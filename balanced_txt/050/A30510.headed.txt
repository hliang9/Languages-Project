THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY To the People of God In Derision called, QUAKERS, The Publisher of this Volumn wisheth all Peace and Prosperity in the Lord. Dear Friends, I Having had much Exercise and care upon me in Collecting, and for the Publishing these Books in this Volumn; at length, after much Travel & Diligence, for the effecting this Impression, they are through the Assistance and Providence of God (as I may well say) brought forth and finished for you and your Children, and such as are moderate and well-affected, who shall desire any of them. The reason why this Work hath been so long unfinished, was partly the difficulty of Printing, and partly it being also thus voluminous and weighty, and partly since I began the Printing of this, many other things of Truth's Concern∣ment intervened, which required expedition in the publication: how∣beit, this Work hath long lain as a matter of weight upon my spirit, to use my utmost endeavours for its accomplishment; and greater de∣sires thereof could not be in any of you, then in my own particular; I ha∣ving Travelled both to answer and serve Truth, as also the desires of ma∣ny Friends herein, whom also I have been willing and desirous to serve in that true Love which stands in the Life and Truth of our God, who requires faith∣fulness of us all, that we may remain living Witnesses in our several Places this short time of our Pilgrimage; and in the end, lay down our Heads in Peace, and Assurance of a Crown of Life and Glory, as our Everlasting Reward; for this is the End that crowns all, The Diligence and Works of the Faithful. And I having been an Eye and Ear Witness of the Faithfulness, Va∣lour and Courage of this Faithful Servant and Prophet of the Lord E. B. in his powerful Testimony, and effectual Ministry, which the Lord did bless with a very Glorious Success unto me, and many more; have found my self the more oblieged for the divulging of these his Works, which, though many of them were given forth in the time of his
Youth, soon after the Lord first raised him up, and when the disco∣very of Truth was in its infancy, both New, Strange and a Wonder∣ment to many in our Age (it being after such a long time of Darkness, and Night of Apostacy) yet the Power of the Lord, which then broke forth, was very Mighty, both in him, and his dear Companion in the Gospel Fr. Howgill, who were sent in the beginning amongst us, in this City of London; where, though they met with much Opposition and Gain-saying by perverse spirits, and formal Professors of all sorts, who denied and resisted the Power of Codliness; yet the Lord so accompained these his two faithful Servants and Ministers of Righteousness, as to the confound∣ing the wisdom of the Wise, and stoping the Mouthes of many contentious Opposers, and convincing of Gain-sayers; yea, the Lord did manifest 1 Cor. 12. 9. and perfect his Strength through Weakness, even through Instruments dis∣pised and coutemptable in the Eyes of the Proud and Exalted of the 1 Cor. 1. 27 World; out of the Mouthes of Babes did the Lord ordain Strength; and Psal. 8. 2. through Simplicity did his wisdom speak, both in this his faithful Witness E. B. and divers other in the beginning: So that let none contemn, the honest Plainness, and harmless Simplicity of any of his first Writtings or Books here inserted; for many are living Witnesses, that the Power and Wisdom of God, did then (even while he was young and tender every way) appear, and shew it self in him, through such plainness and Simplicity, to the confounding, and overturning the wisdom of many that were high and lofty, who conceited themselves wise with their opposition of science (falsly so called.) And it may not be unnecessary for Friends, and their Children to read and peruse these Testimonies, Informations and Vindication of Truth, where they are in way of Controversie (with many others of like na∣ture) given forth by the Servants of the Lord, in Truth's Vindication, the Perusal and Reading thereof may be of Service both to you and yours, you being in the Light and Inspiration of the Almighty, which gives Understanding, from which all Scriptures or Writings that are given, are profitable to the Man of God for his Accommodation, and ought not to be slighted, whether they be in plain Testimonies, or in Vindications and Answers: For though many are come to a particular Satisfaction in the true Light, which is the Rule of the Understanding, and know so much of Christ, as to die for him, yet cannot so well dispute for him, though that be necessary, and few given up and accomplished for that Service; & therefore there may be need for more to apply their hearts to Wisdom, as to be furnished in every respect, to stand up for the Truth against its Opposers, to convince Gain-sayers, and stop the Mouth of Ini∣quity, where ever it opens it self against the Righteous, to pervert the right Wayes of God and his Truth; since the Labours and Works of this valiant Souldier of Christ are here manifest to your view, and to conti∣nue on Record, as permanent Monuments of his Service for the Lord, and as Tokens of God's Love to many; it being also apparently mani∣fest, how plainly and eminently many of his Prophesies came to pass, and were fulfilled upon the Heads of the persecuting Powers, Rulers and
Government of O. C. and others of that Affinity, who trod in the same Path; who resisted God's Power, in not removing Oppression from off the Innocent. It is not my place much to endeavour E. B's applause in many words, because I cannot add to him, or what he hath done, thereby; nor yet to his Faithfull Companion Francis Howgill, or his Works, which many do al∣so desire might be Collected and Published, as these are; for indeed he al∣so wrote many weighty things, and of much Service to the Truth, which would be a very conderable Volmun, that will require both much Care, Charge, and Industry to publish in Print; and therefore it would be of much Service to Truth, if Friends would so consider the weight thereof, as to encourage such a Work of value and worth; for many know what a great Sufferer F. H. was; and how he lay many years in a bad Prison at Appleby in Westmoreland, for the Testimony of Jesus, and of a good Conscience, for that he could not Swear; so that in the same Prison, under the Hands of his Persecutors, he cheerfully, and with much Satifaction and Peace, gave up his Life, and ended his Dayes in Peace. Oh! the remembrance of these two Faithfull Witnesses, who both died Sufferers, being Prisoners for Truth, is never to be forgotten. And thus, Dear Friends, as the Salutation of our dear Brother E. B. ac∣cording to his desire, while in the Body, I recommend unto you this Volumn of his Books, with my Love in the Truth to you all, being therein The Truth's and your Servant and Friend, Ellis Hookes. London, the 1st of the 2d Moneth, 1672.
THE EPISTLE TO The Reader. TO all the World to whom this may come to be Read, that they read with a good understanding, and hereby they may come to the perfect knowledge of the ground of difference between the Priests, and Professors, and all Sects in these Nations, and Us, who are in scorn called Quakers, shewing that the Controversie on our part is just and equal against them all, and that we have sufficient cause to cry against them, and to deny their Ministry, their Church, their Worship, and their whole Religion, as being not in the Power, and by the Spirit of the Living God, as commanded of him, or ever practiced by his Saints; But this declareth the ground and Founda∣tion thereof to be another thing, and not the same on which the true Church, and Ministry, and Practice, and Worship, and true Religion was builded in the days of the Apostles; And also this is an Invitation to all Sects, and Professions of People, to come forth, and try if what they hold and profess be according to the Scriptures of truth; and to do this in tryal, by evident and sound Arguments, and by the best spiritual Weapons they have, and to lay aside all this Persecution and unrighteous Dealing, and Stocking, and Whipping, and Imprisoning of us for speaking against their Religion; and that they come forth in fair dispute, to contend in the Spirit of meekness, for what they Profess and Practice, and to prove according to the Scriptures, their Ministry, Church, and whole Religion, that it is in and by the Spirit and Power of God, or otherwise to renounce and deny all their Religion, and the Profession and Practices thereof, that every man may be satisfied, who it is that are in the true and right Way, and of the true Worship, and true Religion, and who it is that are not, and this is desired by us who are called Quakers; and also a true Account of our first beginning and coming forth in the World, and of that great Sufferings we have sustained, and how we have been carried on, and are preserved to this day. The Lord God everlasting, who is true and faithful, hath fulfilled his promise in us, and unto us, and we are gathered from the Mouths of all
dumb Shepherds, and out of the mouths of all Hirelings, who have made a prey upon us, and fed themselves with the fat, and devoured souls for dishonest gain; And we are come to the Fold of Eternal Rest, where Christ Jesus is the chief Shepherd, and he is the Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls, that feedeth his Flock with living Bread, that nourisheth us unto Life Eternal; he hath called us by his Name, and put us forth, and he feedeth us in green Pastures, and we are fed with hidden Manna, and lie down at Noon with his gathered Flock; and out of Nations, Kindreds, Multitudes, and Peoples are we redeemed to God, and are come out of the World, and out of great Babylon, and out of spiritual Sodom, and Egypt, where the Lord Christ was, and is crucified, and lieth slain to this day; and a top of the World hath the Lord set us, on the Mountain of his own House and Dwelling; where we behold and feel the Life, and Glory, and Crown of the World that hath no end; and the world that hath an end is seen over, and its crown and glory is his Footstool that reigns amongst us: And as for all that which this perishing world brings forth, which men seek after only, its reckoned our temptation, though all the Sons of Adam are seeking its glory, its riches, its crowns, its content∣ments; but of that Birth are we, which hath no crown, no glory, nor rest, under the Sun; and a Birth is brought forth amongst us which is Heir of another Kingdom, and Possessor of another Crown, whose glorying is in the Lord all the Day long; and he is our Refuge, our Rock, and our Fortress against all our Enemies; and what though the Wicked arm themselves, and the Ungodly bend their Bow; what though all sorts of People, from the Prince upon his Throne, to the Beggar upon the Dung∣hil, exalt themselves against the despised People of the Lord's Inheri∣tance, who for his Name's sake are kill'd all the day long: What though the Wise-men bring forth their Arguments; and what though the Rulers bring forth unrighteous Judgments against the Seed that God hath bles∣sed; what though the Revilers and Scorners open their mouthes, and Reproachers and Revilers cast out their bitter words, as a Flood, against the Remnant of the Woman's Seed, that has long been fled into the Wil∣derness: And what then, if the Teachers, the Prophets, and the Elders and the Heads, and Wise men of the World set themselves to pray, and preach and print against the chosen Seed of Iacob; yet notwithstand∣ing all this, though this is come to pass, and Hell open her Mouth, and her Floods break forth to overflow, and be much more increased; yet shall the King of Righteousness rule among his People, and his Presence will not forsake his chosen Ones: but the Lord is with us, a Mighty and Terrible One; and the shout of a King is amongst us; and the Dread and Terror of the Almighty covereth us, and it goeth before us, and com∣passeth us about: And the Lord is working a Work in the Earth mighty and wonderful; he is gathering the Scattered, and binding up the Bro∣ken-hearted; and his People shall dwell in safety, and none shall make them afraid, and no Weapon that is formed against them shall prosper, nor no Hand that is lifted up shall prevail; for Sion shall rise out of the Dust, her beautiful Garments shall be put on, and Mourning and Sorrow
shall flee away, and her Light is risen that is everlasting, and the Sun shall never godown, but his day shall remain for ever, and the Night shall not again cover her brightness, nor the Sun set upon her habitati∣ons; the City that hath long laid waste, shall again be builded; and the dwelling that hath long been without Inhabitant, shall be replenished; for the numberless seed of Iacob is coming out of Egypt, that will replenish the whole Earth, and the seed of Esau shall become bondmen: and where∣fore are you gathered together? and to what purpose have the wicked spent their strength to oppose what the Lord is bringing to pass? shall not all our Enemies be broken to pieces, and will not the Lord grind them to Powder? will he not marr their Beauty, and stain their pride? will he not bring down their crowns, and corrupt their glory, and stain it with his Fire of Wrath, and make them ashamed of their Wayes and Doctrines? Hear this ye Priests, and howl, and lament for the misery that is coming upon you; the Lord hath laid you naked, and made you bare, and you are seen as you are, and the Elect is risen amongst us which ye cannot deceive; but alas, wo is me, how have you caused the people to err! and how have you led the blind out or the way! and how is truth fallen in your Streets! and you have daubed falsly with untem∣pered Morter, and have cried peace to the wicked, and condemned the righteous; and all this hath vexed the righteous soul, and the Lord will now arise, and is risen, and you shall not resist, and escape the stroak of his hand, which will come upon you, and bruise you as a Mil∣stone; for you have caused the wicked to rejoyce and the righteous to mourn; and you have made sad his heart, whom God hath not made sad: have not you fed your selves with the fat, and clothed with the Wooll? and have not the peoples souls been starved, and leanness been upon them all, your plants are dry, and barren trees that bring forth no good fruit; and your people are like a Wilderness that is untilled, and unploughed, and undressed; and your flocks are like wild Asses upon the Mountains, that are untamed; as rude as the Horse, & Mule, that know no Bridle; and now it is seen what the end of your Ministry is, and what fruit it hath brought forth; the Lord hath taken notice, and he hath beheld how you have loytered, and lain idle, and the Nations lie yet like fallow ground, that bears no fruit; and mens hearts, are un∣touched with absence of Gods Word, and there is no sound, true and perfect sence amongst your people of the dealings of the Lord; nor of the operation of his Spirit, but they remain in great Blindness and Igno∣rance, void of the Knowledge of God, for ye have not caused them to hear his Word, but you have told your Dreams, and your false Visions, and you have spoken Imaginations of your hearts, and not from the Mouth of the Lord; neither have you stood in his Coun∣sel, nor hearkened to his Voyce, and therefore people remain un∣profited; but what they and you know, its naturally, and not by the Spi∣rit of the Father, but as dry Trees you are, not taught of the Father, and as rough Goats in the nature of Swine that is polluted in the silth of the World, and in the nature of Dogs, and Lyons, devouring one another, and
biting one another, and killing one another, which things were not in the Churches of Christ, and we have a great controversie with you, and that from the Lord; we have tried you, searched you, and discovered your Foundation, and its not sound, nor will not stand in the trial; we have fetcht your Line from the first original, and we have found out your be∣ginning, and we find yours of that Race, which Christ prophesied of that should come, which should deceive many, having the sheeps cloathing, but inwardly revening, and which Iohn saw was come, and went out from the Apostles, and true Churches, which went from the truth, and went into the World, and had the Form of Godliness without the Power; here began the Race, in the Apostacy of the Churches; and when they Apostatized from the true Faith, then came your original up, and the World went after them, and all that dwelt upon the Earth wor∣shipped the Beast, that hath reigned through all this time of Apostacy, which hath been since the dayes of the Apostles; and we find your origi∣nal goes no further then to the false Brethren, and false Apostles, which went out from the true Apostles, and run for Gifts and Rewards, and preached for filthy Lucre, and through covetousness made merchandize of souls, seeking mony and gain to themselves; I say we find your ori∣ginal begins there, and your Line goes no further, and never came your first rise so far as the true Apostles, you were not in your beginning of their life nor birth, nor cannot be reckoned from their original, for you succeed not them; but you truely succeed the false Apostles, and false brethren, which Christ prophesied should come after his days, and Iohn saw was come, and coming in his days; and we find you of this stock and Generation; and now you are discovered to be contrary to the true A∣postles, and agreeing with the false Apostles, in Call, in Practice, in Main∣tenance, and in all things; and the Line of true judgement is laid upon you all, and you are measured, and found too short, and weighed and sound too light, and we will deal truely with you in judgement; first we do hold controversie with you, as concerning your Call, your Mini∣stry, it agreeth not with, but is contrary to what the Apostles Call was; they were called by power from on high, and were made Ministers by the Gift of the holy Spirit, received from God; and their Ministry was an ab∣solute Gift from God, and not to be bought and sold for mony, and they were anointed of the Father, by his Spirit of promise, and to Preach the Gospel; but your Call is at Schools, and Colledges, in such, and such Orders, which are attained through natural industry, such, and such Arts, and Sciences, and Degrees, having been so many years brought up in studying natural Arts & natural Languages, this is your Ordination and your Call, having no respect to receive, or to wait for the Gift of the holy Spirit to be made Ministers thereby; and this is different from the Apo∣stles and true Ministers, and equal and according to the false Prophets and Deceivers. Secondly, Again you are not according, but contrary to the true Ministry and Ministers of Christ in Practise; for they were led by the Spirit of the Father which dwelt in them, and they preached the Gospel
by the Spirit, and spake as the Spirit gave them utterance, and went up and down the World through Nations, converting People to the Know∣ledge of the Truth, and what they had handled, tasted, seen, and felt of the Word of Life in them, that they declared to others, and preached the Gospel, which they had not received from man, nor by man, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ in them; but your Practices are not such but contrary, for the spirit of this World leads you, and it you follow in all your Works, in your Preaching, Praying, and in your whole Worship, in Form and Tradition, what you have studied for out of Books, and old Authors you preach to people; and what ye have noted in a Book, that you preach by an Hour-glass, and not as the Spirit of God gives you utterance; and you seek out, and enquire after great Benefices, and much Money by the year; and where there is much Tythes, and Gleb-Lands, and such like; thither and to such a Place you go, and seek after, to be Minister there; and there you remain twenty, forty, more, or fewer years, as you can agree with the People; and while they will give you so much as will content you, and maintain you, your Wives and Families as you say, & respect not whether any be converted to God by your preach∣ing; but people remain always in blindness and ignorance, generally, and without the Knowledg of God; for you preach other mens words, and what you have collected in your Imaginations from the Saints words, an Hour by a Glass, leaning upon a soft Cushion, and for Money and Hire, preaching to the people; and this is your manner of practice, and Ministry in these Nations; but thus did not the Apostles, nor Christ's Ministers, but the contrary; and by your Fruits and Works it appears, that you are not Followers of that Spirit that Christ and his Ministers were guided by, neither are lawfull Successors of the Apostles, but by your Fruits and Practice you manifest, that the Lord never sent you, nor Christ never called you into his Service to be his Ministers; for in all your Practices, and in your whole Performances of Worship you differ, and do not agree, but are contrary to what the Practice and Worship of Christ's Ministers and Churches were in the days of the Apostles; this I charge upon you, in the Name, and by the Authority of the Lord God, and am able to prove it against you, face to face, or otherwise to shew that you are not of the same spirit, but contrary to the Saints and Apostles of old, and so not true Succeeders of them, nor lawful Ministers of Christ, as to all people it is, and shall be made manifest. Thirdly, You disagree, and are contrary altogether to the true Mini∣stry, and to the Apostles, in respect of your Maintenance and Wages; for the Wages which Christ allowed his Ministers, was, into whatsoever House they entered, that was worthy, they might eat such things as are set before them; for the Workman (saith he) is worthy of his Hire; and the Apostles eat only of the Fruit of the Vineyard that they had planted, and of the Milk of the Flock which they kept; by a free gift of the People, which they had begotten to the Faith, and to whom they sowed spiritual things; it was but as a small matter if they reaped their carnal things, yet as a free gift they would do it, and the Apostle said,
he would not make the Gospel of Christ chargeable; And in this manner were Christ Ministers and Ministry in Wages and Gifts upheld and main∣tained outwardly in the World. But your Practise and Maintenance is not such, but contrary, as is ful∣ly made manifest; for you will have so much by the year promised to you in Tythes, Money, or Gleab-lands, or Stipends, and of Drunkards, and Swearers, and prophane Wordly People, who are not Sheep of Christ's Flock, nor Plants of his Vine-yard, you will have so much of each of them; and of every man, in such a compass, as you call your Parish; and if any ei∣ther out of Covetousness, or good Conscience, cannot pay you, you sue at Law, and cast into Prison, for Wages, and spoil their Goods, and take treble, nay sometimes Five double damage, and through Violence and In∣justice, and Cruelty are you maintained in such a manner, and not as the true Ministers and Apostles of Christ were, but in a way and manner quite contrary, as it is manifest; and so herein it is proved, that you are not law∣ful Successors of the Apostles and Ministers of Christ. Fourthly, Again you follow not the Apostles, and true Ministers of Christ, but are contrary to them in Doctrine, as this following Volumn will clearly manifest, which for this very end is collected from your own Mouths and Pens, that all men may see what you are, and what you hold and profess; and being truely laid down, and answered, let your selves, and all sober men compare your doctrines and sayings with the Doctrines of the Apostles, and they may see you agree not with them, but are con∣trary to them. And now Friends, to all you that profess your selves to be Ministers of the Gospel, I do hereby declare unto you, in the Name and Authority of the Lord, that we have a controversie with you, and a great charge against you in all these things, in your Call, in your Practice, and in your Maintenance, and in your Doctrines, and our Mouthes hath the Lord opened, and they cannot be shut, from declaring and crying against you, as such whom the Lord never sent, but are contrary to Christ, his Prophets, and Apostles in all your Ways, and Practices, and the Hand of the Lord is certainly against you, and his Power and Dread will comeover you, and lie upon your Consciences. Now Reader, whatsoever thou are that reads this following Volumn, if thy mind be sober, and thy heart right towards God, thou may come to a good understanding of the Ground and cause of this great controver∣sie, between the Priests and the Professors of this Nation, and us, who are in scorn called Quakers; for it is not unknown to Nations, of this great debate and battel, now for some years of continuance in this Nati∣on, no man can be ignorant, what putting in Prisons, and what Persecu∣ting, and what Preaching, and Printing against us, and what Reports and Fame hath been through this Nation for some years past; and the Quakers so called, have written, and spoken, and printed, against the Priests & their Worships, and Ways, and Doctrines, and declared against them, as Deceivers and false Prophets, and such as never were sent of God; and on the other hand, thus have the Priests, and more abundant∣ly cried out against, and printed against the Quakers, as Hereticks and
Deceivers, and Witches, and all what they could say that's evil, and these things being not unknown, but publickly brought to pass; there∣fore it will be good to discover unto every man, the first ground and cause of this great Strife, and the matter of it, and its beginning, so that all may know the certainty of these things, and know they are not without good ground, and sufficient reason on our part; to wit, That we have just cause to do, and strive against that Generation of Priests and Teachers, and that we do nothing rashly, and without sufficient reason. It is now about seven years since the Lord raised us up in the North of England, and opened our Mouthes in this his Spirit; and what we were before in our Religion, Profession, and Practices is well known to that part of the Country, how generally we were men of the strictest Sect, and of the greatest Zeal in the Performance of outward righteousness; and went through, and tried all sorts of Teachers, and run from Mountain to Mountain, and from man to man, and from one Form to another, as do many to this very day, who yet remain ungathered to the Lord, and such we were, (to say no more of us) that sought the Lord, and desired the knowledge of his Wayes more then any thing beside; and for one I may speak, who from a Child, even a few years old, he set his face to seek and find the Saviour, and more then Life and Treasure, or any mortal Crown sought after with all his heart, the one thing that is need∣ful, to wit, the Knowledge of God: And after our long seeking, the Lord appeared to us, and revealed his glory in us, and gave us of his Spirit from Heaven, and poured it upon us, and gave us of his Wisdom to guide us, whereby we saw all the World, and the true state of all things, & the true condition of the Church in her present estate; first the Lord brought us by his Power, & Wisdom, and the Word by which all things were made, to know and understand, and see perfectly that God had given to us, every one of us in particular, a Light from himself shining in our hearts and con∣sciences, which Light, Christ his Son, the Saviour, of the World had ligh∣ted every man, and all Mankind withal; which Light in us we found suf∣ficient to reprove us, & convince us of every evil deed, word and thought, and by it, in us, we come to know good from evil, right from wrong, and whatsoever is of God, and according to him, from what is of the Devil, and what is contrary to God in motion, word and work; and this Light gave us to discern between truth and error, between every false and right way, and it perfectly discovered to us the true state of all things, and we thereby came to know man, what he was in his creation before transgres∣sion, and how he was deceived and overcome by the Devil; and his estate in transgression, and in disobedience, and how he is drove and banished from the presence of the Lord, and the sorrow and anguish which he is in, and to undergo; and also by the Light in us, we perfectly came to know the way of Restauration, and the means to be restored; and the state of man being come out of Transgression and restored, these things to us were revealed by the Light within us, which Christ had given us, and lightened us withal, what man was before Transgression, and what he is in Transgression, and what he is being redeemed out of Transgression,
and also the Light which shineth in every one of us, as to it our minds became turned, and our hearts inclined, the perfect Estate of the Church we came to know; her Estate before the Apostles days, and in the Apostles dayes, and since the dayes of the Apostles, and her pre∣sent Estate we found to be as a Woman who had once been cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, who brought forth him that was to rule the Nations; but she was fled into the Wilderness, and there sitting desolate, in her place, that was prepared of God for such a season; which season, in the very end thereof, when the time of her sojourning was to∣wards a full end, then were we brought forth; if any have an Ear they may hear; so that all these things concerning man, and concerning the times and seasons, and the changing and renewing of times, and all things that pertain to Salvation, and Redemption, and Eternal Life, needfull for man to know; all this was revealed, discovered, and made known to us, by the Light which was in us, which Christ had lighted us withal. And we found this Light to be a sufficient Teacher, to lead us to Christ, from whence this Light came, and thereby it gave us to receive Christ, and to witness him to dwell in us; and through it the new Co∣venant we came to enter into, to be made Heirs of Life and Salvation; and in all things we found the Light which we were enlightened withal, and all Mankind (which is Christ) to be alone and only sufficient to bring to Life and eternal Salvation, and that all who did own the Light in them which Christ hath enlightened every man withal, they needed no man to teach them, but the Lord was their Teacher, by his Light in their own Consciences, and they received the holy Anointing. And so we ceased from the teachings of all men, and their words, and their Worships, and their Temples, and all their Baptisms, and Churches, and we ceased from our own Words, and Professions, and Practises in Religion, in times before zealously performed by us, through divers Forms, and we become Fools for Christ's sake, that we might become truely wise; and by this Light of Christ in us were we led out of all false Wayes and false Preachings, and false Ministers, and we met together often, and waited upon the Lord in pure Silence, from our own words, and all mens words, and hearkned to the Voice of the Lord, and felt his Word in our hearts, to burn up and beat down all that was contrary to God, and we obeyed the Light of Christ in us, and followed the Mo∣tions of the Lords pure Spirit, and took up the Cross to all Earthly Glories, Crowns, and Ways, and denied our selves, our Relations, and all that stood in the way betwixt us and the Lord, and we chose to suffer with and for the Name of Christ, rather then all the pleasures upon Earth, or all our former zealous Professions and Practices in Religion, without the Power and Spirit of God, which the World yet lives in. And while wai∣ting upon the Lord in Silence, as often we did for many Hours together, with our minds and hearts towards him, being stayed in the Light of Christ within us, from all thoughts, fleshly Motions, and desires, in our diligent waiting and fear of his Name, and hearkning to his Word, we re∣received
often the pouring down of the Spirit upon us, and the Gift of God's holy eternal Spirit, as in the dayes of old, and our heart were made glad, and our Tongues loosed, and our Mouthes opened, and we spake with new Tongues, as the Lord gave us utterance, and as his Spirit led us, which was poured down upon us, on Sons and Daughters; and to us hereby was the deep things of God revealed, and things unutterable were known and made manifest, and the Glory of the Father was revealed; and then begun we to sing Praises to the Lord God Al∣mighty, and to the Lamb for ever, who had redeemed us to God; and brought us out of the Captivity and Bondage of the World, and put an end to Sin and Death, and all this was by and through, and in the Light of Christ within us; and much more might be declared hereof, that which could not be believed, if it were spoken, of the several and parti∣cular Operations and Manifestations of the everlasting Spirit that was given us, and revealed in us: but this is the sum; Life and Immortality was brought to light; Power from on High, and Wisdom was made mani∣fest, & the Day everlasting appeared unto us, and the joyful Sun of Righ∣teousness did arise and shine forth unto us, and in us; and the holy Anoint∣ing, the everlasting Comforter we received; and the Babe of Glory was born; and the Heir of the Promise brought forth to Reign over the Earth, and over Hell and Death, whereby we entered into everlasting Union, and Fellowship, and Covenant with the Lord God, whose Mer∣cies are sure, and infinite, and his Promise never fails: and much might be spoken, but this is the sum; we were raised from Death to Life, and are changed from Satans power to God, and gathered from all the dumb Shepherds, and off all the barren Mountains, into the Fold of eternal Peace and Rest; and mighty and wonderful things hath the Lord wrought for us, and by us, by his own out-stretched Arm. And thus we became Followers of the Lamb whithersoever he goes, and he hath called us to make war in righteousness, for his Name sake against Hell and Death, and all the Powers of Darkness; and against the Beast and false Prophet, which have deceived the Nations; and we are of the Royal Seed Elect, Chosen, and Faithful; and we war in Truth, and just Judgment; not with Weapons that are carnal, but by the Sword that goes out of his Mouth, which shall slay the Wicked, and cut them to pieces; and after this manner was our Birth, and bringing forth; and thus hath the Lord chosen us, and made us an Army dreadful and terri∣ble, before whom the Wicked do fear and tremble; and our Standard is Truth, Justice, Righteousness & Equity; and all that comes unto us must cleave thereunto, and fight under that Banner without fear, and without doubting, and they shall never be ashamed, nor put to flight, neither shall ever they be conquer'd by Hell, or Death, or by the Powers of Darkness; but the Lord shall be their Armour, Weapon, and Defence for evermore; and they that follow the Lamb shall overcome, and get the Victory over the Beast, and over the Dragon, and over the Gates of Hell; for the Lord is with us, and who shall be able to make us afraid? Then having thus armed us with Power, Strength and Wisdom, and
Dominion according to his Mind, and we having learned of him, and being taught of him in all things; and he having chosen us into his Work, and put his Sword into our hands, and given us perfect Com∣mission to go forth in his Name and Authority, having the Word from his Mouth, what to cut down, and what to preserve; and having the ever∣lasting Gospel to preach to the Inhabitants of the Earth; and being com∣manded in spirit to leave all, and follow him, and go forth in his Work; yea, an absolute necessity was laid upon us, and wo unto us if we preacht not the Gospel; for when we looked abroad, and beheld the World, be∣hold it was altogether Darkness, and even as a Wilderness, and desolate and barren of good Fruit; and Death reigned over men, and no good Fruit was brought forth to God, but Leaves we beheld upon every Soul; and all men and people were made drunk with the Wine of Whoredoms, and the Whores Cup they had drunk, and was committing Fornication with the great Whore, and she reigned over the Kings and peoples of the Earth; and the Antichrist was set up in the Temple of God, ruling over all, and having brought Nations under his Power, and set up his Government over all, for many Ages; even since the days of the Apostles and true Churches hath he reign'd, while the Woman hath been fled into the Wilderness, and the Man-Child caught up to God. Christ said Anti∣christ should come, and put on the Sheeps cloathing, and be inwardly a ravening Woolf; and Iohn saw that Antichrist was come in his dayes, and he went forth then from the true Church, and went into the World, and deceived the World; and ever since his Kingdom hath reigned over Nations; for then he begun to exalt himself, and it is sixteen hundred years since; all which time Antichrist that hath had the Sheeps Cloath∣ing, but inwardly a Ravener, and hath ruled and reigned; and this we saw and perceived, in the very time of our birth and bringing forth; and we behold Nations as a Wilderness untilled, and mens Hearts as the fallow Ground unbroken up, and not plowed nor sown with the good Seed of Gods Kingdom; so that we saw all states and orders of men corrupted and degenerated from what they ought to be, and from what God had once ordained them: As for the Ministry first, we look∣ing upon it with a single eye, in the Light of the Spirit of God which had Anointed us, we behold it clearly (which formerly we had been stumbling at, and much doubting of, that it was not the perfect Ministry of Christ, for many years before) not to be of Christ nor sent of him, nor ha∣ving the Commission power & Authority of Christ, as his Ministry had in the days of the true Churches; but in all things, as in Call, practice, main∣tenance, and in every thing else in fruits and effects, we found it disa∣gree, and be wholly contrary to the true Ministry of Christ in the days of the Apostles, and likewise we truely beheld it to be in Call, practice, and Maintenance, and all things the very same in fruits and effects; with the false Ministry and false Prophets, and false Apostles, and De∣ceivers of old; and this I do testifie, and am able to prove in the Spirit and Authority of the Lord, that the publick Ministry, as now it stands generally, is wholy degenerated from what the true Ministry of Christ
once was, and differs, and is contrary in all things to what Christ's Mini∣sters were, and agreeth, and is equal in all things with what the false Prophets and Deceivers were thoughout all Ages; and this I charge up∣on it, in the face and view of all men to whom this may come; for this we saw concerning it in the beginning, and our first assurance. And as for other Places, and Orders of men, and Callings, we saw them also cor∣rupted, and degenerated, and evil and iniquity abounding among all sorts of people; and blindness and darkness covered the face of the Earth, and of the World; and all people were in their Transgressions, and making void the Law of God; and that it was time for the Lord to work, and to arise to ease himself of his Adversaries: and as for all Churches (so cal∣led) and Professions, and Gatherings of people, we beheld you as all in the Apostacy, and degeneration from the true Church, not being gathered by the Spirit of the Lord, nor anointed thereby, as the true Members of Christ ever were, but to be in a Form, and in Forms of Righteousness, without the Power; and in Immitations, without Life and perfect Know∣ledge; so that all the Practices of Religion we beheld without Power and Life, though some had a sincerity in them, and a zeal, and a desire to∣wards the Lord, yet all people erred in Judgment, and none were guided in Judgment by the Eternal Spirit; and because of the error in Judg∣ment, that made their zeal blind, and their performances of Righteous∣ness not accepted, though acted in some sincerity and zeal, because they were not guided in Practice, and led in Judgment by the Spirit of the Lord, which only leads into all Truth; and none are in the Truth, but who are led thereby: so that we behold all Profession, but as Coverings with Figg-leaves, while the nature of Transgression stood uncondemned, and not crucified: and then we saw not only the Performance and Practice in Church state, and in religious Orders were corrupted, but also Go∣vernment, and Magistracy, and all things in civil state were not aright in the sight of the Lord, nor as the Lord required, neither as he had ordain∣ed in the beginning; for Government we know, as ordained of God, is to punish, and limit, and terrifie all Evil-Doers, and to preserve and de∣fend all that do well; and that mens Consciences are to be left free, and to be ruled by the Lord alone, and guided by his Spirit; and that outward Power, and civil Magistrates and Laws (so called) ought not to be Lord or Ruler in mens Consciences, nor over them; but we be∣held how Unrighteousness and Iniquity, and Sin and Wickedness was strengthened and encouraged in the Government, and by such as were in Authority; and how the Fear of God, and the exercise of a good Con∣science was abused, so that it was turned backward from what it ought to be; them that did well were punished, and limitted as Trausgressors, and the Evil-Doers were set free, and not made afraid; so that we could truly cry, Truth was faln in the Street, and Justice and true Judgment turned backward, and Equity had no place to enter, and the Innocent were devoured through want of true and just Judgment, and the Needy were spoiled, and made a prey, and thus it was framed; for no sooner had we opened our Mouthes, but the Magistrates began to put
us in Prison, and execute great injustice upon us, and became Oppres∣sors of the Innocent, and laid grievous unjust burdens upon us; grievous to be born, and true justice and judgment was neglected, and wrong judgement brought forth, and good Government abused, and men in Au∣thority not ruled by the Lord, neither ruling for the Lord among men; and thus it came to pass upon us, through the corruption and Degenera∣tion in Goverment and Magistrates, which we saw to be, as it was fulfil∣led by them, to wit, not as the Lord required, nor as he in the beginning ordained it, but quite the contrary; and this we saw in the beginning, when the Spirit of the Lord was poured down upon us, and power from on high was revealed to declare against all the Abominations of the Earth, and to make War against all Corruption, in all Orders, and Places, and Men. Then being prepared of the Lord, and having received Power from on high, we went forth as commanded of the Lord, leaving all Relations and all things of the World behind us, that we might fufill the work of the Lord into which he called us, and with Flesh and Blood, nor any Creature, we consulted not, nor took counsel of men, but of the Lord alone, who lifted up our heads above the World, and all fears and doubtings, and was with us in Power and Domininion, over all that which opposed us, which was great and mighty, and gave us power over it all, and to bind Kings in Chains, and Nobles in Fetters of Iron, and this is the Saints honour; and the Word of the Lord we sounded, and did not spare, and caused the Deaf to hear, the Blind to see, and the heart that was hardned to be awakened; and the Dread of the Lord went be∣fore us, and behind us, and teror took hold upon our Enemies; And first of all our Mouthes were opened, and our spirit filled with indig∣nation against the Priests and Teachers, and with them, and against them first we began to war, as being the Causers of the people to err, and the Blind-leaders, that carried the Blind into the Ditch, and against them, as the Fountain of all wickedness abounding in the Nations, and as being the issue of Prophaness; for from them hath Prophaness gone forth in all Nations, and against them we cryed aloud, as being redeemed from their Mouthes, who had made a prey upon us, as they do upon all that follow their ways; and in Steeple-houses we did visit them often, and in Markets and other Places, as the Lord moved, and made way for us, shewing unto all them, and all their people, that they were not Lawful Ministers of Christ, sent of him, but were Deceivers and Antichrists, and such whom the Lord never sent; and we spared not publikely, and at all seasons to utter forth the Judgments of the Lord against them and their wayes, and against their Churches, and Worships, and Practices, as not being of God, nor commanded by him, by which they deceived the World; and this was our first work which we entred upon, to thresh down the Decei∣vers, and lay them open, that all people might see their shame, and come to turn from them, and receive the Knowledg of the Truth, that they might be saved; and this we did with no small Opposition nor danger, yea oftentimes we were in danger of our lives, through bearing, abusing,
Punishing, Haling, casting over Walls, striking with Staves, and Cudgels, and Knocking down to the Ground, besides Reproaching, Scorning, Re∣vilings, and Houtings at, and Scoffings, and Slanderings, and all abuses that could be thought or acted by evil hands and Tongues, and often carried before Magistrates, with grievous Threats, and sometimes put in the Stocks, and Whipped, and often Imprisoned, and many hard Dealings against us, the worst of Tongues or hands could execute, sparing Life; of this all the North-countries may witness; and all these things are sustai∣ned and suffered from people and Rulers, because of our faithfulness to the Lord, and for declaring against the false Deceivers; for nothing save onely the Hand of the Lord, and his Power could have preserved us, and carryed us through all this; neither for any reward outward whatsoever, or advantage to our selves, would we have exposed our selves to that sufferings and violence, and dangers, which befell us daily; but the Lord was our exceeding great reward through all these things, and kept us in the Hollow of his Hand, and under the Shadow of his Wings, and gave us Dominion in Spirit over all our Enemies, and subdued them before us; and though Rulers and People were combined against us, and executed their injustice and violence upon us, yet the Lord made us to Prosper, and grow exceedingly in Strength, Wisdom and Number, and the hearts of the people enclined unto us, and the Wit∣ness of God in many stired for us, for to that in all Consciences in our words and sufferings, and wayes, we did commend our selves to be known and approved. And in the beginning we were but few in number, onely a few that thus were carried on and dealt withall, and that had received the Power from on high in such a measure, and for such a work; and no sooner did the Lord appear to us, and with us, but the Devil and his power rose up a∣gainst us to destroy us, and it wrought in Rulers, Priests, and People, and all the wayes and means invented by the Devil that could be executed by his Servants were brought sorth, to quench the work of the Lord, and to stop our passage in what we were called to; did ye but perfectly know, as we perfectly found the craftiness, and policy, and wickedness of the Devil, how to overcome this new born Babe, and how to root out forever this Plant, that was newly sprung sorth, it would make you admire and wonder with admiration; all the Priests, and Rules were in an uproar; the Priests they petitioned to the Magistrates, and run up and down from one Sessions and Judicatory to another, and took wicked Oaths, and slandered the Just with Lies and Reproaches, on purpose to incense all people against us, and the Magistrates gave forth Warrants for the ap∣prehending of some, and made their orders to break our Meetings, and that we should not meet in the Night season; and such men might not pass abroad; and such stir and Opposition was made against us, it can hardly be expressed or declared; there were uproars in Steeple-houses, and uproars in Markets, and often haling before Magistrates, and abused, and threatned, and slandred, and all manner of evil done, and spoken a∣gainst us, and great injustice, cruelty and Oppression acted against us,
where ever we came, and all through the means of the Priests, who spared not to enact and conceive Mischief against us, and sought daily to the Magistrates for Persecution, preaching in their Pulpits, and praying against us, & setting days apart to seek their God against us, crying with∣out ceasing in publick and private, Heresie, Heresie, Error and Blasphemy; and that we were Deceivers, Witches, and Seducers, and such like, the worst they could say and imagine to stir up the hearts of people against us, and run∣ning often to the Assize, and Sessions and Courts to complain, and in∣form upon false Oathes against us, and through them were the whole Countries in a Rage and Madness, Rulers and People often Imprison∣ing, and abusing, and resisting us with Violence; banishing us out of Towns, and putting of us out of our Inns; and often threatning, To burn the Houses over our Heads; the whole Company of Rude People in a Town often gathering, and besetting a House or Inn, about where we were en∣tred to lodge in our Travels: We were often exposed to difficult and hard Travels and Journeys, giving our selves to the Cross, to take it up against all Earthly; often drinking Water, and lying in Straw in Barnes after a hard dayes Journey; and yet for all these things the Power and Presence of the Lord was with us, and we were carried on with much Bold∣ness and Faithfulness, in Courage, and without Fear or Doubtings, through the often hazzard of our lives many wayes, in Uproars by evil men, and in Markets, and Steeple-houses, and also in Ttavels by Robbers, and eve∣ry way were we exposed to Dangers and Perils; but through all, and over all were we carried, and are preserved to this day. And after this manner it came to pass concerning us, and much more might be said; but this is in short declar'd, how we were entreated, and dealt withal by Priests, Rulers and People, through all the Northern Counties of England, in our first going forth; through which Counties we first journeyed out of Westmoreland through Cumberland, Northumberland, and into some parts of Scotland, and Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Che∣shire, &c. and in all these Counties much Opposition we had, and excee∣ding Sufferings, and cruel Dealings from men of all sorts; every Goal may witness in every County, how any of them seldom were without some of us, or our Friends imprison'd in them this six Years, and scarce one Steeple-house or Market in all these Counties, but may witness what Beatings, what Bruisings, Strikings, and Halings, Abusings, and Perils we have suffer'd and sustained: and not one Priest in all those Counties can clear himself from Hatred and Malice, and from envying of us, and doing Mischief in Words, and Works, or Thoughts, or Desires against us; nor scarce one Justice, nor any Officer of the Peace, can be ex∣cused in all them Counties, from plotting & acting Injustice upon us, and threatning & cnacting Cruelty against us. And I call Heaven and Earth to record, and the Light in every mans Conscience, and do appeal to that in all sorts and places of people, That by all sorts of people we suffer'd Evil, and unjust Works, and Actions, and Words from them; and let the Witness of God in all mens Consciences, in all the North, give Testimony what Dealings and Cruelty we suffer'd, and how we have been dealt withal,
and also of our Patience; and Innocency under all what they have done to us. But notwithstanding, all what was acted against us, and spoken, many hundreds of the Honest and Sober People owned us, and also many Rude and Ungodly Persons were converted to the Truth; I say many hundreds in all these Counties in two years time, were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, and to own us, all which time we laboured, and travelled in Patience, giving up our selves to live or to die, and to all manner of Sufferings and Reproaches, and hard Trials, that we might fulfil faithfully what we were called unto; Sufferings without, from open Enemies, and from our own Kindred and Relations, and Sufferings within for the Seeds sake; and we are well acquainted with griefs, yet in all our Tryals and Afflictions, the Lord never forsook us, but his Wisdom, Love, and Life, and Presence increased in us, and with us. Then in the Year 1654, as moved of the Lord, we spread our selves South-ward, and entred into these South Parts, and came the first of us into this City of London, in the fift moneth that year, and laboured in the Work of the Gospel, in continual Sufferings, and Oppressions divers wayes, and were oppressed and gainsaid by the wise Men, and by the Learned, and had in reproach and contempt by all the High and Lofty and Proud Professors; and we were set at nought, and rejected by the fat Beasts of the South; and it is well known to thousands in this City and South-Country, what opposition we have had from all sorts of People; opposed in our own Meetings, and scorned, and slandered by envious and reproachfull Tongues; publickly and privately encountered withall by the Wisest of the City & Country; challenged, and invited, and inga∣ged to Disputes by the high Priests and Church-members (so called) and written against, & printed against by the chiefest of men, accounted wise and religious; which of any Sect? and who of all the wisest in profession, and the most zealous in practices of Religion (so called) have not at some∣time or other beset us, and encountred with us in high Disputes and Controversies, opposing of us to our Faces, and gain-saying of our Doctrines, and Practices, and denying of us, and resisting of us whol∣ly, and crying against us to be Deceivers, Deluders, and Hereticks, and Blasphemers, and such like; and that our Doctrines were deceivable, and error, and factious, and what not; and that our Practises were de∣structive to Men, Laws, and Government: these things in the worst na∣ture have been spoken against us without ceasing, by the wisest and men of greatest Parts and most religious (falsly so accounted) for this certain years in the South, as well as in the North; besides, what loss have we sustained other wayes in the South, by Beatings, and Strikings, and Abu∣ses, and Slanders, and false Reproaches, and haling before Magistrates, and Imprisoning; and all the like dealing from Priests, Rulers and People, as we did in the North: yea, the same hard dealing and cruelty from all sorts of people we have suffered, and do daily, as we did in the North; insomuch we are now accustomed to the Yoak, and well acquainted with Sorrow and Griefs from all sorts of people; and were not the Lord on
our side our Enemies would swallow us up quick, and we had been long since devoured by the Teeth of the Ungodly: so that I may call to wit∣ness all the Goals and Prisons in the South, as in the North, and all the Magistrates & Judges, and Rulers, and all Officers of the Law, what suffe∣rings we have sustained; and what cruel and hard dealing we have un∣dergone, and what injustice, and unequal and false Judgment hath been executed upon us in these five years time; which of the Goals may appear free, where some of us have not suffered the loss of our Liberties unjustly? and who of any justice of the Peace, or any other Officer, from the Judge to the Constable, that can clear themselves from guilt in this matter, and that they have not had a hand in our unjust sufferings? and to the Witness of God, in all people of all Sorts, through this whole Nation, and some other, I do appeal concerning this matter, how we have been dealt withal, and what we have sustained in our persons, and in our names, & how many Acts and Words of Cruelty and Injustice we have born & suffered, and these Priests have been as the Fountain and Cause of all this, and the formost in all this Iniquity and Injustice by all what they could do to incense the Rulers and people against us, by Preaching, and Praying, and Writing, and Printing, for the space of this seven years; yet notwithstanding all this, the Mighty Power and Presence of the Lord hath been with us, and perserved us from Dangers great and many, and carried us through Trials and Perplexities, and Sufferings, and not onely so, but he hath increased us in number; so that Thousands and Ten Thousands have and may own us, and the Truth which we give witness of, and live therein? for the eyes of all people are beginning to be opened, and the deaf Ear is unstopped, and the Way of Life Eternal is made ma∣nisest, and the Lord is gathering his Flock, which hath been scattered in the cloudy and dark day, whilest these false Idle-Shepherds, (these Priests and Teachers I mean) have fed themselves with the Fat, and cloathed themselves with the Wool, and laid down in slumber, and not gathered the Flock, nor fed them, but scattered them, and driven them away; and with Force and with Cruelty have they ruled over the Heri∣tage of the Lord; woe, woe, unto these Shepherds, saith the Lord God, they shall be confounded and put to shame perpetually, and they shall be broken down and never builded any more, and the Lord will pluck them up by the roots, and they shall never again be planted. And besides all their Petitioning the Magistrates against us, and preaching and praying against us, and all the evil and wickedness in Work, Word and Desire, brought forth against us from time to time; yet (here sober Reader) thou hast a Catalogue, and whole number of Books printed and written against us, & abundance of their Doctrines uttered against us, and in opposition to us, gathered up in this Volum in a sum, with our Answers to them; and if thy heart and mind be single, thou mayst hereby understand, in measure, the difference in Doctrine between them and us, and compare each of them with the Scriptures, and see whether their Doctrines and Principles laid down as the Subject of their Books, or our Doctrines and Principles laid down in answer to theirs, be
according, and agree with the Scriptures; and if thou be impartial in this business, and single in this search and judgement, I doubt not but thou wilt in a great measure satisfie thy self, and be resolved con∣cerning their Priests, and Professors of England, and us who are called Quakers; and then when thou thus hast done, own and deny whe∣ther them or us, as the Lord shall perswade thee; for thou mayst fully perceive we differ in Doctrines, and Principles; and the one thou must justifie, and the other thou must condemn, as being one clean con∣trary to the other in our Principles: and I wish also, thou wouldst measure us, and compare us in Lives and Conversations, and truely judge whom of us, whether they, or we do the more follow Christ and his Apostles in Practise and Conversation; and in all things lay us and them to the Line of true Judgement, and with an upright heart, judge accordingly; for know this, there is not any Principle we hold, nor any Work which we practice in our Religion and Worship, but we are willing, and fully desire we might be brought to the Bar of true Justice together, and in every Particular of Principles and Practices examined and tryed to the full, and each of us judged in Truth and Equity, whether it be they or us that are of the true Religion, and true Faith, and true Worship of God that the Apostles were in, and which of us it is that are in a wrong Way, and in a false Religion, & false Faith and Worship; and in this we will joyn Issue with them, in the sight of the whole Nation, if they will come forth to tryal; if what already is brought forth by them against us, and by us against them, for this seven Years in Disputes, and in Printing, and otherwise, be not suffi∣cient for all People to try us in, and judge us by, whether they, or we be in the right; and whether in the wrong. And now to all People in the Nation, I do appeal to that of God in all their Consciences, to judge between the Priests and Professors, and all the Sects, and us; ye have heard their Doctrines, and ye have heard something of ours; ye have seen their Conversation, and ye have seen something of ours; ye have heard them long, and something of us ye have heard for a little season; and now give your Evidence: is it not with them as we have said? are not your Priests in the Steps of the false Prophets and of the De∣ceivers? and do not they seek for their Gain from their Quarter, as they did that Isaiah cryed against? do not they preach for Hire and divine for Money, as they did which Micah cryed against? are not they such by whom you have not been profited, as Ieremiah cry'd against? let that of God in you answer to these things: And are they not Proud Men, and Covetous Men, and Envious Men, and Heady High-minded Men, and given to filthy Lucre? And are they not such as through Covetousness make Merchandize of Souls, and that by Good Words and Fair Speeches deceive the Hearts of the Simple, such as Paul and Peter declare against? And are they not such as the true Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles cry'd against? And do they not bring forth the same Fruits, as did the false Prophets and false Apostles? I leave it to your Consciences to be the Judge: Com∣pare them, and lay them to the Line of True Judgment, if you shut not
your eyes, you may see it is thus; and have we charged them falsly, or have not we spoken the truth concerning them? we have said they are false Ministers and Deceivers, and not true Ministers of Christ; and is it not so? let the Light in your Consciences answer; we have said they have run, & never were sent, and that they have not profited the people at all; and is it not so? to the Witness of God in you I do appeal, and let that justifie that we have spoken nothing but the truth; examine and try in all things that we have charged them with: And are they not guilty in all things that we have charged upon them? let the Witness of God in you testifie to this: And what do you judge of them, are they not of that stock which Christ said should come, and should be Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing, and should deceive many, and which Iohn saw were come in his dayes, and which the World went after, and the whole World run after them; are not they in the nature of Wolves, devouring and tearing the Lambs of Christ? and do they not tear People by causing their Bodies to be imprisoned, and their Goods to be spoiled? and do they not deceive many? and yet they have the Sheep's Cloathing, the Saints words, and their practices, but inwardly are they not ravening? and doth not the World go after them? and hath not the World run after them for many Ages? and is it not thus with them? And have they received the gift of the holy Ghost, or are they not made Ministers by the will of man, and not by the will of God? do they not differ, and are contrary in Call, in Practice, in Maintenance, and in Fruits and Effects to the true Ministers and true Apostles? and do they not agree, and are they not according to the false Prophets, and false Ministers, and Deceivers in their Call, Practice, Maintenance, Fruits and Effects? search the Scriptures, and lay them to that line, and then let the witness in your Consciences judge and answer: and do not they prepare War a∣gainst such as do not put into their mouthes? and do not they feed with the Fat, and cloath with the Wool? do not they oppress the Nation, and the Creation? and are not they such whose Call, and Practices, and Maintenance, and whole Ministery hath a dependance upon Popery? and doth it not all savour of Popery, and in the main and Principal parts thereof, were ordained by the Pope? this may be fully made manifest: And are not all Professors, and Sect of people such as have the form, but are without the Power of Godliness? are not people still Covetous, and Earthly-minded, and given to the World, and proud, and vain, even such as profess Religion, and to be a seperated people? are not Professors as covetous, and proud, as such as do not profess? and are not they given to the World? and doth it not shew that they are unchanged, nor translated, but death Reigns among them? and is it not manifest, that they have taken up the form of the Apostles, and Christs words and Practices, and are without the life, and not guided by the Spirit of Christ and the Apostles in their Praying and Preaching? and are not your souls lean and starved? to the Witness of God in you all I speak, which may testifie that many people have a shew of Religion without Life; and therefore have not we spoken the truth of them, in what we
have said? in the Day of Judgment you shall answer this. And as concerning the Quakers, what do you say of them? you have seen their Conversation; few Towns, but some of them have been, and are amongst you: Do not they fear God? and do not they walk justly and truly among their Neighbours, and speak the truth, and do the Truth in all things; doing unto all no otherwise then they would be done unto? and are they not Meek, and Humble, and Sober? and do not they take much Wrong, rather then give Wrong to any? and are they not such as de∣light in the Wayes of the Lord? and do not they deny the World, and its Pleasures, and forsake all Iniquity more then your selves? and do not they take up the daily Cross of Christ, to all its wayes and earthly glo∣ries? and do not they Preach in the Power of God, and reach to your Consciences, when you hear them? and doth not the Light in you answer that they speak the Truth? and is not their Call, and Practice, and Main∣tenance the same as was the Apostles and faithful Ministers? compare them with the Scripture, and then judge in your Consciences: and do not they suffer many hard and cruel things, even all manner of evil spoken and done against them falsly for the Name of Christ? Are you ignorant of their great Sufferings through this Nation? and what do you think? is their suffering for Evil-doing, or is it not for Righteousness sake? What Harm do they do to any, by Work or Word? Why are they reproached, and mocked, and scorned? and why are they put in Prisons, and whipped, and thus sorely abused? is it for any Evil-doing, or is it not because they are the Servants of the Lord? Compare their Fruits with the Priests fruits, their Conversation with the Priests conversation, & see whether be liker the Apostles; and these things I leave to you that you may come to con∣sider and judge justly of all things, for the Lord God is risen; and his Light in Peoples Consciences is shining forth, and it shall answer to what I say, in this World, or in the day of Judgment, when we, and all Man-kind shall appear and come sorth to tryal, and every mans work shall be tryed, and all shall receive according to their deeds. And so gladly would we be made manifest to all the World; if that after the reading of this Book any be unsatisfied still in this matter, And if any, especially of the Heads and Rulers have doubts or Jealousies raised in them, concerning us, and the Priests, and that they further would be satisfied and resolved; for that end let any Wise-men propound for full satisfaction of all sorts of People, that we (with the consent of the chief in Authority that have power in this Nation who may pre∣serve peace and safety among people, and thereby to stop all Jealousies) may freely and chearfully, Four, Ten, Twenty, Thirty, more or fewer of us, give as many of the wisest and ablest of the Priests and Profes∣sors a meeting for dispute, at any place in England, at what place, time, and for what continuance, as they shall ascribe and consent unto, and to dispute and controvert betwixt us and them, any such thing, and every such particular, as shall or may be objected by any of the Heads and Rulers, or other Grave Understanding Men, wherein they are doubtful betwixt us, and would thereof be satisfied, that by such Dispute
and opening of such causes, objected, full, and real, and toal, satisfaction may be given to the whole Nation, and every particular man and mem∣ber therein. Otherwise, Let the Priests or Professors, or any of them, object what they can against us, in our Principles, Profession, Faith, and Practice, and our whole Religion; And if they shall affirm and alledge any one or more things against us, that any Principle we hold, or Practice we profess in any part throughout all our Religion, are false Principles, and false Practi∣ces, and not according to Truth, nor the Scriptures, but shall affirm that our Religion is not the true Religion, nor we of the true Church of Christ, and they shall have free liberty, to give their best proof and reason for what they affirm, and alledge; yet by the Strength of Christ, and in the power and authority of God, and according to the Scriptures we shall con∣fute all their Proofs and strongest Reasons; and on the contrary we shall joyn our Principles, Doctrines, and Practices, and all our Religion, and every part and particular thereof, to be the very truth, and agreeing with the Scriptures, & according to that shall maintain by lawful Arguments, and plea, that our Religion and Worship, and all that we profess and Pra∣ctice is according to the mind of the Lord, and justified of him, and that whatsoever is and may be spoken against us, upon that account, is utterly false, and to be condemned, and upon this we will ingage with them, and with any of our Enemes, of what Sect and Profession soever, to the intent onely that Truth may be manifest and embraced, and Deceit and Error discovered and denied. And also, upon such an Engagement we should agree to have the liber∣ty, freely, and soberly to object against the Priests, concerning their Mi∣nistry, their Call, their Practice, their Maintenance, and their Fruits and Effects, and concerning their Church, and Principles, and Worship, and whole Religion, and shall hear patiently all that can be said in defence thereof by any or all of them, and shall prove by the Spirit of the Lord, and according to the Scriptures, that their ministry is not the true Mini∣stry of Christ, nor they true and lawfull Ministers of the Gospel, but shall manifest by evident Arguments, that their Call, Practice, Maintenance, Fruits and Effects, are not according, nor agreeing, but contrary and dif∣fering, to what the true Ministry was, and its Call, Practice, Mainte∣nance, Fruits and Effects were in the true Apostles, and among the true Churches; and furthermore by the Grace of God we shall prove their Church, their Worship, and their whole Religion, in all parts thereof, to be degenerated from what the true Church was, & the true Worship, and true Religion, in the days of the Apostles, and true Churches of old; and these things shall we make manifest by faithful and sound Arguments, ac∣cording to the Scriptures, that all the Earth may know, and all people perceive who is in the Truth, and of the true Worship and Religion, and who are in the contrary; and whether the Priests, and that which they profess and practice for Religion; or the Quakers, and that which they profess and practice for Religion; be of God, and according to him, and whether are contrary; that the end of this long Travel, and War, and con∣troversie
may be desided and justly ended between, us, and all people may be resolved, and satisfied concerning us, and them that do oppose us. And let all the Priests and Professors lay aside and give over their Houses of Correction, and imprisoning people, and whipping of them, and stocking of us, and dealing in this manner of violence and cruelty, as for years by-past they have done in defence of their Religion, and resist∣ing of ours; and let them lay aside their carnal Weapons, and fighting against our persons, and imprisoning of us about our Religion; and let them come forth in sound Arguments, the best they have, and let us see what spiritual Weapons they have to resist us, and defend themselves; and let us try, whether their spiritual Weapons or ours be the strongest, and the most powerful, and mighty; and let theirs that are so, prevail against the other, be it ours, or theirs; and this is the way to try the truth, and to make all things manifest, and to deside and end all the whole contro∣versies between us and them, which hath been great this many years; and let the Truth be set up and exalted, where ever it is, and all Deceit thrown down to the Ground; and let us war with the Weapons of the Spi∣rit, against Errour and false Religion, one in the other; but lets not hurt Creatures, nor imprison Persons, nor stock and whip Creatures, and make them to suffer; but let us thresh Deceit, and whip and beat that, and all false Opinions; let us throw them down, where they are found, whe∣ther in them or in us; and let us fight with the Weapons of the Spirit, that are spiritual; & let them fight no longer with such cruel carnal Weapons; and then let such as get the victory, and overcome, appear to be in the truth of the Church; and such as falls, and is overcome, be manifest to be in the Error, and of the false Church and Religion; and let us love one anothers persons, and let them act no otherwise towards our persons, then we do upon theirs, and towards them; and let them take the liberty to deal with us, and our persons, as we deal with them, and their persons, and no otherwise. And let such, whether them or us, that cannot prove our selves to be the true Church of Christ, nor of the true Worship, and true Religion, nor in the truth, but is found to be in the Error, and out of the Truth; let such deny their Worship and Church, and renounce all their Religion, and confess to all the World, under their hands, that they are, and have been deceived, and for ever hereafter stop their Mouthes, and never profess nor practice any more what they have done in such Religion; And freely upon these Issues and Conditions we will joyn trial with them; let them appoint time, place, and profer terms at their own pleasure, and then to all the World it shall be manifest, and to all people discovered, whether we have not good ground, and sufficient reason to war against these Priests; and it may perfectly appear that what we have said and written against them these divers years, have been upon a good foundation, and we have had sufficient cause to speak and write against them, as we have done; and none thenceforth shall have cause to say, or doubt, that what we have spoken and written against them hath been out of malice
or envy, and without cause and good reason; but on the contrary all shall know the Ground of Quarrel is sufficient and full of equity on our part. And upon these or any equal tearms and conditions, would we, and are we willing to engage with these Priests, and all, or any one of these Sects, in a lawful Tryal, in Disputes, or Writings, for the Tryal and searching out of the Truth, and the true Religion; And were it not equal and reasonable, that we had the same liberty among all these Priests, and in their Church and Assemblies freely to declare our minds, and to let forth our selves in what we hold and profess, without being violently haled, and beat, and whipped, and sent to Prison, as we have been this many years? which liberty we do freely grant and allow among us to all, to query, or declare what is upon them, without such violent dealing, or whipping, or sending them to Prisons, and Houses of Correction; and the same, and no other do we desire of others in this particular of freedom to declare the Truth, and what we hold, then what we do and would allow to others; and that no Weapon be used by them against us, nor dealing to∣wards us, but the Weapons of the Spirit, the best they have, or can bring forth against us; and let them let Creatures alone, and not hurt, nor do violence to them, and no other Weapons shall we use against them, nor deal with them by any other thing, but the Weapons of the Spirit of God which are powerful, & will bring down strong Holds; and as for Creatures, we shall not hurt, nor do violence, nor imprison them; and whose Wea∣pons are the strongest, let such overcome. And such as are overcome, is not the true Church; for the true Church of Christ which is builded upon the Rock, the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against; and who do overcome, with such let it be manifest, that God of a truth is with them; and let them all cease to defend their Church, and Ministry, and Religion with Prisons, and Whips, and Houses of Correction; for by such things was never the true Church, Ministry, and Religion defended; but only the Power and Authority of God preserved them, and resisted all their Enemies; and so it is at this day: and let all cease to cry Deceivers, and being afraid to be de∣ceived; for if they be the true Church, all, or any of these Sects and Professions of Religions; then if we be Deceivers, and come among them, they cannot be deceived, if they be in the Election; for no Deceivers, nor the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against the true Church of Christ, nor against them that are elect, which the Devil hath nothing in: And if we be the true Church of Christ, & in the Election; then if all the Deceivers upon Earth come among us, they cannot prevail against us, nor deceive us; for the Elect cannot be deceived; and upon these terms we may engage with any people and Sect upon Earth: Therefore come to this, and joyn with us; take you the Liberty to declare in soberness what you own and prosess, & you shall not be persecuted, nor your Bodies, nor Persons harm∣ed by violence; and let us have that liberty to declare in Meekness and Soberness, and in Gods Authority amongst you what we hold and profess, and let us not be persecuted, and dealt violently withal; and
then let it appear whether we or our Enemies have a greater Testimony, and more powerfull in the hearts of people. And were not this a way full of equity, for the trial of all things? but doing contrary, as you have done these many years against us, by Violence, and Whipping, and Perse∣cuting, it shews you have not the spiritual Weapons, nor the Authority of God with you, nor among you; and that is the cause of running to Magistrates, and putting in Goals, and Whippings, and all Violence, because the Authority of God's Spirit is wanting amongst you, which all the false Sects, and false Churches, since the days of the Apostles, have wanted to defend themselves, and resist their Enemies; and so all Sects have been fighting one with another, and killing Persons and Creatures, and desending themselves by Prisons, and Inquisitions, and destroying of lives; and all this hath been out of the Power of God, and not in it, but by the power of the Dragon, and of the Beast, who hath caused all to worship, and them that would not, he hath power to kill, and hath killed them, by Fires, and Tortures, and cruel Deaths, and all these have lost the spiritual Weapons, and been without the Power and Spirit of God; And what a Church is this of yours, which hath been to be defend∣ed by Goals, and Prisons, and Whips and Stocks, and violent Dealing? this Church is not the Church of Christ, for the Power and Spirit of God defends her always, and not Inquisitions, and Prisons and Whips; these are Cains Weapons, and not the Weapons of the Spirit of God, whereby his true Church was ever defended; for because Cains sacrifice was not accep∣ted, therefore he slew his Brother, and persecuted him; and thus you that are of Cains seed do the same, upon the same Ground, because your works are rejected and theirs accepted, with whom you deal thus in this violent way of persecution and wickedness. And this is the Protestant Church (so called) and her Ministers, with whom I am now Dealing, which seems to be the true Church, and more then the Church of Rome; for you Protestant Ministers do deny and cry against the Church of Rome, as a false Church, and her Ministers to be Deceivers (which in it selfe is very true) But yet your hypocrisie in this doth appear, and your double-mindedness; for let me tell you, while you cry against the Church of Rome, as a false Idolater, and a Persecutor of the true Church, and against her Ministers to be Deceivers, and contrary to the Apostles; are not your spirits the same, and your works the same in nature (though not in measure) and in particular, this work of yours to imprison people, and whip them, and put them in the Stocks, and beat them, and abuse their Persons and Bodies, who do but speak against you and your Religion? is not this work of the very same na∣ture as the work of the Romish Church? she to defend her Church hath Inquisitions, and Banishment, and many cruel Tortures, and with these things her Church she defends, killing and afflicting of Peoples Bodies, that do oppose her Church and deny their Religion, and you have Stocks, and Whips, and Houses of Correction, and putting great Fines and Taskes upon People, and Banishing People out of Townes, and spoiling their Goods and casting men into Prison, who do oppose your Church, and deny
your Religion, and is not this equal and justly according (in Nature) to the Persecution that is in the Romish Church? and what difference be∣tween the defence of the Church of Rome and your Church of Protestants? they have their Inquisitions, and you have your Houses of Correction; they have their Slavery in the Gallies, and you have Whips, and Stocks; they have their divers Torments, and cruel Dealings towards Persons that oppose them, and upon their Bodies in one manner, and you have your Torments and cruel Dealing towards us in another manner, though not in the same measure, yet in the same nature; and what difference be∣tween you and them? And herein doth the Hypocrisie of the Protestant Church and their Ministers appear, in that they cry against; and deny the Church of Rome, and their Persecution, and Cruelty acted against others, and yet in nature and manner do Practice the very same upon us, as in England this day is witnessed; And not onely in this particular may the Church, and Ministers of the Protestants be condemned for Hypocrisie, but also in many other things, even the most of their Practices in their Worship is of the same nature, and by the same spirit, which the Pra∣ctices of the Church of Rome is practised by and in; and not onely so, but it may be truely proved, and made manifest, that the original and institution of many of your Church-Practices proceeded from the Church of Rome, and the Church and Pope of Rome did ordain and institute many of your Practices, and a great part of your worship, which is performed in the Church, and by the Ministry of the Protestants (so called) and this in its time and season I may make fully appear, and discover to the Nati∣ons, and I may shew in the particulars, what particulars of the worship and practice in the Protestants Church had their first rice and beginning and original in the Church of Rome, though they are minced and degressed with diminishings and addings, according as their imagina∣tions have guided them, yet still they retain the strongest taste and Savour of the Church of Rome, and had their rice and original there, though in the performing thereof, they may be altered and changed in appearance and from, but are perfectly the same in Ground and Nature, as springing from the Church of Rome, and she the Mother of the Protestant Church, and of the Practices of the most of her performances in worship, and this may be proved, as God willing upon oecasion, as the Lord moves, I may let sorth my mind, and what I know in these things, and may shew, though that the Church of the Protestants have disserted the Church of Rome; yet their Ministry, its Call, and Ordination, and its Practice, and Maintenance, hath a dependancy upon the Church of Rome, as being the Original of that which is by them therein practised, though in some things deviated from the perfect Form and Practice thereof; and also the whole Worship of all the Particulars in relation to the Protes∣tant Church, and Ministry, and Worship, hath a dependance upon the Church of Rome, as being the first Original thereof, and though they cry against her and her Ministers, and have denied her, yet is she the Mo∣ther and Womb in which was bred, and out of whom proceeded the Protestant Church, Ministry, and Worship, and Practices, and this may
be manifest at full that the Protestant Church, Ministry, and Worship, chiefly tasteth and savoureth of the Church and Worship of Rome, and had their original out of her: And also further may be shewed, that the Protestant Church, and Worships, and Ministry are not another in nature and being, then the Romish Church, Ministry, & Worship; but is sprung out thereof, as a Branch out of the same Root, the Ground being one and the same, though differing in appearance; for in her beginning and first dissenting from the Romish Church, she did not deny her in ground and being, as not being at all the Church of Christ; but only in some particu∣lars dissented alwayes then, and to this day retaining divers of their pra∣ctices in Worship and Church-Government, which doth shew, that the Protestant Church is not perfectly another, nor her Ministry, and Go∣vernment, and Worship another then is the Romish Church; but is the same in ground and being, onely digressed and deviated in particulars; and this may be fully manifest in season, that the Protestant Church, and Worship, and Ministry, is of the Romish Church sprung as a branch out of her, not contrary to her, and against her; and all these things is the Lord discovering and laying open, that Nations and Peoples may come to behold the Mother of Harlots, that Mystery of Iniquity, and all her Children, and may see the state and turning of times, and things, ever since the days of the Apostles, and true Churches; and how that all these divers Sects, and all these Churches, falsely so called, are risen up and sprung out one of another, and coming from one Seed and Womb; and though divers in Appearances, and sundry in Practices, and Professions, yet are they all one in the Ground and Nature, sprung from the Mother of Harlots, all of them, and being her Children; and she hath corrup∣ted the Earth with her Fornications and Whoredoms, and made Nati∣ons and Kingdoms drunk with her Cup of Idolatry: but the Lord God is risen and will plead with her, and give her double, and the holy Pro∣phets and Apostles shall rejoyce over her; and this is coming to pass; and this have I seen from the Lord, and received it from him; and thus it come upon me to write.
THE Waters I have seen dry'd up, the Seat of the great Where, Who with the Fornication Cup of her enticing power Hath made all Nations drunk thereby, and the whole Earth defil'd With her gilt Cup of Sorcery, whom she hath long beguil'd. But Peoples many are, and shall, and Multitudes all may; And Nations be Converted all unto another Way: And Tongues they now confounded bee, and Kindreds they must mourn; And when thou this shalt finish'd see, then say her Seat is torn. For these are all the Waters great, on whom her Seat hath been, And over whom her rule was great, like as a stately Queen. For Ages by-past (its now seen) She hath her Whoredoms plaid; And Kingdoms have bewitched been, And have her power obey'd. But now its seen, she shan't deceive; Her Witchcrafts they are known; And men no more will her believe; her Misery is shown. And now the wofull Bed I see, of Torments great prepar'd, Whereon she shortly cast must be; and Plagues must not be spar'd. But wo to her the wrathfull Cup (is fill'd) she others gave; She must it now her self drink up, the same she now must have. And drink she must and that full deep, of God's fierce Indignation. And then shall all her Lovers Weep, and make great Lamentation.
The City also I have seen, which once was great and fair, Destroy'd, and soon laid waste hath been; her Merchants did dispair, Who by her got great gain and trade, to make them rich withall; And trafficks from far she had; but now lament they shall. For Fire in her is kindled bright, which must her all consume; And up to Heaven day and night, ascendeth up her fume. And Antichrist (who ravened from Truth within, the Light) Was with Sheeps Clothing covered, and rul'd Kings by his might: Who had laid waste God's Heritage, and had a Kingdom great; The Saints against him war did wage, and Truth gave him defeat. Behold the Whore's Flesh burnt I've seen; her beauty doth now fall. All Harlots Mother she hath been; her Daughters are Whores all. Behold, the City great and fair, she's fallen to the ground; By which Nations inriched were; in her no profits found. Behold the Antichrist, once great, his Kingdom's near laid waste: The Lord will bring him from his Seat; the day comes on in haste. Christ's Kingdom's coming on with speed; the Lord alone will reign: He will for aye exalt his Seed o'er Antichrist and's Train. The Woman I have seen return, the Wilderness did take; A place where she did greatly mourn; and rest she there did take. The springing of her Seed I've seen; the Man child now must sway: (By'm Nations have replenisht been) for evermore I say.
Then Praises to the Heavenly King, when come to pass this shall. Oh then do ye rejoyce and sing, ye Saints and Prophets all: When God shall pour his Vengeance great, to cause our Enemies Fall: Then is the Day of Praises meet for Saints both great and small. E. B. THis Epistle was by E. B. prefixed to a Book of G. Fox's, in Folio, Entituled, The Great Mystery of the Great Whore unfolded, published in the year 1659. which, though some of it related to that Book; yet it being E. B's Epistle, and much of it of a more general Concernment, it was judged meet to be here inserted, and published with the rest.
FRANCIS HOWGIL's TESTIMONY Concerning the Life, Death, Tryals, Travels and Labours of Edward Burrough, That Worthy Prophet of the LORD. SHall dayes, or months, or years wear out thy Name, as though thou hadst had no being? Oh nay! Shall not thy noble and va∣liant Acts, and mighty Works which thou hast wrought through the power of him that separated thee from the Womb, live in Genera∣tions to come? Oh yes! the children that are yet unborn, shall have thee in their Mouths, and thy Works shall testifie of thee in Generati∣ons, who yet have not a being, and shall count thee blessed. Did thy Life go out as the snuff of a Candle? Oh nay! thou hast pene∣trated the hearts of many, and the memorial of the just shall live for ever, and be had in renown among the Children of Wisdom for ever; for thou hast turned many to righteousness, and shall shine as a Star of God in the Firmament of God's Power, for ever and ever; and they that are in that, shall see thee there, and enjoy thee there, though thou be gone away hence, and can no more be seen in mutability; yet thy Life, and thy Spirit shall run parallel with Immortality. Oh, Edward Burrough! I cannot but mourn for thee, yet not as one without hope nor Faith, knowing and having a perfect testimony of thy well-being in my heart, by the Spirit of the Lord; yet thy absence is great, and years to come shall know the want of thee, Shall I not lament as David did for a worse man then thee, even for Abner, when in wrath he perished by the hand of Ioab, without any just cause, though he was a valiant man? David lamented over Abner, and said, Dyed Abner as a fool dyeth? (Oh nay! he was betrayed of his Life) even so hast thou been bereaved of thy life by the hand of the Oppressor, whose Habitations, are full of cruelty. Oh my soul, come not thou within their secret, for thy blood shall be required at the hands of them who thirsted after thy life; and it shall cry as Abels, who was in the Faith; even so wert thou, it shall weigh as a ponderous Milstone upon their Necks, and shall crush them under, and be as a Worm that gnaweth, and shall not dye: When I think upon thee, I am melted
into tears of true sorrow; and because of the want that the Inheri∣tance of the Lord hath of thee, my substance is even as dissolved: Shall I not say as David said of Saul and Ionathan, when they were slain in Mount Gilboa, The beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places: Even so wast thou stified; in nasty Holes, and Prisons, and many more, who were precious in the Eyes of the Lord: And surely precious wast thou to me, Oh dear Edward, I am distressed for thee my brother; very pleasant hast thou been to me, and my love to thee was wonderful, passing the love of Women, Oh thou whose Bow never turned back, neither Sword empty from the Blood of the Slain, from the slaughter of the Mighty; who made Nations and Multitudes shake with the Word of Life in thy Mouth, and wast very dreadful to the Enemies of the Lord; for thou didst cut like a Rasor, and yet to the Seed of God brought forth; thy words dropped like Oyle, and thy. Lips as the Honey-comb. Thou shalt be recorded among the Valiants of Israel, who attained to the first Degree through the Power of the Lord, that wrought mightily in thee in thy day, and wast worthy of double honor, because of thy Works sake; thou wast ex∣pert to handle thy Weapon, and by thee the Mighty have fallen, and the Slain of the Lord have been many; many have been pricked to the heart through the. Power of the Word of Life; and Coals of fire from thy Life came forth of thy Mouth, that in many a Thicket, and among many Bryars and Thorns it came to be kindled, and did devour much Stubble that cumbered the Ground, and stained the Earth. Oh how certain a sound did thy Trumpet give! And how great an Alarum didst thou give in thy day, that made the Host of the Uncircumcised greatly distressed! What man so valiant, though as Goliah of Gath, would not thy Valour have encountered with, while many despised thy youth! And how have I seen thee with thy Sling and thy Stone (despised Weapons as to war with) wound the Mighty! and that which hath seemed contemptible to the Dragon's Party, even as the Jaw-bone of an Ass; with it thou hast slain the Philistines Heaps upon Heaps, as Sampson. Thou hast put thy Hand to the Hammer of the Lord, and hast often fastened Nailes in the heads of the Lamb's Enemies, as Deborah did to Sisera; and many a rough Stone hast thou polished and squared, and made it fit for the Building of God; and much knotty Wood hast thou hewed in thy day, which was not fit for the building of God's House, Oh thou Prophet of the Lord; and shalt for ever be recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life, among the Lord's Worthies, who have followed the Lamb through great Tribu∣lations, as many can witness for thee from the beginning, and at last hath overcome, and found worthy to stand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion, the Hill of God, as I have often seen thee, and thy heart well tuned as a Harp, to praise the Lord, and to sound forth his great Salvation, which many a time hath made glad the hearts of them that did believe, and strengthened their Faith and Hope. Well, thou art at rest, and bound up in the Bundle of Life; and I know Tears were wiped away from thy Eyes, because there was no cause of sorrow in thee; For I know thou witnessed the old things done away, and there was
no curse, but blessings were poured upon thy head as rain, and peace as a mighty shower, and trouble was far from thy dwelling, though in the outward man trouble on every side, and hath had a Greater share in that, for the Gospel sake (though a Youth in thy time) than many besides: But now thou are freed from that, and hast obtained a name through Faith, with the Saints in Light. Well, hadst thou more to give up then thy Life for the Name of Jesus in this World? Nay; and to seal thy Testimony committed unto thee with thy blood, as thou hast often said in thy day, which shall remain as a Crown upon thee for ever and ever. And now thou art freed from the temptations of him who had the power of death, and art freed from thy outward Enemies, who ha∣ted thee because of the Life that dwelt in thee, and remaineth at the right Hand of God, where there is joy and pleasure for evermore in the ever∣lasting Light, which thou hast often testified unto, according to the Word of Prophesie in thy heart, which was given unto thee by the Ho∣ly Ghost; and art at rest in the perfection thereof, in the beauty of Ho∣liness; yet thy Life and thy Spirit I feel as present, and have unity with it, and in it, beyond all created and visible things, which are subject to mutation and change; and thy Life shall enter into others, to testifie unto the same truth, which is from everlasting to everlasting; for God hath raised, and will raise up children unto Abraham, of them that have been as dead stones, whose Power is Almighty, great in his people in the midst of their Enemies. This same Edward Burroughs was born in the Barrony of Kendal, in the County of Westmoreland, of honest Parents, who had a good report among their Neighbours for upright and honest dealing among men, who brought up Edward in his Youth in Learning, and good Education as the Countrey doth afford. He was a very understanding Boy in his Youth, and his knowledge and understanding did far exceed his years: He had the Spirit of a man when he was but a child; and I may say, grey hairs was upon him when he was but a Youth; for he was cloathed with Wisdom in his Infancy; for I had perfect knowledge of him from a Youth: He was inclinable from his Youth upwards, to Religion, and the best way, always minding the best things, and the best and nearest way of Worship to the Scriptures of Truth, and always did accompany the best men, who walked in godliness and honesty, insomuch I have often admired his discreet carriage, and his great understanding of the things of God: He was never known to be addicted to any vice or malignity, or bad behaviour, neither followed any evil course of life from his childhood, but feared the Lord, and walked uprightly according to the light and knowledge received in all things. In his natural dispo∣sition he was bold and manly, dexterous and servent; and what he took in hand, he did it with his might; loving, kind and courteous, merci∣ful and flexible, and easie to be entreated. His whole delight was always among good people; and to be conferring and reading the Scriptures, and little to mind any sports or pastimes, which there is an insidency unto in Youth; but his very strength was bended after God, and was separted (I
may say) from his Mother's Womb, and fitting for the Work's sake, whereunto he after was called. And when it pleased the Lord to raise up unto us the ancient Horn of Salvation among us, who were reckoned, in the North Part of England, even as the Out-casts of Israel, and as men destitute of the great Know∣ledge, which some seem'd to enjoy; yet there was more Sincerity and true Love amongst us, and desires after the living powerful Presence of God, then was among many in that day, who seem'd to make a great flourish; who ran into Heaps and Forms, but left the Cross behind them, and indeed were Strangers to it: God out of his everlasting Love did ap∣pear unto us, according to the desire of our hearts, who longed after him; when we had turn'd aside from Hireling-Shepherds Tents, we found him whom our Souls loved; and God, out of his great Love, and great Mer∣cy, sent one unto us immediately by his Power, a Man of God, one of Ten Thousand, to instruct us in the Way of God more perfectly; who laid down the sure Foundation, and declared the acceptable Year of the Lord; who indeed made the Mourners to rejoyce, and the Heavy-heart∣ed glad, which yet was terrible to all Hypocrites, and all formal Pro∣fession; which Testimony reached unto all our Consciences, and entred into the in-most part of our Hearts, which drove us to a narrow search, and to a diligent inquisition concerning our state, which we came to see through the Light of Christ Jesus, which was testified of, and found it to be even what it was testified of; and the Lord of Heaven and Earth we sound to be near at hand; and as we waited upon him in pure Si∣lence, our Minds out of all things, his Dreadful Power, and Glorious Majesty, and Heavenly Presence appear'd in our Assemblies, when there was no Language, Tongue nor Speech from any Creature, and the Kingdom of Heaven did gather us, and catch us all, as in a Net; and his Heavenly Power at one time drew many Hundreds to Land, that we came to know a place to stand in, and what to wait in; and the Lord appeared daily to us, to our Astonishment, Amazement, and great Admiration, insomuch that we often said one unto another, with great joy of Heart, What, is the Kingdom of God come to be with men? And will he take up his Tabernacle among the Sons of Men, as He did of old? And what shall we, that were reckoned as the Out casts of Israel, have this Honour of Glory communicated amongst us, which were but men of small Parts, and of little Abilities, in respect of many others, as amongst men. Howbe∣it, thus it seemed good unto the Lord, to chose the weak things, and the foolish things of this World, as to the aspect of men, that no Flesh might glory, that no man because of his Parts might glory, or because of his strength or wisdom might glory; but that the Glory which is his, might only be given to him, Unto whom be the Glory of all his Works forever and ever, Amen. And from that Day forward our Hearts were knit unto the Lord, and one unto another, in true and servent Love; not by any Exter∣nal Covenant, or External Form; but we entred into the Covenant of Life with God, and that was as a strong Obligation or Bond
upon all our spirits, which united us one unto another; and we met together in the Unity of the Spirit, and of the Bond of Peace; tread∣ing down under our Feet all reasoning, questioning, debating and con∣tending about Religion, or any part or parts, or practice or practices thereof, as to any external thing: and we waited at time and times, as God did grant us Oportunities; and the more we had and could ob∣tain from our necessary Occasions of this present life, the better we were, and the more we were confirmed and strengthened in our Hope and Faith; and holy Resolutions were kindled in our Hearts, as a Fire, which the Life kindled in us, To serve the Lord while we had a Beeing; and to make mention of his Name and Power whilst we did live; and to hold forth that Testimony which was committed to us, in the sight of Men and Nations, by Doctrine, by Practice, by a holy Conversation; and mightily did the Word of God grow amongst us; and the desires of many were after the Name of the Lord. Oh happy Day! Oh blessed Day! the memorial of which can never pass out of my Mind. And thus the Lord, in short, did form us to be a Peo∣ple for his Praise in our Generation. Howbeit, after all this, and much more, which time would fail me to write of (neither is the purpose of my spirit bent that way at this time) we did come through very great Tribulations, extream Distres∣ses, great Perplexity; and passed out oftentimes hungry, and hard put to it, both within and without; yet such was our love to the Lord, and such servency in our hearts, That we rather chosed to dye, and to undergo every Difficulty, than to dishonour or deny the Name of Christ in the midst of suffering, because of that Taste that we had of his Goodness and immortal Life revealed in our Hearts; this Young Man, of whom I am speaking, had his share, though but a Youth at that time, of 16. or 17. years of age. Because of the I ruth which crossed all the world's wayes, his nearest Relations, even his own Parents, cast him off, as an Alien, and turn'd him out from their House, as not to have any Part or Portion therein, as a Son, nay, not so much as a hired Servant; which this young Man bore very patiently, without Murmuring or Complain∣ing, having a taste of that then which was better then all the World; and through conversing with his people, and amongst them, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and the Spirit of Wisdom and Understand∣ing entred into his Heart, and the Spirit of Knowledge and sound Judgment came to be seated in his Reins, and the Spirit of Prophe∣sie came upon him, like as it did upon many more, through the Holy Ghost's Power and Operation; and he spake of the wonderful things of God among them that believed; and was one of the first among us which the Lord opened the Mouth of, to shew forth his Praise, and to speak of the things of his Kingdom to as many as he met with, who waited for the Consolation of Israel, for the Riches of the Gentiles, and to as many as desired and hoped after Eternal Life. At last the Lord signled him out, and commanded him to go forth into Coun∣tries, unknown to him, as he did some more besides, upon whom
he laid a necessity to preach the Gospel freely, without Money, with∣out Price, without Tythes, Augmentations, Gifts or Rewards, and in that he was as faithful a man, none exeeeding him in his Generation; for those things were an abhorrency to his heart; and where he met with any such Hireling Shepherds, and deceitful Workers which had gull'd the Nations, and cheated the people for dishonest Gain, and kept them in Blindness, the Indignation of the Lord was kindled in his Heart, and the Sword of the Lord was very Sharp in his Hand; and whomsoever he met with, which walked after this sort, they were sure to feel the weight of his Weapon, and the force of his Blow, by which many have been deeply wounded, that they have grinned like Dogs on him, as greedy Dogs indeed, because of their present Wound and Blow that he did give them; and though he was but young in years, yet he was full of fortitude and true valour: The Lord oftentimes, when he exercised him in such War as this, hath filled his Quiver full of polished Shafts, and made his Bow to abide in strength, and he was as dextrous and as ready handed, as any that I knew in his day, a∣gainst the Dragon and his power, against the Beast and his Followers; and indeed he was very even-handed, and had a special good Arm, and seldom mist the Mark: God had fill'd his Mouth with Argu∣ments, so that he hath often made a breach, in the Face of an Host. And it was my lot (which I cannot but say fell in a good ground) to be his Companion and Fellow-Labourer in the Work of the Gospel, whereunto we were called for many years together: And oh! when I consider, my heart is broken; how sweetly we walked together for ma∣ny Moneths and Years! in which we had perfect knowledge of one anothers hearts, and perfect unity of spirit, not so much as one cross word, or one hard thought of discontent ever rose (I believe) in either of our hearts, for ten years together; but our Souls were bound up in uni∣ty and peace, having the frame of our hearts bent after one and the self same thing, to wit, the propagation of that Truth by which Liberty was obtained, and Salvation received through Jesus Christ the true Light of the World, seeing through his Light the whole World to lie in wicked∣ness; a necessity lay upon this person of whom I am speaking, being con∣strained by the Spirit of the Lord, by which he was made an able Mini∣ster of the Everlasting Gospel, to preach Repentance, Conversion, Sal∣vation and Remission of Sins; and accordingly he went forth in the Name and Power of the Lord Jesus, the Saviour of Mankind, and was an able Minister of the glad Tidings of Salvation, in many, or most parts of this Land; and also he travelled through again and again, the whole Na∣tion of Ireland; and in some part of Scotland, and some part of Flanders; and his Ministry was made effectual, through the Almighty Power of God, in turning many from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to God; there are many thousands who are living in the Bo∣dy, and alive in the Truth, who can in the Spirit of the Lord bear Testimony to the Power and Verity of his Ministry, in many Coun∣treys
where he travelled; for he laboured much in divers places, even in the heat of the day, though he began early in the morning; and in the beginning of his Travels and Labours, it was his share to break up rough places, and untilled ground, and to walk amongst many Bryars and Thorns, which scratched, and pricked, and teared; and travelled with some other, not without great opposition; and he often trod the pathes and wayes which had not been occupied in the Truth; and where dark∣ness had the Dominion, and was as a covering, he brake through as an armed man, not minding the opposition, but the victory, and the good of all souls; though to my knowledge his sufferings and tryals have not been small, nor his exercise a little, on the right hand, and on the left; in travels often, oftentimes buffetted, sometimes knocked down by unreasonable men, who had not Faith; loaded with Lyes, Slan∣ders, Calumnies and Reproaches; often in Weakness, yea in Deaths often; in Watching, Fastings and Temptations often; in Straits and Necessities; in Perils among rude Multitudes; in Perils in Idol-Temple; in Perils in Streets and Markets, where the Lord did move him often to go in the beginning of his time; besides the exceeding weight of service from Weeks end to Weeks end, insomuch that he had seldom many Hours of repose; and often suffered by those spirits who lost their first love, and rose in opposition. He was very diligent and faithful, true hearted and valiant, and the Yoke at last came to be easie unto him, though no ease at all in the Body, as to the outward man; for he made the Work of the Lord his whole business, without taking so much Liberty unto himself, or about any outward occasion in this World, as to spend one Week to himself (to my knowledge) these Ten Years: He had ventured himself often, for the Bodies sake; and a great care I know was in his Heart, that them that he had mi∣nistred unto, and others that had believed in the same Truth, might thrive and prosper, and might walk as becometh the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He was of a manly Spirit in the things of God; he hath engaged himself often upon the Lords account singly in great Disputes, when there were many Opposers; he hath stood in the Door, and in the Gap, against all his Enemies, for the worthy Name of God, and taken the whole weight of things upon his own Shoulders, that others might be eased, though often to the weakening, and almost destroying of the outward man; yet doing all in love to the Lord, and for his peoples sake: he did it with Cheerfulness, and it was a Grief to him if any opportu∣nity was missed of doing good: He was a man of no great Learning in natural Tongues, which men so much applaud; yet indeed his Heart was full of matter, and his Tongue was as the Hand of a ready Scribe; and yet he had the Tongue of the Learned, having had experi∣ment of the Work of the Lord, and being acquainted with many con∣ditions which God had carried him through, he could speak a word in season unto all who declared their conditions unto him; or otherways in his publick Ministry he was very plausible and elegant in his speech,
and indeed had the Tongue of a learned Orator to declare himself to the Understandings and Consciences of all men with whom he conver∣sed, by which many received great profit, and their Understandings came to be opened; for his words ministred Grace to the Hearers, and his words were forcible and very pleasant, as Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver. This young Man of whom I am speaking, was one of the first (with some others) who came to the City of London, where he met with no small opposition both from Professors of divers Forms, and also Pro∣phane, who heeded no Religion at all; and the Way of Truth seemed contemptible, and without form or comeliness to them all; which made the Opposition so great, and the Labour so hard, that notwith∣standing it pleased the Lord to reach unto the Consciences of many, and many were prickt to the Heart, so that they cryed out, what shall we do to be saved? And God made his Ministry very effectual to the conversion of many in the City of London, whereby a great change was wrought in the hearts of many, and many hundreds brought to know the Lord their Teacher, which are as Seals unto the Word of Life through him unto this day. And many hundreds, I may say thousands, heard the lively Word of God declared by him, and were convinced of the Way of Truth, though still remaining in the Disobedience to that of God in their own hearts unto which he declared; and many have lost their day which they had of hearing and receiving the things of God; for now he is taken away which might have been a help unto them while they had time; and all such are not worthy of him. He continued in this City very much at time and times, betwixt eight and nine years together, preaching the Word of God, and speaking of the things of his Kingdom to all that looked after it; and great watching, travel, and exercise in the Work of the Lord; and his earnest desire was, That all might have come to know God's Salvation, and the Redemption of their Souls. And his great diligence was known unto many, that his only rejoycing was in the prosperity of the Work of the Lord, and the increase of Faith amongst them that did believe: And his heart was much drawn towards this City, and oftentimes hath he said to me when sufferings did come for the Gospel sake, which he knew would come, I can freely go to that City, and lay down my Life for a Testimony of that Truth which I have declared through the Power and Spirit of God: which in the end indeed came to be his share, and will for ever be his Crown, who loved not his life unto death for the Testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ. And in the same year 1662, being pressed in his spirit to go visit them who were begotten unto the Faith of God's Elect at the City of Bristol, and in divers other Counties, at divers Meetings, and divers particular Friends, he took his leave of them, saying to very ma∣ny, That he did not know he should see their Faces any more; ex∣horting them all to faithfulness and stedfastness in that wherein they had found rest for their Souls: And said to some, I am going up to the City
of London again, to lay down my LIFE for the GOSPEL, and suffer amongst Friends in that Place; as having some sence of his Suffering before. And a little after his return to the City, at a publick Meeting, which the People of the Lord have kept these many Years, to hear and speak of the things of God to Edification, at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, by certain Souldiers, under the Command of Richard Brown, then General of the City of London, he was violently plucked down, and haled away in a barbarous manner, and carried to the Guard, and so committed to Newgate; not for Evil-Doing, but for testifying unto the Name of the Lord Jesus, and for the Worship of God; as though this were become a great Crime, worthy of Bonds, and (at last) Death: He was had to the Sessions in the Old-Baily, and his Accusers were Wit∣nesses against him, and them that had abused him violently, their Te∣stimony was received as good Proof against him: And at last, after two or three Sessions, he was fined by the Court One Hundred Marks, which at last was reduced to Twenty Marks, and to lie in Prison while payment; where he continued a pretty long season, about Eight Moneths, with Six or Se∣ven Score Prisoners besides, upon the same Account; many being shut up among the Fellons, in nasty Places; and for want of Prison-room, the Natures of many were suffocated, and corrupted; till at last many grew Weak, Sickened and Dyed. At last this same Young Man grew Weak; and though a special Order from the King was sent to the then Sheriffs of London, for the Re∣lease of him, and the rest that were left in Prison; yet such was the Emnity of some of the Rulers of the City, that they did what in them lay to obstruct the Execution of the Order, that he should not be released: And so Weakness grew upon him daily, though in much Patience he was carried through all. In the time of his Weakness he was very fer∣vent in Prayer (and that often, both Day and Night) unto the Lord, as concerning himself, and also his People; and at several times he spoke several precious words from the sensible feeling of God's Spirit in his Heart, and said, I have had the Testimony of the Lord's Love unto me from my Youth, and my Heart hath been given up to do thy Will: And he said, I have preached the Gospel freely in this City, and have often given up my Life for the Gospel's sake; and now Lord rip open my Heart, and see if it he not right before thee. Another time he said, when he had a little ease, There is no Iniquity lies at my Door; but the Presence of the Lord is with me, and his Life I feel justifie me. Another day afterwards he said, Thou hast loved me when I was in the Womb; and I have loved thee from my Cradle, and from my Youth unto this day, and have served thee faithfully in my Generation: And he spoke to Friends that were about him, To live in Love and Peace, and love one another. And at another time he said, The Lord taketh the Righteous from the Evil to come: And he pray∣ed for his Enemies, and for his Persecutors, and said, Lord forgive Richard Brown; he may be forgiven. And though the Distemper and the Dis∣ease was violently upon him, yet he was preserved sensible. And in
the morning before he departed this life, being sensible of his deah, he said, Now my Soul and Spirit is centred into its own Beeing with God; and this form of person must return from whence it was taken: And after a little season he gave up the Ghost and died a Prisoer, and shall be recorded, and is in the Lambs Book of Life, as a Martyr for the Word of God, and the Testimony of Jesus, for which onely he suffered, and gave up his life, whose death was pretious in the Eyes of the Lord. But now he ever liveth with God, and his Work follow him, and his La∣bours shall testifie of him in Generations to come; and thousands be∣side my self can bear witness, his Life and Death was to the praise, ho∣nour and glory of the Grace of God; unto whom be the glory of all his Works for ever, Amen. ANd oh thou City of London! who hast been a professing City of the Name of God, and Christianity so many years, must it be said of thee as Christ said of Jerusalem, that a Prophet cannot perish out of thee: Oh, how many Warnings hast thou had! and how dost thou remain in obdurateness and im∣penitency! Oh, thou art not worthy of those Heavenly Tydings of Salvation which hath been proclaimed in the midst of thee, these many years, by this faithful Messenger of God deceased, with many more, who is taken away in judgment unto thee, because many of thy Inhabitants despised and set at nought that in which the blessedness of all Nations consisteth. Oh how is thy Gold become dim! and how is thy glory stained! How is thy Countenance marred! How is all thy Profession became dead, and like a withered Tree without Sap! The Symptomes of death are upon thee; Your Sun is set, your Glory is passed away; Night is coming, and Darkness is surround∣ing you, and you shall have enough of Darkness, and your Paths and Ways shall be filled with it, because you have hated the Light, and would not have him who is the Light of the World, to rule in your hearts; but have chused Darkness ra∣ther then Light, because your Deeds are evil, and in the end thou shalt be made to see, you have chosen lying Vanities, and have taken Pleasure in the Flesh, and have forsaken your own Mercies. Repent, repent (if any can find a place) while it is called to Day, lest you be shut up in everlasting Darkness, and Truth be hid from your Eyes for ever. ake warning, cease from Persecution and afflicting the Lord's People, who desire to live quietly and peaceably, and to worship God in Truth and Righteousness, with a pure heart: It is too too much that you have done already; the suffering and death of many Innocent Righteous Men, who have suffered these Winters past, will lie as a load upon your City in Summers to come; Remember what God did to Amaleck, the first of the Nations, and to Moab when Israel would have passed to their own Land and Countrey, that God had promised them, and have eaten their own Bread, and Drank their Water, and have passed on peaceably; but they rose up and fell upon the Poor, and upon the Hindmost and Weak; God was Glad to Force his Way, though it proved the ruin of Amaleck, and the Misery of Moab. We would glad walk on our way to the promised Land which belongs to the Saints in Light; we would
eat our own Bread, and Drink our Water, and what we needed, and keep our Con∣sciences clear (in our Generation we must) to that which God hath promised; and if we cannot have away, God will make one for us; and that you that set your selves against the Lord, in the end shall be sure to know and feel, though we shall never lift up carnal Weapon, nor draw Sword, neither use Bow nor Spear; for God hath taught us to love our Enemies; and out of these things we are come, and to the end of Wars, and to be for it; yet God's purpose shall be fulfilled, and he hath wayes enough to plead the cause of his people, and he will do it, and wo to all their Enemies. And do you cry out of Popery because of cruelty and persecution? And will you be found in the same Foot-steps, and in the same nature? Oh! let it never be said nor thought, that ever the Church of God or true Christians did Drink the Blood of the Saints, or cast them into prison; for that is Babylon the Mother of Harlots, that doth so. Therefore be informed and warned; set not Bryars and Thorns in Battel against the Lord, neither stubble before devouring Fire; for if you do, a Consump∣tion will come upon you, and your Name and Memorial shall rot, dye, wither, and melt away, as Snailes; and Glory shall rest with, and upon the Heads of the Suf∣ferers of Christ for ever.

GEORGE WHITEHEAD HIS TESTIMONY AND ACCOUNT Concerning Edward Burroughs ANd as for E. B. our dear Brother, and Companion in Travel, Suffering and Consolation for the Everlasting Gospel's sake in his day, his Testimony lives with us: He was a Preacher of Righteousness, and one who travelled for the Redemption of the Crea∣ture from under the Bondage of Corruption, and proclaimed Liberty to the Captives, in the Power and Authority of God, and therein was a true Witness against Oppression, and all the Antichristian Yokes im∣posed in the Night of Apostacy upon the Persons and Consciences of People; and truly and valiantly he held sorth the Liberty of Consci∣ence, and vindicated it to the great men of the Earth, in things apper∣taining to God in matters of Religion and Worship, against the persecu∣tion and compulsion (which had its Original and Rise from the Power of the Beast, which hath made War against the righteous Seed) that men might be left free to the guidance of the infallible Spirit of God (which is not to be limitted) in these matters, and not be compelled nor brought under the corrupt wills of men, nor their failible judgements nor invent∣ed Forms in these cases: And the Name of this Minister of Righteous∣ness is written in the Lambs Book of Life; and all the Enemies of his Life can never be able to blot it out, nor extinguish his Memorial. Oh! the remembrance of his integrity, uprightness and sincerity, hath deep impression upon my heart; and that tender love and affection in God's Truth which he was filled with towards all the upright, (who are lovers of peace and unity in the Lord) is never to be forgotten by us who are yet remaining in the Work of the Lord, and the Everlasting Gospel, for which he hath left a glorious Testimony, the glory of which shall never be extinguished, but thousands shall praise the Lord our God be∣cause thereof; yea, even the Seed that's yet in the lower parts of the Earth (where darkness covers it) and the child that's yet unborn in many, that's curiously framed in the Mothers Womb, whose Members
are written in the Book of God, shall glorifie the Lord on his behalf. And this Testimony many have already concerning him, that though his Body is dead, his Spirit liveth in the immortallity of that Life that is immutable, and shall never die, not wax old, and is felt among the Righteous, who walk in their integrety and constancy to the Lord. And this faithfull Servant of the Lord, and valiant Souldier of the Lamb (as in his day was evidently apparent) as to live to him was Christ, and to die was Gain: And though in his time many were the Sfferings and Afflictions which his life went under, and his upright spirit suffered by, both from his open Enemies, and Persecutors in the World (because of the valour and courage for the Truth of God) and from deceitfull and transforming exalted spirits, which burthen the ho∣ly Seed; but now his Life is caught up above them all (and is out of their reach) in the transcendent and unspeakable Glory, in the Everlasting Habitation and Firmament of God's Power, where he hath shined (and doth shine among the Stars, that have kept their Habitations, as one that hath turned many to Righteousness, and that hath overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of his Testimony, with those holy Prophets and Martyrs who rejoyce over Babylon and her Abomina∣tions (in whom their blood is found) and against whom he was a faith∣full Witness, and valiant Warrier, whose living and absolute Testi∣mony therein God hath blessed, made prosperous, and will fulfil to the ut∣termost. And though he be ceased from his Labours, his Works do follow him, which will be had in living remembrance, and precious esteem among the Upright, when his Persecutors shall be broken and laid low in the desolation and ruin of Babylon; and all that conti∣nue in Enmity and Deceit, and all the deceitfull spirits that have burdened his righteous Soul, shall fall, and their blossom wither and come to nought. And if any of his Persecutors or Oppressors be yet so impenitent and obdurate, as to triumph, and be elevated in an exalted or prejudiced spirit, because of his death, and in their exaltation and pride of heart say, He was taken away in Judgment, or in Wrath. To such in Gods Fear I answer, That thousands of the Servants of the Lord are of another perswasion, not questioning but it was in God's tender Love (as to his own particular) that he was removed out of the Earthen Vessel, in which he, (though a man as in the prime of his years) endured great Travels in his time for the Truth's sake, and the gather∣ing of many into the Way of the Lord, and in which his Travel was the greater (when the time of his dissolution drew near) to be dissol∣ved, because of his Sufferings, (and the extremity of his Sickness oc∣casioned thereby) which many others were pertakers of, who suffered Persecution and Imprisonment by unreasonable men in this City of London, for the Cause of God and a good Conscience, as chiefly for their meeting together singly in the Worship of God. But this I testifie in the Lord, as in him I have felt, that his being removed, was in Judgment from the Lord against his Persecutors,
who desired and sought his Destruction; and what they have done against him, hath greatly added to the fulfilling of their Iniquities, That the Blood of the Righteous, which cries for Vengeance, may be avenged to the utmost upon them, who would not suffer the Righteous to have a Beeing amongst men, nor lay to heart their being taken away from the Evil to come. And they who, in a byast or prejudiced spirit of Enmity, are listed up because of his Decease, they were not worthy of him, nor of his Testi∣mony; and they have cause to Mourn and Lament amongst those that have pierced the Just, and slighted and despised the Messengers of Truth and Righteousneds, whom God hath therein Honoured: and God will debase such and their vainglory unto the Dust, and exalt the Testimony and Life of his faithful Witnesses over all their Heads. But we, who have been well acquainted with the deep suffering of the Righteous Seed, and with the worth of true Unity, in the weighty Body and Spirit of Christ, and therein do behold the Glory and Compleatness of the City of our God, which is at Peace within it self, cannot but prize the Ministers of Righteousness, and every Member of the same Body; and oh how blessed and precious is the Memorial of the Righteous in our eyes! and how deeply is my Soul affected with that comfortable Commu∣nion, and those many and living Refreshments that we have enjoyed one with another, even with him and others, who have finished their Course! Well, however in this I am satisfied, That though we be left in Travel, and our Dayes have been Dayes of Affliction and Suffering, for Christ and the Gospel's sake (as in the World) yet in him, whom the Prince of this World hath nothing in, we have Peace; being come into Communion with the Spirits of Just Men, who are the Family of God, written in Hea∣ven, and called by one Name both in Heaven and Earth; and the God of Life is their Portion, and his Glory is the Rereward of his Called, and Chosen, and Faithful Ones, who have dealt their Bread to the Hungry, and brought the Poor to their House, even to the Habitation of the Righ∣teous, where the Living Bread is received, and the Heavenly Mansions lived in, and enjoyed by all who abide in the Truth, and retain their first Love and Habitation therein, in which True Fellowship is enjoyed, and the Prosperity of the Elect Seed known. Blessed be the Name of our God forever and ever. London, the 12th day of the 1st Moneth, 1663. George Whitehead
JOSIAH COALE HIS TESTIMONY Concerning The Servant of the Lord, and Minister of Jesus Christ, Edward Burroughs FRiends, a necessity is upon me, and I am even constrained and pressed in my spirit to bring in and give my Testimony concerning my beloved Brother before mentioned, that it may remain and stand upon record for Ages and Generations to come. And this first I say and declare unto all people unto whom this shall come, That he was a man endued with the Almighty Power of God, which lived and reigned in him; and the Treasury of pure, divine, hea∣venly Wisdom was opened in him, &c. and understanding (in the things that relate unto God's Kingdom of Peace and Righteousness, and in the things that concern the Everlasting peace and well-being of all man∣kind) was plentifully manifested unto him by the good Spirit of God, which (I may say) he had received in a plentifull Measure: And this many can testifie unto, and his own Writings which remain upon record, will in a large Measure manifest the truth thereof. And this Spirit dwelt plentifully in him; so that thereby he was able to instruct many in the Way of Life, Peace and true Holiness; and if any were afflicted in spirit or mind, by reason of the Wiles of the Enemy of their Souls, or if they met with any difficulty in their journey, as they passed from Death to Life, he was a man able (through the large experience that he had of the dealings of the Lord, and also of the Wiles of Satan, having followed the Lamb in the Regeneration) to administer a word in season to their refreshment and comfort, and for their establishment in the most precious holy Faith; and this I know the Witness of God in thousands must and shall testifie unto, who are the Seal of his Mini∣stry. And moreover he was a man that was able (through the Wisdom and blessed Gift of God that was in him) to convince and stop the mouths of all Gain-sayers of the Truth, which he (with us) professed and lived in. And it is well known to many, that he was never back∣ward, but alwayes ready and willing to appear in a way of publick
conference, as in vindication of (and against any that should oppose) the blessed Truth of God which he held and professed; and also to manifest the Grounds and Reasons wherefore we deny (and dissent from) the National Priests of the World, (and their traditional Ways of Worship) and the hypocritical Professors thereof, who have not the Life and Substance of what they profess in words. And these things (it is well known unto many) he was oft exercised in; and he did not go about in Corners, nor creep into dark Places, hiddenly nor secretly, but preached the Truth of God, and Doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ boldly and openly, even upon the House∣top; and his valour for God's Truth on Earth, was well known unto many; and his voice was as the found or ratling of the Char∣riots of God's Host upon the tops of the Mountains, and was oft uttered sorth in the Name of the Lord, even like Thunder, and the Voice of the Son of God was uttered forth through him, by which the Dead was raised: the Witnesses are now alive, let them bring in their Testimony, that the truth hereof may be confirmed. His Doctrine dropped as the Oyl of joy upon the spirits of the Mourners in Sion: His life extended it self as a sweet Stream into the hearts of the Children of Light that thirsted after Righteous∣ness: He was one of the Cloud of Witnesses, that dropped down the Dew upon the tender Plants of God: He pleaded the Cause of the innocent suffering Seed, and earnestly contended with the Pow∣ers of the Earth of all sorts, in the behalf, and for the freedom of the suffering people of God: He fore-prophesied unto them that were in Authority in the dayes past, of their destruction, and of their overthrow, because of their deceitfulness to God, and their false and cruel, treacherous and merciless dealings towards his peo∣ple; who had made many fair Promises both to God and Man in the time of their adversity, That they would grant free Liberty of Conscience in things relating to the Worship of God, and that Op∣pression should be removed, and the like; but in the time of their prosperity, when they were waxen fat, and grown great, and lived at ease, and in Pleasures, then they forgot God, and regarded not to per∣form their Engagements neither to God nor his People; for which cause the Lord cut them off in his sore displeasure, and brought an utter Desolation upon them, according to the words of his Ser∣vants; and this Prophet of God lived to see their Desolation come, (which was sad to behold) and his Prophesies were fulfilled in his own dayes. And he also warned the present Rulers of this Nation, to take heed of walking in the Steps of them that are gone before; and for these things, and for the publishing of the Truth of God, and for bearing his Testimony with boldness against all Oppression and Cruelty, he was hated of the men of this Generation, but chiefly by some of the Rulers of the City of London: He sealed his Testi∣mony with his life in Bonds; and so they have wilfully brought in∣nocent
Blood upon themselves; and heavy will it lie upon them in the day of Account (which greatly hastens) wherein the Lord God will make inquisition for the Blood of the Innocent, and reward e∣very man according to his Deeds; then will his Blood be upon you as the Blood of a thousand men; and how will you bear your Sen∣tence from the Lord of Hosts; because you will be found guilty of the Blood of his Prophets, Messengers and Servants, which he sent unto you in love to your Souls, to fore-warn you of the Evil which greatly ha∣stens to come upon you: Yet notwithstanding you have done all these things, and the cry of Innocent Blood hath been heard so loud a∣mongst you, yet have you hardened your Hearts, and go on in stiff∣neckedness, and persist in your Cruelty towards the Servants of the Lord that are left behind, and are found casting them into Pri∣son: Oh, wo is me for you! where will a place be found for you in the day of the Lord? or what Covering will you hide your selves under? Or how will you appear before the Righteous God of Hea∣ven and Earth? Have you no consideration in you of your latter end? Or else do you believe that the Lord sees not your Cruel∣ty towards his People, that you will not answer his requirings, which is to do Justly, and love Mercy, and walk Humbly with the Lord, and to do unto all men as you would they should do unto you? sure∣ly if the consideration of these things were in your hearts, or if you had any regard to keep your Consciences clear in the sight of God herein, you could never do as you have done. Wherefore consider these things, and lay them to heart, and re∣pent speedily, lest you sin your day away, and place of repentance there cannot be found: For this I tell you plainly, that it is in vain for you to strive against the Lord, or to seek to stop or hinder his Work which he hath begun; for he will be too strong for you, and he will make you bow and bend to his own Name and Power, whether you will or no. And though he bear with you long, and suffer you long, yet his Long-suffering will come to an end; and though you should be permitted to fulfill your envious Wills and lustfull Desires so far as to Banish, or Kill, or Destroy us from off the Earth; yea, all of us who are now in being, (which I do not believe ever shall be) yet would God raise up another People by the same Power and Spirit in and by which we stand, which should be a Terror unto you; and should possess God's Everlasting Kingdom (which is not of this World) over your heads. And in the time of his outward weakness he was heard to say, That though this Body of Clay must return to the Dust, yet I have this Testimony, that I have served God in my Generation, and that Spirit which hath lived, and acted, and ruled in me, shall yet break forth in thou∣sands; and my faith is, That it shall be even so; for we have found him a true Prophet amongst us, and to the Nations. And this also near his departure he was heard to desire of the
Lord, That if it were possible, to forgive Brown, &c. And so let all Friends be encouraged to wait upon the Lord in the feeling of the same Spi∣rit that was in him, (which we know is the Saints Comforter) that thereby you may be carried through all Tribulations and Per∣secutions with chearfulness, that in the end you may all receive the Crown of Everlasting Righteousness with him and the rest of the Saints of the most High God, and holy Prophets and Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so the Lord God Almighty of Heaven and Earth be with you all, and keep you all in faithfulness unto the end, Amen. And this is my Testimony for that Man of God, who hath been a Bles∣sing to the Lord in his Generation, and also to this Nation: And in this I have eased my Spirit, and am clear in my Conscience in the Sight of God, having done that which was my duty to do. Josiah Coale.
A Testimony of George Fox Concerning Edward Burroughs HIS Name is Chronicled in the Lamb's Book of Life, a Righteous Plant, Pure, Chaste, Clean: Who can tax him for Oppressing them, or Burdening them, or being Chargeable to them? Who through the Suffering hath fini∣shed his Course, and Testimony; who is now crowned with the Crown of Life, and Reigns with the Lord Christ forever and ever. And in his Ministry in his Life-time he went through Sufferings by bad spirits; who never turn'd his Back on the Truth, nor his Back from any out of the Truth: A Valiant Warrior, more then a Conqueror; who hath got the Crown through Death and Sufferings; who is dead, but yet liveth amongst us, and amongst us is alive. George Fox.
A 1654 Warning from the Lord To the Inhabitants of Underbarrow, and so to all the Inhabitants in ENGLAND, Where it shall meet with them, who holds up the false Teachers, and false Worship, and who beat, stock, stone and persecute, and hale out of their Assemblies those who are sent by the Lord to speak his Word freely: With an Exhortation that they haste to meet the Lord by true repentance, by putting off the works of darkness, lest the Lord cut them assunder by his Sword, which is already drawn and put into the hands of his Servants. Also a word to my Brethren and Companions in tribulation in the King∣dom and Patience of Jesus Christ, who are by the World scornfully called Quakers. With the manner of my passage through the dark World, (wherein the simple ones may see the deceits of the man of sin in his actings like the true Spirit) to warn all to follow the true Light within, which leads unto God, and to beware of the Voice, Lo here, and Lo there. TO all you the Inhabitants of Underbarrow, (profane ones and Professors) you my Neighbours and Country men according to the flesh, (but Stran∣gers as in the spirit) to you all who are in the customary, formal, tra∣ditional Worship of Heathen, and under the barren, dry, and empty Ministry of Man, which stands in the will of man, and have proceeded out of the carnal inventions and imaginations of fallen man, and is not according to God, nor to the practice of the Saints in former Ages and Generations: To you all do I clear my conscience in the presence of God, by declaring to you in writing, being that I cannot have freedom (through the subtilty of the Serpent, who doth work alwayes to prevent the living Truth to be declared, and the deceits Act. 6. 58. from 51. of himself to be discovered and made manifest) to declare in word among you: I have been sent by the Lord, moved of him to come, and to declare to you the Word of the Lord, to the directing of your minds where to wait to attain the true Knowledge of the Lord, and to that one Thing needful, the Eternal welfare of your souls; and to lay open the deceits of the Serpent, who doth work in the cursed deceitful Ministry, which is upheld by you, whereby your souls are kept in the death, and only your dark minds fed and nourished by the painted and Serpent∣like expressions and declarations, coming out of the carnal wisdom and brain knowledge of your Hireling, who walks in the way of the false Prophets of Is∣rael, Isa. 56. 10, 11. which the true Prophet called greedy dumb Dogs: four several times hath the Lord by his Eternal Spirit working in me, moved me to come into the Congrega∣tion and Assembly, he himself is the Witness that I came not of man, nor by the will of man, but contrary to the will and desires of man, wherein stands the true Ier. 1. 6. Ionah , 3. Gal. 1. 1. Ministry of God, now as it was ever, the true Prophets, Ieremiah and Ionah wit∣nessed the same, and the Apostle Paul, and as it is known to you unto whom I
speak, that I could not have liberty to declare to you the Truth from God, who came not to you with entising words, neither what I had gathered out of Scrip∣ture from without me, neither to speak my own imaginations and conceivings, as your false Hireling doth, but to declare the Word of the Lord, to the convin∣cing your dark understandings, that you might see the deceits by which you are, and have been led, that your souls might have been redeemed up to God, out of the imagined worships of the World, to worship in Spirit and in Truth: Hear ye the Word of the Lord ye people, all your carnal traditional Ordinances and Observances is abomination to the Lord, all your praying and praising is odious Isa. 66. 3. Ioh. 9. 21. Prov. 15. 9. in his sight, for all your worship is an imitation and an imagination of the dark mind of man, and was never commanded by God; therefore consider all ye people what you are doing, and reject not the Lord, nor his Everlasting Truth, but prize your time, and now seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon his name Isa. 55. 6. while he is near: Your souls are kept in the death under your dead Minister, and under his dead Doctrines, dead Reasons, Points and Uses, which he speakes from the Saints conditions and experiences, but is an enemy to the substance, and to them in whom the same conditions are made manifest in the power of Truth, and he doth make manifest himself to be in the same generation of them, who had the form of Godliness, but denies the Power; having the Letter as the Pharisees had, but persecuting the substance as they did: All people consider whether he be not in the generation professing God and Truth in Word as the Scribes and Pharisees were, but persecuting the Son of God, who is the Substance of Truth, where he Mat. 2. 5. is born and made manifest; he is in the generation of them who professed Abraham's freedom, and that God was their Father, but were of their father the Devil; for his workes they did; they said, and did not, as he doth, as it is made manifest, Ioh. 8. 44. Mat. 23. 3. 27. he is a whited Wall, a painted Sepulcher, which Christ the Son of God cryed wo against, who was and is the Light, by which all Deceivers, Hirelings and false Teachers are discovered, and cryed out against: The Light which is Christ do I witness to be made manifest in me from God the Father of Light, daily leading me up to him, to live in Purity and Uprightness, praises be to him for ever, in which Light I see your Teacher to be a Hireling, a greedy dumb Dog, seeking for his gain from his Quarter, one that God never sent, but hath run and was not sent, therefore doth he not profit you at all: and from this Light, which is Christ, do I declare against him, as knowing him that he hath not the Word of the Lord, but the Letter: Freely do I declare against him, as knowing him to be a Deceiver, and an An∣tichrist, being once I was deceived by him, but now through the rich Love of my Fa∣ther, who hath made himself known to me, & hath shined by his Eternal Light in my heart, do I see him and all such to be Antichrist, and no Minister of Christ; from the mouth of the Lord I do declare it, that you are led blindly by him; your blind Guide and you are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Living Truth by his Ministry: He layes heavy burdens upon you: He is in the generation of them who had the Law and Prophets, but persecuted him who came to fulfil the Mat. 2. 5. Law, and who hath the substance of the Prophets: He hath the Conditions and Experiences of the Saints in the Letter, but who are brought to witness the same Conditions and the same strait Way in which they walked: He is an enemy to all people, to you from God I do declare it, he is one that God never sent to speak his Word to you, he calls good evil, and evil good; and puts Light for Darkness, and Darkness for Light; and therefore wo is his Portion, and wo is the Portion Isa. 5. 20. Ier. 5. 31. of all that upholds him: What will ye do in the end thereof? He doth bewitch you to observe, That calling is an Ordinance of God, which he never command∣ed: Poor people! your souls lies in the death under the power of darkness and corruption, under your dead Minister, and under his dead carnal Observances; and your dark Minds, your Wit and Reason is only fed, and so the enemies of the Lord are strengthned by him, and you remain in ignorance and in blindness, and Ier. 23. 24. Ioh. 14. 6. cannot attain the true Riches; for Christ only is the Way to the Father, the Light in every man which leads to the Father; but this Light he denies as having enlight∣ened every one that comes into the World, as several times he hath done to me in
Argument: Here he makes Christ a Lyar, and doth not know the first Principle of Religion, nor the Light which leads unto God, but is a Heathen, and knows not God; for this is the Light which all the Servants of God in all Generations wit∣nessed, and which Light we do now witness, praised be the Lord for evermore, who hath in his Light led us to himself, and hath shewed the deceits of him to us, and of all such as he is; he is in the generation shutting the Kingdom of Heaven against men, neither entring himself, nor suffers others to enter that are entring: Mat. 23. 13. Through the Power of the Lord made manifest, am I bold to declare against him, who walks not in the Doctrine of Christ, and therefore is an Antichrist, and doth deceive you, professing himself to be sent of God, and walking contrary to the Truth of God; a Hypocrite, saying, and not doing: Ye my Country men, be not deceived by him, try him by the Scriptures, & see how he walks according to the Declaration, as they did who were Ministers of Christ, not by the will of man; but his Ministry is by man, and according to man, and had his Call from man, as it is known to you all; but they who were true Ministers witnessed the contrary, neither received they their Gospel from man, but by the revelation of Jesus. The true Mi∣nisters Gal. 1. 1. 12. of Christ, sent sorth by Christ, witness now the same thing, for Christ is the same that ever he was, which is now made manifest in the Saints, and his Mini∣stry is the same, which is not by man, but contrary to man; be not deceived, God Gal. 6. 7. Mal. 4. 1. will not be mocked, for he is terrible, and his day is powerful and dreadful, that shall come upon the Heathen, and upon the workers of Iniquity, and upon all Dissemblers and Hypocrites, all your carnal Worship, and Ordinances, and Obser∣vances, is but mocking of God, and dissembling with him, and is but an imitation & an imagination of the Mind of fallen man, imitated by you and your Minister, droven by the imaginations from the true Worship of God, which the Saints in former generations was exercised in, who were led, not by imagination, as you are, but by the Spirit of God, as all the servants of God are: Now as ever was, true Baptism I own, which is by the holy Ghost and with Fire, and Mat. 3. 1. the Baptism with one Spirit into one Body do we witness; but that which your Chief Priest and false Hireling holds up, I deny it; it is not of God, but is an imitation, and is abomination in the sight of God; and therefore from God do I Declare against it, and against your Hireling that upholds it among you. True Communion of Saints I own, for we have Union, and the Bread which we break is the body of Christ; and the Cup which we drink is the Blood of Christ, by 1 Cor. 10. 14. Ior. 6. 53. which we are nourished and fed up to Eternal Life; for he that eats not Christ's Flesh, and drink his Blood, he hath no life in him; he among you that can receive it let him, but your Communion I deny, for it is Heathenish, and no more but an imitation, having proceeded out of the imagination of the Proud: Your break∣ing of Bread and drinking of the Cup, is abomination; and God never com∣manded it, and this doth your Pharisee uphold, sitting in the seat of Christ, and of the Saints, as the Pharisees did in Mose's seat, saying, and not doing: True singing 1 Cor. 14. 15. Eph. 5. 19. Rev. 14. 3. Isa 35. 10. I own, with the Spirit and with Understanding, singing in the Spirit, making Melody in the heart to the Lord, this singing was and is among the Saints in the Church of Christ, this is well pleasing to God, for it is not an imitation, nor by tradition, as your singing is, but it is true Sacrifice, the song of the redeemed ones, which none can learn but the redeemed ones of the Lord, who is come and coming to Zion with songs and everlasting Joy upon their heads; but your singing is Carnal, Traditional, and Heathenish, and is an Imitation, and is not with the Spirit of Jesus; but with the spirit of the World, with the spirit of Drunkards, Swearers, Lyars, Mockers, Scorners, Coveteous ones, with the spirit of Wrath, Envy, Malice, with the spirit of Cain, with the spirit of the Scribes and Pharisees, and chief Priests, who persecuted the Saints which sang in Truth in former Ge∣nerations, and now the deceit is turned into the form of singing, and they that live there persecutes them that sings in the Power; for thus it was ever, they that Amos 6. 5. lived in Profession of the Word outwardly, persecuted them that lived in the Pow∣er of which was professed, and there you and your Hireling is; but know, that the Lord will take an account of you, and give unto every man his reward accor∣ding Rom 2. 6.
to his deeds: You and your Priest have got the form of Baptism, of the Com∣munion, of Singing, and of a Church; but the Power and Substance of these Ordinances you know not, for they are hid from all vulturous eyes, and from the generation of the Pharisees, and Serpents, who are called of men Master, and which have the chief place in the Assemblies, as your Hireling hath, and who is called of men Master, as they were which Christ cryed Wo against: True preach∣ing of Jesus Christ Crucified we own, and do witness, for the preaching is out of Mat. 5. the will of man, out of Form and Custom, and is foolishness to the wisdom of the World; now, as it was ever, this is not with the inticing words of mans wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power, and the preaching of the Word of Faith, which is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart, that preaching we do 1 Cor. 1. 18. 21. 1 Cor. 2. 4. Rom 10. 8. 17. own, for Faith comes by the hearing of this Word preached: And the Prayer with the Spirit of Truth we do own, for that is not in word to be seen of men, but led to that, not by Custom, Form, and Tradition, but by the Eternal Spirit, which proceeds from God, which hath free recourse to God, which God heareth and doth accept; for their iniquity is purged out of the heart, and is not regarded, for he that regards iniquity in his heart, God will not hear his Prayer; but the Isa. 66. 18. Preaching and Praying of your Hireling I do deny, for they are abomination to the Lord, for his preaching leads from God, stands in his own Will, in his own Time, in Form, Custom and Tradition, and your souls are not refreshed by it, neither is true Faith known among you, for how can he being evil speak good things? A corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good fruit, said he, who cryed Wo unto Mat. 12. 34. Mat. 7. 18. them that said, and did not, in which generation he is; how can he teach and direct towards true Religion? being he denies the Corner Stone, the first Principle of Religion which is the Foundation, which no other can any lay, the Light of God, 1 Cor. 3. 11. which hath enlightened every one that comes into the World, which he denies to Ioh. 1. 9. have enlightened every one: Poor people! I do pitty your souls (God is my witness) to see you lie in darkness, in ignorance, and blindness, and in deadness, under your dead Hireling, and under his dead traditional Preaching; your wisdom, reason, and dark minds is only fed and strengthned by his preaching, and you all are but building upon the Sand, hearing but not doing, and we, who have suffered the loss, and have witnessed the destruction of that building, do Mat. 7. 29. now Declare freely against it where it is standing, for we know the depth, height, and breadth of all your profession, and of all your carnal Worship, and Observances; and the Word of God is as a fire, which will burn up, and as a hammer, which will beat down all your imagined Worships and carnal Ier. 23. 29. Ordinances: And his Praying is abomination to the Lord, for it is as theirs was which the Son of God cryed Wo against, which stood Praying in the Synagogues, and which made long Prayers, and the Praying of all such we do Deny, for their Prayers is as the Scribes and Pharisees was, who were called of men Masters, as Mat. 6. 5. they are now, and who were sayers and not doers, as your Hireling is; therefore all you people consider, and diligently weigh these things: If I declare unto you the Truth, own it without respect of Persons; If I speak a Lye, let me be ac∣counted as accursed for ever; and all you simple ones, who are seeking the living among the dead, who are in the simplicity, seeking after the Truth, and yet are bewitched to observe that which God never commanded, and to seek God in that Luk. 24. 5. Ioh. 14. 6. Way which he was never found in, for Christ alone is the Way to the Father, and he is but one from generation to generation, in all generations; for your sakes do I lay open the deceits of your Hireling and chief Priest, who is in the way of Ba∣laam, following the wages of unrighteousness, and do advise you as from the Mouth of the Lord, to cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, and to cease from all your customary carnal observances, which God never commanded, but is only Isa. 2. 25. an imitation and an imagination; your souls are kept in death, under the power of Corruption, Pride, Drunkenness, Coveteousness, Oppression, and Earthly∣mindedness, Wontonness, and the lustful Nature ruling is head in you, and a∣mong you are that generation that draws neer God with their mouths, but your Isa. 29. 13 Ezek. 33. 31 hearts goes after Covetousness, and are far from the Lord; ye worship an un∣known
god, and are Persecutors of the true God, and of his Servants, as ever it was in all generations by Priest and People, as it is now with you and your Priest, they that professed Truth in word, persecuted them that witnessed the Pow∣er, the horrible filthy Thing is committed among you, and you love to have it so, but what will you do in the end thereof? you are in the generation of your Ier. 5. 31 Luk 6. 26. fore-fathers, who spoke good of the false Prophets, but persecuted the true Pro∣phets; so it is now among you, he that hath the Word of the Lord from the Mouth of the Lord to declare unto you, him you revile, and mock and scorn, and per∣secute, but he that speaks the imaginations of his own heart from the Saints condi∣tions, him you own and hear, and here you shew your selves to be them which Christ spoke of which would receive them that come in their own name, but will not receive him that cometh in the Name of his Father: Repent, and turn to the Ioh. 5. 43. Ezek. 14. 9. Pro. 21. 15. Amos 5. 18. Lord, lest his Judgments come upon you and destroy you with an utter destructi∣on; the Day of the Lord is terrible and dreadful, which will come upon the wick∣ed, and upon all the Workers of Iniquity: Be ashamed ye Heathens, you main∣tainers of the greedy dumb Dogs, and upholders of the horrible filthy Thing, the persecutors of the righteous Seed, the contemners of the just, the generation of Serpents, who cryes, let Barrabas go free; ye generation of Hypocrites, who pro∣fesses Mat. 23. God, but persecutes the Son of God where he is made manifest, of this Ge∣neration in which you are shall all the Righteous Blood-shed be required even Isa. 25. 6. Mal. 1. 1. from Abel? Repent, and cease from all your former wayes and doings, from Pride, Drunkenness, Coveteousness, and Oppression, from Lying, Swearing, from Mirth, and Wontonness, and vain Pleasures, for the Day of the Lord cometh that shall burn as an Oven, and the Proud, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble, fully dry, for the Lord will be avenged of his enemies, and render vengeance 2 Thess. 1. 8. Mal. 3. 2. Isa. 33. 14. Ier. 9. 25. Ier. 7. 20. Rev. 6. 16. in flames of fire upon all that know not God, and that obeys not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who can stand when he appears? Who can dwell with everlasting burnings? even he that doth righteously, and that is purged from iniquity: But then wo unto you all Hypocrites and Professors, and to the wick∣ed and prophane ones, ye shall all partake of the righteous Judgment, and drink of the Cup of the Lords Fury and Indignation, for your iniquities are seen, and your transgressions are not covered from the Lord; all your Profession will not hide you from the presence of the Lamb, for in your Sacrifices are found deceit, and in your Offerings lodges iniquity, the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it; there∣fore be ashamed of all your profession, and of all your Glorious Carnal Ordi∣nances; for the Lord is coming to uncover you, and to make you and your pro∣fain Hireling manifest, for God is Pure and Holy, and no iniquity dwells with Hab. 1. 13. Psal. 102. 7. Mic. 3. 11. Ier. 23. 31. him, nor none that works wickedness, therefore stop thy mouth thou Hireling, who preacheth for hire, and divines for money; and leans upon the Lord, and useth thy tongue, and saith, he saith it, when the Lord never spoke to thee: Thou art in the Generation of the Scribes and Pharisees; and be ashamed ye upholders of him, for now every Tree that brings not forth good fruit, must be hewen down, the Lord hath said it; his Word is as a Fire, which will burn up all the wicked; his Mat. 3. 10. Word is sharper then a two edged Sword, which will cut down and wound the head of the wicked; ye Mockers and Scorners, ye Swearers and Lyars, ye Proud and Heb. 4. 12. Coveteous ones, ye Merry-hearted and Wonton ones, dreadful is the Day that shall come upon you, the Lord will make his Power known, and Glorifie himself in your destruction, except you repent and turn to the Lord: Ye hard heart∣ed ones and rebellious ones, the Plagues of God is to rest upon you, therefore Ioel 2. 2, to 12. Exod. 7, 8, 9, Chap. Rev. 14. 7. prize your time, and repent, and fear the Lord God Almighty, and lay aside your vain wicked wayes, and confess your sins, and forsake them, for such shall find Mercy, All ye People, mind the Light of God within you, and hearken to that which shews you what is sin, and evil, which shews you your proud minds, your Pro. 28. 13. Ioh 1. 5, 9. Ioh. 8. 12. Ioh. 11. 9, 10. carnal coveteous desires and affections, which checks and reproves you for your ungodly deeds; this Light shines in Darkness, but the Darkness cannot com∣prehend it: This is the Light which hath enlightened every one that cometh into
the World, which Light is Christ, he that follows this Light walks not in dark∣ness, but hath the Light of Life; he that hates this Light stumbles, and walks in darkness, ignorance, and blindness, as you do, turning the Grace of God into wantonness, which same Grace is the Saints Teacher, this is the free Grace of Iude 1. 4. Tit. 2. 11. God which hath appeared to all men, which in all Generations taught the Saints to deny ungodiness and worldly lusts, and led them into purity and holiness: This Grace do we witness, praised, praised be the Lord, to be led by it, which ever was the Saints Leader; and through the teaching of this Grace do we deny your Hireling, and all such Pharisees and Hypocrites, who makes a prey upon the poor people; and if you stop not into their mouths, they even prepare War Ezek. 34. from 2. to 9. Mic. 3. 5. against you, as the false Prophets of Israel did; and daily are we taught by it in the Wayes of God to do his service, praised be the only Lord of Glory for ever more, who hath gathered us up to himself (to be taught alone by his Grace) out of the mouth of your Hireling, who once made a prey upon us, but Eternal Praise and Glory to our God, who in his Light hath discovered unto us his nakedness and his shame, his hypocrisie and deceit, in the Eternal Light of God do we see him, and all such to be blind Guides, and leads the poor blind people in darkness and ignorance, and none is able to come to the true Knowledg of the Eternal Truth in his Ministry, for he is no Minister of God, but an Antichrist, denying Christ to be come in the flesh, denying the Light to have enlightened eve∣ry Ioh. 1. 7. one, as several times he hath done to me; but my Father who is Light and Glory, hath now made him manifest: And in that Light Christ Jesus, do I see him to be one who hath run, whom God hath not sent, therefore doth he not profit you at all, nor puts no difference between the precious and the vile in you, nor leads you to discern the clean from the unclean, the pure from the impure in you, but speaks the Divination of his own brain, feeding your dark minds, and Ezek. 22. 6. from the Eternal Light made manifest in me from God the Father (who is over all, and above all) do I declare against him, and against all Hirelings and greedy dumb Dogs, that seeks for their gain from their Quarter, as he doth, fely Is. 56. 10, 11. do I declare, as knowing them to be Deceivers and blind Guids: For the simple ones sake among you, who are insnared and kept in ignorance by him under his dead, dry, barren, sloathful Ministry; Repent ye people, who lies in the Cap∣tivity of Babylon, under your Bahylonish Merchant, now is the Lord leading his Rev. 13. 10. Sons and Daughters out of Egypt out of bondage, and now he that hath led Cap∣tive is led into Captivity, praised and honoured be the God of Saints for evermore, who hath redeemed us out of the mouth of your Idol-shepherd, (who feeds himself Ezek. 34. 2 Cor. 4. 6. with the fat) and who hath enlightened our dead Consciences, and hath shined in our hearts, in his Eternal Light, and of this have I received freely, and from this do I let forth freely, to the laying open the deceits of your Hireling. Now is the Day of your visitation, wherein the Saviour of the World stands at the door and knocketh, if any open unto him he will come in; therefore prize Rev. 3. 20. Col. 3. 8, 9. your time, and hear the Word of the Lord, and lay aside the works of dark∣ness, Lying and Swearing, Mocking and Scorning, and beating of your fellow Servants: Wo unto you ye Strikers, who hardens your hearts against the Lord, Mat. 24. 48 to 51, and against those who declare to you the wickedness of your wayes; the Lord will come when you are not aware, and give you your Portion with Hypocrites and Unbeleevers, and cast you into utter darkness: Repent. and turn to the Lord Ioel 2. 12. your God with mourning and lamentation, and cease from all your former wayes and doings; cease from Coveteousness and Opression, ye aged people; and cease Na. 1. 16. from Lightness, Vanity, and Pride, ye young people; and from all your Priests and Steeple-houses, for there your Lightness, Pride, and Vain minds are fed and nourished, and the enemies of the Lord are strengthened. Dear people, there had I once fellowship with you in your Pride, Lightness, and Vanity, and there was once my joy and delight; but now am I chosen by the Lord out of all these things, praised be him for ever, to serve the Lord, in declaring against all these abominations, in whom they are standing; For, wo unto the proud and Isa. 2. 12. light vain minds, who are tripping upon the mountains, and whose hearts are
not subject to the Lord; against all these abominations, do I Declare as from the Lord, and do advise you as from him, to depart out of these abominations, for the day is coming when you must be separated from all your lovers, a day of dark∣ness and misery; therefore prize your time, and hearken unto the Light of God within you, which reproves you for your filthy and ungodly deeds and words; Ioel 2. 2. 1 Iohn 1. 7. Ioh. 4. 24. 1 Thess. 1. 1. this Light will lead you to God, out of all filthiness, obeying it; this will separate the clean from the unclean in you, and will lead you to be taught of God, and to have unity with God, and with the Saints; for it was in the Light that the Saints had unity; this Light will lead you out of your hypocritical and deceitful carnal Worships, to Worship in Spirit and Truth; this Light will lead you to the true Baptism, out of your deceitful imitation of a Baptism, which your Hireling up∣holds among you; this Light will lead you to the true Church in God out of your formal imagined Church, and to the true Communion of Saints, and true Sing∣ing to God, out of your Heathenish Communion and Singing: Therefore all ye people mind the Light, for the Light hath enlightened every one, which is the Saviour and Reedemer of him that loveth it, and bringeth his deeds to it, but is the Condemnation of him that hateth it, and walks not in it; therefore all peo∣ple Iohn 3. 19. mind this Light which is of God, this will lead you up to God; this is the way to the Father, and none comes to the Father but by me, said he, who was, and is the Light; this Light loving it, and walking in it, will free you from all the burdens Iohn 14. 6. Mat. 23. 4. which the Pharisee layes upon you, and from all the taxes of Pharaoh's Tax-mast∣ers, and will lead you into the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, to know him who is invisible, and is present every where, yet hidden from all dark minds, who lives in the imaginations and imitations, as you and your Hireling doth: If you love this Light and walk in this Light, it will bring you to be witnesses of the Scripture and of the Saints Conditions, which you are but talkers of; this is the Light from which they spoke that spoke the truth of God, and from this Light did Isaiah cry, who lived in the obedience of it, against the greedy dumb dogs, that Isa. 56. Ier 23. Ezek. 34. Mich. 3. Mal. 2. sought for their gain from their Quarter; and so did Ieremiah, Ezekiel, Micha, and Malachy cry against Hirelings, and against those that said, the Lord saith it, and he never spoke to them, and against them that preached for hire, and that divied for money, and that taught for the Fleece, and yet leaned upon the Lord as your Pharisee doth, saying, Is not the Lord among us? And from this same Light do we declare against all such, and seeth them to be abomination to the Lord now, as they did then, praised, praised, be the Lord for ever, for now the abominations of the Whore is made manifest that sitteth upon many waters, that hath made all Nations drunk with the Wine of her fornication, and now is the Rev. 17. 1, 2, 3. Judgment of the Whore come, and the day wherein she must reckon to drink the wine of the Wrath of God; and he who was and is this Light cryed Wo against them that said, and did not; and against them that had the chiefest places in the Mat. 23. Assemblies, and that were called of men Masters: This same Light do I witness to be made manifest from God the Father of Light, and am not ashamed to de∣clare it before men; for, he that denies Christ before men, he must be denyed by Mat. 10. 33. Acts. 26. 24. Christ before the Father; and this Light lived the Saints in, and spoke from, who were called Mad-men, and deceivers of them that professed Truth in Word, but persecuted them in whom the Son was born and made manifest, in which Genera∣tion you and your Priest daily makes manifest your selves to be; therefore repent, and come down ye high minds and lifted up spirits, for the Lord is against you, and hearken to the Light of God in you, and wait in it according to measure, and cease from all your formal, customary, traditional worshipping, and from all your dumb Teachers, who are Antichrists, and denies the Light, as having enligh∣tened every one; this Light is the only Way to the Father, which all must (who Iohn 14. 6. 1 Iohn 2. 10, 11. comes to God) follow and walk in, for he that walks not in this Light, walks in darkness, and stumbles, and knows not whither he goes; and there are all Priests and People in darkness and ignorance, who walks not in this Light; therefore love the Light and obey it, it will separate you from all filthiness and corruption, and lead you into purity and holiness, without which none shall see God, and
here is your Teacher alwayes present with you, which teaches to deny ungodli∣ness, and the wicked wayes of this World; he who walked in this Light, by this Light saw all the World to lie in wickedness, but said they were of God, and all that were of God heard them who dwelt in the Light, but he who disobeyes this 1 Ioh. 5. 19. 1 Ioh. 4. 6. Light, follows the blind Guides of the World as you do, and sets up Teachers to themselves, having iching ears, and that ministry is of man, and by man called to the ministry by the earthly Powers, by earthly Magistrates, or at Oxford, Cam∣bridge, 2 Tim. 4. 3. or Newcastle, all this ministry, who is here called, is by man, and their gospel is of man, which the true Gospel is not, and he that hath the Word of God to declare from God, his call is not by man, neither doth he go to man to be ap∣proved; for he that preacheth the true Gospel, consulted not with flesh and blood, Gal. 1. 16. and so it is now, the same thing do we witness, and to be Ministers of the everlast∣ing Gospel, called not by man, but by God; praised be the Lord for ever, from Generation to Generation, who hath revealed himself unto babes, and hath hid himself from the Wise and Prudent of this World; stop your mouthes ye Mini∣sters, which is by man, which Gospel is according to man, for now the Lord is Mat. 11. 25. arising, whose Angel is gone forth preaching the everlasting Gospel: Sing praises to the Lord for ever ye Redeemed ones, who are brought from under the empty, Rev. 14. 6. dead, deceitful Ministry, which is by man, to be true witnesses of the true Mi∣nistry which is of God: Therefore be ashamed ye upholders of the deceitful Mi∣nistry, which is but the Ministry of witchcraft, by which your eyes are dark∣ned, Nahu. 3. 4. and under which your souls doth lie in blindness and ignorance under the power of witchcraft and sorceries. Be confounded ye Back-sliders, who once heard the Word with joy, and re∣ceived it; who were once among us, yet not of us; who hath chosen the glory of this World rather then the everlasting Truth, and hath fold your birth-right of the Everlasting Inheritance, for the satisfying of your earthly minds, with Mat. 13. 20. the earthly treasures: Hear the Word of the Lord ye sloathful servants, who not abiding to wait upon God, eats and drinks with the Drunkards, and beats your fellow-servants, and are now become Haters, Mockers, and Revilers, suddenly will the Lord come and cut you all assunder, and give you your Portion Mat. 24. 48. to the end. Psal. 50. 22. in the Lake that burns with fire, except you repent: Repent you Back-sliders, and consider ye that forget God, now while you have time, before the Lord wear in his wrath that ye shall not enter; hearken to that which convinceth you of your filthiness, the Light of God within you, which shall eternally witness us to be true, which Light shall be your Condemnation, because you love darkness ra∣ther Iohn 3. 19. 2 Pet. 2. 20, 22. than Light; ye are returned with the Dog to his vomit, and with the Sow to the wallowing in the mire, your latter end is worse then your beginning, and the Parable is fulfilled upon you, for lying against the Truth will the Lord plead with you, and wo will be your Portion for ever, for the Lyars shall not enter into the Kingdom of God; therefore all people fear the living God, and prize your time, and see where you are, his servants you are unto whom you do obey; all Rev. 21. 1. Rom. 6. 16. Rom. 2. 6. Luke 6. 2. must give an account to the living God, and must receive according to what is done in the body; in such an hour will the Master come which you are not aware of, and will take account of your stewardship, for God hath given unto every one a Talent; therefore spend not away your time in wickedness, and in a deceitful Profession of God, feeding your dark minds with the dead formal Preaching, of your dead carnal blind Pharisee, but hearken to the Light of God within you, and improve every one his Talent; the good and faithful servant improves his to the honor and riches of his Master, but the sloathful servant hides his in the earth, Mat. 25. 20, 21, 24, 25. living in the filthiness, saying he hath no power; now see which servant you are, and read your selves within, how you stood covered, in the presence of the living God, for wo unto him that is covered but not with the Spirit of the Lord; the Isa. 30. 1. servants of God brings forth fruit unto God, bears the image of their Father; and the servants of the Devil brings forth fruits of darkness, and bears the image 1 Cor. 11. 7. Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. of the Devil, which is glorious to the carnal eye, and feeds the carnal mind: The Seed of the Woman is but one in all generations, and the Seed of the Serpent
is but one, which ever was, is ruling and reigning in the Children of Disobedi∣ence, who are disobedient to the Light of God within them; and betwixt these two Seeds is Enmity, the one against the other, each Seed is known by its fruit; Gen. 3. 15. the old bottle pours out old Wine, the new bottle new Wine; therefore all people sink down to within, and call in all your wandring thoughts, imaginations and Mat. 12. 34. affections, and desires, and see which seed is head in you, and see what your desires and affections goes out after, for where your hearts are, there is your treasure; see what you do possess of God in your Souls, and what you are made witnesses of, for he that believeth hath the witness in himself, and Faith is the Victory over the world, he that can receive it, let him: Dear people, I have freely Declared to 1 Ioh. 5. 10. and vers. 4. you the Truth, and from the love of God shed abroad in my heart to your Souls, and for the Seed sake in you, which lieth in death, captivated under your Wisdom and Reason, have I spoken the Word of the Lord, which if you own it, and abide in it, shall be the savor of Life, and in eternal joy shall you witness me to be true in what I have Declared; but if you harden your hearts, and kick against the Truth; and against what I have Declared, shall be the savor of death unto Death, and in eter∣nal torment and misery shall ye witness me in what I say, for to that which should exercise the Conscience do I speak in every one of you, and to that in you have I cleared my Conscience, and have freed my Spirit; this is the day of your Visitation, the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it: Remember that you have been shewed the Deceits which you live in, and have been warned of the misery and desolation that shall come upon you, except you lay these things to heart, and turn to the Lord. Farewel. By him who is dispised, and had in derision among you, who is not greater then his Lord, and therefore is contented to be called a Blasphemer and a Seducer, as he whom I serve was, by them of your Generation. E. B. TO all you my Country people of every degree, who are Inhabitants in Under∣barrow have I cleared my Conscience, and have freely Declared to you the Word of the Lord, and have laid open the Deceits of your Deceitful Ministry and Ministry, and have directed you to that in every one of you which leads unto God, and which is the way to the Father, which is the true Light which hath enlightned every one that comes into the World, which light all who loves and follows, walk not in darkness, but walks up to God out of the Fall, from under the Curse, into the Being, but all who hates this Light, and follows the imagina∣tion of their own brains, and of the divination of their Hirelings and Phari∣sees, this Light shall be their condemnation, because they walk not in it; even this Light, which is come into the World in every man, even the witness in the Conscience which is placed by God, shall for ever witness against you, and against all your false worships and Hirelings, and shall bear testimony to what I have in this little Volume declared to be true, when the Book of Conscience shall be laid open, for to every mans Conscience am I made manifest in what I have to you declared as concerning your Hireling, whom God hath never sent, but is in the way of the false Prophets and Pharisees, for he that abides not in the Doctrine of Christ hath not God, 2 Iohn 1. 9. but is an Antichrist, and of the Devil. And as concerning the Light within you, that Light will bear witness to it self, that every one of you to whom I speak, hath this Light, which shews you sin, your lying, swearing, pride, and wicked wayes, covetousness and wantonness to be sin: this is the true Light, which is, as ever was, foolishness and a stumbling block to the wise ones: This is the Light which your Pharisee denies to have lightned every one, and this Light shall for ever witness me to be true, and shall witness this poor people among you who are despised and contem∣ned by you, and scornfully called Quakers, to be the servants of God, whom I do own as my Brethren in the sufferings of Jesus, who are my joy in the Lord. Now all people every where, to you all, a word from the Lord, though I have spoken in
this small Volume, as moved by the Lord of Heaven and Earth, to the Inhabitants of Underbarrow, as declaring against their false Teacher, and false Worships which they uphold: now freely and plainly do I declare against all thy Teachers, O England, who are one in the same generation with him in the Seat of Christ, and of his Apostles, professing themselves to be sent of God, but walking contrary to his commands, in the same footsteps which the Scribes and Pharisees walked in, which were persecutors of the Son of God; and which he cried wo against, they who said and did not, as all these thy Teachers do, who are called of men Masters as they were, and have the chiefest places in the Assemblies as they had, and prayed standing, as these thy professed Ministers do: Now the same Light which ever was, which is Jesus Christ, is now born and made manifest, which is witnessed among the Saints, in which Light I see all thy Teachers, O England, to be drunk with the Wine of her that hath deceived the Nations, who sits upon a scarlet coloured Beast, and is arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones, and hath the golden cup in her hand full of abominations, whose name is written in her forehead, Mystery Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlots, and abomination of the Earth: And in this Light to I declare against them all which are in the generation of the false Prophets of Israel, which seeks for their gain from their Quarter, and which steals the word from their neighbor, and have taken the words of the Prophets of Christ and of his Apostles and selleth the divination of their own brain upon the Scriptures, (which the holy men speak forth freely to the poor blind people) and teacheth for the Fleece; and if ye stop not into their mouths, they prepare War against you, and which are called of men Master, which Christ forbids: Against all these freely (as from the Lord) I do Declare to be no Ministers of Jesus Christ, but are Seducers, and blind Guides, and are Antichrists, and leads the poor blind people in the wayes of death and destruction; for they are no Ministers of Christ that abides not in the Do∣ctrine of Christ: these have run, but have not been sent by God, and therefore is not your Souls profited by them, but are in the dark heathenish nature, as by your fruits it made manifest, leaning in the imaginations, and not in the counsel of the Lord, and in lying, swearing, drunkenness, covetousness, and oppression, and according to the course of this world; these iniquities are ruling among People; Priests, and Rulers in this Nation, from the least of them even to the greatest, every one is given too covetousness, from the Prophet even to the Priest, every one deals falsely: All your Hirelings and greedy dumb Dogs I do deny, and all who are of God denies all such, and are taught of God in the ways of God, which ever the world derided: All thy Teachers, O England, is denied of them who are taught of God, and whose Teacher is the Anointing, needs not any man to teach them: And by thy Teachers who are in the way of the Pharisees, art thou blindly led in the ways of darkness and ignorance, and all thy carnal worship, which is in every part of thee upheld, which is to Read, Sing, and Preach upon the Saints Conditions, which were witnesses of God: All this I do deny and freely declare against as from the mouth of the Lord, to be no worship of God, but imagination, and an imitation of the Worship of God: And the li∣ving eternal God of Heaven and Earth is but mocked by you, in your imagined worship, for your reading of anothers condition, and singing of that which you live not in, and preaching that which is gathered from without by imagination, and conceiving upon that which the Prophet Prophesied, or which Christ spoke, who was, and is the Substance, and which the Apostles witnessed; this is carnal and heathenish, and was never commanded by the Lord, nor is no worship of the true God, and against this worship I do from the Lord declare, as in the eternal Light of God seeing it, to be deceitful and abomination to the Lord, being I am Re∣deemed up to God by his eternal Spirit, and to worship in Spirit and in Truth, and not limitted to a day, place, or time; neither at Ierusalem, nor in this Mount, &c. and am freed and redeemed out of this fallen mans invention and tradition, which is but Cains sacrifice, which God doth not accept, but is abomination in his sight, praised be the Lord for evermore. And O England, I do declare against all these
thy Teachers, and against this all thy Worship, as from the mouth of tbe Lord, as moved of the Lord to speak this word unto thee, Thou hast spent thy money, this many Generations, for that which is not bread, and thy labour for that which doth not satisfie thee, all thy imagined formal Worships and carnal Traditions and Ordinances of man is the Lord risen in his Servants to declare against: And the same Light which ever made manifest deceitful Worships, and the deceitful Hire∣lings, and them that cryed Peace, peace to the people when the Lord spake no peace, is now risen and speaketh in thy ears; O Nation, the same everlasting Light which the true Prophets lived in, who cryed against them that sought for their gain from their quarter, and that cryed against the horrible filthy thing which is upheld in thee; O England, this same Light is made manifest in the despi∣sed People, called Quakers, in this North part of the Nation: O People your Teachers have beguiled you, and have taught for the Fleece, and fed themselves with the fat, but your souls are hungred by them; for they are in the Generation of them that said and did not, they love the Wages of unrighteousness, and fol∣lows the error of Balaam for Reward, and have devoured souls for dishonest Gain; but the only true God is arising to beat the Mountains to dust, and to cleave the Rocks assunder: In thee, O Land, will the Lord manifest his Power, and will stretch forth his Arm for the deliverance of his Chosen, and for the Redemption of his two Witnesses, which have layn slain in the great City in this Land, which they that dwell upon the Earth have rejoyced over, and made merry, and triumphed in their slaughter; the Lord is arising to require his Flock at the hands of the I∣dols-shepherds. O ye Idol dumb Shepherds, the Lord will be avenged upon you, for you have scattered the sheep of his pasture, and have fed your selves with them; the Lord of Hosts is grieved with you, and have shaken his hands at your dishonest Gain, and ye shall no longer wear Garments to deceive; ye have long deceived the simple by your lyes, and by your lightness, but now you are discovered and made manifest in the eternal Light of God, and the mystery of witchcraft is not hid now from the Saints: Therefore O England hear the Word of the Lord, Thy Prophets are light and treacherous Persons, thy Judges judges for Reward, and thy Priests preach for Hire, and thy Officers imprisons the Just, and thy Rulers are evening Wolves, which seeks for the Prey, and the Lord of Heaven and Earth is grieved with these things; therefore, O Land, tremble at the presence of the Lord God of Iacob, for Esau shall become a place for Dragons, and shall be dis-inhabited in the day of mourning, and lamentation is coming upon thee; for that which the Lord hath not planted will he pluck up, and every corrupt Tree shall be cast into the fire: All thy corrupt Judges, and Officers, and Rulers will the Lord cut off utterly from the face of the Earth, and will restore to his People Judges as at the first, and Councellers as at the beginning, the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it: Therefore, O Land, prepare to meet the Lord thy God by true repentance, by putting off the works of darkness; thy Pride and thy Oppression, O Nation, is seen by the Lord, and the cry of the Oppressed through thy pride and tyranny is heard in the ears of the Lord of Sabbath, and he will avenge the cause of the poor and needy that is Oppressed by Priests in their Tythes, by Lawyers in their Fees, and by Officers in their unrighteous dealing, and the Seed of Abraham shall go free, and Israel shall no longer be subject to Pharaoh, nor to his Tax-ma∣sters. O England in the North part of thee is the Light of God arisen, which shines clearly, and which discovers the abomination of thy Teachers and of thy Worship, and we are bold to declare against them, and against all thy corrupt Officers, Judges, and Rulers, and this Light shall shine through the Nation, and shall be spread over Kingdoms, and the fire is to be kindled which the Lord hath promised, which shall burn as an Oven, and the proud and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble: This fire shall proceed out of the mouth of the two Witnesses, as it did before they were slain, and shall devour the enemies of the Lord; the Sword of the Lord is drawn in thee, O Nation, and put into the hands of them which is hated and despised by the Rulers & Officers, which is scornfully called Quakers, but they shall conquer by the sword of the Lord, which the Lord hath put into their hands, over
Countries and Dominions: For, O Nation, the Lord is with them, and thy unjust Rulers and Officers cannot hurt them, not a hair of their heads shall perish without my heavenly Father: It is for a testimony of their Fathers love to them that they suffer shame and reproach, and some of them imprisonment by the unjust Rulers, and for a witness against them that some of them are brought before them, the Lord is chusing the weak things of this World, and he is making manifest his Counsels to Babes, and revealing his Counsel and eternal Truth to Children, and keeps his hidden Treasures from the eyes of the Wise, and vulturous ones, Praises, praises be to him for evermore: For the Lion of Judah is opening, and hath opened the Sealed Book, let all his Saints rejoyce for evermore. This is the day of thy Visitation, O Nation, wherein the Lord speaks to thee by the mouth of his Servants in word and writing, therefore return to the Lord thy God from whence thou art fallen: Now will the Lord gather his Jewels and Chosen ones out of thee, and will raise up the dead which lies slain under thy Teachers and Pharisees, which makes a prey upon the people, which was never sent by God to speak unto thee. O Land, Hear the Word of the Lord, Depart from all thy Teachers, for the Lord hath drawn his Sword, and lifted it up against the false Prophet, and the Vials of Indignation shall be poured upon him, and upon all that upholds him in his Whoredoms and Witchcraft, by which he deceiveth the simple; therefore lest thou be partaker of their Plagues, depart from them: And all people, mind that measure of Light within you, which the Lord hath lightened every one of you withal, for the Lord is risen to teach his people himself, and he is fulfilling his Prophesie in thy ears, O Nation, they shall teach no more every man his neigh∣bor and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord; for I will put my Law in thine inward parts, and write it in their hearts, Ier. 31. 33. The Lord is about his great and wonderful Work in thee, and all the Wars and Contentions in thee, O Land, hath but been a making way for this Work of the Lord, and hath not been the Work which the Lord hath purposed: This Work is made known to them that feareth the Lord, and abideth in his Counsel: The Lord will overturn, overturn the Nation, and will create new Heavens and new Earth, wherein shall dwell righteousness, in which all the Chosen of the Lord shall rejoyce for evermore; And all the Kings and Nobles shall cast down their Crowns before this Glory: And all the men of War shall lay down their Armour and Weapons of War: And Nation shall not lift up a Sword against Nation any more: For the Lord will establish Righteousness and Peace; this will the Lord bring to pass in thee, O England, through the destruction of that which now liveth, and through the Resurrection of that to Life which now lieth in Death: Hear, O Land, give ear, O People, for the Lord of Heaven and Earth is now turning the World up-side down, all old things shall pass away, all things shall become new by fire, and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of him shall be many; corrupt Judges and Officers will the Lord sweep away, and their name shall no more be found in the Nation, the fire is kindled and the sword is drawn, happy is he that keepeth himself from fighting against the Lord in this his Work, and happy are ye, O Brethren, that stands faithful to the end to see these things accomplished, great shall be the battel, it is now begun, many shall see death, and shall yet live to see these things. TO all the Despised and Contemned ones, who are Persecuted and shamefully entreated by the Generation of the Chief Priests, and by them who live in the highest Profession in the Word outwardly, ye who are the scorn of the Nation, and the derision of all the Heathen, and are called Quakers; you are my brethren, children of my Father, have been brought forth by the same Womb, and have sucked the same Breast; Ye are chosen out of the world, out of all worldly glories, and earthly excellencies, and are not of this world, and therefore the world hateth you, you are brought out of the broad way of the flesh, and are
separated from all the world in their ways, worships, and forms of religion, and are redeemed out of the mouths of all Idoll dumb Shepherds, and hath one Shep∣herd, and are gathered from all the mountains, and out of all the desolate dis∣inhabited places, and are come into the pleasant sheepfold, where is green pastures and fresh springs of living Waters: By Faith with Abraham are ye come out of your native Country from among your kindred, and out of your Fathers house: And with Moses have you forsaken the glory of Pharaohs house, and chosen rather to suffer affliction among the poor despised people, than to have enjoyed the pleasures of sin; but great shall be your reward ye Contemned ones, glory, and honor, and everlasting happiness is prepared for you, if you stand faithful to the end; the Lord is with you as a mighty terrible one; and therefore shall all your persecuters be ashamed and confounded; the sound of a trumpet is heard among you, which makes all Nations at a stand, and all the Heathen to wonder, and all the Rulers, Nobles, and chief Priests are in consultation, combining together to suppress the Army of the Lord of Hosts, which he is gathering together: fear not, nor be dismaid, for the sounding of your trumpet causes an alarum, and makes all the inhabitants of the Land to tremble, and all bows before the sound of it; for the sound of it is terrible to the Nations, to all Kingdoms and Dominions; the Lord of Heaven and Earth is your Captain, which rides upon the Clouds, and whose glory is above the World, and therefore in the battel shall you obtain the con∣quest, and all your enemies shall be put to flight, and one of you shall chase a thou∣sand, for he is with you who hath all power in his hand, and all your enemies are limitted by him; therefore be not discouraged at the raging and swelling words of your Adversaries, but be bold and valiant and faithful to him, for his is the victory, and by his own Right Hand will he get himself the victory: Ye are my fellow Souldiers; and fellow Members of the same body, and my joy in the Lord; stand faithfull to the Lord, and be bold and valiant for the Truth upon Earth, for you hath the Lord chosen of all the Families of the Earth to place his Name a∣mong you, and he will glorifie his Name by you, he will accomplish his Wonders, and make his power known, and the greatness of his Name in the sight of the Hea∣then; let all flesh be silent before him, and let all the Pharisees, and chief Priests, and the wise men of the earth stop their mouths before the Lord, for you have the word of the Lord, and you are made patakers of the everlasting wisdom; and are the beloved of God; for his eternal Son is born and brought forth among you, and therefore doth the wise men and chief Priests consult to take his life; but wo unto your Persecuters, for they are the seed of evil doers, and better it were that a milstone were hanged about their necks and they cast into the sea, for the Lord hath sought you to worship him, and he is worshipped by you in spirit and in truth, your sacrifice is accepted, and therefore they that are of Cains generation perse∣cutes you, seeking after your blood; you are made partakers of the blessing, and therefore doth Esau threaten your destruction; but your Preserver is the Lord of Hosts, and therefore shall all their consultations be disappointed: For wo unto them that digs deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and that takes counsel but not at the Lord; All ye my brethren, be ye faithful and obedient to him who hath called and chosen you out from among the heathen, out of all imagined wor∣ships, to worship in truth, serve the Lord in singleness of heart, and give up all to him freely to be ordered and disposed by him, and look not back at the glory of Sedom, nor at the riches of Egypt, but follow him who hath enlightened your dark understandings; and hath gathered you up by his eternal Light; walk in obedi∣ence to the Law of God, and to the Light made manifest, for the Kingdom of Hea∣ven is as a man travelling into a far Country, which hath given talents to his servants to improve; now all you my beloved ones, improve every one your talent that the Lord may receive his own with usury, that he may be glorified, and that you all may receive a reward; therefore all be bold and valiant in the truth, and fear not man, but fear the Lord God Almighty, and walk in the fear of the living God, and despise not the cross of Christ, but let the cross be your rejoycing, for through the cross is the power of the Lord made manifest: Rejoyce for ever
and be exceeding glad that you are counted worthy to suffer shame and reproach, and some of you imprisonment for the Truths sake: thus it was ever, he that was born after the flesh, persecutes him that's born after the Spirit; but be glad and re∣joyce in the Lord, for you hath he chosen and called even to shine as light in the dark world, and to be as a burthensom stone to the Nations; your fame is gone abroad through Nations, and because of the Man-child that is born is the Nations trou∣bled, and the chief Priests and Rulers combined together, but that the Lord may be glorified, and for your sakes will he scatter the proud in their imaginations; and will break in pieces the snares which the Pharisees and chief Priests have laid for your feet, and they shall be taken in their own craftiness, and fall into the pit which they have digged for you, for the Lord, who hath called you, will set you upon a rock, and will preserve you out of the mouths of cunning Wolves who devours souls for dishonest gain: Sing praises for ever to the Lord our God, who hath chosen us to make manifest his love and truth unto, and hath gathered us up out of the mouths of all Idol shepherds that made a prey upon us, and from all the mountains and hills where we were scateered in the cloudy and dark day, where we were devoured by the wild beasts, being without Shepherd and Sheepfold, but praises, glory, and honor for evermore that we are freed out of the cruelty of Pharaoh, and from under his tax-masters, which layes heavy burdens upon the peo∣ple; rejoyce and be glad in faithfulness and truth unto our King for ever, who is the Lion of the tribe of Iudah, who hath opened this book, and unlosed the seals, and hath led us to himself, and by suffering under all are we made Kings and Priests over all for evermore, he alone is worthy to be praised, who hath avenged us of our adversaries, and hath given her to drink of the wine of the wrath of God; who once made us drink of the wine of her Fornication; I am with you, you despised ones, and my prayers are for you, and the eternal glorious God of power be with you, and keep you in the middest of this crooked and perverse generation, for this generation seeks the blood of the Saints; the Beast, which was, is, and now makes war against the Lamb. E B. A true Declaration and a Discovery to all the World of my manner of Life; what I have been, and what now I am at present. I Was brought up by my natural Parents in the profession of Religion, according to the generality of this Nation, going one day in seven to hear a man Preach the Word, as they said to me, and to be exercised in the formal worship which was then upheld, to read and sing, and to rabble over a Prayer; but I was wanton and light, and lived in pleasure, without the fear of God, not knowing of God, but by hear-say and tradition: but when I grew up toward twelve years of age, something stirred in me, and shewed me, that there was a higher Religion than that I was exercised in; and then I inquired where the chiefest of the Presbyterian Priests preached, and would have gone some miles of a first day to have heard one of the best of them, which seemed liker truth than the other, and so I got up to be a Presbyterian, and followed the highest of the Priests and Professors of that form, and grew in favor with them, then some small of my vanity and lightness I left, and Pride grew up in me, for wisdom grew up in me; then some of my forer acquaintance began to scorn me, calling me a Round-head, and the like; and by my labouring here, I gathered knowledge in things without, but yet was ignorant of the living Truth: Then when I was about seventeen years of age, it pleased God to shew himself a little to me, and somthing struck me with terror, and when I had been praying, I heard the voice often, Thou art ignorant of God, thou knowest not where he is, nor what he is; to what purpose is thy Prayer? And so much fear and dread came upon me, and broke me off from praying many times, and trouble came thick into my mind, and fearfulness fell many times upon me, and I was struck off my de∣lights that I formerly loved, and what I had gathered in as of a god died; and I left off reading in the Scripture, for somthing shewed me that I was very ignorant,
and knew not the true God, and the beauty of all things vanished; And I went to some, asking, What God was, which was professed? for I said, I knew him not: but got no satisfaction from any. And I was much separated from the vain ways of the world, and from vain worldly people, and was made to reprove many, often for wickedness, in words and actions, and was much decided, and looked upon scornfully by many; and then the Preaching of them whom I had formerly much delighted in, was as withered and decayed; yet then it pleased the Lord to shew himself a little in love to me, and I had sweet refreshments coming in from him to my soul, and had joy and peace in abundance, and openings of the living truth in me, which the world knew not of, and the mystery of the Scripture was something opened, which before I knew nothing of, and I saw many glorious things in it, which lie hid under the letter; and I was in much rejoycing many times, and sang praise, for I was brought out of the Land of darkness, and could say, I was in the Light, and I grew up to know high things, but not knowing the Cross of Christ, I ran forth in my wisdom comprehending the mysteries of God, having a Light shined in me, and I grew up into notion, to talk of high things, for it was my delight to comprehend in my busie mind; thus being ignorant of the Cross to keep low in it, I ran before my Guide, up into comprehension, and then was I above many of the Priests and Professors, and followed only to hear the highest Notionists, that Preached high things, but the fleshly man was at liberty, and so I became one of them in their discoursings, and was looked upon by them to know much; the former terrour was gone, and I had got up from under the judgement, and now pride grew more than ever, and self-conceitedness and presumption, and fleshly liberty to the carnal mind, and my delight was much in discoursings, where I played the Halot, and the Prodigal, and gave holy things unto Dogs, and cast Pearls before Swine, (for wisdom was hid from me) and here I lived pleasantly, for I had the true God, and the true Truth in my comprehension, which by my wisdom in the Light I had comprehended, and I had the world in my heart, Pride, Covetousness, and the earthly spirit ruled, and my delight was grown up to that, which once I had no delight in, and the beauty of things grew up, which seemed to be vanished; here I was un from my Husband after other Lovers, and had left the Lord my Maker, who had so graciously made manifest himself unto me, and had spent my portion a∣mong harlots; but I became to be darkned, and had lost that which once I had, and had but in memory that which before I had injoyed, could tell of Experiences, but they were dead to me; and somthing within me began to question how it was with me; for I saw my self to be ignorant more than formerly, and I saw I knew nothing; something desiring in me to be from whence I was come, but I grew to be much given to the world to seek after riches, and glory in it; and I fed my self with what I had formerly enjoyed, and said, Whom God loves once, he loves for ever: (but that was then head, and ruled in me, which he loved never) I was wanton, and lived in the lustful nature, among heathens, crucifying the Lord of Life, but the blood of that which I had slain cried continually, and the witness which lay slain, would give me no rest, which the earthly made merry over; and I grew to be weary of hearing any of the Priests, though never so high, for something, which shined deep in me, shewed me ignorance in all profession, and I was put to a stand many times in my self at those things, which were come to pass; then it pleased the Lord to send his true and faithful Servant and Messenger, who is called according to the flesh, G. Fox, he spoke the language which I knew not, notwithstan∣ding all my high talking, for it was higher, and yet lower: And it pleased the Lord to speak to me by him, that I was in the prodigal state, and above the Cross of Christ, and not in the pure fear of the Lord, but full of corruption and the old nature, though I had professed freedom, yet it was but such as the Jewes profes∣sed; for I saw my self to be in bondage to my own Will, and to my own Lust; and through the Word of the Lord spoken to me by him, I began to see my self (the witness being raised) where I was, and what I had been doing, and saw I had been making an image to the first Beast, which had the Wound by a Sword and did
live, whose deadly Wound was healed, and was full of Airy Notions and Imagi∣nations, and was worshipping the image which I had made; and then I saw my self to be a Child of Wrath, and that the Son of the Bond-Woman lived, & that Harlots had been my Companions, and was no more worthy to be called a Son: Then trouble and distress came upon me, such as was not since the beginning of the world, and I was at my wits end, and a day of thick darkness and trouble, a day of weeping, and mourning, and misery, and a day of vengeance and recompence, came upon me, such as I had never known; one vial of Wrath after another, the great Whore was to be judged, and to drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, which had made me once drunk with the Wine of her Fornication, and then I separated from all the glory of the World, and from all my Acquaintance, and kindred, and betook my self to the company of a poor despised and contemned people called Quakers, and now am I one in that Generation, which is, and ever was hated of the world by the chief Priests and Pharisees, and Generation of Serpents, and hath chosen rather to suffer Affliction with a poor despised People, than to injoy the pleasures of Sin with the great multitude (though the worldly pleasures were not wanting to me) and now do I bear witness against all Forms of Religion, and false Hirelings, and chief Priests, who walks in the steps of the Scribes and Pharisees, and of the false Prophets of Israel, and was never sent of God to declare his Word: And do freely Declare against all out-side Profession, and Notion, and do witness George Fox to be a true Minister of God, one that speaks the Word of the Lord from his mouth, one who was sent of God, and who is the Servant and Messenger of the living God, he is the Friend of God, and wo unto his Persecutors, they are the Seed of evil doers; and now I am despised of my neighbors and carnal acquaintance, and is not greater then my Lord who was called a Blasphemer and a Deceiver, as now I am; but praised, praised be the Lord for evermore, who hath separated me from the World and worldly glo∣ries, and hath made me a partaker of his Love, in whom my Soul hath fall satisfa∣ction joy and content: Thus have I travelled through the World, even unto the end, and am now come to the beginning of that which never shall have end, which the dark mind of man knows not. E. B. I Am a Prisoner for the Truth sake, and for Declaring to man of his Wickedness, and of his Transgression of the spiritual Law of God, which is spiritual, and for writing of a Letter, which was written from God, to shew to man of his wicked ways, and how he stood in the presence of God, as by the spiritual Light of God (which shines in the hearts of his servants) was discovered and made manifest unto me; for who Speaks, Writes, or Declares, from the Light of God (which doth discover all the dark paths of fallen man, and all his spiritual Wickedness) Speaks, Writes, and Declares, not as from man, whose light is only natural and carnal, (which is darkness in the pure Light which is eternal) but as from God, whose Light is spiritual, and doth make manifest the secret Whoredom of fallen man; and from this Light did the Prophets and Ministers of God, who were sent by him to reprove Sin and Transgression, Speak, Write and Declare; and in this Light did the true Prophets Ieremiah and Hosea discover Israel to be adulterous, and in the presence of God to be guilty of Whoredom, from whose presence they declar∣ed: And all now who are sent of God, to reprove for Sin and Iniquity, declares from the same Light of God, and by the same Spirit which Ieremiah and Hosea did; For the pure Light of God is but one, from generation to generation, in all gene∣ration, which discovers Sin and Iniquity, the same Light now, as in the time of the Prophets and Apostles: and from this Light (which is not carnal, but eternal) did all the holy men of God Write, and Declare; And all who are sent of God now, witnesses the same Light, and Speaks from the same Light now, as they did then; for, who cannot witness this Light, are no Ministers of God, neither ever were sent of God to Declare the Truth from God, but are Deceivers and blind Guids, and spea from the natural and carnal light, the imagined and supposed light,
which hath not seen the living & spiritual God; for Declaring by Writing to a man that he is guilty of all manner of wickedness, naming, pride, drunkenness, and whore∣dom, I am imprisoned; I wrote not as from man, whose light is only natural and car∣nal, and doth only make manifest carnal Transgressions, of a carnal Law, but as from the eternal and spiritual light, which doth make manifest spiritual Transgressions of a spiritual Law; And in this Light, is he to whom I wrote, guilty of all manner of Wickedness: Now this which I declared from God who is spiritual, is above the reach and comprehension of the carnal and earthly Law; for by the natural light through the earthly Law is no natural man able to judge of that which is spoken or declared from that which is eternal and spiritual, (for darkness cannot com∣prehend the light) which light all the Servants and Ministers of God are guided by, to Act, Speak, or Write; and therefore do I deny to have this Cause put into the Judgement of carnal Lawyers, who judges by the natural light, through the earthly and carnal Law, yet willing I am before any Authority to Answer for my self that whereof I am Accused; but to the Judgement of earthly Magistrates I do not stand, but to the Judgement of the Living and Eternal Judge, who Judges not according to the sight of the eyes, and hearing of the ears, but who judges with Equity and Righteousness; thus rather I chose to suffer imprisonment in the Body, yet free as to God in the Truth, waiting to be Redeemed, not by the earthly Powers, through the earthly Law, but by him who is Eternal, whose Law is Eternal, who orders all things by his mighty Power, to which Power I give up my self to be kept in it, and ordered by it continually. Here I have given to all People the ground of my Imprisoment in the particular of it, though I might in few words have declared the thing; for between the feed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent, is Enmity put; and he in whom the Seed of the Serpent is Ruling, seeks the destruction of him in whom the Seed of the Woman is Raised: And here is the Ground of all the Saints Imprisonment now, as ever was, the envy of the Devil working in Fallen man, against the living Truth of God, where it is made manifest. By one who is a Labourer in the Vineyard, who is not known to the World; (though named of the World) EDWARD BURROUGH.
THE Walls of Jericho Razed down to the GROUND: OR An Answer to a Lying Book, called, The Quaking Principles dashed in pieces: Wherein one called Henoch Howet, which goes under the name of an Ana∣baptist, doth falsely accuse, and maliciously belye us: his seven Principles, which he calls ours, I shall lay down, and what we own is vindicated, and what he hath belyed the Truth in, is turned upon his own head. NOw is the time wherein the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is setting up a Kingdom, and exalting his Name in the Earth, and is exalting his own Son upon the holy Hill of Sion, and is discovering the Mother of Harlots, who hath made all Nations drunk with her Fornication, and Iezabel shall be cast into a Bed of Torment, and the fire of the Lord God is come down from Heaven, and is kindled in the Earth, to burn up and destroy, and to consume to ashes, even all those that have worshipped the Beast, and hath his Image, and the false Prophets that have deceived the Nations, and they both shall be taken alive, and cast into the pit; for the Lord is grieved and wearied with this adulterous and viperous Generation, who are offering up that which stinks in his nostrils, and strange fire, and are professing him and his Resurrection, who crucifie him, and put him to open shame, and they deny the end of his coming, and are offering in Cains nature, while they slay the Just, and are in the gainsaying of Corah, who perished in it, and so shall all those that gainsay the Lord in his Way; and now the Lord of Heaven and Earth is proclaming War with the Dragon and his Angels, and they shall be cast out, and whosoever doth resist him in his way shall be broken to pieces as a Potters vessel; and thou Henoch Howet, who would limit the holy One of Israel, and bind him up in thy carnal reason, and stint him in his Way, and Form up things in thy imagination from the Scripture, and walks by Tradition; thou art accusing us among the Papist, but let it stand for thy self, and to that in thy Conscience I speak, and it will let thee see that all thy worship is taken on in thy will, and in that nature in which the enmity stands, and so hath taken on things, and taken up things by tradition from others, and that which was commands to others, who fol∣lowed the Lamb whithersoever he went, and no commands to thee, nei∣ther doth God require those things of that nature, neither doth he accept it, while the bands of wickedness is not loosed, and the oppressed is not set free, and therefore let all flesh and carnal reason be silent, for God will confound the wisdom of the wise, and they that have divined in their reasons, which is in the curse, and under the curse, shall be mad, now in the day when God is raising up his own Image, and bringing back that which hath long been held in captivity, and now the men of the Earth, Pharaoh, and all the Inchanters of Egypt, and the South-sayers, and the Diviners, and Gog and Magog, among which thou Hewet art found
one, and they compass the Camp of the Saints about, but fire shall come down from Heaven, that shall destroy all the Adversaries of the Lord, and Israel shall go free. 1. That which thou calls our first Principle; And first, thou sayest, They oppose the Word Christ, to the written word; and will have a Word that is a discovery spiritual to be the Word, but whatsoever it is they call the Word, it is perfectly false, and not the truth. Answer. Oh thou Lyar and Slanderer, the Lord will plead with thee, for Addars Poyson is under thy tongue, and thou hast a Whores forehead, that art not ashamed of thy false accusing, let hundreds in the City of Lon∣don, who hath heard us, be witness against thee, and thy Lyes that thou hast Printed, and suffers them to be cryed up and down the streets, as thy filthy Songs and Ballads, and runs to disgrace the Truth, but to the Lord, who is righteous, shalt thou give an account; and thou art as Ianes and Iambres, that withstood Moses, and for all thy hard Speeches and fil∣thy. Lyes, shalt thou give an Account for to him who is the Searcher of hearts, and that in thy Conscience shall bear witness against thee; and that we oppose the Word Christ to the written word, as thou callst it, I charge it upon thee, that we do not oppose Christ to the Scripture, for Christ is the Word, Iohn 1. and this the Scripture doth not oppose, but bears witness to him who is the Word; and his Name is called the Word of God, and this Word became flesh and dwelt among us, as the Scriptures witness, and the Word of the Lord endures for ever; but he doth not say the Letter endures for ever: but thou that art accusing us that we do not own a form of sound words, here thou shalt be judged out of thy own mouth; where readst thou of a written word in the Scripture? and here thou shalt be tryed by the Scripture, and judged by it, that thou art a perverter of the Scripture; thou wouldst have more words then one, the Word is but one, the Word sanctifies, Sanctifie them through thy Word, but he doth not say the Letter sanctifies; And the Word of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting, but the Letter is not from everlasting; and the Scripture had a beginning, and was declared in time, and Prophesie shall cease, but the Word is from everlasting to everlasting; And the Word of the Lord is as a Hammer, and as a Fire, but the Scripture doth not say that it is as a Hammer and a Fire; and yet the Word that he spoke was Spirit and Life, yet the Scripture is not Spirit and Life; and thou that wouldst set up the Letter in the place of God, to try all things, and search all hearts, thou makest an Idol of it, and so opposes God with it, and so would bring that to contend against the Lord, the which they witnessed through sufferings: and I tell thee and all the world, the Word is but one, and all who knows God hears that Word, and it is a Light and a Lanthorn unto their Pathes, but that is invisible and eternal, and what the Saints did witness of this Word they declared, 1 Iohn, and the Scripture is true, and bears true record and testimony of the Word, and they were true Witnesses of the Word of Life that wrote it, and it is a true Declaration or Testimony of those things that are certainly believed, Luke 1. of the which they saw, and heard, and tasted; and all who come to know the Word of the Lord, reads it again, and sees it as it is written: and further, thy en∣vy and shame is made manifest, that thou wouldst accuse, and yet thou sayst whatsoever they call the word, it is perfectly false, and not truth; here thou would judge, and yet thou canst not tell what we call the Word, but at last concludes its false whatever it be: and here thou blasphemes, and callest Christ Jesus, in whom is all truth, false; for no other Word I own but Christ; and the Scripture speaks of no Word of God, but one; and thou that wouldst make the Letter the Word, it self shall judge thee; and thou makest much mincing and arguments in thy carnal reason, and sayst the ground of error, is ignorance of the Scripture, and thou bringst Mark and Matthew; alas, I know what Mark and Matthew wrote is true, if thou
hadst an ear to hear, the ground of all error is because he is not known, nor his voice whom the Scriptures bear record of; and thou sayst we drive men into darkness, that works upon people to dis-esteem the Scripture, and perswades people to an uselessness of the Scriptures; let all that have heard us in the City of London, or elsewhere, speak, if they heard us say the Scri∣ture was useless, or did dis-esteem it; but on the contrary we exhorted them to search if the Scripture did not bear witness to those things we declared, and so let shame cover thy face thou false Accuser; and thou bringst 2 Tim. 3. 17. that it is for the perfecting the man of God, and that its profitable to correct and instruct; this is owned, but its not the man of God thou wouldst have perfected by it, but such Hirelings as thy self hath been, and false Accusers as thou art; and I say it is profitable to us to reprove thee, and correct thee, and read thy portion; a Lyars portion is in the Lake, and as Rom. 15. 4. its not denyed; but as Christ Jesus is witnessed, who is the Comforter, which the Scripture bears witness of, there is comfort and hope; and thou sayst, the Scripture proves the New birth, and teacheth perseverance to the end; It bears testimony of some that did witness the New birth, and that persevered unto the end; but what is this to thee, that never came one step in the way? and as for promises, there is no promise, but condemnation in the Scripture, in such as thee, and read it, The Lyar and false Accusar, and the Envious shall not inherit the Kingdom of God; and there own thy promise and thy portion. 2. Particular which thou callst a mistake, that is speaking to a thing within thee; I would fain (sayst thou) know what can be meant of the thing within men; for there is nothing to be spoken to in man, but man. Answer. Here thy ignorance, shame and envy is made manifest, that thou that hath pretended to be a Minister, and a Pastor of a Church, and cannot tell what thou hast spoke; to what hast thou ministered, to the Wind? or hast thou ministered to the Devil, and preached glad ti∣dings to him, who is in the transgression, and free grace to him that hath walked contrary to God? it is so; and therefore thou, and all who are in that nature, knows not what you speak, and therefore none hath been at all profitted by your Ministery; and blessed be the Lord that its hid from the eyes of the Wise, and revealed to Babes: and thy envious spirit is seen, that it is of thy father the Devil, who is the Accuser of the Brethren, that would lay a thing down as an error, and tells of dashing in peices our Principles, and yet knowst not what they are, nor what we speak; dost thou accuse, and knowst not for what, let shame cover thy face, that ever thou shouldst put pen to paper, or speak of God or Christ, and speakest thou knowst not what, and then thou hast hatched a thing, and concludes there is nothing in man to be spoken to, but man, and before thou knewst not, and so art in confusion; for Christ and his Apostles always spoke to man, thou sayst the Apostle saith, he went and ministered to the Spirits in prison, and to open the bind eye, and to raise the dead, and the dead should hear the voice of the Son of God and live, and he preached liberty to the captive, and is given for a Covenant to open the blind eyes, and unstop the deaf ears, and make the Lame to walk, if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear, but not to feed thy Serpents wisdom do I speak, I will shut thee out, for into it thou canst not enter, but through death, and death wrote the book; and the Apostles were made manifest to every mans Con∣science in the sight of God; and the slothfull servant had a talent given to improve, which was anothers, and not his own, and that was required of him, and that will God require of man; and unto that we speak which hears us, and shall witness us eternally, even that which is not in the transgression, neither is of man, but is given to man to improve, and yet is not far from man; but this is a mystery, and it shall be sealed; for without a parable spoke he not to such as thou art, and I know this is a parable; but in the end thou sayst, thou knowst not how they can speak to any light in man, distinct from him, unless they speak unto Satan, or some
of his Legions: here again thy shame and ignorance is made manifest, we speak to the ear, and the eye in man, which the god of the World hath blinded, and this is not of man, and yet is not far from man; but [distinct] that is thy own word, I do not own it: bring forth the Blind that hath eyes, and the Deaf that hath ears; did the Prophets speak to the Devil in man; we speak to the witness of God in man, and according to this shall all be judged; if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear; oh thou Blasphemer, dost thou call that which may be known of God, which is manifest in Romans 1. 19, 20. dost thou call this a Legion of Devils, even that which declares the eternal Power and Godhead, but thou art he that calls the Ma∣ster of the house Belzebub, and in that nature thou art, and the Lord will re∣buke thee. 3. Principle, That thou calls a mistake, that is, The denying the use of Reason in the matters of God, calling it Serpentine. Answ. The World by wisdom knows not God, and all the disputing and twining, and lavishing of the wisdom of man, and that which thou callst reason, it is corrupted, and is shut out; and who lives in that nature are the unreasonable men that hath not faith: now he that hath not faith, hath not reason, and he that hath faith, hath the Witness in himself; but I see thee, thy witness is without thee, and so thou speaks unreasonably; and all that would understand the mysteries of the Kingdom, must come through death, for Light shines in Darkness, but Darkness cannot comprehend it, and therefore one cryes, lo here, and another, lo there, and with that which thou callst reason, is Scripture torn asunder, and it begets strife, contention, endless disputes and striving for Mastery, which is carnal; and all this we deny: And thou sayst [upon this ground they will not do as the Apostles and Christ himself, who disputed with the gainsayers, Ioh. 6. and Stephen, Acts 6.] and thou bringst in some of the Synagogue of Libertines, and Syrenians, and Alexandrians, and the rest that disputed with Stephen, and they were not able to resist him: let ma∣ny hundreds of this City of London, both in publike, and in private, bear witness against thee, if we have not disputed, and have not been ready to give an answer to the gainsayers, though not such a one as they desired, even as Christ our Master did not answer the Iews in their subtil tempting of him; and of those Sects that encountred both Stephen and Paul, truly I must needs say unto thee, we have met with the same Generation in this City, whereof thou are one, and truly more subtil then they were, but in the eternal Light you are all seen, and many though they could not gainsay, yet have resisted us; and after a little, thou pleads not for carnal reason, for this will not suffer any to follow Christ: further, then they can carry their own things, their honours, pleasures, ease and lusts, to that in thy Conscience I speak whether this doth not rule thee and guide thee; it will let thee see thou art pleading for honour, and respecting mens persons, and hath them in admiration, because of advantage, and brings the example of others to prove and uphold thy deceit, which they were neither commanded nor com∣mended for to oppose the commands of Christ, and the express Scripture: and thou goes on further and sayst, [God is the Author of memory, and wisdom and reason] but I tell thee there is a wisdom and a reason that God will confound, for by faith we know the heavens were made, and see them upholden, and by faith all things is brought to our remembrance, and it is the Light that convinceth of sin, even the Light of Christ; and so in the eternal Light I see what thou pleadst for, for eating of the tree of knowledge, and there thou art, till thou art become a Fool, and dead to that reason, thou shalt never eat of the tree of Life, and therefore Flesh, be silent: and thou sayst, thou dost not allow that reason that gets only a conclusion, or an argument instead of Christ; and after thou sayst the day is yet to dawn, and the day Star to arise, and thou cryes violently for it: and here what hast thou more for an assurance of thy salvation, then an argu∣ment, and a conclusion instead of Christ; for thou confesses the day is not dawn∣ed, and then thou are yet in the night, and in darkness, for the day dawns, and the day star arises before Christ be witnessed; but thou knows no such thing, as either Christ, or the dawning, if thou had not others testimony, and that is
without; and thou art one Christ spoke of, Since Iohn the Kingdom suffers violence, and many thrust into it; and thou art striving, and are violent; but I say thou shalt not be able till thou layst down thy contending in thy carnal wisdom, and striving, and resisting; but thou must become a Fool, and sit at Jesus feet, but thou art full, and rich and whole, and need no Physitian, and therefore thou must be sent empty away, and when the Book of Conscience shall be opened, thou shalt be judged for what thou hast done against the Innocent. Now something in Answer to the Fourth Particular, which thou sayest is a Tenent held forth by the Northern people; which is, A denying of the Ascension and Beeing of the Body of Christ. Answ. O thou Enemy of Righteousness, when wilt thou cease to pervert the right Way of God, who uttereth thy Lyes and Slanders against the Innocent; God shall judge thee, and between thee & us, whether thou hast not uttered Lyes and false Accusations in the Name of the Lord, and put forth in Writing unto the World for truth, that which is absolutely contrary unto the Truth; God will reward thee, thou full of subtilty, according to thy deeds, who takes part with the Dragon against the Lamb, & goes about by thy lying Slanders, to render the Way of Truth (which thou canst not comprehend in thy serpents wisdom) odious unto all men, but God taketh our part against thee, and will dash thy Lyes and Slanders, and thy Impudent Fore∣head in pieces, even by that Power which makes the Earth to quake & tremble, which is become a reproach unto this Generation, many who have heard us since we came to this City (though our Enemies) shall witness against thee, and for us, in this particular; for we have oft witnessed forth, and I do here again witness forth in the sight of God and men, that Christ Jesus is risen, and ascended far above all Principalities and Powers, and the same which descended into the lower parts of the Earth, is also ascended, and raigns over all, subjecting all unto himself, that he may be Lord over all, and in all, and may be glorified by all; and Members of his Body we are (who thou enviously raylst against) and Witnesses of the Body we are whereof Christ Jesus is Head; and because of the Resurrection of the dead Bo∣dy, which is ascended, we are called in question, and all Sects & Opinions are trou∣bled, and on an uproar concerning us; and I tell thee plainly, we are so far from de∣nying the Ascension and Beeing of the Body of Christ, that because of being cal∣led to witness it, as being Members of it, we are persecuted and reviled by such as thy self, whose carnal conceptions and imaginations of Truth we do deny, and do testifie unto you all, that through death is the Resurrection and Ascension witnessed, and every one that reads the Scripture is not witnesses of the resurrection of the body of Christ; and all whose witness is onely without them, other mens words, which had the Witness within them, we deny to be true Witnesses, but are found false Witnesses of the Resurrection, and of the Ascension, and knows not Christ, nor his body but by hearsay; and whereas thou bringst many Scriptures to prove his Resurrection and Ascension: I answer, the Scriptures we own to be a true Declaration of the Witness which was in the Apostles of the Resurrection and of the Ascension of Christ; but thee we deny, who are found a Lyar and a Slanderer, and thy resurrection will be unto condemnation, and thy ascension will prove a descending into the Bottomless-pit, for ever to be tormented, except thou repent; and from the Life of the holy men of God thou are razed out, who art found in the way of ungodliness, and thou hast nothing to do to profess their words, who art out of their life, nor no inheritance in their words, but as thou steals them, adding thy own imaginations upon them, and wresting them to thy own destruction, being one unlearned in the Way of God, and in the Doctrine of Christ. And whereas thou sayst, And thus you see how these men deny the Lord that bought them, if they deny the Body that was crucified for them. I answer, We deny not the Lord that bought us, for by him can we say we have received the end of his coming, and of his Death and Ascension, even he hath pur∣chased us, and set us free from the Power and Kingdom of the Divel, of Lyes, and Slanders, and false Accusations of us, by whom the Man-child is brought forth; and this shall stand for thy own condition, who art a wandring Star, and hath no habi∣tation
in the Heavens; God will plead with thee, thou who hast set thy self against the Lord, in Slandring and reviling his servants. Now to thy fift Particular, That we deny the Ordinances of Christ, in which thou sayest, We also deny the Lord that bought us. Answ. The Way unto God, and unto Everlasting Life, which is Christ Jesus, we do not deny, but are true Witnesses, that same Christ alone which was crucified at Ierusalem, and which God hath raised from the dead, and which is ascended, in him alone is Salvation, and by him also alone are all justified that believe in him; and this we declare freely unto all people, that Christ is the Ordinance of God, ordained by him, for the Salvation of all that believe, and for the Con∣demnation of all that believe not in him; and that the Way unto this Christ, is not any outward visible thing, but even that which is manifest from him, leads up unto him, even the Light by which he hath enlightened every one that cometh in∣to the World, which is Spiritual, as Christ is Spiritual; and whereas thou sayest, there is nothing that Christ commanded, but we deny it, mentioning only your Baptism, and Breaking of Bread, which is your Idol, and your Image you bow unto; the one Baptism, which is by one Spirit into one Body, into the Death of Christ, we are Witnesses of; and the Bread which we break, is the Communion of the Body of Christ, and we being many, are one Bread; but the beggerly Rudiments of the World we testifie against, being Witnesses of the Substance, and your taking on practices in that nature which is contrary unto Christ, from the Words and Commands of Christ, unto them that followed him, we also testifie against; and in it you are found among the Papists, which walks by Tradition, and not from the Motion of the Spirit of God; and here thou art found a Lyar; for the Commands of Christ is our life, our joy, our peace and glory, and here∣by we know that we love him, because we keep his Commandments, and they are not grevious unto us (which is not received by tradition from without us, but by the Eternal Spirit, Christ Jesus revealed in us, which is not contrary to his Com∣mands without, but a fulfilling of them; for he is not a Iew who is one out∣wardly, whose praise is of men; neither is the Obedience which Christ doth re∣quire a conforming the outward man unto an outward thing, which Obedience is your boasting onely, and there only your difference lieth from all the World, in the outward appearance, Pharisee-like; but the ground of enmity, and seat of the Beast is standing within, and you are twofold more the children of the Devil; and God is risen to confound you, and to break your Image to pieces; and he shall have the praise of God who is the Jew inward, whose obedience and circumcision is inward, and who have no confidence in the flesh: And whereas thou exhorts to hear one loving Reproof out of the Scripture, which their Prede∣cessors (I mean the Papists) thou sayest would have taken from us in the English Tongue, and these would take from us the vertue of it, that is to say, the sharpness and sweeness of it, by working upon us a dislike to it: I Answer, we do deny thy voice, and though thou mayst bring Scripture in thy mouth to us, it is but as the Devil brought it to Christ, and we deny it from thee; for if thou sayst God lives thou swears falsly; and the Papists they are thy Predecessors, who walks only by tradition as thou dost, from a thing without them, separate from the Life, and both them and thee we do deny, and bears witness against you, to be without God, in the World, in the alienation, out of the Covenant, knowing nothing of him but what you have heard by a Fame and a Report and that we in the least would take from any the virtue of the Scripture; it is a Lye uttered by the Devil in thee: for we testifie unto all, that it shall every tittle be fulfilled, even upon the ungod∣ly, and thou shalt know it one day to be fulfilled upon thee, thou Lyar must be cast into the Lake that burns for ever; and this is the sharpness and sweetness which thou must have from it, who art a false Accuser of the Brethren, bearing the Image of the Dragon, the Devil, whose servant thou art, as it is made manifest by thy Writing; and this many will witness with us, that often we do declare upon the just and the unjust the Scripture must be fulfilled, and the righteous must have a Reward, and the ungodly must have their Portion in utter darkness, ac∣cording
as the Scripture saith; and herein we establish the Scripture in its place, to be a true Declaration of God and Christ, and what the righteous and the wic∣ed shall enjoy; but that it is God and Christ, or the Way unto Life, we deny it; for this is its vertue, a declaration of that which the Saints believed, and he that witnesses the same Life and Truth which it testifies of, to be made manifest in him, is a Witness of it, and it is a Witness unto him, and this is the vertue of it; if thou hast an ear thou mayest hear, and that we work upon Any a dislike of the Scriptures, I charge thee to be a Lyar; for to the fulfilling and establishing of it we declare, that every one may walk up in the Life of it, by that which gave it forth, and to be a true witness of it, as they were that spoke it; but thee, and all such we do deny, which adds your imaginations upon it, to sell for money. And whereas thou sayst by way of Query to us, [Hath the Scripture no power over you? have you a spirit to guide you without a written word; it is out of Gods Government if it cannot be brought to the Law and to the Testimony?] I answer, Jesus Christ onely hath power over us, and not a Letter without us; and the Spirit by which we are guided, is no other but that which gave forth the Scripture, which Spirit is the Word of God, and which Spirit the Scripture bears witness unto; and this we often say, if we speak or act contrary to Scripture, let us be judged by the Scripture; and we, as Paul did, do commend all that shall search the Scripture, to try whether these things be not so which we declare; and herein we are under the Government of God, who alone hath power over us; but you who have not the same spirit which gave forth the Scripture, neither knows it nor us; but out of the evil corrupt ground thou judgest of it, as thou dost of us, and both thy judgment of it and us is to be judged by the Eternal Light of Christ, which never erreth nor changeth. And whereas thou sayest [We may be Familiar-spirits for ought thou knowest, what muttering and uncouth howling is among us, which you cannot but impute to be a spirit contrary to the Word, if we will not come to the Word to be tryed.] I answer, it is true, thou knowst us not, for we are unknown to thy Gene∣ration, (though you have the Scripture, which we in our lives and practices, are Witnesses of) as Christ was unknown to the Pharisees, who had the Scrip∣ture, which he came to fulfil; and thou art ignorant of the Scripture, and a Scorner of the Power of it, who callst the Power of the Lord uncouth howl∣ing; what would you have said concerning David, who lay roaring all the day long even as a man distracted? and concerning Habakkuk, whose belly trembled, and whose lips quivered when he heard the Voice of God? But here you are made manifest, who scorns that which the Scripture bears witness of, and never knew what it was to be pricked to the heart, as they were which cryed out, what shall we do to be saved? and, if thou canst, thou may try by the Scripture, whether this be any other but that which the Scripture speaks of, and not the same Spirit which made the Servants of God to quake and tremble, which the Scriptures speaks of, which this day is become a reproach, even unto them that profess the Scripture; for by the Word of God, which the Scripture declares of shall all flesh tremble and be confounded, and then thy self shall be judged into the Lake that burns for ever, except thou repent. And whereas thou sayest, How shall you do to try spirits, if we deny both the written Word which is your Rule, and Reason too; for we appeal from both. Answ. Art thou not ashamed to say, The Scripture is thy Rule, who art found a Lyar and a false Accuser; thy Rule shall try thee, and shall bear witness against thee, when God judgeth thee by Jesus Christ; for neither by the Scripture nor thy corrupt reason, canst thou know the things of God, who art a natural man, in the fall, in the World, without God: But again I say, let any try us, in our lives and in our practices, and if we speak or act contrary to the Scripture, judge us by it; but thy eye is blinded, and when thou feest the Scripture fulfilled, even
crying out as a Woman in travel, thou calls it uncouth howling, and a spirit con∣trary to the Scripture; and how art thou able to try who art blind and deaf in the mystery of the Kingdom of God, for thy reason must never enter unto God, but is shut out, and in seeing thou seest not, and in hearing thou dost not understanst; and upon thee herein is the Scripture fulfilled. And whereas thou sayest, We will not have Christ to rule over us, for we deny both his Person and Word, which is the Rule of Life and Love. I answer, O thou Lyar, God shall judge thee, let shame cover thee, and let thy own Conscience convince thee of thy Lyes and Slanders against the Innocent, Christ Jesus is our Head, and we are of his Body, and his Word is sweet unto us, even our life and rule of life, and by him we see thee to be an Enemy to him, and from him I judge thee; not his Word, but the spirit of the Devil is thy rule, for he is the Ruler and Father of Lyes and Lyars, and thy Portion thou must have with him in the Lake; and what thou sayest of us it shall stand for thy own Condition, thou wilt not have Christ to rule over thee, who lives in thy lust and carnal mind without the fear of God, which Christ comes to destroy in all that witness him. And whereas thou sayest, In the Name of God thou proclaimest, That those men that disown the written Word, are not Spiritual men; they may have the Spirit of Anti∣christ. Answ. Thou hast nothing to proclaim from God, but as the false Prophets had other mens words; and also I say, if thou find any that disown the Scripture, we also disown such, and do say they are not spiritual men, but have the spirit of Antichrist, and of this number thou art, guided by the spirit of Antichrist, who art a Lyar and a false Accuser, which is contrary to the Spirit of Christ, and art without Faith, and so art unreasonable in the corrupt reason, without pure and undefiled Reason. And whereas thou sayest, Who but the spirit of Antichrist durst countermand the Com∣mands of our Law-giver the Lord Iesus Christ? I answ. The Commands of Christ are Spiritual, and in and by the Spirit, and not traditional from the Letter without, and Antichrist may conform to the Com∣mand without, as the Pharisees did, and yet be an Enemy to the Life and Substance of his Commands; and this is thy own condition as it was the Pharisees, who said, He destroyed the Law, who came to fulfil it, as thou sayest, We make void and deny the Commands of Christ, when as we are Witnesses of them, and directs all unto the fulfilling of them; and thy spirit here is tryed to be the spirit of Antichrist, the same which was in them which persecuted Christ; and thou raylst and slanderest his Members. And whereas thou sayest, There were never any men appeared in the World so like those that Peter speaketh of in his second Epistle; and these desire to overthrow the Writings of the Spirit of God. I answ. Peter spoke of such as thou art, for as a Cloud carryed about with a Tempest thou art, and a Well without water, and defilest the flesh, and dispisest the Saints dignity, and speakest great swelling words of Vanity, whilst thou thy self art a Servant of corruption, serving the Devil, by lying and falsly accusing: and that we desire to overthrow the Writings of the Spirit of God, thou art a Lyar, for we go about to establish them, and declares of him who is the Substance of them, and God will reward thee according to thy deeds: Who also accuseth us of un∣seemly Kissing in Glasiers-hall, thou sayest, if Mr Pope do not belye us. I answer, This is another Lye which proceeds from thee; let all the honest heart∣ed which ever have frequented our Assembly at that Place testifie against thee, and Pope, and your father the Devill, whom by lying you, serve, and that no unseemly Actions have proceeded from us, but Sobriety and Civility; and un∣seemly Actions shall stand for thy own condition, they are such as thy self, who commits unseemly brawling, and folly, and vain contending against the Truth in Glasiers-hall, as many Honest-hearted will witness against you, and for us
who have seen your base actions, as Scorning and Flouting in that Place; and so here you your selves are guilty of the Wontonness which Peter speaks of, and of aluring through the lust of the flesh, which thou slanderously wouldst cast it upon us. And thou further sayest, None ever promised to themselves so much liberty as these and the Ranters, in being freed from the power and tryal of the Word. I answer, Both the Ranters and thee we do absolutely deny, and testifie against you both to be in the enmity against God, and against us who are his Servants: Thou before didst rank us with the Papists, and now among the Ranters; but herein the Scripture is fulfilled upon us, as they have done unto Christ, so they do unto us; he was numbred among Transgressors by the Generation of painted Sepulchers, and whited Walls, as we are by thee; and all liberty which is of the flesh, and to the flesh, we do deny, as many can witness, who are Witnesses of our Ministery; and again I say, he that is able, let him try us by the Scrip∣ture; but thou art blind, and hath hardened thy heart against God, and hath neither salt nor savory, and so are good for nothing but to be trodden under foot. And whereas thou sayest, The Lord bless every one of his from the condition of Chandler, who formerly was the head of a Company of Shakers. I answer, The day is coming when thou canst not flee the wrath of God, though thou pray, God will not hear thee; and if ever thou hast seen Chandler in this condi∣tion, thou mightst have read thy figure in him, weeping, and howling, and gnash∣ing of teeth will be thy portion for ever; and I say unto thee, this condition of Chandlers is not come upon him, because he was once a Shaker, by the dread of the Lord upon him, but because he went out from that condition, out of the fear of God into the liberty of the flesh, out of his shaking and fearing state which once he was in, and this he shall witness with me to be true, and against thee, who would reproach the Way of Truth by him, when the Book of Conscience is opened. And whereas thou further sayest, Their spirit will perswade them that they are not fallen from righteousness, and would therefore justifie them. I answer, We are gathered up into righteousness, and fallen from vanity, and this the Spirit of God perswadeth us, and witnesseth in us and for us, by which onely we are justified freely, and not by the works of the Law, nor by any outward observance; and herein thou also art a Lyar; who sayst, we are fallen from righteousness, for even the righteousness of God is manifested to us, by which we deny all your carnal outward observances, by which you think to obtain life and righteousness. Now in answer to thy sixth Particular, which thou calls a heavy and sad offence, which is a denying honour to men, which thou sayst is the example of good men; to which I do answer: God hath commanded to honour him alone, and not to how down to any Creature, and thou hast brought many Scriptures to oppose the com∣mand of God, and so art more fully made manifest to be an enemy unto him, which would plead against him, by that which is written from him, pleading the example of good men, which is no example to us to break the command of God, no more then Davids example in comming whoredom, and Iosephs example in swearing by the life of Pharoah, is an example for any to act those things now; and I do utterly deny that any of these Scriptures, which thou hast cited, will prove and maintain your heathenish custom, in your deceitfull way of honouring one another, to please the Devil in one another, which is without the fear of God; and it is a sad offence to none but the Devil, because it weakens and disturbs his Kingdom, of which thou art, as is made manifest, who pleads to uphold it from the Scripture; but vain honour with flattering titles unto any man, we do deny; but yet we honour all men in the Lord, and out of him we honour none, to uphold the pride of man for God will bring it all down, and lay it in the dust, and exalt himself, to reign over you all; and whereas thou sayst, [how far are these men from the holy Writ:]
To which I say and answer, thou slanderously wouldst make us to appear odious in the sight of men, but all the upright in heart will see thee, and thy blindness and ignorance, who bringst that Scripture where Christ (in fulfilling the Law of God, which he came to fulfil) worshipped in the Temple, to prove and maintain the worship of man. Answ. O thou blind Pharisee and perverter of the Scripture, God will plague thee, thou enemy of his truth; who perverts the Scripture, to thy own destruction, and art worse then the Pharisees, who said, he respected no mans person, and they shall witness against thee; and whereas thou speaks of honouring Father and Mother, which thou sayest we deny in this our practice: I answer, I charge thee to be a Lyar, for, as I said, we honour all men in the Lord, and direct all Children and Servants, to obey their Parents and Masters in the Lord; and this many can witness for us, which have more frequented our Assemblies then thou hast done; but this we also testifie, where the obedience to any man stands in opposition to God, the obedience to God is rather to be chosen; and herein he that will not hate Father or Mother for Christ sake is not worthy of him; but thou carnal earthly man art pleading for the Kingdom of the Devil, to honour man above God; and I say how can you believe, that seeks honour one of another? your honour and your heathenish custom we testifie against, yet unto every Ordinance of man we are subject for Conscience sake. Now to that which you call the seventh mistake, [affording absolute per∣fection at one Instant, in admitting of none but perfect men into conjun∣ction.] Answ. It is a mistake in thee, for such a word never proceeded from us, I may say it is rather an absolute Lye invented by thee, to make us odious, then a mistake from us; for thy heart is desperately wicked, and thy torment is kindling by the Breath of the Almighty; many which have heard us will testifie against thee; for we say the Saints have their growth up into a perfect man in Christ, as Christ himself had, and we say also, there is children, and young men, and fathers, as the Apostle said, but thou art not ashamed to utter thy Lies and Slanders, which hundreds in this City will witness against thee for a Lyar; and even the light in thy Conscience will accuse thee to thy face, that thou hast imagined lyes and mischief upon thy bed against us; and whereas thou bringst many Scriptures to prove thy slanders against us to be true: to which I answer, all the Scriptures we own and bear witness unto, by that Spirit from which they were spoken; but thee and thy spirit we deny, for both you and it is of the Devil; and thou hast devillishly added thy imaginations upon them, and wrested them, which I shall not now men∣tion, because I do deny the thing which thou assertest, for its an absolute lye, and do say unto thee, God will reward thee thou slanderous tongue: and where∣as further thou sayest, [in our perfection, we deny any man, being under frailty, or capableness to sin, to be of our communion.] I answer, here again thou art a Lyar, these words were never uttered by us, as thou hast set them down; but I say he that sins is of the Devil, and such we have no unity withal, nor such hath no unity with God; for no impure thing enters to him, nor hath communion with him; for whosoever works abomination, is to be cast out, and trodden in the winepress of his wrath, where the portion of Lyars is, among whom thou must receive thy reward; for with such we have no union, who are disobedient children, but with him who in the least measure which he hath received from God, walks up in the Light unto God, we have unity and communion with him. Thou sayst one of us told thee [that which sinned could not be saved.] I answer, it is out of the reach of thy wisdom, and thy vulterous eye shall never see it; I say as the Scripture saith, The soul that sinneth must die, and every man must die for his own iniquity, if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear; and further thou sayest, [that our Doctrine may appear to be utterly against the Scripture thou bringst, Rom. 7. 23.] where Paul was under the Law, and saw a Law in the members warring against the Law of the mind: I answer, his
Scripture we own, and are ture Witnesses of it; but there was also a time, that the Law of the Spirit of Life had freed him from the Law of sin and death; but thy ignorance is made manifest, who bringst one Scripture to oppose another, and knowst not the conditions in thy self, from which Paul spoke, and so art ignorant of what he spoke; for I say, there is a time without the Law, and a time under the Law, and a time dead to the Law, and not under it, and all these states Paul witnessed, which we also in our measures are witnesses of, which thou knowst not in thy self, and so wrests Pauls words; And whereas thou sayest, [Yet let not them think that we by this doctrine nourish sin, having brought many Scriptures to plead for sin;] I answer, being guilty in thy self, thou art afraid, and hath a jealousie lest we should lay it to thy charge; and truly concerning thee we think nothing in this matter, for thy heart, and the secrets of it is made manifest in the Eternal Light, by which thou are comprehended, and answered, and by which God will eternal judge thee; therefore repent lest the wrath of God overtake thee, and thou be swept away with the Beesom of destruction, who hath falsly accused and slandered us with lies and false reproaches: but now its the time that Pilate and Herod is made Friends, and Gog and Magog is gathered together to compass the Camp of the Saints about; and even the Priests and their Crew, and the Ana∣baptists and their Crew, and all Sects is combined against the Truth, but God is with us, and in him alone can we rejoyce over you all for ever and ever; and in him make our boast all the day long, for this is our heritage; every tongue that riseth up in judgement against us shall be condemned, for the Lord is our porti∣on, and even the stone which is become the head stone of the corner; and thou Howet shalt be grinded to powder by it, who hath bent thy bow to shoot at the righteous; therefore consider what thou hast done, and repent, lest God tear thee in pieces, and there be none to deliver. By one who is zealous for the Name of the Lord of Hosts, called, EDWARD BURROUGH.
Answers to several Queries Put forth to the despised People, called Quakers, by Philip Bennett, who calls himself a Minister of Christ, but is found a Deceiver. Also Answers to several other Queries put forth by Iohn Reeve, who lives in the City of London, who calls himself, The last Messenger and Witness unto the true God, but is found a false Witness, and a Lyar, and a Perverter of the right Way of God. A Paper being received which was directed to Rich. Roper, and to his Quaking Friend, which words comes from the dark carnal mind: quaking and trembling, which the Saints and holy men of God witnessed, we own and witness; therefore we do deny thee, and all thy dark Divinations. WHereas thou Philip Bennett, in thy Note which thou hast written to Roper, in Answer to a Letter which he wrote to thee, wherein he charges thee to be a Lyar, and a false Accuser, and charges thee to bring any man to witness what thou hast spoken by them, whom thou sayest, denyed that Christ that dyed at Ierusalem, and who they were that denyed that Christ that suffered at Ierusalem, or else acknowledge thy self to be a Slanderer; and in thy Paper, thou gives no Answer at all to these words, but sayest, thou callest the Congregation to witness, but doth not mention one in all the Congregation that will witness it; whereupon the Lye rests upon thy head, and thou found to be the Lyar, and the Slanderer, and the false Accuser. And whereas thou sayest, thou hast sent queries concerning that matter; thy queries makes thee manifest what thou art, many of thy own Tribe and Generati∣on, if they saw thy queries, would be ashamed both of thee and of thy queries; for hundreds there are in the world that know nothing of the true and living God, and yet would see thee and thy queries not to be worth answering; yet lest thou shouldst boast in thy filthy ignorance and darkness, and for clearing of the Truth to the simple: Something in answer to them. 1 Quer. Whether was the Word made flesh, or the Son of God made of a Woman more, or oftner, then once? Answ. In this first query thou hast manifested what thou art, to all the Children of Light, and where thou art, and what spirit thou art of, a Reprobate, a child of Darkness thou art; thou mightest have spared the other nineteen queries, for in this query thy spirit is tryed, and in the Eternal Light seen and known: Thou askest whether the Word was made Flesh any more or oftner then once, which makes it plainly manifest, that thou knowest no at thou askest, and that thou dost not know, nor canst not witness the Word to be made Flesh once, but art one of the An∣tichrists and Deceivers which Iohn speaks of, that are entred into the World, which cannot confess Jesus Christ come in the flesh; and therefore thou queries whether the Word was made Flesh any more or oftner than once, which query comes from thy dark polluted mind, who is out of the Light, and a Stranger to the Life, and
without God in the world, amongst the false Prophets, Antichrists and Deceivers which are in the world, and in the Light of Christ, which condemns the world, ye are all seen known, and made manifest, and are turned away from by these who dwell in the Light, which Light condemns thee and all thy Generation eternally; and the Word made flesh we witness, which dwells amongst us, and we behold his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, according to the Scripture; whereby we witness thee, and all thy Generation, to be in the Sorcery, and in the Witchcraft, deceiving and betraying the Souls of the Simple, the Light of Christ in thy Consci∣ence will tell thee so, for that thou must be obedient to, and witness before thou witness the Word to be made flesh once, for thou art Darkness it self; and the Light in thy Conscience, if thou wouldst let it rise, will be thy condemnation, and when thou canst witness the Word to be made flesh once, then thou wilt know whether the Son of God was made of a Woman any more or oftner than once: But thou art the Dragon that wouldst devour the Man-child which the Woman hath brought forth, who shall rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron, and her Child is caught up to God, and to his Throne, and thou, the Dragon, and thy Angels are cast out into the Earth; and therefore dost thou persecute the Woman which hath brought forth the Man-child; but thou art overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of his Testimony; and for thy other nineteen queries, thou hast conjured them up in thy black Art, out of the Bottomless-pit, which is to be turned into perdition; if thou hadst an ear thou mightst hear, or a eye thou mightst read; but thou art blind. 2 Quer. Whether did the Man Christ Iesus the Son of God, slain, (in respect of Gods Decree and Efficacy of his Death) from the foundation of the world really and indeed suffer death, or dissolution of Soul and Body, as upon the Cross at Ierusalem, more or oftner than once. Answ. Here in this query thou, Diviner, art found adding to the Scripture thy divinations of thy own brain, whereupon the plagues of God is to be added unto thee, and poured upon thee, for as thou sayst, the Man Christ Jesus; the Lamb of God, slain (in respect of Gods Decree and Efficacy of his Death) from the Foundation of the World. Oh thou Lyar, let all people see where there is such a Scripture that speaks as thou speakst here; but in the Light of Christ thou art seen, and in the life comprehended, and art for condemnation. The man Christ Jesus we own, and witness, and the Lambs Book of Life, which was slain from the Foundation of the world we witness the Lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world; this we witness according to the Scripture, praises, praises eternal praises, be to the Lord God for ever, and thee to be the Beast that makes war with the Lamb we witness, and thou Antichrist which looks at Christs death at Ieru∣salem alone, and cannot confess him no otherwise but without thee; here thou art but equal with the Pope of Rome, for he confesseth Christ dyed at Ierusalem as well as thou; so let all thy Congregation see what they hold up that follows thee. 3. Quer. Whether did the man Christ ever really and indeed suffer in his own person, for that end and, after that manner which he did once upon the Cross at Ierusalem, before the time, or since the time? Answ. Here thou full of all subtilty hast made manifest thy Poison and enmity, but with the Light of Christ thou art seen, and known, and with it condemned for ever; Christ Jesus in his own Person doth, and ever did, suffer by thee, and such as thou art, and by thy Generation he did suffer at Ierusalem, and doth suffer where he is made manifest by you, after the same manner, and thou Blind-Pharisee and Blasphemer, wouldst thou have Christ to have more ends in suffering then one? 4 Quer. Whether was not that death which the man Christ suffered once, and but once, upon the Cross at Ierusalem, so satisfactory for all the sins of the Elect, as that the Iustice of God, did not, doth not since require any suffering or working upon that account, either from Sinner or from Saint. Answ. Here thou, Jesuite, art pleading again for a Christ far off thee,
according as thy Father doth at Rome: That Christ that dyed at Ierusalem did not satisfie for thee who art an enemy to him, and doth not abide in his Doctrine, but acts contrary to his Commands, and art under the wo, which he cryed against them that were in the same steps where thou art, and from that wo thou shalt never flee: The death of the man Christ Jesus which suffered at Ierusalem we own and witness; the same Christ that suffered at Ierusalem we witness made manifest, and the one God and the one Mediator we witness and know, betwixt God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, according to the Scripture: And here thou Lyar art made 2 Tim. 2. 10. Tit. 1. 1. 1 Pet. 1. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 6. 1 Pet. 5. 13. manifest to all thy Congregation to be a Lyar, who said amongst them, that we denyed that Christ that died at Ierusalem, so let them all be Witnesses of thy Lyes, and let thy mouth be stopt thou Lyar, who art for the Lake; and whereas thou queries; whether the justice of God be not satisfied for the sins of the Elect? here let shame strike thee in the face, that ever thou shouldst take upon thee to speak to any people, and knowst not the Scripture; where dost thou read in all the Scrip∣ture, that God doth require satisfaction for the sins of the Elect, or laid any thing to their charge, let all people try thee here by the Scripture, and see whether thou be not a blind ignorant Sot, who doth not know what the Justice of God requires, neither from Sinner nor from Saint, Isa. 42. 1. Isa. 65. 9. 22. Luk. 18. 7. Rom. 8. 33. 5 Quer. Whether you are reconciled to God by any other obedience, than that particular obedience which Christ performed in his own Person, and is mentioned in the Scripture, or by any other suffering or death, than that which Christ once suffered upon the Cross at Ierusalem? Answ. Silence flesh: wouldst thou, (who art an Enemy to God, and a child of disobedience, in whom the Prince of the Air rules) know how we are reconciled to God, and by what obedience; first own the Light in thy Conscience which condemns thee, and be obedient to that, and then thou shalt know by what obedience it is that we are reconciled to God; for yet thou knowst no obedience, nor the Death which Christ suffered upon the Cross, thou dost not know, but art an Enemy to the Cross of Christ, and in the mystery of iniquity, and in the dark power and man of sin; what hast thou to do to talk of obedience, who art reconciled to thy lust, and sin reigns in thee, and thou art blind, in the broad way that leads to death, as thy fruits makes it manifest, who lives in strife and envy? 6 Quer. Whether did not the Man Christ suffer as a publick Person in the Elects stead, or in their behalf, and for that end that none who believed in him might dye eternally? Answ. There thou Blind-Guide, makest many replys, but still one and the same thing, but thou makest it manifest, that thou dost not know the man Christ at all, nor his sufferings, for that death reigns in thee yet that hath passed over all men that askes this query; for a publick Person Christ is not to thee, but a mystery which thou knowest nothing of, and for the redeeming of the Elect from under such mouths as thine, did and doth Christ suffer; and those that are brought to believe, deny such dumb Idol Shepherds as thee, who as yet doth not believe, and therefore shalt dye eternally, except they repent. 7 Quer. Whether the sufferings of Christ now in his Saints, be all the satisfaction that is made to, or which the justice of God looks for, for sins past, present and to come? Answ. There thou Blasphemer askest thou knowest not what; is not Christ the same now as ever? and is not the sufferings of Christ satisfactory where ever? What wilt thou have to satisfie, if the sufferings of Christ do not satisfie, let all people take notice what a Blasphemer thou art, or what they can learn of such a one as thee, who knowst neither the justice of God, nor the sufferings of Christ in his Saints. 8 Quer. Whether was not that Body of Iesus which consisted of Flesh, Blood and Bone, and which was offered upon the Cross at Ierusalem, the one and onely sacrifice for sin God accepted, and to which alone exclusively the Saints before under the Law, and the
Saints since under the Gospel, did, and do look to be justified by, without any other works. Answ. Here again thou art replying thy former sottish queries, which rises out of thy dark mind, concerning the Body of Jesus, as the Devil did about the Body of Moses; let thy mouth be stopt here, for the Body of Jesus thou knowest not, nor what it consists on; and the offering of it up thou knowst nothing of, but what thou knowest and hearest by the outward Letter; that it was offered up at Ierusalem; and the sacrifice for sin thou knowest not, and thou art none of the Saints, neither under the Law, nor under the Gospel; but are without in the world, in the Broad-Way, blind, leading the Blind into the Ditch; and for thee the Body of Christ is no saisfaction: And thou Reprobate, what hast thou to do to talk of believing? for that is the condition of the Saints, they do believe and are justified; and their works thou knowest not, thou disobedient one, upon whom God will render vengeance in flaming fire. 9. Quer. Whether there be not another righteousness by which the Saints are justified in the sight of God, than that which Christ works in them and by them? Answ. There thou accursed, art made manifest, who preacheth another Gospel, and wouldst have another righteousness than that of Christ, here thou Beast, to whom the Plagues of God is due, and upon whom his wrath must be accomplished, here thou hast made thy self manifest, thou who wouldst have another righteousness than the Righteousness of Christ, which he works in the Saints, and by them; and so thou wouldst be justified and live in thy sin, but thou art shut out from God for ever; and we witness justification by faith, and the just shall live by his Faith. 10 Quer. Whether doth sanctification or justification, in order antecede holiness of life, or justification by faith go before; or whether doth not God love man, ere man loved God? Answ. Here thou, dark blind Hypocrite, hast shut thy self out from the know∣ledge of God in any measure; oh that People should ever be so blind, as to look for to learn any thing at such a one as thee, but sin and filthiness! and what hast thou been teaching them all this while, that neither knowst Sanctification nor Ju∣stification yet, but art querying whether goes before? let all people judge if thou art not a Teacher of Laciviousness, Sin and Uncleanness; and how darst thou mention a holy life, or justification by Faith, and knowst neither Justification nor Sanctification? And thee, man, which art Cain, God doth not love nor accept thee nor thy Sacrifice; and for Justification by Faith, thou knowst nothing of it, which we own and witness; and thou, who art in envy dost not love God. 11. Quer. Whether the Iustice of God be not fully satisfied for all the Sins of the Elect; ere Christ appeareth to their Souls, or Holiness appeareth in their Lives? Answ. Here thou full of all subtilty art comprehended, and with the Light of Christ thou art seen, and with the Life judged and condemned, who wouldet lay sin to the charge of the Elect, when the Scripture faith, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that justifieth, who shall condemn? The Soul that sinneth shall dye. Thou Sorcerer, Doth the Elect of God sin? Shall the Elect dye? To that in thy Conscience I speak. 12. Quer. Whether the holy Lives, or holy Works of the Saints be not excluded from the Act of Iustification, from the Guilt of Sin? Answ. Thou dead Beast hast made it manifest, that thou art a Stranger from the Life of God, and is excluded from the holy Life of the Saints and their Works, who art querying whether this be not excluded from Justification: Oh that ever thou shouldest open thy mouth, or take upon thee to speak of the Scrip∣ture; Doth not the Apostle say, 1 Pet. 1. 18. For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from your vain Conversation, but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without Blemish and without Spot, who ve∣rily was ordained before the Foundation of the World was, but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead? Now let all
people read this Chapter, and try thee, who knowest nothing of Jesus Christ, but as thou hast heard of him, that he was crucified at Ierusalem, and so thou art unredeemed from thy vain conversation, and so art not justified before God, nor never shall be; but those that can witness Redemption by the precious Blood of Jesus Christ, as all the Saints of God do, are justified; and by the same that they are justified thou art condemned into the Lake for ever. 13 Quer. Whether is that righteousness which is wrought by the Saints every way answerable to the justice of God? Answ. There again thy blindness is made manifest; is there any righteousness but that of Jesus Christ? and is not that every way answerable to the justice of God? but such polluted filthy Beasts as thou wouldst have another righteousness, as thou speakst plainly in thy ninth query; but all thy righteousness we deny, and the righteousness of Jesus Christ we own and witness, whose righteousness shall be revealed upon thee in flames of fire. 14 Quer. Whether none be accounted righteous in Gods sight, in whom there is any corruption or failing, or who do not fulfill the Law, and answer every demand of justice? Answ. Here thou polluted beast, hast made it manifest what thou hast been dri∣ving at all this while in thy queries, which is, that thou wouldst have corruption and filthiness to be accounted righteous in Gods sight, that so thou mightst lye and wallow in thy sins and filthiness, but Iohn saith, that he that commits sin is of the De∣vil; for the Devil sinned from the beginning; and for this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, that he might destroy the works of the Devil; and thou man of sin wouldst have it to stand; but those that loves God keeps his Commande∣ments, and they are not grievous; and God doth not accept any where there is any failing, or who do not fulfil the Law, and answer every demand of justice; and he doth reserve the unjust unto the day of judgement to be punished, 1 Pet. 2. 9. and chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness; and there thou art. 15 Quer. Whether a soul be justified before God by the non-imputation of sin, and the imputation of the righteousness of the Person of Christ to his Faith, or by a righteousness wrought by Christ in the Person justified, or to be justified. Answ. Here stop thy mouth, thou Sorcerer, which art gathering up here a heap of confusion, which is fit for nothing but to be turned with thee into the bottomless pit, from whence it comes, wherein thou talkest of imputation and non-imputa∣tion, and of a person justified, and to be justified; thy language is of Egypt, and in the mystery of iniquity, thou speakst it, which is condemned into the ake of per∣dition by the Light of Christ, and in the Light thou and it art seen and compre∣hended; and as I told thee before, I own no righteousness but what is of Christ and wrought by him, which Righteousness shall confound thee and all thy unrigh∣teousness and conjuration, and the same that justifies us shall condemn thee eternally. 16 Quer. Whether Christ be in his Saints in respect of that nature wherein he suffered at Ierusalem? Answ. Here, thou Enemy of Christ, wouldst know how the Saints injoy Christ here, the Scripture is fulfilled upon thee, the Light shines in darkness, and dark∣ness comprehends is not, when thou comes to own thy condemnation, the Light in thy conscience it will let thee see thy evill deeds, it will lead thee up to Christ from whence it comes, and then thou wilt know that nature that he suffered in; but now thou art in that nature that Iudas was in that betrayed him, and that they were in that crucified him. 17 Quer. How, and after what manner Christ, who in respect of his Divine nature is in all places, may be said to be in a Saint, and not in Reprobate? Answ. What hast thou to do to query after the Divine Nature, who art the na∣tural man, that knowes nothing of God, but what thou knowest naturally as a bruit beast, and knowes not the things that be of God, because they are spiritual∣ly discerned, and the manner of Christs Divine nature, which is infinite, is hid from thy eyes; for with that eye that thou shouldst see, with that art thou blind,
and the manner of his being in a Saint thou knowest not, who art a Reprobate, and thou shalt find him to be thine eternall condemnation. 18 Quer. Whether doth Christ now in these dayes assume or take upon him the form of a servant, and the seed of Abraham, that is our flesh: And Whether doth not this assumption cause such a perfection of the God-head and the Man-hood, as that both of them are united together into one person? Answ. O thou dark Beast and Conjurer, who art querying with thy conjured words, that which thou knowst nothing of, and which is out of thy reach, and comprehension; thou Blasphemer, dost thou limit Christ to dayes, in taking upon him the form of a Servant, and the seed of Abraham? Is not he the same now as ever he was? And for the union of the God-head and Man-hood, as thou callst it, let thy mouth be stopt, for with thee God nor none of his Children hath any union; for God hath put an utter enmity, betwixt thy seed, thou Serpent, and the Seed of the Woman, and the perfect union with Christ we witness, who is the same to day, yesterday and for ever, and therefore are we separate from thee and thy Generation. 19 Quer. Whether is Christ now conversant upon earth, amongst men, since his A∣scension, as he was before, and in those times wherein the Apostles lived? Answ. In thy queries thy speech bewrayes thee, thy language is the language of Aegypt, for in it thou makest it clearly manifest that thou knowest not Christ at all, not in the least measure, for where the first Principle of Truth is made manifest, it is the same that ever was, and never changes; and thou askest whether Christ be now conversant upon Earth amongst men since his Ascension, as he was in the A∣postles time; Dost thou know what thou askest? Did he not appear to the Apostles since his Ascension, in the most glorious manner that ever thou readst; and is he not the same now as he was then? What wouldst thou make of him, (thou dark sottish Beast) such a one as thy self? who wouldst be pleading for darkness and ignorance of God, but praise and glory to him who hath discovered thee and all such De∣ceivers as thou art. 20 Quer. Whether did not Christ dwell among his Saints, after another and more visible manner than now he dwels in his Saints? Answ. There again thou hast shewed thy ignorance of the Scripture, and for thy word visible, he is not, nor never was visible to thee, nor to thy Generation, for those that did profess the Scriptures, as thou, and thy Generation doth, crucified him, and said he was of the Devil, as thou and such as thou art, dost now; thou Blasphemer, where hast thou a Scripture that saith, that Christ would dwell in his Saints after another manner? Did he not say, It is expedient for you that I go away, and I go and prepare n place for you, and I will come again and receive you unto my self, that where I am there you may be also; and ye have heard how I have said I go away and come again unto you, and if ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, because I go unto the Father; and Christ Jesus saith in Iohn 14. 21. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do, he shall do also, and greater works than these, because I go to the Father: But all these Scriptures is hid from thy eyes, and thou art one of those that Isaiah prophesied on; and that Scripture is fulfiled on thee, which saith, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts. Now blessed be the Lord that hath discovered thee, and such Blind-Guides as thou art. So thy queries are answered in the eternal Light and Life of God, and judgement is given upon thee and them, which thou shalt eternally witness, without roving or wandring; but thou who art out of the Light art roving, and wandring and stumbling in darknes; who hast put forth these stumbling queries, which are Answered lovingly and plainly, and in the Scripture Language and Termes, and with the Eternal Light and Life of God, set thee in thy own place, which thou shalt eternally witness. These are matters of great concernment, and if you refuse to answer them in writing, spare your tongues and spare your Papers, for I will henceforth neither hear the one, nor read the other. Answ. Thou sayst, these are matters of great concernment; We see that that
which makes thee manifest, and such as thou art, and which layes thee open to poor ignorant people, who are deceived by thee, and led into the ditch, and their souls kept in death by thee; to make this manifest is of great concernment, as these dark black stumbling queries, and thy conjured words hath done, which thou hast no Scripture for, as ambiguity, efficacy, exclusively, antecede, and non-imputation, assume, and assumption: Now let all people read and consider what they do that holds such as thee up, who is shut out from God, and shut out from the Saints life and language, and art shut out of the Scriptures, though thou makest a trade of them for money, and deceives poor people, but thou knowest nothing of the Life and Power that gave them forth; So thou art to be condemned with the Light, and with the Life which gave forth the Scripture. Let all people read Deut. Chap. 18. from verse 9. to 15. there the Priests and the Levites which were ordained of God, were to have no Inheritance among the people, but the Lord was their Inheritance, and they were to have it of that which was offered up to the Lord, and this was a figure of the everlasting Priest-hood which ministreth out of the everlasting Treasure; and the Lord God commanded Israel, not to do as they did when they came into the Land, nor to go after their abominations, as you may see, but gave Israel their Land to possess that did hearken unto such as the Lord had not sent, which was Abomination to him; and the Lord said to Israel, Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God; and in the 15th verse, The Lord thy God will raise unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him shall ye hearken; And so to the end of the Chapter; he that hath an eye may see, and the Lord is the same that he was, and he will not suffer the abominations that are committed in this Land, but is discovering the abomination of it: A horrible and a filthy thing is com∣mitted, which Ieremiah cryed against, Coveteous Men preach, Drunkards preach, Swearers preach, Lyars preach, Strikers preach, and Proud Men preach: Oh wonderful! where are your eyes? Try your Priests by the Scriptures, see if they be not found in the same Generation that all the false Prophets and the Deceivers were in, which the true Prophets of God cryed against, and discovered; and in the steps of the Scribes and Pharisees, that Christ cryed wo against; and see if they be not the Antichrists and the Deceivers which are entred into the World, which Iohn speaketh of, which cannot confess Christ come in the flesh, but trans∣gresseth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, so hath not God, neither knoweth him, but preacheth for sin, and against Perfection; and denyeth the Light which enlighteneth every one that cometh into the World, & so keeps people in blindness and ignorance, and out of the Knowledge of God, and never any that follow them shall ever come to the Knowledg of the true and living God; therefore all people see where you are, and mind the Light in your Consciences, which is pure, and which testifieth against sin, and it will let you see all your Blind-Guides which deceive you, to be in sin, and ignorant of God; for they deny that which should make him manifest, therefore beware what you hold up, and give over going after them; to that in your Consciences I speak, which shall witness me eternally to speak the Truth, if you obey it; and shall condemn you eternally, if you disobey it. These Blinde-Guides that are in this Land, deny the Prophet which Moses wrote of, which is the substance of the Priest-hood, which was before, and here they are found in the same Generation, in the Sorcery and in the Witchcraft, which the Lord commanded should be put out of the Land, where the Children of Is∣rael went to possess.
Answers to several other subtil Queries, put forth by one John Reeve, who lives in the City of London, who callst himself the Messenger and Witness unto the true God, but is found a Lyar, and a Perverter of the right Way of God. A Certain Writing is come to my hand, called An Epistle from the Mighty JEHOVAH, or Jesus the only LORD, and God of the E∣ect Israelites, from one, whose name is subscribed Iohn Reeve, Pilgrim, who calls himself the last Messenger, and Witness unto the true God, unto which, for the sake of the Simple, I am moved by the Spirit of the Lord of Heaven and Earth to write something in answer, that so his folly may be made manifest, and his ignorance and blasphemy laid open unto the simple∣hearted, who have been long deceived by such through their false Voice, lo here, and lo there: Friend, to thee, who hast subscribed this Writing, who calls thy self the last Messenger, and Witness unto the true God: I Answer, the Lord of Hosts, and God of the Elect Israelites, doth not accept thy Testimony and Wit∣ness; for thy spirit is made manifest not to be the Spirit which came from God, and which dwelleth with God, which beareth true Witness unto God; but the spirit which is driven out from the Presence of God, into the Creation, and in∣to the visible World; and that is the lying spirit, and bears not true witness un∣to the true God, but is a spirit which bears witness to the imaginations of thy own heart, which looks upon, and declares the living God, as if he was carnal, and a Creature-like Substance; and here the Scripture is fulfilled upon thee, thou thinkest he is altogether such a one as thy self; and for the true God thou art no Messenger, nor hast received any Message from him, for thy spirit is known, and he never delivered his Message unto it in any Generation, but kept his Secret seal∣ed up from it: And Friend, here I charge thee, in the Presence of the true spi∣ritual God, that thou belyst the Lord of Hosts, who sayest thy Epistle is from him; thou uses thy tongue, and sayest, The Lord saith, when, saith the Lord, I have not spoken unto thee: And of that Generation thou art which Ieremiah cryed against; and therefore let all flesh be silent before the Lord, and call not thy own imaginations his Word, but thou who hast a Dream, tell thy Dream for a Dream, and he that hath the Word of the Lord, let him speak it faithfully; and though thou callest thy self the last Messenger, or Witness unto the true God; yet I say unto thee, verily the Lord hath a Witness which was before thee, which hath been slain in the Streets of the great City, which the Lord will bring forth after thee, which will bear true witness of the true God, and, against thee; and thou, who hast been alive, shall be judged by him who hath lain slain, and he will eternally condemn thy Testimony and Message: Friend, in the Light of Christ, which hath lightened every one that cometh into the World, thou art comprehended, and seen, thy beginning, thy time, and thy end, and with it thy Testimony and Message is denyed, for thy Testimony is such, that if thou swearst the Lord lives, thou swearest falsly; and further thou sayst, [By inspiration of the holy Spirit thou wast moved to present this Epistle:] I answer, the lan∣guage of the holy Spirit is like it self, Pure and Spiritual, but thy language is car∣nal and sensual, and so is thy spirit; the Saints which spake by the inspiration and moving of the Spirit, cursed not that which God had blessed, as thou dost; neither did they say the Elect were defiled, as thou doest; neither did they speak of God as a carnal Substance, as thou dost, but said that God was a Spirit; and here art thou a Witness against thy self, that thou speakest not by the inspira∣tion and moving of the holy Spirit, but speakest thy imaginations and lyes in the Name of the Lord: And whereas thou sayest, [In this confused Age there hath appeared variety of spirits, pretending to be sent by the everlasting God, yet they are at war with all their power to overthrow one another, that their own Opinions may bear rule.] I Answer, Among the Many Preten∣ders
thou speakest of, thou art one; and it is true, you are at war with all your power endeavouring to overthrow one another, that your own Opinions may bear rule, and though there be among you variety of Opinions, yet by one spirit you act, for the Kingdom of the Devil is but one, and yet divided, and it is at war with it self, and therefore it cannot stand; and you cannot overthrow one ano∣ther, but one is appearing to overthrow you all, and all your Opinions; for all you Pretenders are made manifest by your fruits, and thereby men may try you; for nothing is to be gathered from you but Opinions and airy Imaginations, some of you speaking of a God and Christ a far off to believe in, others of you speak∣ing of a God and of a Christ within, and a far off to believe in; thus you feed peo∣ple by your own imaginations; and some of you pretend Revelation, others of you denying Revelation; and thus you strive to set up your own Opinions, but you live all in one nature, and are of one Generation, and he that walks in the Light seeth you all, and comprehendeth you all, and judgeth all your Opi∣nions, and are redeemed out of all your vain imaginations, into the Life of God, acting and speaking as the Spirit acteth and speaketh, and seeketh to ex∣alt Christ, and him to bear rule, that all Opinions may be by him thrown down, and that by him people may be brought out of a confused Age, into the Land of Rest, and Peace, and Righteousness, to serve the true Spiritual God in the Spi∣rit, and by the Spirit of his own Son: And further, thou sayest [Some there are that take upon them to speak of a God, and of a Christ in the invisible Hea∣vens, above the Stars, but are uncapable to demonstrate how Christ by his spiritu∣al Word liveth in mens hearts, and how he reigneth visibly in glory with his Elect Angels.] I Answer, there are not some, but many, which lives in, and speaks forth their own imaginations, upon God and Christ, and one of them thou art, thy spirit is tryed; God who is a Spirit, dwells in the Spirit of his Son, e∣ven in the high and holy Place, and with him also who is of a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at his Word, but this by thy vulterous eye is not seen, neither can any demonstrate how Christ dwells in the heart, but he who witnesseth it through death, and where he reigns, his Glory is with him and his Elect Angels; this I witness, but to thy carnal eye it is invisible, and by thy carnal wisdom he can never be known, Christ and his spiritual Word is not to be divided, though thy sensual spirit would divide them, but by the Flaming Sword thou that speakest art divided from both, and shalt know neither, but to thy condemnation: And further thou sayest [Others there are which speak of an eternal Spirit, or Christ only in the Consciences of men, as if there were no Creator or Christ at all, visibly reigning upon his Throne of immortal Glory.] I answer, they who talk of an eternal Spirit, or Christ in the Conscience by hearsay, or of other mens words, without (as thou dost) and doth not in Life and Power witness it, from the Father within, made manifest, such are denyed by them who witness the eternal Spirit dwelling with the contrite heart, which Spirit is the Creator which dwells also in the high and holy Place, and reigns upon his Throne for ever; and who do in Power witness this, sees and judges all your carnal imaginations, and conceptions of the living God in your carnal minds; where he dwells shall no unclean thing enter, but is without to be troden in the Wine-Press of his Wrath for ever and ever; and by him shall thy carnal conceptions be consu∣med, even by the Breath of his Mouth, for he is Eternal, and his Throne is E∣ternal, and by the carnal eye shall never be seen: And further thou sayst, [There are some (who through unbelief that ever any living Creature had a beginning) do affirm there is no God or Christ at all, but perishing nature; this sort are innumerable, witness the lives and conversations of people every where.] I an∣swer, All who do witness the Eternal Spirit made manifest, to rule and guide; all such do deny and declare against such Opinions; for nothing was without begin∣ning but the Eternal Word, which was the beginning of all things, and will be the end of all things; even the destruction of the wicked, and the Salvation of them that believe, who are born of the immortall Seed, and redeemed out of the perishing nature into the image of God, and such do set to their
seal there is a God, who will reward every one according to their works, and bears witness against them, who in their lives and conversations denies God, as all do who do not witness the eternall Spirit of Christ ruling in the Conscience, but talkes of a God in imagination at a distance, and such are innumerable, and sayes in their hearts, there is no God, and such are the fools the Scripture speaks of; and whereas thou beseeches to consider of these ensuing particulars; I answer, They are considered, and by them thy ignorance is made manifest, and thy folly disclosed, and thy blasphemy, who calls thy self the last Witness. 1 Quer. In thy first particular thou queriest, Whether these men were sent forth by the eternall Spirit to preach, which in the least cannot demonstrate what the onely true God is in himself, and how he is a distinct Beeing from all living Creatures, and how he reigns in the Elect by a created Word, Voice or spirituall Motion onely. Answ. Those men were not sent forth by the eternall Spirit to preach, who have not received it, and such know not God, what he is, nor where he is, but in their imaginations imagine him to be like a creature, by being in a creaturely Place or Habitation, God is a Spirit, and he is not distinct from living creatures, for in him living creatures lives, moves, and have their beings, and he is not far from them, nor distinct from them, as he spake who was sent by the eternall Spirit to preach, he reigns in the Elect not by a created word, voice, or a created spirituall motion, for the Word which lives in the Elect, from which voice and motion pro∣ceeds, is not created, but is uncreated, even as God is uncreated, for God is that Word, and here thy ignorance appears, by calling the Word which lives in the Elect a created word, or voice, or motions; and here be a witness against thy self that thou speakst from darkness, and not from Light, which darkness cannot com∣prehend the shining of the Light; and this discovers thee more to be a false Witness, and not the true Witness of God, and therefore thy Portion must be the Portion of false witnesses; read what it is. Quer. 2. In thy second particular thou queriest, Is not this an infallible demonstra∣tion to men, that a man is sent forth by the eternall Spirit, if he have received a gift from the holy Ghost, to demonstrate what the true Creator was in his own distinct Essence, Nature and glory, from all eternity, in time, and to all eternity, and wherein Elect men and Angels differ in their natures, and glory, distinct from their Creator in their Persons. Answ. He that hath not received a gift from the Holy Ghost in some measure, is not sent forth by the Eternal Spirit, or God of all Truth, this is infallible; and such knowes not what the Creator is, but by imagination, and carnall conceptions of him; and such in the Light of Christ is seen, and by it judged; and among such thou art, to that in thy Conscience I speak, which will witness me, he that hath received the Holy Ghost, turneth people from the power of Satan to the power of God, and knoweth the Creator, and the dwelling of him in the heart; for as the Scripture saith, The Word is nigh, but let all flesh be silent, he who is in time, knowes not him which was before time, and shall be when time shall be no more; he who knows the Creator which inhabiteth Eternity, is redeemed out of time, into the Habitation of the Almighty; but this to thy dark minde and spirit is unknown; if ever thou knowest it, it must be through death, the nature and glory of the Elect differs not from the Nature and glory of the Creator, for the Elect are one with the Creator, in his nature, enjoying his glory, which was from eter∣nity unto eternity, he that reads let him understand, thy word [distinct Essence,] I deny, for the Elect is not distinct from the Creator, but lives by the dwelling of the Son in him, and with the Son the Father dwells also; if thou hast an ear, thou mayest hear. 3 Quer. In thy third particular thou queriest, What that Angelical Serpent was in his creation, which the Scripture speaks of, and how he came to be cast out of his glory; and how he overcame innocent Eve, and how he entered into her womb, and changed her pure Seed into his nature of unclean reason? And thou askest, What think you, Was not that man Cain the first murdering lying Devil that ever was? And is there any Devil but proud, vain-glorious, unmercifull men and women?
Ans. That same which speaks in thee is that same servent which the Scripture speaks of, and if thou hast the spirit of Moses, thou knowest what he was in the Creation; for Moses saw his Creation by that Spirit which was before he was; and if thou knowest his creation in thy self, then thou mayst know him without thee; but yet he lies under his vail deceiving thee, and is not deceived by thee; and by the same which thou lives in, he was cast out of his glory, even disobedience; and he over came innocent Eve even as he overcomes thee, by promising what he fulfilled nor, and by presenting that which was visible, and so her minde was led out, as thine is, and by her consenting, he entered and got power, and set up his habitati∣on, which is now standing in thee, and so she became the likeness of himself, her minde and lust strayed into the visibles, out from the Creator who is invisible, and spirituall, and she now lives under the curse, and brings forth cursed children, such as thou art who puts forth these queries; and this child was begotten by him who deceived her, and he is the Father and Prince of all you who are Wells without water, Clouds without rain, and wandering Stars, having no habitations in the Heavens, the blackness of darkness is reserved unto you for ever, ye who speak great swelling words of vanity (that ye are the last Witnesses and Messengers, &c.) but you your selves are servants of corruption: and to the last part of thy query. I answer, before Cain, who is a lying Devil, was a child, he was a father; and if thou hast an ear, thou mayest hear; the proud, vain glorious, unmercifull men and women, who bears his image must with him be tormented in the Lake which burneth (by the kindling of the breath of the Almighty) for ever and ever; and here thou art answered, though not to the feeding of thy wisdom, but in the Light, by which thou art comprehended, which Light will eternally condemn thee who hates it. 4 Quer. Thou queries, What condition Adam was formed in, and how he came to fall from his estate, and what sin it was they committed, (Adam and Eve) and whereby the Elect and Reprobate are defiled. Answ. Adam was created in the image of God, and God breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living Soul, but eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; therein he turned from the Command of God and did dye; if thou hast an ear thou mayest hear, and thou that queriest hast eaten of that Tree; and thou shalt never know in what condition he was created in, but through the death: for a sword is set at Edens gate to keep the Tree of life, which will cut thee down, before ever thou knowest, or canst witness his estate: and as for the Elect being defiled, here thou makest thy self manifest, that thou never knewest what the Elect was, for the Elect is born of God, and he that is born of God sins not; and the promises of God are to the Elect, and election obtains it, and the Elect was never defiled: if thou hast an ear thou mayest hear; that which is defiled shall not enter into the holy City; and here thou hast manifested thy ignorance, and art that Reprobate thou speakst of, which is ordained of old for condemnation, which is the Transgressor which is cast out, thou hast no communion with the Elect, for thou art defiled, and art without the Gate, to be trodden in the Wine-press. 5 Quer. What that heavenly glory is, and where it is that the Elect Wheat of Christ shall eternally enjoy, who are the Seed of Adam, and not of Cain? Answ. What that glory which the Elect, which thou hast spoke of in thy fourth query shall inherit, which was and is defiled, it is to be in Hell, in utter darkness for ever and ever, where all the unclean are; and thou wouldst know where it is; it is without the Gate of the City; among the Dogs and Whoremongers, and Lyars, and Deceivers, and whatsoever is defiled shall be trodden in the Wine-press of the Wrath of God for ever and ever, where is Weeping, Wailing, and Gnashing of Teeth: But as for the Elect Wheat of Christ, which thou sayest is the Children of Adam, thou speakest thou knowest not what, the first man is of the Earth earthly, and he begat his Image, and that which is earthly shall never inherit, but are to have their portion with Cain, where thou art that hast uncovered thy nakedness; but the Elect, and the Wheat shall be gathered into the Barn, and they are not, nor ever were they defiled, but shall reign with the Lamb in the New Ierusalem for
ever and ever, where no unclean thing can enter, nor nothing that destroys or defiles in that holy Mountain of the Lord; if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear. 6 Quer. What is that painful and shameful Death in utter darkness, (and where it is) that is reserved for the Reprobate; who are the seed of Cain, and not of Adam, or blessed Abraham. Answ. Thou that queriest shall surely know, it is Tophet, prepared of old even for the King, the burning of it is as Fire, the Breath of the Lord doth kindle it, it shall be destruction for ever and ever to that which hath given forth these queries, and it is to be separated from God for ever among all Idolaters, and Adulterers, and Lyars, the Unbelieving, the Abominable, and the Fearful, in the Lake of Fire where the Worm dieth not, nor the Fire goeth not out; as for Adam, in innocency, thou knows nothing of him, who art of Cain, who slew his brother, and must have thy portion with him, and not with Abraham: the pro∣mise was not to the Transgressor, nor to Adam when he eat of the Tree of knowledg, for the Lord said in the day thou eatest thou shalt dye; he was driven from the Presence of the Lord into the Earth, in the curse; the Promise was to Abraham, in Isaac is the Blessing, not in Ishmael; and here thou shewst thy ignorance, but it is but like the former, when thou joynest the Elect and Reprobate together, Light and Darkness, and in Babylon thou art, but in that which was before Babylon was, thou art seen; and as for those dark spirits thou speaks of, who minde no∣thing but their lusts, condemning the glorious things of eternity, because their carnal reason cannot comprehend them; see at home; for in the Light of Christ thou art seen, that thou knowest nothing of Eternity by thy dark imaginations, being naturally as a Bruit, to the Light of Christ in thy Conscience I speak, which will let thee see it is so. 7 Quer. Are they not deceived Persons, and utterly ignorant of the true God, who judge men and women in darkness, if they ask them Questions about the needfull things of Eternity? is it not because they went before they were sent, and so are of a bitter spirit for want of spiritual Light to satisfie the tender Christian Querier. Answ. All who dwell not in this Light, which is pure and eternal, are igno∣rant of God, and never knew God; such judging shall be judged; and by the Light which sees and comprehends all darkness thou art seen; but the spiritual man judg∣eth all things, and he is judged of none; and all Judgement is committed to the Son, and where he is made manifest he speaketh, and judgeth righteously, and those men and women who would be asking questions of Eternity, and never came to the first principle to be guided by it, the Light which leads to Eternity, all such men and women are in darkness, and that minde which is in the Earth and in the naturals shall never know; and therefore they are judged to be in darkness, and darkness cannot comprehend the Light; Christ and his Disciples answered and judged that spirit which would have had a sign; and called them Adulterers, which Spirit we witness to the praise of God; and to thee that put forth the queries, I speak to thee in the presence of God, whether thou putst them forth in simplicity, and art ignorant, or wouldst know, or in the pride of thy heart, and subtilty to tempt; the Light of Christ will let thee see, but thou art rich and full, therefore thou must be sent empty away; all who queries from that nature that would know, but never come to obedience, that is to be judged, and judgment must thou witness, and for a bitter spirit of envy, that shall stand for thy self; and that thou wantst spiritual Light is made manifest, which curses that which God hath blessed, as I have seen under thy own hand, far remote from this City, and that thou hast cursed them soul and body to all eternity, which thou never heardst nor saw; let shame strike thee in the face, and stop thy mouth, for thou canst not put a difference betwixt the precious and the vile, but cursest thou knowst not what, and speaks to that thou knowest not: But as for them who have a desire to know the way to the Father, we are ready to give an answer, and to impart of the gift we have received, and doth not break a bruised reed, but the fat we feed with judgement, and there thou art answered.
8 Quer. It is not an infallible demonstration unto them who have a discerning Spirit, that that man hath no commission from the true Spirit to preach or speak to a pople, when for fear of his ignorance being discovered, or for fear of losing his Heers, e shall coun∣sell them to stick close to the Word of God, or to heken to the Light within th in their Consciences, without knowing what that is in the Conscience, or what will be the issue of it, if men be obedient to it; or disobedient to it, and to beware of false Prophets, and not thinking in the least himself to be that false Prophet; and thus borrowing▪ Scripture language which we are the true Messengers of the Gospel, doth he not in his p inder his Heers from reading the glorious things revealed unto the two last Witnesses, and so thou sayst, it is clear that the Spirit is not in them which was in Paul, who gave the leave to try all. Answ. Here thy infallible demonstration is made manifest to be fallible and lying, when thou layst that down to be a sign of them that have no Commission from the Spirit, and not to have the Spirit, because they exhort them to cleave close to the Word of God, and to mind the Light which shines into the Conscience of every man, which is the Light of Christ; here thy Spirit is tryed, that thou hast not the same commission as they had, who spoke forth the Scripture, and so thou preachest another Gospel; for the Word of God endures for ever, and by the Word which is eternall, and which was in the beginning, which tryes all things, which searches all things, comprehends all things, and judges all things, he that cleaves not close unto that, builds upon another foundation; and by the Word which endures for ever, thou art seen, not to have that Word, neither knowest what, nor where it is, neither hast cleaved to it, and so art raed out from the Life, and from the Foundation; and the Apostle who had his Commission not from man, nor by man, he exhorted those he preached and wrote to, to take heed to the sure Word of Prophesie, as unto a Light that shined in a dark place, and to wait in it, till the Day did dawn, and the Day Star did arise; and for distinguishing of that in the Conscience what it is, he that is not separate from the darkness knows not how to do it. But this I say unto thee, as we declare unto all, the Light which shines into the Conscience is the Light of Christ, which he hath enlightned every one with∣al, and it is spiritual, like himself, and eternal, and it leads out of sin, and declares against all iniquity, and he that comes to own it, and to be guided by it, it leads out of sin to know the Cross of Christ, which is a Mystery to thee, and it leads to the eternal Word, which was in the beginning before sin was, and it will judge all thy imaginations and vain conceivings, and it leads to the Inheritance incorrup∣tible, out of corruptible; if thou hast an ear to hear, thou mayst hear, it is that which will let thee see thy vain frothy imaginations, which thou hast of God, and will condemn all thy vain imaginations; and hating it, it will be thy condemnati∣on, and there is the issue of it; and all such as steals other mens words, and the true Prophets words, and never knew the life that was in them, all such we deny, and shut them up within utter darkness, where they, and thou art; and for the glorious things that thou and thy Partner speaks of, which call your selves the two last Witnesses, it is manifest that your mysteries are as in thy Book, and thy queries, where thou putst Elect and Reprobate together; and as for tryall of spirits, we give liberty, and exhort all that may to try, and we direct them to that to try by, which is infallible and eternall, whereby they may see and comprehend thee and all who have not the Spirit. But that they should try, who have nothing to try with, let all such be silent for ever, for none understands the Spirit, but the Spirit with which we see thee, and all who stands in their imaginations are ignorant of it; therefore stop thy mouth in the dust; and be silent. 9 Quer. Do not they that speak to a people that declares against all appearances, which are contrary to his way; discover himself unto a true discerning Spirit, not to be of the Lord unless they can demonstrate a spiritual Commission that he hath received from Heaven, by voyce of words through the glorious mouth of the Lord; so that no mortal man can disprove him, though few for want of understanding receive him. Ans. The, Way that leads to the Father is but one, which is Christ, and he
that declares from him, made manifest in him, declares against all Sects, and Opi∣nions, that which thou calls appearances, and the Way is one, and the Truth one, where there is no rent nor division, and he that dwels in the life hath discerning, and he that witnesses the annointing discerns, he is able to judge and discern, and in that thou art seen, who wouldst sit on the throne, but thou must come down and lick the dust, dust is the Serpents meat, and they who had their Commission from God, and have their Commission from God now, they were made manifest to every mans Conscience in the sight of God, and this we witness, this the Scripture witnesseth, and he that believes hath the witness in himself, and the father bears witness, and they witness the voice of the Lord, which is spiritual, speaking to them, and they declare from that which is spiritual to the Consciences of Gain∣sayers, and this is witnessed; but thy voice of words is carnal, and is denyed; and who art thou made manifest unto? that which is mortal cannot discern and disprove thee, but that which is immortal can, and they who are guided by the immortal denies thee, and will receive none of thy Testimony, because it is not the same which the holy men of God witnessed, and doth now witness, which voice shakes the Wilderness, and rents the Rocks, and makes the Earth to reel to and fro; but to thee this is a mystery, and sealed. 10. Again he that speaketh of an invisible spiritual God, or Christ living in the Con∣sciences or Spirits of men, thou sayst, He questions the truth of all the Scripture records concerning the Life, Death, and Resurrection, and Ascension of the blessed Body of Christ into the Throne of his Immortal Glory: And doth he not question, Whether the Consciences of the Saints being sprinkled with the Blood of Iesus, which dyed without the Gates of Jerusalem, are purified from the pollutions of the Flesh and Spirit; doth he not question the Resurrection of the Souls and Bodies out of the Earth at the last Day? Answ. Here again, thou hast made thy shame and ignorance manifest, and knows not so much as the Letter of the Scripture; Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ, not by the will of man, and a Minister of the Everlasting God, he witnessed the Son of God revealed in him; and he said, Know ye not that Christ is in you, or else you are Reprobates; And Christ is not divided; And he that is joyned to the Lord is on Spirit; And I and my Father are one; And where Christ dwells the Father dwells; And if thou hast an ear to hear thou mayst ear, and if the same Spirit be not in you that raised Christ from the dead, you are none of his; and he that declared these things spake of a spiritual Christ, and an invisible God; and who shall ascend up to Heaven, the word is nigh, in thy mouth and in thy heart, and this is the same Christ that suffered without the Gate at Ierusalem, and no other which Paul travelled till he was born in them, if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear; and the Apostle did not question the Scripture records, for they spoke it, and recorded it, and they witnessed the Life of Christ, and his Death, and Resurrection, and Ascension, and they witnessed him ascended above Thrones and Dominions, and to sit at the right-hand of the Father; and we witness the same Christ made manifest in us, and his Resurrection, not because Paul said so, but we have seen it, and are Witnesses of it; the same that ever was, the same that did Ascend, the same did ascend; this is a riddle unto thee, and seven seals is upon it, and thou that queriest shall never see them opened; and they who had Christ in them, and the Father, and the Son supping with them, they had their Consciences sprinkled, and none else; for his blood thou knowst not; and so I say un∣to thee, thou art not sprinkled, nor thy Conscience purified from dead works, and they who know Christ in them, and no more after the flesh come to know his Re∣surrection, he is the resurrection, he is the first and the last, who knows him risen, and have seen him witness the first day and the last; what speaks thou of a last day, that never came to the beginning, and so thy soul lies in death, and in chains, and in utter darkness; and therefore lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and see where thou art, and the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures thou canst not witness. 11 Quer. If after death there is no bodily Resurrection for the Spirits of men to possess
an immortal Glory to eternity, or to suffer an eternal Devil-like shame, according to their deeds, whether good or evil; Is it not one of the vainest things in the World to discourse of God, and Righteousness, unless it be for earthly Gain amongst men? Answ. There is a Resurrection both of the just and of the unjust, the just into everlasting life, and the unjust into everlasting shame and contempt, and every one shall receive according to his works, whether they be good or evil; but this is a mystery hid, for none knowes it, but through death; but what knowest thou who art yet alive in sin, what shall be in the resurrection which is after death? which whoever comes to know the resurrection, knowes the end of all things; therefore it is not taking their words, nor thy own imaginations, that is Faith, nor if thou know Christ no nearer than Ierusalem, nor no nearer than above the stars, thou knowst not where, but through thy dark imaginations, this is not to know Christ risen from the dead; see therefore what hast thou seen in thy self: But thou art dead while thou livest in that nature, and at the resurrection contempt and shame will be thy portion; and turn in hy minde to that which shews thee sin, and witness the body and sin destroyed within, and then, and not till then, shalt thou know how it is in the resurrection. 12 Quer. Thou raises a question from Pauls words to the Athenians, and didst before condemn them that stole other mens words, and here thou hast stolen a Query; and thou askestwhat think you; did that spiritual Creator dwell and sive in the Athenians Consci∣ences? or did his glorious person visibly appear in the highest heavens? Answ. The Athenians to whom Paul spoke worshipped the work of their own hands, as this Generation doth their own imaginations, and that God whom ignorantly they worshipped at a distance, which God lived in Paul's Conscience, Paul declared unto them; and they looked, as thou dost carnally, thinking God to be carnal, and at a distance; but he said, he was not at a distance from every one of them, for in him they lived, moved, and had their being; and this was the God which Paul preached of, which Creator, we witness, lives in the high and holy place, and with him also that is of a humble and a contrite spirit, and trembleth at his Word. 13 Quer. And thou sayest, what think you, can there be any living Spirit without a bo∣dy, or person to display its life, in, or from, and must not the Creator of necessity be a glorious personal substance, and thou sayest, doth not these men that worship an infinite Spirit without any bodily form, living in mens Consciences, glory only in a god of eir own imagina∣tions instead of honouring the onely Lord of all life, the man Iesus, yesterday, today, and for ever? Answ. That which is not possible with men is possible with God, which God is a Spirit, as Jesus Christ saith, and a spirit hath not flesh, and bone, nor a created body, but displays it self as it pleases, contrary to thy will, and the will of all men; and thou who wouldst by thy reason tye the Creator, with a necessity, to a personal Beeing, art void of the knowledge of God, and led by thy corrupt reason, which shall never know God; and all those who wor∣ships God in Spirit, worships an infinite Spirit, which Spirit inhabiteth eternity, and lives in the Consciences of the Saints, and this is not to glory in an imagination, but a witnessing of the same eternal Truth which the Saints witnessed which spake forth the Scripture; for they witnessed Christ to dwell in them, and the same God they worshipped, whose temple they were, and not another, and the same we witness, and this to the honour of the Man Jesus, who was yesterday, today, and for ever. 14 Quer. The eternal Spirit, Creator, and alone everlasting Father, which dwells essentially in the glorified Body, as our Lord Ies his eternall Son, and virtually reigns in all the Saints, Elect men and Angels, be Record between me and you world with∣out end, whether this Epistle shall not be sent to you, and all the chosen that shall peruse it, principally for the establishing of your tender spirits upon that eternal spiri∣tual Rock Iesus Christ God and Man in one distinct body, or person glorified, and onely honoured with all spiritual praises from Elect men and Angels when this World
is consumed into ashes, and all time or times is swallowed up into eternity or eterni∣ties. Ans The Eternal Spirit, which is the Everlasting Father, which thou sayst is essen∣cially in the Son; thy word [essencially] I deny, and thy voice, yet Christ and the Father is one, and the same Spirit that dwells in the Son dwels in the Father, which is one, I and my Father is one; the same dwells in the Saints; thy word [virtual] I deny, the same that dwells in the Father and in the Son, the same dwells in the Saints, not distinct nor divided, For he that hath seen the Father hath seen the Son, and he that hath the Son, hath the Father also; and Christ is not divided. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one: and he that is joyned to Christ is one spi∣rit, and not distinct nor separate; if thou have an ear thou mayst hear; and that eternal Spirit, which is the Father and the Son, which dwels in the Saints, is Judge of thee, and by that Spirit I judge thee, that this Epistle came not from him to none of the chosen, for they who are chosen deny thy voice, and what dost thou speak of Elect and Angels, with whom God dwells, when in thy fourth query thou saidst, they were defiled? and the holy Ghost saith, He dwells with no uncleanness, and so speaks con∣fusion, and Babylons language, which is the land of thy nativity, from whence all these things have been spoken by thee, and all that shall ever be established with thy declaring, or thy Epistles, shall be thrown down; for the Rock shall beat thy Image to pieces; and therefore leave off thy speaking of him, and of thy distinct body, and of his glory; for when he shall appear in his glory, instead of thy praises, thou shalt bowl and lament, and wish the mountains to cover thee; and he who is out of time shall consume thee to ashes, who stands in time, and in the airy Philosophy and imagination, and thy great words [etetnity and eternities] shall stand thee in no stead; for that which is Eternal was before thou wast, and shall be when thou art brought down to the pit with all thy imaginations: And so that thou mightst not glory any more in thy shame, I have answered thy Queries, and for the simple ones sake, that they might not be stumbled by thy stumbling queries, who dwell not in the Light. EDWARD BURROUGH.
An Answer to a Book, called, Choice Experiences, Given forth by I. Turner. Also the Copy of a Letter sent to the Assembly of those that are called Anabaptists in Newcastle. I Have met with a Book called, Choice experiences, given forth by one J. Turner, who by Iohn Spilsbery in his Epistle, is called, a Daughter of Syon; and her self declareth in the 109. pag. of her Book, of being brought out of Babylon into Syon, but all along through her Book, he language is one and the same, before her comming out of Babylon, and in Syon (as she saith) her language is the language of Babylon wholly; and she is yet a servant in bondage in Babylon unto the Mistress of Witchcraft, and never came to witnes freedom in Syon; for I know her voyce, its the language of her City where she now dwells, which is in confusion in Babylon. And whereas she declares of some particulars which she calls Decits, whereby she was deceived, in the 109. pag. in that which she calls, the fifth note of experience, concerning notions and pretended spiritualities in which Satan transforms hiself into an Angel of light, and how the Lord was pleased to recover her out of deceit. I answer, It is plain to the spiritual man which discerns of truth and deceit, that she is yet deceived and unrecovered out of deceit; and here I charge her that she belyes the Lord, for he hath not recovered her out of deceit; for she hath resisted him in that work, as is made appear in her Book; and she is now in notion, and not in power, and in pretended spiritualities, and not really in the Spirit; and Satan is now transformed in her into an Angel of light, by which she is deceived; and whereas she talkes of her choice experienes, death yet raigns in her, and is no whit subdued; I speak as in the presence of the Lord, who am moved to lay open her deceit to the simple, who doth blaspheme the God of Heaven in his Saints, in calling Truth error, and calling that deceit, which by the Spirit of the Lord I own to be truth, and calls those corrupt Principles, which were owned by the Ser∣vants of the Lord in former Generations, and which are owned now by them which witness the same Spirit, which Spirit of Christ she makes appear, she knows not, who hath denied him, and salvation by him, within. Whereas she speaks of Satan envying her happiness, and waits his opportunity to catch her, as a Fish in the Water, covering his book, with a baite of Mystery and spirituality. I answer. She is yet in the power of Satan, he hath already catched her with his covered hook, which is covered with a very fair out side, a fair Form of Truth, a likeness of it, with the likeness of a Church, and of a Baptism, and of a Fellowship, &c. is she beguiled already, and is unhappy through the opportu∣nities which the Devil hath waited over her; for she it under the curse, lying in the fall and enmity. And whereas she speaks, Of having escaped him in his former appearances as a Devil yet now transforms himself as an Angel of light. I answer. She hath not escaped him, as a Devil; and here she is a Lyar, for his appearance is in her, in lying and in speaking evil of those things she knows not;
and he is transformed in her as an Angel of light, but she knows it not; but lyes in darkness, in the mystery of iniquity, in notion, and the pretence of spirituality. And she saith, Those that are so deceived are the fittest Agents to promote his Kingdom. I answer, Here it is made manifest, she, who is deceived, by the Devil, doth much promote his Kingdom, by strengthening the hands of evil doers, who through her writing hardens their hearts against the truth. Whereas she speaks, Of Satans drawing persons by corrupt principles, which they would have trembled at the thought of, before they had such principles. I answer. This is her own condition, she is drawn by Satan, to follow corrup principles, which, if she did see, she would tremble at the sight of them. And she saith, God was not onely pleased to keep her from such things, but to discover the way by which persons are brought to such things. I answer, Here again I charge her that se belies the Lord (which is Blasphemy) for he hath not kept her from corrupt Principles; he would, but she hath resisted him; and the discovery from God to her, will be plagues and wo; for death and darkness raigns, which makes manifest themselves in her, which is her discovery. She speaks, of avoiding those ways, and forewarning others to avoid them like∣wise. I answer, She hath not avoyded the wayes of darkness, but hath chosen them, and hath avoyded the way of truth, as is made manifest, who hath denied salvation by Christ within; and as she hath avoyded the way of truth her self, so she casts a stumbling-block in the way of the simple to avoyed it likewise. Whereas she speaks, of discovering Satan under these vails, and saith, by barkening to the voyce of the Tempter she was deceived, and beguiled by him, in some particular things. I answer, Satan is not yet discovered to her, but lyes under his vayle in Flesh, deceiving her; and by her bearkening to the voyce of the Tempter, she is now deceived by him, not in few things, but in many: I speak it as in the presence of the Lord who shall judge of her and me. And she speaks of ever being humbled in the presence of God for it. I answer, When the dreadfull God shews his presence, she cannot stand, but shall be confounded, who doth here speak to the dishonour of his Name: True humility she knows not, for the man of sin is exalted in her above all that is called God. And whereas she speaks, of beginning to be somewhat confused in her judgement; and she speaks, of not being swallowed up with confusion. I answer, She is in confusion, and hath never been out of it, as to every single eye may appear; she is not only somewhat in confusion, but is rowled and swallow∣ed up in it; and it is long since it began in her. Whereas, she speaks of being weak in Principles. I answer, It it true, the Principle which is of God, is, and hath been weak in her, for it is over-powred by the Principle of Deceit, which is not weak, but strong; and which rules and Guides her in her own will. Whereas, she speaks, of being with a people, and by them being deceived in some particular things: naming onely three things; the first whereof is. That godliness being a Mystery; that it did consist of something within, and not of some∣thing without; and that the Saints were to expect life and salvation from a Christ within, and not from a Christ without. I answer Godliness is a mystery; the Image of God, which is Godliness is a mystery hidden from the eye of I. Turner, and from all vulterous eyes; and this mystery is within, in life and power consisting of the new man Christ Jesus, who is the Image of God made manifest within the Saints, in whose Image man is like God, godly; and this mystery is not in outward things, in word or declaration, or outward practice, though where this mystery is made manifest, godly practises will flow from it to without; but yet the power, life, and mystery
of godliness is within, and cannot be seen with the carnal eye, not comprehended with the carnal mind. And here I charge I. Turner, in the presence of God, that she knowes not the mystery of Godliness, who blasphemously calls this a corrupt Principle; and here it is made manifest, that she is in Babylon yet, and is de∣ceived and bewitched by the Devill: I bear witness to the truth, and to this particular, and against her who denyes it. And the Saints have Life and Salvation from Christ made manifest within, which is the same Christ which suffered with∣out; and this I affirm, that till Christ be revealed within, there is no Salvation, nor Life partaked of. The Scripture saith, they were Reprobates in whom Christ was not; And the Apostle said, Christ in you, the hope of glory; and Christ lived in him, which was his ife and Salvation. Where Christ is not made manifest within, the Serpent is Head, and the Devil is King in the heart; and this I witness, and do declare it, as in the presence of God, that till Christ was made manifest within me, I was not saved, nor had no life as to God, though I was high in Profession and Knowledge outwardly. And here again I. Turner hath shewed forth her blindness and sottishness to all, and may stop her mouth for shame, and confess, that she is a bondslave in Babylon, who calls this a corrupt Principle, which is the Way, Power and Life of Religion and Salvation, which is Christ Jesus within made manifest in the Saints, which takes away Sin, and destroys the Works of the Devil; and she and all others, who walks and lives in the flesh, following the lusts and desires of it, living to their own wills in the broad-way, and talks of Salvation by any thing without, will be deceived; for nothing will present to God, but the Righteousness of Jesus Christ revealed, which takes away sin, and sets free from it. And now for the second Principle, That Saints were not to do duties by, or from a commmand without, but from a command within; and that the Word command in Scripture, was not a command to them, till they had a Word within them. I answer, That is no command from God to me, what he commands to another; neither did any of the Saints which we read of in Scripture act by the command which was to another, not having the command to themselves; I challenge to find an example for it; they obeyed every one their own command, one was sent to Baptism and to Preach the Gospel; another was sent, not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel. And thou I. Turner, or any other, who goes to duty, as you call it, by imitation from the Letter without, which was commands to others, in your own wills and time, your sacrifice is not accepted, but is abomination to the Lord; for you go without the moving of the Spirit, in your own wills and strength, which God hates, and which his wrath is upon. And I charge her here, as in the presence of the Lord, that she knows not what a command from God in Spirit is; but is ignorant, and not a daughter of Sion; and let her mouth be stopped, and let shame strike her in the Face, who professes her self to know the Lord; and let all be ashamed of her who professes themselves members joyned with her in Church; she hath made manifest the ignorance of them all. Now for the third particular, That as to the time of doing duties, they were to wait for the moving of the spirit, to carry them forth to it; and this they called, Wayting for a power; and till they had such a power, they were to do nothing, but sit still, and wait; and this not onely in private duties, but in Church also; not owning any Ministery by way of gifts of Office, but to come together, and there sit still and wait till they had a power, and then to speak whether man or woman. I answer, who dare call this a Principle of deceit? none but who are led by deceit, and such is I. Turner, who puts light for darkeness, and darkeness for light; all duties, as she calls them whatsoever, if the moving of the Spirit do not carry forth to act them; then the movings of the corrupt will and vain mind carries forth; and who act from such Principles, are accursed from God. And I. Turner, and all who denies to wait for the movings of the power of the Spirit to carry forth, but goes before the moving of it, all their Prayers, Preachings, Or∣dinances, and Churches, I do deny, and declare against, by the Eternal Spirit of
God that they are odious and abomination in the eye of the Lord; and is no duty which he accepts, whether they be done in private, or in the Church. And that Ministery which is not carried forth by the moving of the Spirit of God, but of man, and in the will of man, which Ministry is hated of God; and she which denies waiting upon God, till power be given in from God, to act and speak for God, hath denied the way of God, and the practice of the Saints in former Generations; and wo is unto her, who makes the simple believe this to be deceit. Whereas she saith, in these particulars, which carried such a face or shew of spirituality, she was corruped, but did never fully own them in judgement nor practice. I answer, O blind deceived spirit, which calls these but a shew or face of spirituality; she calls the substance a shew, and the shew or likeness, a substance; And wo unto her, which calls good evil, and evil good; these particulars by the eternal spirit, I own, and walk in; but that spirit of deceit, and Antichrist in her, hath denied them, and calls them deceiveable, and saith by them she was cor∣rupted; let her be ashamed, and all of her Faction; it was the Principle which led her from these things, by which she was corrupted, and which hindered her to own them and practice them, and which now makes her declare against them; which Principle is the spirit of the false Prophet, which now rules, which I know will never own nor practice these things. She also saith, She did oppose those Principles which led to looseness, either in conversation, or in slighting the Churches or Ordinances of Christ, though she believes such Principles natur∣ally follow the others. I answer, She did, and doth oppose the Principle of God, which would have led her out of pride and lust, into an holy conversation; and out of false Churches, into the Church which is in God. And I charge her here, that she believes Lyes, and utters what she believes, which is Blasphemy; who saith she believes that wicked Principles naturally follow the three named by her And whereas she saith, As to that Principle of waiting, she could yet never come up to it in practice, in private duties, she could not stay so long from duty, till she had such a power, but did frequently go to duty when she had it not. I answer. Here I do believe her she speaks truth, with her lying spirit; she never yet could wait upon God, to act for him, but hath run in her own will, which is abomination to him, which is no acting for God, but for self, and for the Devil; and here hath she shut her self out, from the holy men of Gods practice, who waited upon him to be led by him, by the power of his Spirit; and she shews her self openly to all, that she went to that which she calls duty in her own power and time, and knew not the power of God, nor his time to be acted in; and all her Duties, as she calls them, is no more but imagined and imitated from the letter without, acted by the Serpents strength and wisedom in her; and she hath here plainly discovered that she knows not what waiting upon God is, in truth and sincerity. She saith, She thought sometime she had had it; and saith, she thought she had had communion with God. I answer, Her thoughts I do deny, who call truth deceit; and she did, as now she doth, live in thoughts and conceivings, by which she is beguiled; that spirit which rules and speaks in her, never had communion with God, but is contrary to him; nor never was acted in the truth of God, but against him. She saith, She knew no Scripture-ground for the practice of waiting to be acted by the power of the Spirit, and led to duty. I answer, The Saints ground of acting, is not the outward letter, but the Spirit which gave forth the letter; but the Scripture doth declare of such as waited to be acted by the Spirit and Power of the Lord: Dare any say, the Saints Prayed or Propresied, without the movings of the Spirit and Power of the Lord? here she hath shut her self among the Heathens, who knows not God, nor what it is to be acted by his Spirit and Power.
She speaks of losing her peace, and having little or no communion with God, nor scarce any thing to speak to, or for God. I answer, True peace in Christ she never knew; for there is no peace to the wicked: neither have any, who denies waiting upon God, as she hath done, any commu∣nion with God, nor nothing to say to, or for God, but through deceit, and in deceit is I. Turner. That which brought her into trouble, and let her see the confusion (Which she speaks of) which she had lived in before, but saw it not till then; that Witness I own, and it shall witness for the Lord and the Truth of what I say eternally; though she have slain the Witness, yet it shall arise to her condem∣nation, and her everlasting misery. And whereas she saith, Some laboured to perswade her it was a dispensation of God, and that the Saints, after brought out of Egypt, must be in the Wilderness, before they come to Canaan. I answer, I bear witness by the eternal Spirit, the truth of this particular, as having witnessed the same condition; and she which hath denied this to be of God; hath openly shewed her self to be of the Devil, denying the truth of Scriptures. She saith, this did not at all satisfie her, but she continued in a sad conditi∣on. I answer, She here hath shewed what spirit she is of, of the viperous Generation which fled the wrath which came upon her, and could not abide the judgement; and of the spirit of them which would have been back in Aegypt, which murmured, and therefore, with them, she entered not, but i perished with them in the Wilderness. Whereas she saith, She was never so troubled with temptations, as at that time. I answer, Here she hath shewed her self to be the stony ground, which when temptation came, withered away. She speaks of a particular temptation, which was, Questioning the Being of God. I answer, That which was troubled, wrought the temptations; and not that which troubled; and here she shews her ignorance, which cannot discern the ground of temptation, but layes it upon God, which is basphemy; for he tempts none to evil. Whereas she saith, this was the  fruit of her straying from the pure wayes of Truth. I answer, Here again she shews her blindness, who knows not that temptations are for good: That which she calls, straying from the pure wayes of truth, is other∣wise; for the stronger man came to dispossess the strong man, and then began the war, and happy had she been, if she had patiently endured to the end; but not abiding under the judgement, but starting aside, she is cast out, and must not enter; for the second Beast whose deadly wound is healed, is alive, which makes war with the Lamb, which exerciseth all the power of the first Beast: and here I. Turner is under the dominion of the second Beast. She speaks of blessing God that she strayed no further. I answer. She who hath denied to wait unto Prayer and Praises, but prayeth in her own strength and time, her Praise is abomination to the Lord, and she calls that, straying from God, which was leading unto God, and so hath forsaken the right way, and hath cast the way of God behind her back, and resisted him, who would have led her out of darkness, and out of confusion. Whereas she speaks of God remembring her. To which I answer, he will remember her to plague her, who hath brought dishonour to his great Name, and hath called his way, the way of error, and of deceit; and his real Truth, a shew or notion; she hath chosen her own way, the way of destruction. Whereas she speaks, being turned from owning these particulars, she was restored to those joyes that once she had.
I answer. She is returned with the Dog to the vomit, and with the Sow to her wallowing in the mire, and there's her joy; and she now joys in the earthly dust, in Forms and Traditions, and likenesses of things, and knows not what it is to joy in God the Substance, as by her writings it is made manifest, who hath denied Salvation by Christ within, and hath denied to wait upon God for the Power of his Spirit, and calls them deceitfull Principles; she hath chosen the way of Death, rather then the way of Life, and hath taken her self to follow shaddows and likenesses, and neglected the Substance, which is Christ within, the hope of glory; her latter end is worse then her beginning, and the Parable is fulfilled upon her. And she speaks in the 126. pag. of Satan being discovered under his vail; and in particular, as to that of being saved by a Christ within, and not by a Christ without; and the Lord was pleased to shew her it was quite another thing, differing from the Gospel, and that it was attended with this evil consequence, to overthrow the whole Gospel, and to deny the Lord that bought them. I answer, I charge her here, as in the presence of God, with belying the Lord, and with horrible Basphemy; who saith, That that which the Saints and servants of God witnessed, who Preached the Gospel and established it, (Christ within manifested) is quite another thing differing from the Gospel, and that it is attended to overthrow the whole Gospel: O horrible Blasphemy, and belying the Lord, who saith, that the Lord was pleased to shew her it; did ever he shew any Lyes? all take notice of this wicked and horrible Blasphemer; the Lord rebuke that unclean spirit of Antichrist in her. She goes on, and saith, then secondly, as to that of waiting for a power to Pray, and that here was no command but from within; concerning both these, the Lord was pleased to shew that it was not according to his minde, but a meer invention of Sa∣tan; and that it was attended with this evill consequence to slight Scriptures and Commands of God, and to expose the soul to Satans deceivings to walk by the ima∣ginations of their own heart, instead of the motions of the Spirit. I answer, The Saints waited for the moving of the Spirit, which was power in them to help them to pray, they knew not to Pray as they ought without it, and this command and help, they had not without them, but within them: And I again here charge her with belying the Lord, and with notorious Blasphe∣my, who saith, that that which the Saints witnessed (waiting for the power of the Spirit to Pray) is not according, to the minde of the Lord, but an invention of Satan; and she is not ashamed to say, the Lord shewed her, and the same which they witnessed, who spoke forth the Scripture, and which walked in the Commands of God, tends to slight Scriptures and commands of God, and to expose the soul to Satans deceivings: this is Blasphemy and Error, and corrupt Principles: and she which hath denyed waiting, to be led by the motions of the Spirit, is led by the imaginations of her own heart, is under the power of Satans deceiving, and speaks contrary to what the Scripture speaks, and so slights it, and the Commands of God; she hath Blasphemed the God of Heaven, and accordingly will the Lord requite her. And thus have I for the simple ones sake declared the truth, and every single eye may see, who it is is led by corrupt principles; and what I have written shall she eternally witness to be true, and all her co-partners. And I pass by the rest of her Book, as not worth answering, for it is nothing but airy imagination and confusion, and death yet raigns in her, and in her Book is spoken out by her; and she knowes not the Baptism of Saints, nor Communi∣on, nor the true Church of Christ; to that witness in her conscience do I declare, and when it shall arise, it will eternally witness me. Whose Name in the Flesh is EDWARD BURROUGH.
The Copy of a Letter, &c. FRiends, (for so I call you) I was moved of the Lord to come into your Assembly, to declare the truth from him, concerning you, as by the eternal Spirit was revealed to me; and I do acknowledge it, it was a mercy from the Lord that I had that small liberty which I had, to clear my Conscience amongst you, and to discharge my duty, in obedience to the Lord, and to every ones Con∣science am I made manifest, whether you will hear, or you will forbear: truely Friends, there is somthing among you which I own, and which is owned of my Father; but yet many things hath he against you, and as I said, I now again say from the mouth of the Lord, that your Covering is too narrow to hide your shame, and your bed too short to stretch your selves upon; Now friends, the Ordinances of Iesus Christ, which you act in, (you say) in obedience to him, I do not speak against, but do witness them in life and power; neither do I judge such amongst you who have entered in at the door, by the Principle of God, to the Ordinances, (if any such) but you I do declare against, and do judge by the infallible Spirit, who have in your own wills thrust in your selves, and acted by imagination and immitation from the Letter without, and not having received the Command from Christ into your selves; such I judge to be in deceit, deceived by the Serpent, which deceives the simple, by the likeness of a thing; and you that limit the Lord to any outward visible thing, that without such, can be no Salvation, you I judge again to be in deceit, and my judgement shall stand; for nothing is available, that which God once commanded, nor that which was not commanded, but the new Creature, which is born of the immortall Seed, contrary to the will of man. Truely, Friends, you are acting in darkness, and there is no seperation in you betwixt the precious and the vile, betwixt the clean, and the unclean; for that which did convince you of false Hirelings, and of their deceitful worship, (which is owned of my Father in you) hath not been obeyed by you, but your minds have been drawn forth from within, to obey a thing without; and herein have you been bewitched from the obedience of the truth within, to obey the letter without; as they were which the Scripture speaks of; and you are acted in another form; and likeness then you were before, and which some are acted in yet, but by the same spirit; and you have a zeale, I beare you record, but it is not according to knowledge; I declare against that spirit, by which you are now acted, as knowing it to be the spirit of Antichrist; and that which is owned by my Father in you, is oppressed by you, by your wisdom and reason which stands above, and is head, and rules amongst you, which is for destruction, and for the Lord to accomplish his wrath upon: and happy were you if you knew the day of vengeance, which is the acceptable year of the Lord; but you are yet full and rich, and think you have need of nothing; and have a name that you live, but you are dead, and empty, and miserable; your form is corrupted, and you seek the living among the dead, and you act in the form, but walks at liberty in your own wills, despising the daily cross of Christ, which if you walked in, would bring down the high minde, and high nature in you; and through the Cross, that which is low in you would be exalted, and the witness of your Ordinances would you have within, which you are seeking in the letter without. And now Friend, to the who wert the Speaker when I was present among you; thy Name I know not,
but by thy nature and spirit, thy spirit is the same which they speak from, which thou seems to deny as false spirits; and by that spirit hast thou been deceived, and now it workes by thee to deceive others; and that spirit infallibly, by the eternal Spirit do I judge; for the time is come, that by the Saints, the great Whore must be judged, which hath made all the men of the Earth drunk with the Wine of her Fornication, and which hath deceived the simple. And whereas thou didst Quaery, what one thing I will deny as untruth which you had spoken▪ I answered then, as now I do; I do deny thy voyce and spirit, for  is the voyce of the stranger, and, not of Christ: and though you sweare by that spirit, The Lord lives; I say surely thou swearest falsely; and the false Prophets which used their tongues, and said The Lord saith it, when the Lord had not spoken unto them, spoke the same words of the true Prophet; but he that had the true spirit judged the false spirit, and so it is now. And therefore Friend, out of love to thy soul, I do advise thee to be silent before the Lord, and wait upon him, till he manifest himself to speak in thee, and by thee; for Friend, thy Ministry is in the will of man, and thou ministers death unto dead minds; and the Ministery which is to the Seed, thou art ignorant of; to that in thy conscience I speak, which shall witness for me before the Lord, who is appearing in his power, to utter his thunders; and all Flesh shall tremble at his presence; and all Forms of Worship will he dash to pieces at his appear∣ance; And yours, which is the purest Form, shall be broken to pieces, that he may rule, who is without form and comeliness. Now Friends, for the Seeds sake have I spoken and written to you; and to that in your consciences have I cleared my consci∣ence, in the presence of the Lord, which you shall Eternally witness, whether you will hear or forbear: By a Servant of the Lord, who is named of the World, Edward Burrough.
An Answer to a Book, called, A Voice from the word of the LORD, by one Iohn Griffith, against us whom the World calls Quakers, wherein his false Accusations is denied, and he proved to be a Slanderer, and the Truth cleared from his Scandals. A Certain Book being come forth into the world, full of Lies and Slanders against the Innocent, called A voice from the word of the Lord, to those grand Impostors called Quakers; to the Author of which Book (who calls himself Iohn Criffith, a Servant of Christ) and to all to whomsoever it may come, I am moved to write something in Answer, that his lies and slanders, and false reproaches may be made manifest, and that he may proceed no further; for as Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses, so doth he resist the truth, being a man of a corrupt mind, and reprobate concerning faith, and is not a Servant of Christ, nor a witness for his Name, but a child of disobedience; in whom the Prince of the aire rules. And first to the title of thy Book, I Answer, the Word of the Lord is powerful, and will cut thee down, thou sensual minded man, it thou knowest not, but takes the words of others declared from the word which was in them. and thou useth thy tongue, and saith the Lord saith it; but I say unto thee, the Lord hath not spoken unto thee, neither commanded thee to speak of his Name: and I charge it upon thee in the presence of the Lord God of Life, that thou art of that Generation which Ieremiah was sent to cry against, Ier. 23. 31. for thou speaks thy imagina∣tions upon their words which dwelt in the life of God, but the life thou knowest not, and thy whole Book is no more but an empty sound and voice, and is as the untimely fruit of the womb which will wither and perish away: and one of them I am whom thou calls Quakers, to whom thou sayst, thou directs thy speech; but that we are grand Impostors, I do deny, for we are gathered up into the life which the holy men of God lived in, and are fallen from the world, and from its wayes and nature: and I charge thee here to be a slanderer, and from the mouth of the Lord I do declare unto thee that thou must have a slanderers reward. And whereas thou sayst, thou hast discovered their fleshly and filthy mindedness, together with the judgments of God attending them. I Answer, Fleshly and filthy mindedness, we have denied by the Power of the Son of God made manifest in us; thou hast laid it to our charge, but thou hast not proved it, nor discovered it, and here again thou are a false Accuser, fleshly and filthy mindedness shall stand for thy own condition; for there thou art in the flesh & filth, living to thy will in the lust of uncleanness, for thou mayst remem∣ber thou camest out of the Bowling-Alley to our Meeting, though Pharisee-like thy out-side is painted and made clean, but thy heart is full of enmity and lies, and slanders, and false reproaches, to that in thy conscience I do speak which shall forever witness me, and as for the judgments of the Lord upon thy own head will they fall, and with what measure thou metes it shall be measured to thee again;
we are passed from judgment, and from the condemnation, and who art thou thou enemy of righteousness, that shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect. And whereas thou sayest thou art one that bears witness against those wandring starres. I answer, this shall stand for thy own condition, a wandring star thou art, and hath no habitation in the Heaven, but speaks swelling words of vanity, thou thy self being a servant of corruption, we have an abiding place, and an habitation in the Lord, and are not wandring; and here again I charge thee to be a false Ac∣cuser, and a false witness, who bears Witness of thy self; for the Father bears no witness of thee, but against thee. Whereas thou sayst the most high God that made the heavens and the Earth, hath moved thee and stirred thee up to bear witness to the Truth, and to witness against the abominable fleshly mindedness, and yet spiritual pride of those grand Impostors called Quakers, by whose sorceries many are bewitched and drawn from the simplicity of the Gospell, to another Gospel, which is not another Gospel, but the vanity of their own minds and their own fleshly and corrupt thoughts which they cry up as Oracles of God. I answer. The most high God judge between thee and us; whose wrath is kindled against thee, thou enemy of righteousness, and Child of wrath; thou hast belyed the Lord of Heaven and Earth, for to this he moved thee not, for he moves none to utter lyes and slanders, as thou hast done, but the spirit of enmity, and of the Devil, hath moved thee; and to the Truth thou bears no witness, but against the Truth, and against the Innocent; and charges us with fleshly minded∣ness and spiritual pride. O thou Lyar and false Accuser, the Lord who takes our part against thee will plead with thee, and render upon thy head according to thy deeds; prove what thou speaks that we are fleshly minded and spiritually proud, or else let thy mouth be stopped and shame cover thee forever; Sorceries and witchcraft, and drawing from the simplicity of the Gospel we do deny; but the plain single Truth we do declare, by which the eye of the blind is opened in many to see your deceits who call your selves Churches and Preachers of the Gospel; which is not the Gospel that the Apostles preached, but an adding your own Imaginations upon their words, who witnessed the Gospel, and it shall stand for thy own condition, thou art in the sorcery and witchraft; who draws people to observe an outward visible thing, from the Light of Christ within them; which leades to the simplicity of the Gospel, which is inward and not outward; and thou art in thy fleshly and corrupt thoughts, crying up the Ordinances and Oracles, of God, which are but carnal and beggerly rudiments of the world, which passeth away; and here thou art seen and made manifest, in the Light of Christ, to be a Hypocrite, who falsely accuses others of that which thou art guilty of thy self; the same Gospel as ever was, do we declare; and not another, which we received not from man, neither was taught it by man: and as the Oracles of God it shall stand forever for a witness against thee, and all the world who doth not believe; for even the Father beares witness of us, and therefore our witness is true; and the righteous God will plead with thee thou Lyar and false Accuser, and here be a witness against thy self that the Lord moved thee not, but the Devil, acting in thy own imaginations, and in the vanity of thy own mind, and in thy one fleshly and corrupt thoughts. And whereas thou sayest to us thou directs thy speech from the Lord, Thus saith the Lord to thee, O Quaker, thou art fleshly minded. I answer, It is not the voyce of the Lord to us that speaks in thee, but the voyce of the Devil, and the Serpent which speaks from thee: fleshly minded we are not, but are redeemed out of it, and our mindes are changed and are Spiritual, and 'tis the Spirit of the living God seals unto us, and witnesses in us; and here thou art of thy Father the old Dragon, and Accuser of the Brethren, but it is God that justifies, and who art thou that condemns? and this thy speech is seen and com∣prehended, which thou hast directed to us, and it is judged, by the Spirit of true
judgment to be a false Accusation and a Lye, and not the Word of the Lord, and into the Lake amongst the false Prophets thou art to be turned, who useth thy tougue when the Lord never spake to thee. And thou sayest we look upon the Iustitution of Christ Supper with a fleshly and carnal eye, because we say, that the bread and wine which Christ commanded his Disciples to eat and to drink, is carnal. I Answer, The bread, and wine, is visible and carnal, and fleshly, and not Spiritual, nor Eternal, and in the eternal Light, by the Spiritual eye of God opened in us, we see them, and do own that it was a command of Christ, to stand for its time, and no more, but a carnal figure of a spiritual thing, and the spiritual thing being the Substance bearing witness, the figure is de∣nied and declared against, and thou and thy Generation who art acting in those things by tradition, tying and limitting God to a visible thing, (that without it no salvation) art in the sorcery and witchraft, and an enemy to the substance; for Christ never since he was sacrificed brake of the Bread, or drank of the Cup with his Disciples, but new in his Fathers kingdom; and thou who art in the arnal figure, acting those things without the injoyment of Christ, art sensual, and by the Light of Christ art to be condemned and judged with the world, who art without God, and without the injoyment of Christ, in the beggerly rudiments of the world. Thou sayst, O fleshly minded men whom the god of this world hath blinded because you believe not: and thou sayst, thus saith the Lord, and speaks the Prophet Malachic words. To which I answer; this again I do deny; the god of the world is cast out, and the eye is opened through judgments and our fleshly minds are judged, and in the Name of Jesus we do believe, and our belief in him hath purified our hearts; to the praise of the Living God, who hath wrought all our works in us, and fo us, do I speak without boasting; and here again I charge it upon thee, that thou art a slanderer and a false accuser; and let shame cover thee who professes thy self to be a Teacher of others, who thy self is not taught of the Lord; but steals Malachis words, and speaks them to us in thine own imaginations, and calls it the word of the Lord; the Lord is against thee thou false Prophet, who prophesies lyes in his Name; and that which thou speaks to us is thy own condition, and that which shall come upon thine own head, for a child of disobedience thou art, and thy eye is blinded by the god of this world. And whereas thou sayest we are spiritually proud, that give forth our selves to be some great ones; and we say we are Apostles, and are not, but are found Lyars, proud Pharisees, Hypocrites, that say we are Iust, Holy, Humble; and the poor sinful Publicans are more justified then we. I answer; proud we are not, our God shall judge between thee and us in this thing, for we have nothing but what we have freely received from him: and that we give forth our selves to be great ones; here thou art a Lyer, and a false Accuser again; this we have said, and do yet again declare that we were moved of the Lord of Heaven and Earth to come to declare his mind and his Truth in this City; but this is no boasting, and by that same spirit which was in the Apostles, were we moved, and are guided, and by no other; but who hath found us Lyers since we came, I challenge you, and all thy Sect to prove one lye that we have uttered; or else let shame cover thee, and let thy mouth be stopped; and let thy own heart condemn thee to be found the lyer thy self; and this we testifie against thee, and all the world, that by Jesus, and in him are we made Holy, Just, and Humble, he is made these things in us, and for us; and the Publican state is wit∣nessed by us who have passed through the figure and parable into the life and substance. And whereas thou sayst we that boast of our light within, and faith, thus saith the Lord, and brings Christs words. I answer, this is another lye, we do not boast of our Light within, but we witness
it to be within us, and to have enlightned every one that comes into the world; which thou and thy Generation denies, and so would make Christ a Lyer, and the Scripture a Lye; but against you all, with all the world, we bear testimony, & the Fa∣ther bears witness with us, that every man that comes into the world is enlightned by the Light of Christ; which teacheth righteousness, unto all that loves it but con∣demn them that hate it, whereof thou art one who utters forth thy lyes and Slanders, and false Accusations against the Innocent; and that Scripture Ioh. 9. we own, and do witness to be fulfilled in us by the coming of Christ; he which did see, is Blind, and he which was Blind now sees; and while we did see, our sin remained, but being Blind we have no sin; but this to thee, and to thy spirit, is a mystery sealed, and never to be known in that nature and wisdom; and here again thou hast used thy tongue false Prophet like, and must receive a false Prophets reward. And whereas thou sayst, if Christ had not spoke to us in his word, we had no sin, but now we have no cloak for our sin. I answer, Christs words we own, but here thou art made manifest to all to add to the Scripture (in his word) this thou hast added false Prophet like, and therefore the Lord will add his plagues unto thee as the Scripture saith; be ashamed and blush, thy folly and wickednesse is made manifest, who is not ashamed (to carry on thy designe) to add to Christs words. And whereas thou sayest we do not only neglect the weightier matters of the law, but t law it self, teaching men so to do; for we said that the Scripture is not the rule of faith and conversation, as one of us taught Sept. 27. in thy hearing, and many others that will witness it. I answer, here I challenge thee to prove that thou hast spoken, and all thy witnesses which thou speakes of; oh thou Lyer be ashamed to forge such Lyes, and declare them in writing for Truth, we neglect not the weightier mat∣ters of the Law, nor the Law, nor teach any so to do; all that ever heard us will bear witness against thee, and they (though our Enemies) shall wit∣ness for us, and against thee in this thing; for we declare the Everlasting Gospel, which is the fulfilling of the Law; and this we declare, that the Law must have its thorow operation before the Gospel be witnessed; and one of thy own society said to us, we had preached the Law, and brought men to understand  from Grace; now let all take notice of the confusion you live in, and let your own hearts condemn you, and the light in your own consciences convince you, that you are in Babylon, and in confusion, and are no true Church of Christ, where all are o one heart, and one mind: and this again I affirm, as before I did in thy hearing that the Scripture is not the Saints rule, but the Spirit which gave forth the Scripture, as the Scripture it self witnesses, Rom. 8. Faith was before the Scripture was, and therefore the Scripture is not the ground of it, but a Declarati∣on of it, and no other faith we own but the faith which Abel had, and which Mo had, which was when no Scripture was written, and that we own to be the Rule of our Conversation, which they walked by, the immediate Spirit of God which was before the Scripture was written; and all you who profess the Scripture to be your rule, your own rule shall testifie against you when the eternal God judges you, and they who witness that to be their rule which gave forth the Scripture, walkes up in the life of the Sdripture more then you all; and you are proved to be but the Iew outward, who boasts of the Ordinances from the Letter, but persecutes them by slanders and false reproaches, who witness the Substance; and your praise is only of men, and not of God; and the same woe which thou pronounces upon us will fall upon thy own head, for this thy grievous slander, that we neglect the Law, and teach men so to do. And whereas thou brings many Scriptures, and saith, thus saith the Lord. I answer, the Scriptures we own, and by that spirit which speaks them forth, we witness them to be true, and they are ours; and though you say they are the savour of death to us that perish, yet thou art found a Lyer, for we are saved out of the perishing state, and death is destroyed through death, through faith, and
thou hast diminished from that Scripture 2 Tim. 3. 15. false Prophet like again, and so art both an adder and a diminisher, and thou mayst read thy portion in Rev. 22. 18, 19. And whereas thou sayest, know this thou perverter of the right way of God, thou shalt be judged by the word that Christ spake. I answer, here thou sets the Scripture in the room of Christ, and art the perverter of the right way of God thy self, for the Scripture saith, all judgement is commited to the Son, and the Scripture is not the Son; and thou didst say and now again writes, that the Scripture shall judge the world; and so I charge it upon thee, that thou art a Blasphemer, who exalts the Scripture above the Son of God, and shalt be judged by the Son into utter darkness, and into the pit from whence thou art come; yet this I testifie, he that receives the Son re∣jecteth not those words which was spoken by him; though thou and thy Generation Pharisee-like may make a profession of the words which Christ spoke and yet reject the Son, and all to whom Christ speaks, which receives him not, shall be judged by the word which he speaks; for he speaks eternally, which shall stand eternally; but when did he speak to thee? For this I do declare, thou mayst have those words which he spoke, and yet never have heard his word nor voice; as the Pharisees had those words, which God spake by the Prophets, but never had heard his word, nor seen his shape. Iohn. 5. And thou sayst quake and tremble at this; that word which you reject and dispise sha judge you at the last day; and sayst, thus saith the Lord, and bringst Christs words, and the Apostles words. I Answer; The Lord rebuke thee thou Scorner, here thou hast made the filthiness of thy heart known, for out of the abundance thereof thy mouth speaks: here thou art seen to be a Scorner; quaking and trembling we own, it is that which the holy men of God witnessed, but here be a Witness against thy self, that thou art a Scorner of their conditions: what hast thou to do to talk of the Scripture, who art scorn∣ing that which it declares of? Here thou art made manifest to be one that hath the form but denies the power, and scorns at it, God scornes thee, thou scornful one; and let all that feare the Lord depart from thee, and see thy filthinesse and search the Scripture whether it testifies not of that, which thou scornes at, and makes a mock upon. And that we reject and despise the Scripture and the words which Christ spake, which thou accusest us of, this is another lye, and a false slander, for the Scriptures we own in their place, and by the Spirit of God sets to our seale that they are true, but that they shall judge the world we do deny: and herein thy ignorance doth appear, and that thou art blinded by the god of this World, which thou wouldst cast upon us: and Christs words, and the words of the Apostles shall fall upon thy own head, for vengeance in flames of fire will the Lord render upon thee, thou Lyar and Slanderer and false Accuser, who art in disobedience to the Gospel of God. And whereas thou sayst the Lord hath spoken it, and it shall surely come to pass, and bringst many Scriptures. I Answer, The Scriptures we own, and what is spoken in them shall be fulfiled; but thou Lyar, when did God speak this to thee? the judgements pronounced in them shall fall upon thy own head, because thou art guilty of the same iniquities, as they were of, against whom these Scriptures were decla∣ed. And wheras thou sayst we are those that the Lord before hath spoken of in his word, (and therefore no marvel we would not have men to read it) and cites the 2. Peter Chap. 2. I answer, I do in the Presence of the living God deny thee and thy false asser∣tion, but it shall stand for thy own condition; thou art one in the Generation which Christ spake of, and that was in the Apostles dayes, who hath the form, but de∣nies the power, as they had: And I charge thee again with a Lye in thy mouth, who sayst, We would not have men to read the Scriptures; they who have heard
us shall witness against thee, that we do direct to search the Scripture, whether our doctrine be not true, and by the Scripture shall our doctrine be tried; how long wilt thou utter thy lyes in the Name of the Lord; the Lord will plead with thee, thou unclean lying spirit; and that which thou pronounces against us, shall come upon thy self: And thou sayst, We through Coveteousness make merchandize of some. We challenge thee, and all the City of London to prove this, thou ly∣ing Serpent, God shall plead with thee; we are free and clear in the sight of God, of thy false accusations, and have neither desired, nor sought after any mans Mony, nor Gold, nor Apparel, God is our Witness, and many in this City knows the fame, though thou slanderously, as an Enemy of God, dost accuse us; but I challenge thee in thy reply to this, make it appear what thou assertest, or lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and let shame strike thee in the face for ever; I charge thee, that if thou canst, make it appear plainly in particular, (and do not darkly ac∣cuse us) what those damnable heresies are, which we bring in, and wherein we deny the Lord, and what our pernicious wayes are which thou falsly and slanderously accuses us of, and wherein we are fleshly, and despise government, and are presum∣tuous, and wherein, or how we speak evil of Dignities, and wherein we are as na∣tural bruit Beasts, and what these things are, we speak evil of, which we know not, and what our swelling word of vanity are, and whom we do allure through the lusts of the flesh, and through much wontonness? In the presence of the Lord I challenge thee to prove the particulars of thy Accusations, and not to slander in the dark; though such as these there were in the Apostles dayes, who were turned out from the Light, and the Apostles which dwelt in the Light saw them; and such a Generation there is now, they are seen and known where they are, by them who abides in the Light; but of these thy false slanders upon us, we are clear in the presence of the Lord God, and that portion which thou wouldst give unto us must thou have thy self, for with what measure thou hast meeted, it shall be measured to thee again, even the blackness of darkness for ever, and the Day of the Vengeance of God is at hand against thee. And whereas thou sayst, We pretend to tremble: [Its true, we pretend the exam∣ple of Moses] and thou sayst, O abominable hypocrifie and dissimulation, will that ju∣stifie your shaking your hands like Idiots, and your raving like mad-men? Moses was a  in whom the fear and dread of the Lord was, who kept his Word, but you despise it; who lo∣ved the Law, but you reject it. I answer, We do not onely pretend to tremble, but oft do we, and have we witnessed it, by the mighty Power and Dread of the Lord upon us, and we walk not by the example of the Servants of the Lord without us, but the same Power we witness which was in them, by which they were made to tremble which thou scornest and deridest, and calls it madness: The holy Men of God were counted (by such as thou art) mad-men, (and were cast out of their Assemblies) which trembled at the Word of the Lord: But that we despise the Word and Law of God, here thou art a Lyar again, and the Plagues of God hang over thy head, for thy Lyes and Slanders against the Innocent; the same fear of God which was in Moses we witness, and no other, and thou who art without it art a Heathen; and Moses and Ieremiah, and Habbakkuk, which thou speakest of were our example, who walked by the same Spirit, and served the Lord by the same Spirit; but that we served out fleshly lusts, which here again thou accusest us of, I do challenge thee to prove it, but I know thou canst not, and therefore art in the nature of the Devil, accusing the Brethren; and to walk by tradition we deny, which you also would lay to our charge; but the same Spirit by which they were acted, acts us the same way according to its measure; and the same Light in which they walked is our Light, and this Light is the Light of Christ within us, and not without us. And whereas thou sayest, its true, If we served the Lord, and kept his Word, it would make us to tremble, as it doth those that fear him, but we have rejected the Law of the Lord, and the Word which he hath spoken: And the Lord when he comes to shake ter∣ribly the Earth, shall give us our Portion in the Lake that burns.
I answer, Let all the World here take notice of thy confusion and ignorance which utters forth it self through thee; thou before wast scorning of trembling, and now thou art approving of it; and if it be they that tremple which serve the Lord; here be a Witness against thy self, thou servest him not, who art not yet come to tremble, but art in thy high nature, above the fear of the Lord: and here again thou art found a false Accuser, for we reject not the Law of the Lord, nor the Word which he hath spoken, but live in it, and rejoyce in it daily, for in it is our hearts delight: And here again, as thou hast measured to us, it shall be measured unto thee, when the Lord God arises to recompence his Enemies, thy Portion will be the same, as thou hast said, in the Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone, And now a few words in answer to that which thou calls, A Caution to all that are called Saints in the Nation, which may concern all people. I answer, They who are Saints, who dwell in the Light, and walks in the Light, do discern thee to be no Saint, neither will receive any caution from thee, but will testifie against thee; for thy Lyes & slanders and false accusations which thy Book is filled with, and herein it may concern all people, that thy Lyes and Slanders be re∣proved and laid open, lest they receive thy Lyes for the Truth; and be deceived by thy subtil Speeches; who brings the Prophets words, and the Apostles words, wrest ing them, and falsly applying them, to make thy Lyes to be received; but all people who love the Light wherewith Christ hath enlightened them, will see thee, and de∣ny thee, and turn away from thee, as having the Form of Godliness without the Power. And whereas thou sayst, Ye may rejoyce that you live to se, not only the mystery of Godliness, but also the working of iniquity in the fleshly corrupt and sensual minded men, cal∣d Quakers. I answer, That name Quakers, was cast upon us by the Heathen; through their scorn and derision, as the name Christians was upon the Disciples; though quaking we own, for all the Holy Men of God witnessed it, and the Holy Scriptures de∣clares of it; and here again thou enviously, and maliciously, castest a Slander upon us, Fleshly, Corrupt, and Sensual-mindedness, and the working of the mystery of Iniquity, is destroyed in us by the mighty Power of God made manifest in Jesus Christ, which takes away sin; to the praise of the living God I speak, in clearing the Innocent from thy false Slanders, and it shall stand for thy own condition, fleshly corrupt, and sensual-minded, and the working of the mystery of iniquity; And herein I prove thee to be so by thy Fruits, thy Lyes, and false Reproaches, and envious false Accusations, which is the fruits of the flesh, and of corrupt sensual-mindedness, which fruits do appear in this thy Writing, and as for the Mystery of Godliness, it is hidden from thee, and in that mind and nature thou shalt ne∣ver know it; for thou livest in the sight of thy own Pollution, and of thy carnal Ordinances, and not in the injoyment of the Mystery of Christ, which is God∣liness. And whereas thou sayest, Ye may rejoyce, and in nothing be terrified, because the Scriptures did foretel of such, and is fulfilled in these men: And thou bringest many Scrip∣tures, where Christ and the Apostles prophesied of the coming in of false Prophets, and Teachers. I Answer, Though ye do now rejoyce, yet your joy shall be turned into sorrow and howling, and the Lord hath said it; and the day of terror will overtake you, wherein your hearts shall fail you for fear, and your foundation shall be re∣moved; and its true, that the Scripture doth foretel of us, and is witnessed in us, That all the Lord's Children should be taught of the Lord; And that the Lord would gather his Flock out of the mouths of all dumb Shepherds, &c. and ac∣cording to our growth up in the Life of the Scriptures, they are fulfilled in us; but false Prophets we do deny, though all those Scriptures which thou hast set down we own to be prophesies of false Prophets, those false prophets which Christ pro∣phesied of, came in the Apostles dayes, they saw them comming in then, 1 Iohn 2. 18.
And as all these Scriptures testifies which thou hast cited; and since the Apostles, dayes, hath been a great Apostacy, and not a true Church of Christ could be found, and ever since hath the same Generation of false Prophets stood under several forms and appearances, deceiving the Nations: But now the pure Light of Christ shines, discovering to them, who walk in the Light, who they are, and daily more and more clearly shall they be seen, and thou wilt be found in their number, who art a cursed child, in whom the son of perdition is exalted, which utters forth thy Lyes and Slanders sensually, and make it manifest to all, that thou hast not the Spirit of God, but are separated from it, in self-seperation which is abomination unto God, and must be scattered by him. And whereas thou sayest, Seeing it is so, let you be filled with boldness, and let you contend against those ungodly Ones which are now risen. I answer, ungodliness we deny, and your boldness shall the Lord turn into weak∣ness, and faintness, and your contendings against us shall not prosper, for this is our heritage; every Tongue that riseth up in judgment shall be condemned; you shall all be scattered and driven away as Chaff before the Wind, who sets your∣selves to contend against the Truth; for that which is now risen shall confound you all. And whereas thou bringest many Scriptures, which were Exhortations of the Apostle to the Saints, with exhorting thy Brethren. I answer, The Scriptures I do own, and that Spirit which spake them forth I witness, but thou art an Enemy to the Power of them; though thou hast the Form of Truth, thy lying and false accusing hath made thee appear to be an Enemy to the Life which the holy Men of God lived in, and so hast cleared thy self from those Scriptures which were written to the Saints, and must own those which were written to the World; The Lyar must be cast into the Lake; the Wicked must be turned in∣to Hell; and such as these thou must own to belong unto thee, and these are thy Scrip∣tures which thou hast right unto. And whereas thou sayest, We talk of high enjoyments and great revelations without, above and beyond the Scripture, and that we talk of a Light which is besides the Scripture, but its deep, and thick darkness; and what hath such lights led men unto? even contempt of God, and of all Righteousness, I answer, Here again thou art found a Lyar, and an Accuser of the Brethren, for what we do declare, the Scripture witnesseth to the same, and we speak of no∣thing but what is declared of in the Scripture by the Holy Men of God, and nei∣ther without it, nor above, or beyond it, do we speak: I challenge thee (to prove what thou hast asserted) and all the City of London, whether we have spoken or de∣clared any thing, but what the Scriptures bears witness to; and the Light which we declare of, is the Light of Christ, which the Scripture saith hath enlightened eve∣ry one that comes into the World; and it is not besides the Scripture, so as contrary to it, but the Scripture bears witness of the Light: And here I charge thee with Blasphemy, who calls the Pure Light of Christ thick Darkness, and that the Light of Christ (which is the Light which we declare of) hath led men, or leads any to contemn God, or his Ordinances, or Righteousness; let shame strike thee in the face, thou impudent one, who blasphemously sayes, that the Light of Christ is thick Dark∣ness, and leads into contempt of God; let the Light in thy own Conscience con∣demn thee, thou Enemy of God; for thy Lyes, and Slanders, and Blasphemy, which in this thy Book thou hast uttered. And whereas, Thou exhortest to labour to see an excellency in Christ, in the Word of Christ, and in the Church and Ordinances of Christ. I answer, For the simple Ones sake, that they may not be deceived; none ever shall see any excellency in those things, but who owns and walks in the Light of Christ, which lets every one see themselves first; and your talking of the same, and report of Christ, and of his Word and Ordinance, is not to know the excel∣lency of those things, for death in you talks of the same, but the thing in Sub∣stance you are ignorant of; and you who stumble at the Light wherewith Christ
lighteneth every one; are above the Door, which is the entrance unto the life of these things: And so I exhort all to mind the Light of Christ, and to walk in it, and it will lead unto Christ from whence the Light comes, and it will lead to the fulfilling of Christs Words, and to the one Bread, and to the one Baptism; and the Light is the Door and Entrance unto the Life of those things: But you who hate the Light, and deny it to be in every one, hath but the Husk and outward De∣claration of those things, and are without the Life. And whereas thou sayst, They that are of God will hear John, Peter, and Paul, and the rest that were the Servants of Christ, not the fleshly conceits of those, or any other men; and Christ Sheep hear his Voyce, and a Stranger they will not hear. I answer, They that are of God, do own the writings of all the Servants of Christ; but many may profess their words, as the Pharisees did the Prophets words, and as thou dost now, and yet not be of God, but children of the Devil; but that our conceits are fleshly, I do deny, for all conceits of the flesh we deny, and bears witness against, and it shall stand for thy own condition, and thy voice is the voice of a stranger, and they that are of God will not follow it: though thou bringst the Saints words in thy mouth, as the Devil did unto Christ; yet in the Light of Christ thou art seen, and comprehended, and from the Light of Christ answered, and by it judged to be without the life of those Scriptures which thou speakst of, and they are to thee but as an empty sound. And whereas thou cites many more Scriptures, which are exhortations of the Apostles to the Church, and exhorts thy Brethren with them. To which I answer as before. The Scriptures I do own, but, to thee, thou envious man, they do not belong, for as in this thy writing thou art proved a Lyar, and a Scorner, and a Slanderer, and a false Accuser, and a Blasphemer; out of thy own mouth, be a Witness against thy self, and let all thy whole Assembly bear witness against thee, that the Scriptures which were spoken to the Saints who walked in the light and had denyed ungodliness, do not belong unto thee who art an hater of the light, and lives in the pollutions of the world; but the Scriptures will surely be fulfilled upon thee, The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and the Lyar shall have his portion in the Lake, and he that works abomination is to be troden in the winepress of the wrath of God without the City, and such like. And now somthing in answer to some things in the Epistle to the Reader. Whereas thou and the rest of you there say, although the light hath appeared, yet there is a Generation of men in the world, that do hate the light, and endeavour to put it out, crying against the Scriptures of Truth; its a dead letter, and against the form of doctrine therein contained. To which I answer, It is true, the light hath appeared; Christ who is the Light lightneth every one that comes into the world; which light hath appeared in every mans conscience; and there is a Generation which hates the light, and you are of that Generation which say, every man hath not the light, and calls the Light of Christ thick darkness, and endeavour to put it out; and here you have read your own condition, though you make a large profession of the Scriptures (which is not the light, but words declared from the Light) as the Iewes did profess the Prophets words, but persecuted Christ, and spoke against him, who was the light and substance of the Prophets words: and if you know any who cry against the Scripture, and against the doctrine therein contained, we cry and declare against such, for the Scripture we own in its place to be a true declaration of God, of Christ, and of the Saints conditions, but they are not the light, but Christ is the light, as themselves bear witness, nor are they the Saints guide, but the Spirit that gave them forth, as they themselves bear testimony, neither were the Scriptures given forth to give your own imaginations and suppositions upon, but they themselves are doctrine, and are as they speak, he that hath the same spirit which speak them forth, reads them and understands them, and none else. And whereas thou sayst, Lest that simple plain meaning men should be kept in Babels dark∣ness,
or the enlightned fall into the errour of the wicked, for that reason your Book came to publick view. I answer, truly you are deceived, who think to gain into your form, the simple, plain meaning men by Lies, and false Slanders and false Accusation; who are simple and plain unto God, will descern your deceits, and how falsly you have accused the innocent, and will see you to be in Babels darkness; and who walks in in the light wherewith they are enlightned will see you to be in the errour of the wicked, and out of the Truth; and it is well for the Truths sake, that your Book came forth, that thereby your filthiness and deceitfulness, and enviousness might be laid open to the simple. And truly I say unto you, you have, and will miss of your end in putting forth this Book of yours. And whereas you say you shall be willing at any time to vindicate every conclusion therein con∣tained against any that shall oppose. I answer, I challenge you all in this particular to prove those accusations which you have laid to our charge whom you call Quakers, in many particulars, which before I have demanded; what they are is before spoken of. And whereas you say, you account that light within (not witnessed by the Scripture without) which some so much talk of, to be deep darkness. I answer, if you know any who speak of any Light which the Scripture doth not witness of, we with you freely declare against such, and such a light is darkness, but the Light of Christ which we speak of, which hath enlightned every one that cometh into the world, I hope you are not so impudent, but you will ac∣knowledge that the Scriptures speaks of this light; and dare not deny, but that the Scripture witnesses that Christ is the Light of the word; for as I said, we freely give way, and desire that all might search the Scripture, whether these things be not so as we declare. And whereas you say, and exhort to let the Scripture be the rule of faith and practice. I Answ. Here you would alwayes keep people in darkeness, under your teaching, and would make void the new Covenant which is the Law written in the heart, and the Spirit of the Lord put in the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of the Saints; for who walks by the rule without them, and teaches men so to do, would make void the Covenant of life and peace, where the Teacher is not removed into a corner, which Teacher all that have faith and an holy Conversation do witness, which teaches not contrary to what the Scripture speak but is a teaching and ful∣filling of the Scripture, and an establishing of it, though thou and many may pro∣fess the teaching of the Scripture and may in your own wills, conform unto it in the outward appearance, as the Pharisees did, and yet be but Hypocrites and deceived as they were; and I say again, that faith was before the Scripture was written, which faith is declared of in the Scripture, which faith comes as is mani∣fested by hearing of the word preached, which word is even in the mouth and in the heart, if you have an ear you may hear; and now I advise you all in the Name of the Lord to cease striving and contending against the truth; for verily the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands, will dash your image of many mixtures to peices, and it falling upon you, will grinde you to powder, and your conforming the outward man, to an outward thing, and teaching men so to do, and limitting and tying the Holy one to a visible thing, will not cover you in the Day of the Lord: nay verily, though concerning the Scripture without, you may walk blameless, yet one thing will be found lacking, even the cross of Jesus Christ, by which all sin is crucified in them who walk in it; and I say unto you, that your covering is to narrow, and it will not hide your secret parts: for in the eternall Light of Christ you are seen and comprehended, your beginning, your time, and your end; for though you have the Scriptures, and Jewish like, walks up in the outward appearance of them, crying up the Ordinances and Churches, yet your praise is of men, and not of God, for you are enemies to the life of the Scriptures, as is made appear by your many Lyes and Slanders against
us, which you have uttered; and I say return your minds every one within to that in your own consciences which reproves you in secret for your secret iniquities, it will let you see where your hearts are, and how far they are mor∣tified to the world, and the love of it, and this light wherewith every one of you is enlightned is the Light of Christ, and it is the Lords true Witness and shall witness for him eternally against all whose deeds are evil, who walk in dis∣obedience of it; and all who love it, and walk in it, it leads unto Christ, and into all purity and holiness and uprightness of heart towards God and man; and this light leads unto justification, all te who are taught by it; and her is your Teacher, loving it; and your condemnation eternally, continuing to hate it. And thus I have answered thy Book, and the Truth is witnessed, and many false Lyes and false Accusations denied and testified against, and thus I rest, waiting for an answer to clear thy self (if thou art able) of those things which I hae denied, which thou hast charged upon us, for God is my Witness, this I do desire, that Truth may be made mani∣fest and imbraced, and Deceit and Errour discovered and denied. By one who is a Witness, against the Deceits of the World, called, Edward Burrough.
TO THE 1655 Camp of the Lord IN ENGLAND. TO all you Called, Chosen, Elected, and Beloved of the Lord, who are of the Circumcision made without hands, of the Seed of Abraham; who are Iews indeed, not after the flesh but in the Spirit; unto whom belongs the Everlasting Promise and Covenant, which God hath, and is fulfilling in you, and establishing with you: We your Fellow-Citizens of the Heavenly Ierusalem which is the Mother of us all; and of the same Body, and of the same Seed, and same Birth, begotten and brought forth by the immortal Word of Life, which lives for ever, do send greeting, and do imbrace you in the Arms of our Beloved, who is, and is to come, God blessed for ever: You who are called Quakers, who are so, not onely in word, nor in shew, but in Life and in Power; whom God hath called & chosen to place his Name in, and to take up his Habitation among, above all the Families of the Earth; the Tabernacle of God is with you, and his Dwelling-place is among you, and onely among you is God known, and his Name is great in your Assemblies. We who are of the same Root and Off-spring, do bring in our witness, and do set to our seal, That God of a truth is with you, and among you; and he is the God of the living that answers by Fire; he is, I am, and there is none be∣sides him, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End of all things. Praise him for ever ye Redeemed of him; lift up your heads, your Redemer is come; clap your hands, and shout for joy, and let the everlasting Praises of God be in your mouthes for ever and ever: Exalt ye his Name above all gods, and glorifie him in the sight of all the Heathen, and let his marvellous Works stand upon Record from Generation to Generation. Wonderful hath his Work been among you, and that my soul knows right well; you that were scattered in the cloudy and dark Day, and were a prey for the wild Beasts of the Forrest, and were driven away as lost Sheep in the Wilderness, hath God gathered into the Fold, to lie down by the Springs of Living Water in fat Pastures for evermore. Your Bread is sure, and your Waters never fails; a Feast of fat things is made unto you, of Wines well refined; the Lord is become the Lot of your Inhe∣ritance, and the Portion of your Cup forever. Your Crowns have you laid down at the Feet of the Lamb, and your lives and liberties have not been dear unto you; and let this never repent you, for now the Lord will exalt you, and Crown you with Immortal Glory. The Everlasting Day-Star is risen among you, which gives Light unto the Na∣tions; and the light of the Sun is as the Light of seven dayes; and there is no need of a Candle in your Dwelling, but the Lamb is the light thereof; fair as the Sun, clear as the Moon; yea, it is he which was dead and is alive, and behold he lives for evermore. Praise him all ye people, praise ye him ye holy Host; let all that hath breath praise him for ever. Who can express his noble Acts? And who can declare his wondrous Works? Oh, my Soul is ravished, and my heart
is overcome! let me speak that I may be refreshed, and let me declare his Wonders among all People. The Lord is our King, our Judge, and our Law-giver, and our Rock of defence; Just is he in his Judgments, who hath avenged us of our Enemies; Mercy and Judgment meet, Righteousness and Peace do imbrace each other. Rejoyce for evermore ye Saints of the most High, and tell it to your Children, that they may tell it to an other Generation what the Lord hath wrought among you, and what his Hand hath brought to pass. Salvation is come, and plentious Redemption, and the dead hath heard the Voyce of the Son of God, and liveth. Let sorrow and mourning flee away, and be ye comforted ye that have mourned, and be ye refreshed ye that have been weary; for God hath opened the Everlasting Fountain, and the Streams run pleasantly, which refresh the City of our God; He is come and his Reward is with him, even he for whom we have waited; this is he, who is our Life, our Peace, and our exceeding great Reward; the Light of the World is our Saviour, but the Worlds Condemner; our Peace, but the Worlds Torment: Glad-tidings glad tidings, the acceptable year is come; praise ye the Lord ye Sons and daughters of Sion, beautifull is your dwelling place, and aboundeth with pleasant fruit, for you are digged and pruned and enclosed a Garden of lovely branches; let the wonders of the Lord never be forgotten, nor his works never pass out of your remembrance, for he hath wounded and healed, killed and made alive, raised the dead, and slain the living, brought out of captivity and bound with chains, gathered and scattered, brought low and exalted, saved, and condemned; all this hath your eye seen, and your ear heard; and the Heavens and the Earth hath been burned as a scroule, and the indignation of the Lord you have born: But the Winter is past, and the Summer is come, and the Turtle dove, and the singing of Birds is heard in our Land. O magnifie his Name for ever; you are made vessels of honour wherein the everlasting Treasure abideth, which never waxeth old; the voyce of the Bridegroom is heard among you, and how can you have any more sorrow? instead of weeping, rejoycing; and instead of heaviness of heart, fulness of everlasting joy: the Lord hath fulfilled his promise, and made good his word, and his Law and Covenant is with you; and from you doth the Law go forth, and the powerfull Word of Life, and Death soundeth out of your Dwelling and you are Gods only witnesses to testifie of him in the presence of all Nations, some of you by suffering, and some by declaring: Oh endless love, and life, and riches, an eternal Crown is upon your heads, and your suffering (which hath not been a little) is not worthy to be compared with the glory that is and shall be revealed. I speak to you who have an ear to hear, my soul and heart is comforted in you, in the midst of my burdens and sufferings, who is separated from you outwardly, yet joyned and united to you by the Spirit which is unlimited, which doth comprehend all Nations: yea I behold your beauty afar off and my heart is ravished with it, and I am sick of love: let his works praise him forever, which he hath wrought, for his Dwelling is with you in the Light, unto which no mortaleye can approach. The new Ierusalem is come down from Heaven, and no unclean can enter: but you are made white with the blood of the Lamb, and purged as silver, and purified as gold in the burning, and unto you an entrance is given, and the way is prepared, and the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her self ready, and the Way of the Lord is pleasant to you, and his Commands are not grievous; no unclean thing can pass over, nor no Lyons Whelps can tread therein, but it is called the way of holiness, where only the ransomed of the Lord do walk; even your Mountain is established upon the top of all hills, and all Nations shall flow unto it. Sing praises for ever, for the Kingdom of endless peace is come, which passeth understanding, and of glory, which on mortall eye can behold, and of life which no flesh can live in. Oh my beloved, come up hither and I will shew you what God hath done from you, he hath rebuked the Sea, and driven back the floods of waters which compassed you about, and he hath scattered your enemies with a whirlwind, and be hath given you to feed upon the flesh of Kings, and of Captaines. Can you
call to mind the doings of your God, and his marvellous works brought to pass, and not cry out in praises for evermore, O drink and be refreshed, and eat and be satisfied for ever, and let your soul delight it self in fatness; the planting of the Lord you are, and his own purchased Possession; he hath separated you from the womb, and hath called you out of kindreds, and ye are the Royal Seed of the Off∣spring of the Lord Almighty, and all Nations shall call you blessed. And O thou North of England, who art counted as desolate and barren, and reckoned the least of the Nations, yet out of thee did the Branch spring, and the Star arise which gives light unto all the Regions round about; in thee the Son of Righteousness appeared with wounding and with healing; and out of thee the terror of the Lord proceeded, which makes the Earth to tremble and be removed; out of thee Kings, Princes and Prophets did come forth in the Name and Power of the most High, which uttered their voices as thunders, and laid their swords on the necks of their Enemies and never returned empty from the slaughter. Though I be as by the waters of Babylon, in a strange Land; and as a Pilgrim and Stranger destitute, but not forsaken; as dying but behold I live; yet if I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning, and let my Name be blotted out of the Book of Life. O how I love the holy Seed which in my eye is precious! No man can hinder my boasting of thee, for I am sealed among you in the Record of eternal life, to be read among you in the light where I am known to you, and where my unity stands with you in the love and life, which never changes, and you are my Mother, and my Brother and Sister, who doth the Will of my Father; Our God is a consuming fire, and his Habitation is compast about with dread and terror. The Heathen shall see and fear, and the Inhabitants of the Earth shall tremble; o God is everlasting burnings, and it is tempestuous round about his Throne, and he reigns for evermore; and though thou be despised and set at nought, and counted as the off-scouring of all things, and the scorn of the Heathen, yet thy King reign upon Mount Sion, and if he utter his voice all flesh shall tremble, and before him thy Adversaries shall fall, and thy Persecutors shall be confounded, for tho shalt never be forgotten of thy God, but with his arm will he defend thee, and compass thee about, and thy seed shall be increased, and thou Ierusalem shalt be made the praise of the whole Earth, for among you is laid the sure foundation, and the tried stone, Christ Jesus the Light of the world, in whom you have believed, which unto the Nations is a stumbling stone; but unto you precious: bring in your testimony, and set to your seal; is there salvation in any other, but in him who is the Light of the World? Nay there is no redemption wrought but by him, nor no deliverance but through him; his is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, and he is become all in all; and you are no more of this World, but are of the chosen Generation, and of the royal Priesthood, a people, Redeemed, unto whom there is none like among the thousands of Israel and Iudah, whose God is the Lord, whose Sa∣viour is the Prince of Righteousness, who covers your heads in the day of Battel, and smites your enemies in the hinder parts; and wounds them in the fore-head. And now my beloved, let his Name be had in remembrance for evermore, and let his praises be declared throughout Ages to come, and walk you worthy of his everlasting love, wherewith he hath loved you more then your brethren; let his Name be exalted by righteousness, by purity, and by a blameless life, and bring forth the fruits of righteousness and peace, and let your light shine forth into the world, and your good works abound plentifully; for you are as a City set on a hill, and as a lighted candle to shine abroad; and are created unto good works. Let faith, hope, love and unity be increased among you; and let mercy and judge∣ment and equity flow down and be established for ever; never to be removed. Let joy, and long-suffering and meekness and temperance spring out; and be you per∣fect as your heavenly Father is perfect. Stand upon your watch Tower, and be not shaken nor drawn aside to follow any other gods, nor to bow to any other Image, nor joyn your selves to strangers, and mingle not your seed with the adulterous Generation, nor take not, nor give not in marriage with them; but keep your selves from the Idols of the Heathen, be
not defiled with them; but abide in your strength, you know where it lies, by which you may work good, and be perserved from evil; and you need not that any man teach you, for you are taught of God, and are far from oppression. Ye Children of Light, worship your God for ever, who is light, and in him is no darkness at all, who is the same and changes not, whose mercy endures for ever: Be Followers of the Lamb as undefiled Virgins, and let your soul scorn the glory of Babylon and Aegypt for ever; for you are not your own, but are bought with a price, no more to serve your selves, but the Lord of Israel forever. Put on your Armour, and gird on your Sword, and lay hold on the spear, and march into the field, and prepare your selves to battel, for the Nations doth defie our God, and saith in their heart, Who is the God of the Quakers, that we should fear him, and obey his voice? Arise, arise, and sound forth the everlasting word of war and judgment in the ears of all Nations; sound an Alarum, and make their ears to tingle. Our Enemies are whole Nations, and multitudes in number, of a rebellious people that will not come under our law, which arise up against us, and will not have our King to reign, but trample his Honour under foot, and despise his Law and his Statutes, and count his Subjects as Slaves and Bond-men. Stand upon your feet, and appear in your terror as an Army with banners, and let the Nations know your power, and the stroke of your hand: cut down on the right hand, and slay on the left, and let not your eye pitty, nor your hand spare, but wound the Lofty, and tread under foot the Honourable of the Earth, and give unto the great Whore double, and give her no rest day nor night; but as she hath done, so let it be done unto her; and give her double into her bosom: as she hath loved blood, so give her blood, and dash her children against the stones, and let none of the Heathen Nations, nor their gods escape out of your hands, nor their Images, nor I∣dols, but lay waste the fenced Cities, and tread down the high Walls; for we have proclaimed open War betwixt Michael our Prince, and the Dragon. Your Captains are mighty men, and your leaders are skilled to handle the Sword, and they are riding on before you, Arise worm Iacob, and fear not, but thresh the mountains to dust; for God hath given thee the power of thy enemies to tread upon, and they shall fly before thee, and shalt fall by thy sword; there is none to strong for thee, nor no inchantment against thee; but thou art blessed, blessed world without end. Therefore all ye Lambs of my Father, and ye Camp of the Lords Host, wait upon him to fulfil his Will, for he hath put into your hearts to make war in righteousness against the beast and the false Prophet: and cursed be every one that riseth not up to the help of the Lord against the mighty: the Beast is mighty; and the false Prophet is great; and they keep the Nations under their power. But O thou Beast, and thou false Prophet you shall be tormented together: thou Beast, upon which the false Prophet sits, whom thou upholds by thy Law; and defends by thy unrighteous power, thy power is limited, and it shall be taken from thee, and thou shalt be overcome, and the Lamb shall get the victory, and into the pit and lake of fire shall you be turned to have your resting place. And thou false Prophet which hath deceived the Nations, and scattered the Inha∣bitants thereof, and builded by fraud, and daubed with untempered morter; thy Judgment is past upon thy head already, and the Decree of our God is sealed against thee; thy smoke shall ascend for ever and ever; and of thy sin there is no forgive∣ness, nor of thy torment no remission. Over you do we (and shall for ever) re∣joyce and sing, and over your god and your King, the Dragon that old Serpent; cursed be he, and his memorial for ever. Ye Lambs of the true Shepherds fold, with whom my soul resteth, whether ever I behold you outwardly, yet my heart is with you, and I am one of your fold, and I lye down with you under the shadow of the rock, upon the Mountain which the beast can∣not touch, where we are safe from all our enemies, and am to you wel known, to be read in your hearts, in the Record of the Lambs Book of Life, and known only to the world by the name of, EDWARD BURROUGH.

Several Epistles to Friends in LONDON: Written in the Year 1655. by E. B. Some of which were sub∣scribed by F. H. who was Fellow-Labourer with him in the Work of the Lord. FRiends of God in the Truth, whom the Lord is gathering as desolate Stones to build unto himself a Habitation, whom the Lord is bringing back out of Captivity, wherein you have been held under the Chains of Darkness, in the Land of the shadow of Death the Lord is calling you, and chusing you, to place his Name in you, and to spread forth his glory among you: Therefore all dear Friends, whose hearts the Lord hath touched by his Love, and by his Pow∣er; be faithful unto God, who hath called you; and look not out at any thing that is mortal, to draw you from the Obedience of the Eternal Light of Jesus Christ which shines clearly in Darkness: Resist not the Drawing of the Father, but take up the Cross, and abide in it daily, that your wills may be crucified, in which the ground of enmity lodges: So all in your own conditions wait in the Fear of the Lord, in singleness of heart, and in simplicity of mind for the power∣ful Appearance of the Son of God, to be revealed in you, to destroy the works of the Devil; for where he is not witnessed the works of the Devil stands, and the nature of the earthly man in the fall: All of you whose minds are turned home to within, where the Pearl and the Lost Money is to be found; dwell and walk in the pure Fear, and Obedience to that of God which is made manifest in you, and made known unto you, and there will Peace flow in from the Presence of the Lord unto you, and refreshment and strength to the Seed, and the Pure will live, and the Corrupt will die daily: Beware every one that have put their hands to the Plow, that you look not back at any thing which you have left behind in the World, but press on in the strait Way, which is the Light, which gives no liberty to the flesh∣ly man, but which judges and condemns all that hates it and turns from it; the Light is the Way that leads to Life, and by it as you wait in it the Life will be made manifest, which is immortal, and your Redemption will be witnessed; dwell in the Judgment and in the Burning, that the Dross may be consumed, and the Pure may be refined, and the earthly carnal minds may be confounded and judged: The Lord is near unto you, wait for his powerful Presence in his own Light, to see him, and in it to comprehend all the World, with all its Pro∣fession, which leads not to God, but keeps in the separation from God; your Way is near, walking in the Light you will see it, and in the Light you will see all the paths, and all the wayes of the Harlot, which leads into the Cham∣bers of Death; look not out at words, for that which feeds there, is for the Famine; but dwell in the Light, joyning with the immortal Principle, which receives nourishment from the Eternal Fountain, which the World knows not, nor comprehends, as you grow in the Pure, and in the Life, so you are unknown to the World, and your growth will appear by your obedience in the Cross of Christ; so take off stumbling at the Cross; for such hath no part in the Eternal Inheritance; but walk in the Cross, which is life to the New-man, and death to the Old, and so through Death Life is made manifest, and the pure Life of God arising in all, the World will be trampled upon, and denied by you,
but such amongst you that chuseth the World, wrath from God I declare against you; and you who knows the way, and casts off the Truth, and for the love of that which is visible, turns from the Truth, you cannot escape the Damnation of Hell: So all dear and tender hearts, abide in the Counsel of God, and let not the World overcome your minds, but wait for a daily victory over it, that so you may with the Saints possess the Eternal Riches, and that in you which is carnal and corrupt may be overcome, by that which is Eternal and Holy, as you abide and walk in the Truth, and grow up in the knowledge of the eternal God; so our joy will be fulfilled in you, and our rejoycing will be encreased by you; there∣fore walk and live in that which God hath made manifest in you, which is of him∣self; and the eternal God of Life and Power prosper you, and lead you up unto himself, to dwell and walk in his Love for evermore. Be not troubled at the rage of the World, nor at Temptations, but stand in the Will of God, which hath been declared amongst you; that you may all be establish∣ed and guided by that which is not of this World, but by the Principle of Life, which is Eternal, which judges all the fruits and grounds of Darkness: Our love salutes you all, who walk in the Truth, and our prayers are for you, that Life may spring up in you, to praise the Lord for ever. This was al∣so subscribed by F. H.We are Servants unto you, and unto all the Elect Seed of God every where, for whose sakes we give our selves to be spent, E. B. F. H. To Friends in London. ALl Friends, whose minds are turned to the Lord, by that which is Pure, which comes from him who is the Light of the World; all mind it, that with it your minds may be turned to him, from whence it comes, out of all the perishing things, and out of all the visible to the invisible, that so you may all come to know the Word of the Lord, which endures for ever; which is as a Fire and a Hammer, which breaks down the Mountains, and burns up, and destroyes all that which is acted in that nature which leads into transgression, and into the curse from God: And therefore all dear Friends whose minds are turned to the Lord, and have tast∣ed of his Power, all dwell in his Fear, and keep in your minds from gadding abroad; and that which hath discovered the lusts and filthiness of your minds, and turned your minds from these things, and from that nature that rules in the chil∣dren of disobedience, that so you may all come to know the Life, and that he may lead you, and direct all your minds up in his Fear and Wisdom, that so you may be preserved out of those Paths that lead to destruction, and out of all the deceit∣ful Profession of the World; and in the Light of Christ you will see the rise and ground of all Deceivers, and Dreamers, and all them that speak their own Imagi∣nations, and yet boast of great things, and strive, and contend about words, and feed upon wind, and bring no fruit unto God; and all ye that are not of the Light, and walk not according to the Light are there, and lending your ears to such who act and speak in that nature, you turn from your Guide which is near, and lend your ears to the wicked, and so have walked in Darkness: But now you who have tasted of the Love and Power of God, which all the Profession in the World knows nothing of, in it dwell, and abide in that which hath convinced you, and in that which judgeth you, & abide in it, that so you may witness the Fallow Ground plow∣ed up, and the Earth shaken, and the Rocks rent, and the Vail taken away, that so there may be a way, and a passage for the Pure to pass through the Earth, and so the Earth may waste, and wither, and decay, and the Lyons may suffer hunger, and the gods of the Earth may be famisht, and the lust destroyed; and all keep low in the fear, and wait in silence upon the Lord, to be near you to direct all your minds and stay, and establish you; And as you have received the Truth, so walk in the
Truth, we do charge you all in the Name of the Lord; and be faithful every one to your measure, and improve, and wait for power, and stand in the cross to the earthly, that whatsoever your minds have delighted in, in the first nature, may all be denied and crossed, and the Cross is to the ground, to the lust; and as you nourish the lust, and let your minds and wills at liberty, and deny the Cross, then that which is pure is vexed and darkened, and so the deceit and lust gets up again, and so the Guide is lost, and condemnation comes upon you; and therefore all be diligent in the Work of the Lord, and watch over your actions, and deceit; and you will come to see Satan hath many strong holds, and would spare the best and the fat; but in that which is a Cross to all mortal stand, and abide, and dwell, that so you may be preserved and kept out of all snares of the Devil: And now take heed of judging the Power of the Lord, and that it knows not what it is to be si∣lent and wait, that you may come to see in the Light, and be Partakers of the same; and all who have tasted of the Power, wait, and keep out of imaginations, and thoughts, and false voyces, that so the Enemy may not be hearkned to, nor the deceit, but all in the measure wait upon the Lord in singleness of heart, out of all deceit; and form nothing in your minds; but all in Purity and Uprightness dwell, And all Friends, now take heed of carelesness, slothfulness, and sluggish∣ness of mind, and of giving liberty to the flesh, and ease to the carnal mind: And we charge and command you in the Presence of the Lord, whose Power is dreadful, that you meet together in silence, and wait, and none to speak a word but what he is moved to speak, a word from the Lord; take heed of adding to it, but only what you are moved; and take heed of striving, and contending, or let∣ting out your selves to strange spirits, but every one keep in his own Tent, and sit down under his own Vine; and eat not that which dyes of it self, but feed upon the Eternal, and so you will be nourished, and grow up in Wisdom and Power, in that which is pure, that all deceit may be kept out. And all Children and Servants, be diligent in your places, more willing, more ready to labour in love and dili∣gence, that so the Name of God may not be dishonoured. And all you who have Callings, throw off nothing hastily nor rashly, but wait and flee not the Cross, for if you do, you will be darkened, and the Name of God dishonoured: And therefore all dear Friends, who have owned the Truth, now wait upon the Lord in diligence, that so you may grow in the Life, in the Power of the Lord, that no∣thing may be spared that is for destruction; and so God Almighty bless you all, and keep you out of all deceit, in the pure Life which is made manifest, that you may have victory over all, and witness him who puts all under; with it, if you wait, you will see him present and near you. And so the Everlasting God of Power keep you all; for great is our care over you, and our love is to you that abide in the Truth, which you are already made Partakers of; and when Joy springs up, keep in it, and run not forth, and spend it not; and take heed of exalting, for then pride and presumption gets up, if you keep not in his Fear, and so Darkness will come upon you; but all dwelling in that which is pure, you will be preserved out of snares, and temptations, and your minds kept clear and pure, out of all things that defile; and so the Everla∣sting God of Life and Power be with you all. Your dear Brethren in the unchangable Love of God, E. B. F. H. To Friends at London. Dear and beloved Friends, in that which is pure of God, and made manifest in you all, wait and abide, and walk in the Light, which comes from Je∣sus, from whence it comes, who is the Judge of the Quick and the Dead, con∣demns all unrighteousness into the pit; and therefore all wait in that which is pure of God, which hath turned your minds from Darkness to Light, and from Sata
to God, and hath convinced you of all unrighteousness, and hath let you see all that ever you have done; behold, he is the very Christ; and therefore all Friends of God, mind that which is pure of God, which shews you the deceits of the heart; the Light is the Eye which discovers all the secrets of your hearts, and it will shew all deceit, and your present condition, and that which would lead aside; and temptation as it ariseth it will discover, and resisting in the Light, here temptations come to be escaped, and the pits and the snares which they who err from the Light fall into. Dear Friends, great is our care one every side, and we are jealous over you lest you depart from the simplicity of the Gospel, and so the deceit lead and guide, and so you will come under condemnation; and therefore all in silence wait, be swift to hear, slow to speak; and all wait upon the Light in diligence, and take heed of forward minds and wills, which would go before the Light and run before the Guide; there is the Deceiver and false Prophet within, the same that is without, and therefore we charge you all in the Name and Power of God, to take heed of forward wills in speaking, lest your minds be drawn out from the moving of the Pure within, to hearken to words without, which are spoken from that which is a∣bove the Light, and this feeds the carnal reason, and the earthly wisdom, and lets in the Inchanter, and so your minds being turned without you feed upon the husk, and not the Life, and therefore that nature that cannot live without words is for the Plague and for the Famine, and must be famished and stopt: And therefore now as the Power ariseth in you, dwell low in it, and sink down in the same, and as things open in you speak not forth, there your minds would run out, and speak that which is opened by the Spirit, this is the Prodigal; but as things open, treasure them up in your hearts; and all keep in that which separates between Light and dark∣ness; and be not hasty to do any thing, lest your wills betray you, and all keep in Patience, there the Crown is obtained; and flee not from the trouble, nor from that which judgeth; but dwell in it, and pray that your flight be not in Winter, if you do, you are Vipers; And despise not the Cross, even the death of the Cross, that all your iniquity may be nailed to the Cross, and so the righ∣teousness may be set up within, and so the Land is kept in Peace: And there∣fore all, dear Friends, whose hearts the Lord hath touched, meet together, in silence wait, and you will see the Lord present among you, and his power made mani∣fest among you, and the earth broken up, and the fallow ground, and a passage for the Seed; and we charge you all take heed of many words, or feeding upon that which is torn, and dies of it self; and we charge by the Lord, that none speak without Eternal Motion; for if you do, the false Prophet speaks, and his words eats as a Canker, and darkens; and vails them that hearken to it: And therefore all wait to have Salt in your selves, and savour and discerning, that you may come to know the voice of the Lord from the voice of a Stranger, and so you may be kept out of all deceit, for there Thorns and Briars; and the cursed fruits are brought forth: but in the Light of Christ dwell, and wait, and grow up in it, and walk in it, that you may come to know your Redeemer, and what you are redeemed from, and see him near you, and in you, else you are Reprobates: And so the Lord God of Life and Power preserve you all, for we have kept no∣thing back, but are free from the blood of you all, and of all that hears us; but our desire to the Lord is, that what hath been sown in weakness may be raised in power, and that you may grow up in the Truth, and walk in the Truth, that we may see the Travel of our Souls, and be satisfied; and if the Lord give us to see your faces again, we may rejoyce in you, and with you: and so the Ever∣lasting God of Life and Power keep you all in his Wisdom and Power, to have victory over all your Enemies, that you may serve him in uprightness of heart, and be faithfull to that of God made manifest in you all. Your dear Brethren in the Gospel of Christ committed to our charge, E. B. F. H.
To be read at Meetings of Friends in London. FRiends of God, called by him out of the dark World, into his marvellous Light; to all you who by the Power of God are kept faithful, to walk and abide in the measure of the Gift of God received; Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God the Father of Life be multiplied in you, and amongst you, that you all may grow up in the Power of God, out of Darkness, and the shaddow of Death, where∣in you have been held captive in a strange Land: Dear Friends, our souls are pour∣ed out for you, that you all may abide in that which you have received, and heard, which is the Way and Path of Life, and Righteousness, and Peace eternal; therefore all dear Friend, walk worthy of the calling, whereunto ye are called, and wait in the Light by which you are enlightened, that all deceit in particular and in the general may be comprehended, seen, and judged; we bear you record, there is a Witness of God manifest in you, and true desires which flows to God from you: Therefore take heed to the measure of God, that by it you may hear the Voyce of God, and see his powerful Presence; for by that which is manifested of God in man, God speaks, moves, and acts, and is known unto man; and all that neglect the measure of God, to walk in it, all their Knowledge, Experiences, and Profession is for condemnation, by that which changeth not; so all dwell in the measure which is the Light, in the Cross which keeps under and judges the flesh∣ly man, so the understanding will be kept open to receive the Mercies of God, and to walk worthy of the Mercies received; but turning aside from the Light you neglect the Mercies, and follow lying vanities, and err from the Way of Righte∣ousness, and bring your selves under condemnation; for no longer is God enjoy∣ed by man, then man abides in his Counsel, in his Fear, where the secrets of God are manifest and received by the Light, which is the first entrance unto God, and the fulness of the enjoyment of God: Beware of the World, where all the temp∣tations lie, to draw away your minds into the carnal and visible things, out from the Light by which the Life is enjoyed, and so death passeth over you, and con∣demnation cometh upon you, and the Life be lost, and misery be revealed against you. Large is the Love of God unto you, in calling you, and chusing you, and there∣fore forget not this Love, but walk in it, up to God, from whom free Redemption is manifested, unto that which hath lain in Death, overcome by the Darkness; follow not your own wills, nor the voice of the Stranger and false Prophet, which draws out into visibles, into here, and there; but have salt and discerning in your selves, that you may try every motion, and every spirit, and may by that which is infallible and errs not, comprehend and judge that which is fallible and erring, which flourisheth for a time, but comes to an end, is withered, as that in your own Knowledge and Consciences will set to seal, who have been strayed and scat∣tered upon the Mountains in the cloudy and dark day; but now the Light is break∣ing forth, and the Day begins to appear; and all you who abide faithful shall see the Glory of the Lord, and (shall enjoy him in the Land of the Living) End of the Work of God. We charge you all in the Lord, that you who profess the Truth walk in it, and who profess a change, to let it appear by putting off the works of Darkness, which by the Light are made manifest unto you, and testified against by the Witness of God in you; for know this, that that which liveth in you which is contrary to God, witnessed against by the Light of Christ, shall be as a Prick in the eye, and as a Thorn in the side for ever; and Wrath is to be revealed upon him that spareth the best, and saveth the fat from Judgment, for to the slaughter all must come, that Life and Glory may be made manifest; and he that looks back by the way is not fit for the Kingdom; and he that returns again to the pollutions, his latter end is worse then his beginning, and the Judgment of God cannot be esca∣ped:
Therefore wait in the Power of God, and stand in the Light, which is the Armour against all temptations, whereby the Darkness and Death, and he that hath the power of Death is overcome, and all that love the Light, and are guided by it. And all dear Friends, who have tasted of the Love and Power of God, and do witness the renting of the Earth, dwell in the Power and pure Fear of the Lord, that so all deceit may be kept down, and under; and take heed of the false Prophet, speaking or suffering your minds to run out in the openings, and so you will speak that which is opened in the Light; and therefore we charge you all in the Presence of the dreadful God of Life and Power, that you all wait in silence, and wait to have Salt and Savour in your selves, to know the Voice of Christ from the voice of the Stranger, for till that be known in your selves you are not able to judge; and therefore all wait in the Light, which is the Eye, which sees into the Mysteries of the Kingdom, and none to utter a word, but what you are Eternally moved unto, or else that in every ones Conscience will bear witness against you; and therefore be not hasty now when you see things open in your minds, dwell in them, and run not forth and speak, but treasure them up in your hearts, and take heed, and keep low in the Fear of the Lord God, that pride and presumption get not up, nor no∣thing be exalted above that which is pure. Dear Friends, you are upon us as a great weight and burden, lest we should have bestowed our labour in vain, but we hope and trust the Lord will preserve you, if you stand in obedience to that of God made manifest in you, and so you will grow; and take heed of striving and con∣tending, but judge that, every one in your selves, that you may all grow up in the pure Life of God: And so the everlasting Power of God bless you all, and keep you in his everlasting Love, and Power, and give the victory over your Enemies, that you may come to witness eternal Life in you, made manifest from God. This was al∣so subscribed by F. H. Your Brethren in the Work of the Lord, E. B. F. H. To Friends in London. DEar Friends, in the evelasting Covenant of Life and Peace whom we bear witness of, and unto whom we have declared, and preached in season and out of season among; yea, and have often come unto, in much weakness, and fear, and trembling; and have not ceased day by day to watch over you, lest any should start aside from the Hope of the Gospel, which was declared amongst you in much demonstration of Spirit, whereby your understandings came to be opened, even by the Word of his Power, which we directed you to wait in, and for; and you are Witnesses your selves of the Love and mighty Power of God, which was made manifest among you; which made the Heathen to rage, and confounded the wis∣dom of the Wise: So dear Children of Light, of whom we have travelled in pains, and great burdens, that Christ might be formed in you; fulfil ye our joy, make our hearts glad in your growth up in him, who hath called and spoken to you from Heaven by his Son, in the Light; and your ears have heard, and your eyes have seen, and you have been made to understand the Mystery of the Kingdom of God, which is a Parable to all the World, and sealed, and cannot be read; but to you who continue and abide in the Grace of God, which hath appeared to all men, which brings Salvation to all that walk and abide in it, and leads to the Enterance, and Earnest, and the sealing of the Spirit, until the time of the finishing transgres∣on, and making an end of sin, and so the everlasting Offering be witnessed, which perfects for ever them that are Sanctified; therfore all Friends whose minds are turn∣to the Light, and do witness a change in you, by the working of the Spirit, and now a door of Hope being set open, abide in that measure every one, and stay your souls upon him, who is your Hope; and keep low in the Fear to the just Principle of Life; that you may have savour and discerning, to know the Voice of Christ from the voice of a Stranger in your selves and in others, and so grow up in the discerning; and comprehend all spirits, and judge them by the Light that makes all things manifest; and all meet together in your several Meetings, and watch
one over another; and be diligent all in your measure, and take heed you neglect not; and none be of a careless mind to meet and wait upon the Lord in silence; for whose life stands only in words without, such we deny, for their eyes and ears are without, and they would be ever learning, and that is the silly woman that is loden with lust, And all dear Babes, take heed of taking liberty to the flesh, nor give no ear nor liberty to the Earth, but in the Cross dwell to the carnal, and so you will witness the Plant of the Lord watered, and a growth in the Immortal, and the Seed you will see, which is one in all, which the Promise is to; and all be still, and cool, and quiet, and of a meek spirit, that out of boysterousness, and ea∣gerness, and feignedness, and self-love, you may be preserved in your measures up to God; and if any be moved to speak a few words in your Meetings, this we charge you all, That you speak nothing but that which is given in, and in the sence, and in the cross; and do not add your own words, for then you will burthen others who dwell in the Life; and take heed of whispering, and back-biting one another, or uncovering one anothers nakedness, but if any see any to be overtaken, or walking disorderly, reprove such a one privately, and exhort private, and bear and forbear one another; and so love will encrease, and your joy, and your wis∣dom, and your strength will grow; and so the Lord God of Life preserve you all in his Wisdom, and take heed of imaginations or running out, and do nothing hasily; but wait at Wisdom's Gate, that so you may do all things in wisdom; and all be faithful in your measures, and give up all freely unto the Lord, that he may take away your Enemies, and bring you into everlasting Righteousness. All Friends in your places, Masters, Parents, Servants, and Children in your places be diligent in that which is just unto the Lord, that so the Name of the Lord by whom you are called be not dishonoured, but that you may all dwell in the Counsel of the Lord, in the Light of Christ single, which keeps you out of all pollutions, and out of that nature that starves you, and darkens you; and so the living God of Life preserve you, for you are dear to us, even all of you, without respect of Persons, who walk with the Lord; and we cease not to make mention of you to the Lord, (and he hears us) that you may grow up in the Life of Christ Jesus, to follow the Lamb wheresoever he leads you, or moves you; for truly our hearts are bound to you in the Lord, by one everlasting Cord, and if you make us sorry, who shall make as glad? for you are our Crown of rejoycing in the Lord. We are your Brethren, nay, your Servants for Christ's sake, E. B. F. H. To all the beloved Friends, and Brethren, and Sisters, who are made Partakers of his eternal Word of Life, by which you are gathered into one Light and Power, in which is Life eternal abiding in it. DEar Friends of God, who have received and heard the Word, the immortal Word with gladness and readiness, who are accounted worthy to receive the Testimony of our Lord Christ; our love in the eternal Life of God which endures for ever, which is not limitted to Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and Peo∣ple, is shed abroad in all, and to all that wait upon Christ Jesus, who is the Light, the Love, and the Gift of the Father, which we are made Partakers of, by which Gift Eternal Life and Peace for evermore is witnessed, unto all them that continue and dwell in him, who is Love. Beloved in the Lord, our thirsting is great after you, that the Truth you have received from him whom we declared unto you, con∣trary to our own wills, in much weakness, and much fear, and often tears, and much trembling, and walking before you in Uprightness, without fraud and dis∣simulation, as Patterns and Examples; and the Lord by his eternal working of his mighty Power made his own Ministry powerful unto you, unto whom be glory for evermore: So dear hearts, in the Grace of God which hath appeared unto you, which did convince you of sin, and condemned sin in the flesh, by which Power ye are saved from sin, and brings Salvation unto you who walk in it; in it dwell and wait for the day star of Iacob to arise, and the Babe of Glory to be brought in you,
and made manifest, and the Government may be upon his shoulders, who rules in righteousness for ever: There is a Crown before you; and therefore our dear∣ly beloved ones, all wait, and press on to the work before you, in the Cross, and on the Cross give up all to be slain, and keep nothing back, for if you do, the Canaanite will vex you, and trouble you, and be a thorn in your eyes, to blind the eye, and so turn you into darkness; but all keep low in the fear, and wait, that the head may be exalted and uncovered, that so the man may bear rule who is not in the transgression, and so in the living hope which is come to you from him who is the Life of men you may purifie your selves, & all the old Leaven may be purged out; and so wait for the Faith of the Son of God, which is born of God, by which the Just lives, and so the Everlasting you will come to see; and so the Everlasting God of Life and Power preserve you all in one, out of all jar and strife, pure to himself, in one, that you may bear witness to his Name by your holy conversation, in that great Place; for I see there is more yet to come into the Fold in that City: And so be diligent in your meeting together, and his eternal Power and Presence you will see, as you have done continually; so grow up in the Life of God, and here you are unknown to the World; salute us to all the Church of Christ in the City, without re∣spect of persons, whom we love and own in the Life that never dies; and as many as are free, write to us, for a Friend here were precious indeed; but none knows us here, nor we are known to none, but well known to the Elect and precious, in whom we wait to hear from you, to be refreed to hea of you, of the work of the Lord every where; the Grace of God by which you are saved from , be with you, and in you, to give you dominion over all in it, we lie down with you, and are your Brethren and Servants for Christs sake, to whom be glory for evermore. E. B. F. H. DEar Friends in the Truth of God, without respect of persons, grace, mercy and peace from the Everlasting Father be multiplied among you, tht in the Faith and Love, and every good work you may abound towards God and man,  may shew forth the praise of the Lord, and walk as a People redeemed by him, in all holi∣ness and pureness, that your good works may be seen, and your light may shine be∣fore men: Dearly beloved in the Lord, my love doth salute you all who are pt in faithfulness to the gift of Grace received, in which you walking, Salvation it doth bring, and redemption it doth manifest, out of the World, and out of its nature, into the Image and likeness of the Son of God; therefore dear Friends and Babes of God, by the immortal Word of Life begotten and nourished, who waiteth upon the Lord, blessed are ye that wait to the end, till he who is the Light of the World hath put all things under him, and he to be exalted your Head; if in that you dwell which from the beginning hath been heard, you need no man to teach you, but the Way you know, and the Word of Life is your victory: So keep to the measure, that self-will, and self-love may be judged, and your Neighbour loved, as self, and the living God, who is Light, above all, who hath begun his work in you, and among you, with his right Hand will finish it: And dear Friends, keep nothing back, nor the best, nor the fat, let not be spared from slaughter; but let the Sword pss upon all, that you peace may be for ever, and your righteousness may never perish; Oh, how doth my Soul long to know and understand of the growth and unmovable∣ness in the Truth manifested among you, and gladly received by you, even your Crowns you laid down at the feet of the Lamb, and your glory and renown in the World! Ye dispised for the Lights sake, but your Reward shall be everlasting, and your Inheritance shall never wither; I speak not to puff you up, but that you may the rather be kept low in subjection to the Light of the Lord Jesus, by which self, and that which would be exalted must be crucified; and this is the victory, and precious Faith which will purifie you, and sanctifie you throughout, from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, in that Faith to stand as Witnesses for the Lord God in that great City, and against all its pollutions and Idol gods, which neither do hear, see, nor taste; in wisdom, as examples one to another in love and unity walk, as children of
the Day, being past through he dark night where the works of darkness were com∣mitted; but now being separated from the World, joyn not your selves any mo to strange women, which enticeth from God, but sit under your own vine in peace, dwelling with the Lord, who is Light, of whom you are become the Temple an Tabernacle; and watch in diligence one over another, that as the day appears, yo may edifie one another, and may be made one in the Light, which is Christ, upo whom you have believed, which unto you is precious, but a stumbling Stone, and a Rock of offence to all the World: The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ preserve you, that by it you may be preserved, to walk in the pure Religion, where your ow will is not to be done; the Power of God Almighty fill your hearts with joy, ad peace, and love in him; and this is the desire of my Soul, who is a Labourer among you in the Work and Travel of the Gospel of Christ, E. B. A General Epistle to Friends in London. MY dear beloved Friends and Brethren, in the Everlasting Unerring Trut, of which you are made Partakers, who are called of God, his Witnesse, to be of his Name, and of his Truth; with my dear love I do salute you, dearly and tenderly, and all the rest of the Begotten of God, in that City, whom my soul longeth after, your growth in the inward man; the Everlasting Father strengthen you, and refresh you with the living Streams from his Presence; and his Love and Power, and Grace be multiplied among you, unto whom he hath opened a Door, and made an entrance into the true Rest, which remaineth for you, unto which the Lord of Glory is gathering you, and leading you, and carrying you as Lambs in his Arms, into the Fold of everlasting Refreshing; my dear hearts, walk wo∣thy of the love of God, wherewith he hath loved you, and let your Light shew, ye Children of Light, forth into the World, that your good Works they may see, who over you watch with an evil eye. Dear Friends, to you that believe, he who is the Light of the World, is precious; therefore in the Light wait, that your Understandings may be opened, and your Feet prepared to walk in the Wayes of the Lord, which to all the Children of Light are pleasant Wayes; and be not entangled with any yoak of bondage which may burthen you from running the rae that is set before you; but in the death of all mortal stand, and there the Life of immortallity you will see and witness, and the daily Food you will receive, to that Life which the love of the World doth crucifie; for do you not know that the friendship of this World is at emnity against God; but you are called not to serve the World, but God, who is the Light, and the World must serve you; so take heed lest your affections, and desires, and hearts be drawn aside from the pure Way of Life into that which is visible, which will not endure forever▪ for that life is death, and that glory is shame; in the Light I read you, and do behold many pleasant Plants springing up in the Garden of God; and I bear you record some of you have laid your Crowns down at the Lamb's Feet, and have scorned the glory of Babylon and Aegypt; surely your Reward will be everlasting, and your Cps will the Lord fill in the sight of your Enemies, and your Glory shall be above the glory of the Earth, and your Crowns shall never wither; therefore press on, and look not back, nor spare not the fat, nor the best from slaughter, but to the Sword bring all your Enemies, which have been they of your own house, which over you have prevailed; but now the Lord is arising among you, and the day you have seen of the shaking of the Earth, and the Heavens, and of the darkness of the Sun, and of the falling of the Stars; therefore wait to the end, that the Crown of Immortallity you may wear; and with the Instrument of the Lord the Mountains you may thresh, and may give the Whore double reward into her bosom, for all her wayes. The day among you begins to dawn, therefore put of every work of the night, and walk all in the day; for ye are the Light of the World, and a City set upon a Hill which cannot be hid; the Lord prosper you, and preserve you, and be with your spirits, and establish you, Amen.

THE VISITASION Of the Rebellious Nation of Ireland. And a Warning from the Lord proclaimed to all the Inhabitants thereof, to make their Peace with him before his Long-suffering come to an end. With a Lamentation over its Unfruitness and Rebellion after so many Visi∣tations. And an Exhortation to all the honest-hearted, to meet the Lord by re∣pentance, while the patience of the Lord continues. Or the Sealing of the Lord's Testimony unto all sorts of People in that Land, by his Servants, after their several moneths sore labours and travels, and sufferings therein, who loved not their lives for the Seed sake. Also some particular Papers, written in that Nation, to several sorts of People. I. An Information to the Heads and the Ground of the Law laid down to the Iudges and Iustices, and to all that handle the Law through that Nation. II. An Exhortation sent to the chief Commander and his Councel, and the just cause of the Innocent laid before them. III. The unjust Sufferings of the Iust declared, and their appeal to the just Witness of God in all mns Consciences. IV. A Challenge to the Priests of Dublin to try their God, and their Ministry, and their Worships. V. A Discovery of the Idol dumb Shepherds in that Nation, and a Lamentation over their starved and strayed Flocks. VI. An Invitation to all the poor desolate Souldiers to repent, and make their peace with the Lord, and their duty shewed them, what the Lord requires of them. ALas, alas, wo is me for thee, thou desolate Nation of Ireland, thou art to be pitied and lamented, because of thy backslidings, and rebellion a∣gainst the Lord; thou aboundest in Iniquity, and thy Transgressions can∣not be numbred, O thou art a fruitless Habitation, and barren of Righ∣teousness, and Mercy, and true Judgment; even from the Head to the Taile thou art corrupted, and thy wickedness is marked before the Lord: Thy Rulers, and Teachers, and People are all gone out of the Way, and are disobedient Children, having backslided from the pure Ways of the Lord God; a deceitful Heart is found among them, and a Lye is in their Hand; even the best of men are as a Bryar, and the most upright among men sharper then a Thorn-Hedge; a cursed seed hath ta∣ken root in thee, and fruit of a cursed taste is abundantly sprung forth; thou at turned into the degenerate Plant of a strange Vine unto God, and are become a∣bominable in his eye; thy vines brings forth a soure grape, and the Lords soul hath no delight therein; thou art altogether untilled, and thy flowers give an ill
smell; thy Inhabitants have let themselves to do wickedness they imagine mischief upon their beds and brings it forth in the morning, cruelty is their weapon against the Innocent, and hard heartedness is their defence against the upright. Wo is me for thee, thou desolate Nation, who have rejected the counsel of the Lord, and neglected the day of thy Visitation, wherein the Lord would have gathered thee, but thou wouldst not; How often hath the Lord spoken unto thee, and thou wilt not hear his call? By judgement hath he spoken, and by mercy hath he drawn, but thou refusest to return, and wilt not be reclaimed, but continues in thy Rebellion against the Lord, and forgets the work of his hand, in Ages and Ge∣nerations past; even since the beginning hast thou been a Land of wickedness, and a people of a cursed seed, drinking up iniquity as an Ox that drinks up water, & filling the measure of Transgression, till the Lord was forced in grievous judgments to deal with thee, even his wrath in a day broke forth upon thee, and the fire of indigna∣tion was kindled in thee, and thy Princes were cut off in fury, & thy Inhabitants fell by the plague and sword in great numbers, and thou were given up to be a prey to thy enemies in thy treasures, and the cruell hearted took the spoyle, thou wast laid levell in the dust of deep misery and confusion, and thy lamentation and sorrow was heard among the Nations, and the stroke of the Lords hand was heavy upon thee, and his judgements was just upon thy head, and he gave no rest unto thee for many years, but thou wast as a trembling leaf, and as a forsaken bough, and thou wast made desolate and comfortless, and misery girded thee about, and then thy stout heart was brought down into sorrow, when the Lord contended with thee; but now thou hast ease from thy bitterness, and a day of rest from thy sore trouble, yet hast thou forgotten the day of thy distress, and art again more abundantly exalted, and thy sins are much more encreased, the pride of thy heart is become equall with Sodom, and thy transgressions are encreased to her number, and the rebellion against the Lord is grown more high, and through mercies and deliverance art thou waxe fat, and now thou kicks against the Lord, and in thy heart sayes, Who is he? O when wilt thou consider, what the Lord hath wrought? when wilt thou call to minde his just and righteous dealing? who hast forgotten the day of thy former visitation, and is becoming more vile in the sight of the Lord, by thy secret hypo∣crisie of deceitful profession, then thou wast in thy open prophaness, when thou layest naked in thy open sins. O Desolate Nation, the Lord once and again hath stretched forth his hands unto thee, in pity for thee, and he sent his Servants and Witnesses to warn thee of these thy transgressions, and to call upon thee to awake thee out of thy carelesness, and he gave thee a glorious day of visitation, and free tenders of salvation, wherein thou mightst have made thy peace with him, and repent thee of thy sin, And his Servants were faithfull in thee, and lamented over thee, and gave themselves to be spent for thee, and gladly suffered the reproach of the Heathen, and the cruelty of the wicked, that thereby thou mightst be reclaimed out of thy Rebellion and wick∣edness, and they gave their back to the Smiter, and loved not their lives unto death, nor prized not their liberty unto bonds, but diligently in sufferings, and labours, and perplexities, called unto thee, and through thy Towns and Cities proclaimed the visitation and message of the Lord concerning thee, and was accounted as sheep for the slaughter, that they might finish their Testimony to the gathering of thee▪ but thou wouldst not, but hast to this very day stopped thy ear from counsel, & hard∣ned thy heart against reproof, and contemned the day of thy visitation, and hereby added to thy measure of wickedness in dealing cruelly with the Lords Servants, who rewarded them evil for good, and entreated them shamefully, and laid thy hand of oppression upon them, and rejected their message of glad tidings, and would not be instructed in the way of the Lord unto salvation, but gave heed unto the false visions of thy lying Prophets, and took counsel against the Lord of thy Inchanters, and persecuted the faithful, by unjust Imprisonments, and dealt wickedly with the
Lords chosen, and made unrighteous de crees is thy wrath, and sealed them in thy cruelty, and made a purpose in thy heart to root out the Seed of Iacob, and to lay wast the Lords Heritage. O Ireland, hereby in the Name of the Lord (thus far) I seal my Testimony in faithfulness unto thee, and binds up my many burdens, and travells, and reproaches, and tryals, and sufferings in thee, in a few words, which is the Word of the Lord concerning thee. Ye Heads and Rulers that sits upon the Throne, Repent, and turn to the Lord, from whom you are grievously revolted by woful backslidings, a grievous sin have you committed, a gross sum of hainous abomination is recorded against you, the righteous God will meet you in his Judgements, and once more will appear in the fire of Indignation against you, and your mountains of pride, and vain∣glory, and self-exaltation, shall be layed waste, as your enemies were before you, and as you have thought to do (to root out the Seed of Iacob, and to spoyle the ten∣der grapes of the Lords vintage) even so shall it be done unto you, and your destru∣ction cometh as an armed man, and you cannot escape, nor fly to hide your selves, from the wrath that cometh, which is kindled already to devour the pleasant Palaces of your wicked hearts delight. Wo is me for you; you that are exalted upon your mountain of ease and liber∣ty, having forgotten the rock from whence you are hewn, who were raised out of weakness to reprove the mighty, and gives not glory to the Lord, neither consi∣ders what he hath done for you, but are become ingratefull, and disobedient chil∣dren, and of a double heart and tongue, professing liberty of the pure conscience, but living in corrupt fleshly bondage, oppressing the Just, and slaying the holy One, and neglecting the cry of the Innocent, having made your fingers as heavy as your Fathers loynes; the hand of the Lord is against you; and his wrath will break out upon you, who strengthens the hand of evil doers, and gives liberty, in your Domi∣nions, unto the scum of the Nations, to possess your Land in peace, and will not give place unto the Seed of Iacob; but fortifies your selves against him, and will not suffer him to inherit; how full is your Land of murderers, of drunkards, of Lyars, and swearers, and of prophane persons, of fugitives, and vagabonds, and runnagades, who are protected by your Law, to possess in peace? but in wrath have you turned your sword against the upright, and have made Laws to limit the Spirit of the Lord, and to uphold deceit. Therefore repent of this your sin, who have endeavoured to prevent the Lord; and humble your selves ye Lofty, for the purposes of your hearts are broken, and a scattered Seed remains in your Dominions, which the Lord will bless, and which you cannot be able to suppress, and as pricks in your eyes will it stand a Wit∣ness against you in your hypocrisie and cruelty, and the more ye lay yokes upon it, the more it will spring forth. Therefore be wise ye Rulers and Judges, and leave to imagine mischief; and lay your hands upon your mouthes, and open them not any more; and turn in your minds to the Light of Christ Jesus, wherewith you are enlightened, and it will let you see what you have done, and will set your sins in order before your eyes, and will justly reprove you, who have not done as you would be done unto, but have cast the Law of God behind your backs, and not regarded the call of Equity; and if you love the Light of Christ it will change your minds, and will bring you to Repentance from sin unto God, and from the Dominion of Satan unto the Kingdom of Christ Jesus: The Light is your Teacher, if you love it, and will guide you in the Way of God; but if you go on in your wickedness, it is your Condemnation eternally, and shall seal to the justness of the Judgments of God, when they come upon you; now you have time, and a fair Warning, prize the day of your visitation, before the Decree of Vengeance be sealed against you, nd Repentance be hid from your eyes; lay it to heart, you are but men, and not God, and your strength flesh and not Spirit; if you own the Light it will manifest
the Will and Counsel of the Lord unto you, and give you Power to act Righteous∣ness unto God, wherein you will be accepted: Consider, lest you go down to destruction, and there be none to deliver you. ANd unto all you that do profess the Name of the Lord, and have got the form of the Saints worship in your imaginations; and have separated your selves into an outward conformity, without the Power of Righteousness brought forth in you, and would be called Members of the Church of Christ, all Sects and Sorts: Repent ye, of your Hypocrisie, and stop your mouths in the dust, for you are weighed in an equal Ballance, and are found wanting; and are tried by the Searcher of hearts, the Light of the World, and are found corrupted; de∣ceitful are you in the Root, and cursed in your Branch, deep and secret Hypo∣crisie, Pride, and Coveteousness, and the love and glory of the World, and fleshly Exaltations abounds among you; as Branches of the Root wherein you grow: And how can you bring forth good fruit out of your cursed Ground? your knowledge is bruitish and vain, and your outward conformity is a weariness to the Lord, for you are found Fighters against him, and Opposers of Christ Je∣sus, and Deniers, and Contemner of his Light, by which he hath lightened eve∣ry man that comes into the World: You stumble at the Foundation, and build up∣on the Sand; one of you building a Wall, and another daubing it with untempe∣red Morter; your hearts are not upright with the Lord, but flatters your own souls: Which of you have denied the World for Christ, or what have you laid down for him? In your vain imaginations you worship God ignorantly, ma∣king his Commandment void through your transgressions. You stand in the cursed Nature, alive to the World, following the vain de∣lights thereof, resisting the Way of the Lord, through your wisdom, which is foolishness with God, you have the profession of the Scriptures in your natural knowledge, but you are without the Life thereof, out of the unity of the one Spirit of life in severall meanings, and opinions, which is death; and in vain conceits are you scattered upon the barren Mountains, where your souls are starved▪ and strayed, in the cloudy and dark day; and you are devoured under your dumb Idoll Shepherds, who are in Cains way of wickedness, and in the steps of all the false Prophets, and of the Scribes and Pharisees, fulfilling their measure of wickedness and persecution; against them is the wrath of God kindled to con∣sume them as stubble; they preach for hire, and they divine for money, and they seek for their gain from their quarter, and they run, and were never sent, and you are not profited by them, but are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth. Awake, ye Professors, God calls unto you, give ear unto his voyce, Come out of Babylon, and turn unto Sion, that her desolate places may be builded; you wander abroad in the darkness, groping as blind men, your profession will wither, and all your knowledge will consume away, and your righteousness is abomnation to the Lord, your praying God hates, and your oblations is a weariness to him, for you are in the enmity against God, and the Serpents head is not bruised. Come down ye Cedars, who are exalted above the Cross of Christ, and make not a cloak of the Saints words to cover your unrighteousness; grievous is your Idolatry, who have painted your selves with the likeness of the Saints life, and bows to the Image set up in your imaginations, drawing near God with your mouths, but with your hearts going after your coveteousness: Repent, the day of the Lord is coming upon all flesh, and meet the Lord, and prepare his way; and bow your heads you lofty Oakes, who saith in your hearts you are the onely people, but your lying hearts deceives you, and you are found naked, and without a covering. All ye that desire after the way of the Lord, of all sorts of people who are simple and honest hearted, whether prophane or professor, you have a day of visitation from the Lord, yet stretched forth unto you; Come ye unto the Lord, and forsake
all your lovers, lay aside your evil hearts which hath led you aside from the way of salvation, and now learn the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, and mind the one thing needful, which is of great prize, even the salvation of your souls; press after, and come out of the broad way of perdition, wherein the world goes on to destruction, and enter into the strait-way, where the unclean walks not; cease from all the deceitful wayes and worships of the world, and love truth, and walk in simplicity. Cease from all your Idoll Temples, for God dwells not in them, but his Saints are his Temples, wherein he dwells and walks: cease from all your Idoll worships, and feigned prayers, and praises, for God is not worshipped in vain traditions, as in observing dayes, and times, and outward things, but in Spirit and truth is he worshipped, and such he seeks to worship him, and a broken spirit and an upright heart is accepted with him. Cease from all your Idol Shepherds, and Priests of Baal, that preaches for hire, and divines for money, and seeks for their gain from their quarter, for they profit not the people at all, who are ever learning while they live upon earth, and none able to come to the knowledge of the truth: therefore cease from man, and wait upon the Lord, who is now risen to teach his people by his Spirit in his way of truth and righteousness, in his peace and purity, where his blessing is received from his presence, which is with all that fear him. Therefore awake, awake out of darkness, and love not to slumber in the dark night, which long hath ruled over you; this is the day of your return, and of your visitation, wherein the Lord would gather you; Therefore resist not the love of the Lord, wherein he calls you to repentance from dead works to serve him in righ∣teousness; but every one turn your minds inward, to the Light of Christ Jesus, wherewith every one of you is lightned, which light is it which convinceth you of sin, and lets you see your evil deeds, and whom you have served, and how you have spent your time; the Light shines in darkness, and reveals unto you the se∣cret intents of your dark hearts, and doth secretly reprove the wicked pur∣poses of your minds: with this light in your consciences, your sins are writ∣ten, and all that ever you have done is recorded; and this light shall be the swift witness, and the condemnation of the wicked, in the day of the Lord; and by it all your works will be brought to remembrance, and your sins will be set in order be∣fore you, to receive judgement by Christ Jesus: And here is the free love and gift of God unto you, who hath given you a light to guide you in his way; if you own it, and wait in it, it will manifest the judgements of God against sin in you, and will condemn sin in your flesh, and will reveal the righteousness of God to be your covering; if you dwell in the light, it is your Teacher, and way unto life eternal, and if you bring all your deeds to it, it will reprove every evil word and work, and give you discerning of things that differ, it will manifest the secretest deceit of your heart, and winding of the Serpent, and will be judge thereof, till unrighte∣ousness be taken away, and a birth brought forth from above, and born of ano∣ther nature and Seed, which if you be not born again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Therefore in the fear of the Lord all consider, and search your selves; in tender love to all your souls I write: You must be judged in the flesh, that you may be justified in the Spirit, and you must be made poor, and emptied of all your know∣ledge, and wisdom, that you may be filled, and made truly wise. So if you believe in Christ Jesus the Light, and life, of the world, your hearts will be cleansed by the word of God, which endures for ever; and the Covenant of peace will be established with you, where sin is no more remembred, being condemned, so ow you have all time, this is to you all a warning, as I was moved of the Lord. Repent, the dreadfull day is at hand, and meet the Lord, by confessing and for∣saking your sins, and prepare the way of the Lord, his coming draweth near, lest his Judgments come upon you unawares, and his Wrath sweep you away in fury, and your Nation become more cursed then the rest; all your applying of Christ's Righteousness, whilst your selves are Sinners, is to no purpose, for no Hypo∣crite
can enter into Life, nor none that work wickedness have Eternal Life abi∣ding in them, but are in the death, which hath passed over all men, and the curse remaineth upon the Disobedient, and all in the first nature are Children of wrath. Therefore every one wait in the Light, that you may be changed, and take up the daily Cross of Christ, that your own wills, affections, lusts, and desires, may be crucified, and you may become dead to the World, and may live unto God, in his Nature and Likeness, that your souls may be satisfied therewith, and all that hunger and thirst after Righteousness shall be filled with the true Food. Therefore wait, all you that fear the Lord, and meet together in his Counsel, and wait for his Law that you may walk therein, and lay aside the works of Dark∣ness, which are made manifest by the Light, and also condemned, in all that come to Sion. Spend not your time in the vain deceits of the World, nor follow no the delights thereof, for according to your works must you be judged in the day of the Lord. Depart from Iniquity, and all the works of the Flesh, Pride and Co∣tousness, Lying, Swearing, and Double-dealing, and all the fruits of unrighteousness, let them be judged; and let the time past be sufficient that you have wrought evil, and now return, and work Righteousness in God, by the Light, which all that love, works in God. And deceive not your selves, with a deceitful covering, of self-making, and self-righteousness, professing Scriptures in your carnal minds, which was gi∣ven forth by the Spirit, and is not understood, but by the same Spirit: Whilst the first nature stands alive in you, you cannot please God, but are in the emnity against him: Humble your selves, and come down to the Light, and search your hearts thereby. Wo unto the Lofty, and High-minded, who will not be instructed, but hat reproof. Wo is unto all Lyars, and Swearers, and Whoremongers, and Vaga∣bonds, and prophane Persons, such cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,  enter to within the Gates of the City, but are to be troden in the Wine-Press of the Wrath of God for ever and ever. Therefore, Awake, awake, ye Careless and Unbelieving, and fear and tremble ye Children of disobedience, who hate the Light, and love your evil deed, and upholds your false Prophets, whom God never sent, and will not own the Lord to be your Teacher; the Light in your Conscience is your condemnation; for this is the Condemnation of the World, That Light is come, and men hate it. So be you warned all People, the Day of the Lord is at hand, and now he calls▪ therefore hear his Voice, and hearken to his Light, which is of Christ, which on∣ly is needful to Salvation; and there is no other Name given for Salvation. And if you will not hear, and receive thi Day of visitation, which in love appears unto you, you shall hear in the Day of visitation of Vengeance; and behold the Lord comes quickly, make straight his Path; the Light is your Teacher if you love it, and your condemnation if you hate it.

An Information to the Heads, and the Ground of the Law laid down, to the Iudges and Iustices, and to all that handle the Law in that Nation. ALL ye Heads and Rulers, and Judges, and Counsellors, and all you that it in Council together in the Seat of Justice and Judgement, from whom the Law do go forth into the Nation, and all you that handle the Law take heed to your selves, for the Living God of power is Judge of you, and over you all, to you all I speak the Word of the Lord, without respect to any of your persons (but is a Lover and Respecter of Righteousness, and true Judgment, and Justice) that I may stand clear of your blood, for God hath laid it upon me to give you warning, which if I do not, your blood will be upon me, and if this you refuse to hear and obey, your blood be upon your selves for ever. Christ Jesus is the Light of the World, the true Light, which lightneth every man that comes into the World, and by which every one of you is lightned, which Light, if it you love, and be guided by, it will lead you out of the Worlds way and nature, and unrighteousness, and will give you an entrance into Etetnal Life and Peace, and an assurance in Christ when this World ceases to be; and in this World it will teach you how to serve God in Righteousness in your Generation; and to give righteous Judgments and Councels among your Brethren without re∣spect of Persons, for the Law of Gods respects no mans Person, nor Justice re∣gards not the Person of the Mighty; the Light of Christ Jesus in your Consci∣ences, and in all mens Consciences, is just and one with Christ, and one with the Law of God, in its measure, and condemneth the unjust, and all works of wickedness, who against it do act; by which Light every one of you being guided, your own Consciences in particular will be exercised towards God and towards men, and by him you being ruled and judged, will know how to rule and judge for him in the World among men, who are required for God to rule and judge in righteousness and equity; and none can rule for God, but who are ruled by him, with his Light that shines in the Conscience, by which you be∣ing governed, will by it govern in the Earth righteously. You are not to judge for Gifts and Rewards, for if you do, you judge not for God, but for your selves, and you and your Judgment is to be judged and condemned with the righteous Law of God, which is free; but such who fear God and hate covetousness, and gifts, and rewards, are to bear rule, and such will handle the Law righteously, and will be a terror to evil Doers, who do not fear God, but act contrary to the Light of Christ in their own Consciences, and so transgress the just Law, and brings themselves under the guilt, and so under condemnation; and such a Government will stand for the praise of them that do well, and encouraging of the Upright; but if such bear rule and handle the Law which know not God, nor is not ruled by him, these will abuse the Law, and will be a terror to righ∣teousness, and good works, and will strengthen the hands of Evil-doers, and will let Vice and Wickedness escape unpunished. This I speak in love to all your Souls, to the informing of all your minds, that you may know your place, and how to exalt Justice and Judgment; the Light of the Son of God, by which every man is lighted, is but one in all, just, righteous and equal; the same in him that hates it, and transgresseth the righteous Law, as it is in him that loves it, and judges all transgressions. And this Light of Christ, by which all men are lightned, is the Seat of Justice, and true Judgment, and the Ground of all good wholsom Laws,) and every Law that is contrary to it is for condemnation by it: Therefore, I say, wait in the Light, by which you are lightned, to receive the pure Law of God to judge all Causes by, and make no Law in your own wills,
nor act not in such Laws made by the will of man, for such Laws are oppression, and tyranny lodges in them, and false judgment, and such God hath and will cast out, who act from that ground. So be ye warned by their fall, and judge not af∣ter your own thoughts, nor sensual carnal wisdom, nor follow not your own wills, nor the counsel of your own hearts; but stand in God's Counsel, and fear his Name, and tremble at his Presence, and wait to be guided by him in his holy Law, which all unrighteous counsels, and vain affections, and false judgments will con∣demn in your own hearts, and then you will truely know how to judge your Bre∣thren in Equity and Righteousness, how to reward well Doers, and how to pu∣nish evil Doers according to the measure of their transgressions, and according to the Light in their own Consciences, by which they being convinced from your Law, of the evil of their transgression, will confess your Law and Judgment to be just and equal, and you to be righteous Judges; here you judge for God, and bear not the Sword in vain, but are a Terror to Transgressors, and to the Disobe∣dient, and Lawless, against which the Law was only added, to slay unrighteousness; but it was not made for the Righteous, whose Consciences are exercised towards God and towards man, by the pure Law of God written in the heart: and up∣on such, and over such your Law hath no power, for they are one, and in union with that Law which is righteous, and do witness the justness, and goodness, and holiness of it; but if you make a Law in your own wills, and judge by such a Law, then you will make the Innocent suffer, and oppress them who walk in the Law of God, and in the exercise of a pure Conscience: Christ was put to death by such a Law, and the Saints in all Generations were persecuted by such Laws, which were made in the will of man, contrary to the Will and Law God: Therefore take eed to your selves lest God hew you down and your Law together, and condemn yo by his righteous Law eternally, which Law of God needs not to be made, but i made already, and to be witnessed by the Light in every mans Conscience to Justi∣fication, or condemnation, and is revealed in all that love Righteousness. So take heed what you do, and know your place, and the length and breadth o your law, which is committed to you, which is to keep the outward man in good order, and the Nations in peace and truth, and from Theft, and Murder, and A∣dultry, and Fighting, and Quarrelling, and Drunkenness, and Wronging one an∣other, and such like; such who acts these things walk contrary to the Light, and so brings themselves under the penalty of the law; but over the inward man you law which is outward hath no power to bind, to limit or to tie too or from any way of worship in Religion, but let Religion defend it self, and lay not your la upon the Conscience, to exercise dominion over it, for it is Christs Seat, in who he will rule; lest you be found Tyrants, and numbred for destruction; nor li not the Spirit of the Lord, how, when, where, and by whom it must speak; for the Holy-men of God in all Ages, ever cryed against such laws as were contrary to the Law of God, and did limit the Spirit of the Lord, and against such Rulers as did judge false Judgment, and for Gifts, and Rewards; and against such Priest and Prophets as preached for Hire and divined for Money, and sought for their Gain from their Quarter, and made a prey upon the People, and through Cove∣teousness made merchandize of souls: Therefore be ye warned, if such you up∣hold by a law, which act those things which the Scripture declares against, which the Holy-men of God gave forth by his Spirit; the Scripture which you profess shall stand a Witness against you, and the Law of God will condemn you; and God will lay your honour in the dust, and cast you out of the Seat of Judgment▪ But judge the cause of the Poor, and Needy, of the Widow, and Fatherless, and joyn Mercy with Judgment, and lay your Swords upon oppression, and all tyra∣ny, and wrong dealing; that the Land may cleansed of evil Doers, and Equity and Righteousness may flow down, and the Nation in good order may be kept i Peace and Righteousness; and so God will establish you among his Children, who are taught of him alone, and are far from oppression: To the Light of God in all your Consciences I do speak, which if you make laws contrary to it, and judge contrary to it, it is the eternal Condemnation of you, and of your laws,
and judgment. And remember you are warned in your▪ life time▪ and my Con∣science is cleared to you, and in the Day of the Lord you shall witness  to be tru and this to be the Word of the Lord to you, whether you will hear or  ear. Written to you by a Friend of Righteousness and true Iudgment from the Spirit of the Lord, as moved of him in love to all your souls; to go abroad among the Heads; and Rulers, and Iudges in Dublin, and elsewhere through the Nation of Ireland; from one who is cal∣led a Quaker by Scorners, whose name in the flesh is, Edward Burrough. Written at Dublin, the 23d of the 8th Moneth, 1655. And now Oye Heads and Rulers, happy had you been if you had taken the coun∣sel of the Lord, and submitted to have obeyed his▪ Word, which came to you as moved of him, but in that you have neglected, and have made laws in your will, and exercise lordship over the Conscience, and have limited the Lord, and have purposed to e a error to good, and strengthened the wicked, and have not regar∣ded the Will of God, but have persecuted and imprisoned the Innocent, and udged  your own hearts; therefore according to the Word of the Lord, your blood will be upon your own heas, for you have not taken Warning, and I am  hereof for ever. An Exhortation sent to the chief Commander and his Council, and the just Cause of the Innocent laid at their door. WE who are Servants of the Lord of Hosts, who is the Protector of Hea∣ven This Ex∣hortation was written by E. B. on the behalf of him∣self and Fra. Howgill, who was, then with him in Ireland. and Earth; we who stand in his Fear, and know his Consel, are moved of him who lives for ever, who is, I Am, and there is none besides him; to clear our Consciences, and our Lords Truth, from the Lyes and Slanders which are cast upon us, and the Good Way of the Lord; which envious spirits, wh are proud and know nothing, that cannot abide sound Doctrine, do reproach and slander us, and by false   things to our charge which we never knw; therefore we being innocent and clear cannot but deny and  witness against all those proceedings, which are ot according to the Law of Righteous∣ness and equity, and lay th at your door▪ whom it nearly concern. Unto thee Henry Cromwel who is Commander in chief for the Affairs of Ireland, and to thy Council we write. We have seen two several Warrants der your , dated at Dublin, and in them both you say, You have received information at your board, of great disorders, and disturbances of  in the Cou of rk, and Places adjacent, by Francis Howgill ad Edward Burrough. This we say unto you; your Informer hath declared an truth at your Board, and we dere that you may make it appear where in we have made any disturbance, or disorder; all these things in your Warrants we deny and do charge you in the Name of the God of Justice, to send for them that so informed you, that have so abused you, and are so bold and impudent, as to declare unto you any such thing, and so have caused you to bring guilt upon your selves, in sending ou your Warrants to bring the Innocent before your Judgment-seat; and caused us to be dragged a hundred Miles from place to place, as Mlefactors, and as though we had done some criminal act; and when we have dome before yo▪ you had nothing to lay to our charge▪ but have endeavoured to give Sentence of Banishment of us out of your Nation, who are free-born English men, nor have we been burthenfom to your Nation, nor transgressed any known Law of the Nation; and you have judged us before our  came; and herein you do us great injustice, and you act contrary to the
Law of Equity, and that which you your selves in your own case would not allo, to that in all your Consciences I speak. Oh, that ever you should thus req the Lord for his Love and Mercy, in breaking the Yoak o the Oppressor from off your necks; and now power is given into your hands to relieve the Innocent, and to set the Opressed free, to execute Judgment and righteousness upon the Transgres∣sors, whom the Law is against. And this doth God require of you, that his Wi may be done, and your wills denied, that so the Nation may be established in Righteousness, and that your latter end may be better then your beginning; but if you go on in the way you are beginning, and ur Justice backward, and l Equity fall in the Streets, and not suffer Judgment to enter, then misery will be your end. Wo is me, for you have all forgot the Rock from whence you were hen, and the Deliverances of the Lord to you in the time of diss, yea, you have forgot∣ten, and your hearts are lifted up; and by your policy think to establish your own wills, and to limit the Holy One a Way, and set up your Standard by his, and tru in the ar of flesh: What is become of the liberty of tender Consciences you hav spoken of, and we have engaged with you to purchase? And is it ended in this? O horrible hypocrisie! that they who bear witness against all sin, and iniquity, and against all deceit, that they should now be made a prey of. And we charge all i the Name of the Living God in Ireland to convince us of evil, or the transgressi∣on of any Law; and if it cannot be done, let none lay hold on us, to abridge  of our liberty, lest you bring guilt upon your selves. And do not take counsel at them nor hold them up, who are Hirelings, and walk in the steps of the false Prophets, and in the error of Balaam, who speak for Gifts and Rewards, who in all Generations resisted every appearance of God in his Saints, and now would make all bow to their Image; and they bend their tongues, and report Lyes, and make Lyes their refuge, the Hand of the dreadful God of Heaven and Earth is against them; yea, the Lord will thunder from Heaven against them, they shall be blown away in the Whirle-wind of Gods Wrath, who have perverted the Way of the Lord, because they stand not in the Counsel of the Lord, but flatter you,  they have done the Princes in all Generations, till all were laid waste together. Wo is me for you, Have you consulted, have you taken counsel together agai the Lord, and his Servants, whom he hath sent unto you, and do you thus requi the Lord already? Have you sent out your Decree, to shut out and root out the Seed of Iacob in a day, whom the Lord hath made choice of above all the Fami∣lies of the Earth? Surely your Decree will be broken, and your Cords wi  but as a Bulrush; for them whom you now set at nought are precious in the Ey of the Lord, and unto our God shall you bow, and worship at his feet. Consi∣der, if there be any honesty left among you; What is become of all the Persecut of old? And will you tell of Reformation, and yet act in the foot-steps of the Persecutors? If you go on, you are at the brink of destruction, and at e sides of the pit; and you will be made a ruinous Heap, and as desolate as Mo Esau, which is a place for Dragons: Was not persecution ever blind? Would they ever own themselves to be such? For verily if you knew us, you would  have done so unto us. When Herod stretched out his hand to vex certain of the Church, the next you hear of him, he is eaten up of Worms. The dread of the Lord of Host is upon all the proud, and lofty, and high Oaks, and the wind o the Almighty shall blow them all down root and branch, and all your strength, is which you trust, if you take counsel at Aegypt, will become as a bowed Wall, and as a rotten Hedg; and God will make them that exalt themselves against him,  a Dunghil, and as the Princes of Gog, of Mesek, and Tubal, which are all peri∣shed among the rest of the uncricumcised. Oh, ye Potsheards, do you think y can limit the Lord? will he be instructed by you? he that reproves him, let hi answer it: Can you command the wind that it blow not upon the Earth? C you stop the Waves of the Sea, and say unto them he still? Can you stop the Bottles of Heaven, that it rain not? If you cannot, all be silent, and  not to resist the Lord in his own Work which he is bringing to pass in this
own day, he will confound the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nought the ho∣nourable of the Earth, and make all as a Plain before him, who can withstand him? Oh, ye Potsheards, fear and tremble before him, who is a consuming Fire to all the ungodly, who is visiting the Transgressors with vengeance dread and fury, and putting into their hands a Cup of trembling, and making Ierusalem a bur∣thensom Stone, all that meddle with it shall be wearied, they shall faint, and bow themselves, and sink under it, and be crushed as with a Cart-wheel to piees, and their names shall rot from under Heaven, and all shall know our God is the living God, yea, the God of gods, yea, there is none like him; and know this, no power you had of us, except it had been from above. We were with you in the City of Dublin near three moneths, some of us, and none laid hands on us, but the time was not come, and till the Testimony of the Lord▪ was near finished, which he sent us to do, none could lay hands on us: And know this, though this be a time of temptation and trial, yet it shall be for the furtherance of the Gospel of Christ; and though you think in your hearts, by sending us out of your Nation, that so all will cease, and Deceit will stand without molestation; I tell you, nay, even the children that are yet in the womb shall be brought forth, and hear witness against the deceit of this Generation. And know this, there is a Stump, which is but little, which is bound about, as with Iron and Brass, and out of it shall spring fire, that shall be kindled, and flame to the tor∣ment of all them who worship the Beast, and have received his mark, and to the tormenting of all the false Prophets in the Nation, and it shall burn, and none shall be able to quench it; many shall bear witness unto us, that we came not in our own names, but in the Name of the Living Eternal God, who by his power hath accomplished his own Work, for his own Glory, and many shall bless us in the Name of the Lord; and all our Opposers shall gnash their Teeth, and gnaw their tongues for pain, for the torment that is coming upon them; all that have resisted the Counsel of the most high God, and have gainsayed the Lord, they shall perish in their gainsaying, and we are clear and free from the blood of all men in this Nation thus far; yea, of every City, Town, and Village, unto which we were moved to go; and the blood of all the rest be upon those that have resisted us; and a good savour we are unto God in them that have believed in his Name, of whom we have born true witness unto, and in them that perish we are clear in the sight of God. And oh thou City of Dublin, thou art as Moab, at ease, and art lifted up in thy heart, and rejoycing in thy spoil, and art making thy self merry in the abun∣dance of thy delicacies; oh, how full of profaness art thou? oh, how full of pride and vain glory, of deceit and unrighteousness, of lust and filth, lying and swearing, and full of Briars and Thorns? a careless untoward People: Oh, your abominations are loathsom to all the Children of Light, professing God in words, but in your lives and works deny him: oh, that thou hadst known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace; a crooked Generation you are, the yoke must be laid upon you necks; will neither Plague, Famine nor Sword bring thee into subjection unto the Lord? will neither Mercy nor Judg∣ment take place in your hearts? Oh, how long shall the Lord bear with you? how long shall he spare you? his long-suffering is near at an end; his patience is near out concerning you; and then, wo wo to him that shall see the day which will come; the Lord will arise as a Lion, and will rend and tear you, and his Sword shall be bathed in the blood of his Enemies, and he shall be wrath, as in the Valley of Acor, and as in the dayes of Giba, and will bring ye down ye Mountains, and level you ye Hills, and will make his Name known in your overthrow, except ye repent; and they that are round about you, when they shall see Calamity coming upon you, this shall be their Proverb, This is the City and People that dispised the Counsel of the Lord, and contemned the In∣structions of the most high God, and provoked the Lord to wrath, till his Pati∣ence was worn out, and his Long-suffering came to an end, and therefore is this evil come upon them. Therefore gird your selves in Sackcloth, and pour Ashes
upon your heads; houl and weep ye cureless People, misery is coming u you; the dreadful God will visit with a Scourge, and will make you know  is the Lord: Blessed is he that hears, and considers, and repents, and turns  his iniquity, before the Decree be sealed against you, which will never be altered▪ This is the day of your visitation, and If you contemn it, wo unto you for ever and fo we are clear in Gods sight of you all, from the highest to the lowest, a your blood if you perish will the Lord require at your own hands, from this  forth and for evermore. We are Friends to all just Powers, and are subject to the highest Power for Conscience  but witness against all deceit and unrighteousness, and against all that hold the Truth  unrighteousness, who are Prisoners of the Lord for the testimony of Iesus, our Con∣sciences bearng us witness in the Holy Ghost. This was also subscribed by F. Howgill. Edw. Burrough. Dublin, 24th of the 12th Moneth, 1655. The unjust Sufferings of the Iust declared, and their ap∣peal to the just Witness of God in all mens Con∣sciences. TO all ye Colonels, and Commanders, and Officers, and to all the honest hearted in the City of Dublin, and elsewhere, to whom this may come▪ Hereby we the Prisoners of the Lord, for the Testimony of Jesus, and for the ex∣ercise of a pure Conscience, do lay down our cause before you, and to the Light of Jesus Christ in all your Consciences we appeal in this our cause of Right∣ousness and Innocency, to be judged thereby; We are men fearing God, and working righteousness, and are Friends to the Commonwealth of Israel, and are Exaltes of Justice and true Judgment in the Earth, and are subject to all just power, and to every just ordinance of man for Conscience sake, and have suffer∣ed the loss of all, and have born part of the burthen with you, that we might obtain the freedom of the righteous Seed, and the liberty of tender Conscience, to serve the Lord in his own way; and we are well known to the Lord, though Strangers to you, and are Free-men in the record of Heaven, though now Suf∣ferers unjustly under your present authority, who have taken the place of exer∣cising lordship over our pure Consciences, and have imprisoned us, and endea∣voured to give judgment of banishing us, onely upon false Accusations and In∣formations, and Slanders, without the proof or testimony of any Accusation of  justly laid to our charge. And to you hereby be it known, that not for evil do∣ing do we thus suffer; for to this present no man hath convinced us of any evil, nor justly proved the transgression of any Law (Martial or Civil) against us, though we stand accused of many grievous things, of which we are clearly inno∣cent in the sight of him that lives for ever▪ and do nothing more desire herein but o be tryed by the Law of Equity, and Righteousness, and judged according thereunto▪ By vertue of command given unto us by the eternal Spirit of the Lord came we into this Land of Ireland, contrary to the will of man, not to seek our selves, nor our own glory, not to prejudice your Nation, nor Government, nor to be hurtful to your Commonwealth, but with the Message of the Gospel of Christ Jesus we came to turn from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to the Power of God, and  minister the Word of Reconciliation, and Salvation eely (without a Gift or a Reward) unto lost souls; and hereof God is our Witness▪ and also we have the seal of our Ministry, which unto us herein can give testimony by the same Spirit, and this are e ready to seal with our blood. And these six moneths and upwards have we
laboured in travels, and sufferings, and reproaches; and have passed through your Cities and Towns in soberness; and in meekness have we preached the Kingdom of God, and have holden forth the Word of Truth, and the Testimony of Jesus; and our lives have we not loved till this day, though sometimes dan∣gers on every side have beset us, that we might hold forth the Faith of Jesus, the Authour of our profession, in the exercise of a pure Conscience, both by do∣ctrine and conversation, and herein we are justified in the sight of God, and who is he that condemns us? And do call Heaven and Earth to record, and the Light in all mens Consciences, who have heard our Doctrine, and seen our con∣versation, to witness for us herein; and we challenge all your Nation of Ireland, our very Enemies, to prove the contrary, though otherwise we stand falsly accu∣sed, and falsly reputed to be Disturbers, and Makers of disorders, to the breach of publique Peace, and such like grievous things upon the false Information; whereof a Warrant was issued out from the chief Ruler and Council of Ireland, and we thereby were apprehended in the City of Corke, and haled by Guards, as Malefactors too, before the Council in this City, where none of all these false Accusations were, or could be proved against us, nor the transgression of any known Law could we be convicted of, and though occasions were sought against us▪ yet none could be found, and though snares were laid for our feet, yet were we not entrapped, but were cleared in the sight of God, witnessed by the Light in all their Consciences, and were found innocent, and without reproof in the Eye of the Lord; and by our innocency were their orders of false Accusations made of none effect, and we thus far proved to be guiltless before the Throne of true Judg∣ment: Yet notwithstanding contrary to the Light in their own Consciences, and contrary to the just Laws of the Nations (which afford freedom to the Free∣born and Righteous) were we committed to Prison, without conviction or any guilt charged upon us, or the least appearance of evil towards any man's person, though falsly accused, yet no true testimony given against us, whereby our bold∣ness in the Way of the Lord could be discouraged, as having the Testimony of the Spirit of God bearing us witness in the Holy Ghost, that in all good Consci∣ence towards God and towards man we have lived to this day, and so are with∣out reproof in the sight of God, and all just Men; and though upon search and examination we were found guiltless thus far, yet further hath the Enemy the De∣vil prevailed in cruelty against the Innocent, that it is endeavoured that we be ba∣nished, under the account of Vagabonds, which last Accusation is the most false and unrighteous; for we challenge this, Of whom have we begged? or to whom have we been burdensome? or whose bread have we eaten for nothing? or what evil have we done? Where is the testimony of your Slanders? But innocently do we suffer these things, bearing reproaches, and binding the cruelty done unto us, as Chains about our necks, and as Crowns upon our heads, having the as∣surance that for well doing we suffer these things from the hands of the Rulers, through the Lies and Slanders of the Teachers, who are in Cain's way of persecuti∣on, till they have fulfilled their measure of wickedness, and be laid waste as the Wilderness. And this is our cause, and hereby it comes before you, by the Light of Christ in your Consciences to be judged; if your Hearts be not altogether hardened, and your Minds wholly blinded; and we lay it at the door, to receive sentence from you, and without respect of persons, holds forth our guiltless cause before you, not begging any thing from you, but herein to clear our Consciences, that you may save your selves from this untoward Generation, whose Root is cor∣rupt, and Fruit bitterness; for while we have breath from the Lord, and injoy∣ment of his Presence, our duty is to serve the Lord, in bearing witness against in∣justice, and all cruelty, and oppression, and shall appeal to receive justice from the present power which now rules; for in the Name of the Lord we challenge our pri∣viledge of freedom as being Free-born, till we be accused guilty by the just Law of Equity, unto which we are subject for Conscience sake, and not to any mans will, but by word and writing are bound by the Law of God, to bear witness against the
unjust proceedings herein of the Heads and Rulers of Dublin, and shall seal our witness against them, and against their unrighteous Decrees sealed in their cruelty against the Innocent, with our blood, if thereunto we be called. Edw. Burrough. Dublin the 26th of the 12th Moneth, 1655. A Challenge to the Priests of Dublin, to try their God, and their Ministry, and their Worships. WE the Servants and faithful Witnesses of the most High God, called and cho∣sen of him, and redeemed out of Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and People; who are Ministers of the Word of Life, and Reconciliation and Messen∣gers of Glad-tidings, and Salvation, unto captive and weary Souls; our glorying is only in the Lord, and not in our selves, who are by the World in scorn called Quakers; who are at this present in outward bonds, for the Testimony of Jesus Christ in Dublin; and who have been in the labour and travel of the Gospel of God these six moneths and upwards, in this Nation of Ireland, according to the Will of God ordained hereunto, and moved, and commanded by his Eternal Spirit into this his Work, for the Seed's sake which is not of this World, to the gathering of it into the Fold of Everlasting Peace; and to the clearing of the Lord from the blood of his Enemies, that they may be left without excuse, by his Powerful Word given unto us, and uttered by us (and herein we are a good sa∣vour to God, both in them that perish, and in them that believe) and for this cause have we denied our dearest and nearest Relations, and love not our lives unto death, that our Testimony we may finish, which is committed to us of the Lord; and because of this are we Labourers under many burdens, and travels in many af∣flictions, and sufferings, and are abundantly reproached, and our Lord's Truth, of which we bear witness, greatly infamed, by many slandering and back-biting Tongues, especially by Teachers, and professed Ministers, in the ears of their Peo∣ple, and Hearers; slandering us with being Jesuits, and Deceivers, and Seducers, and Hereticks and Blasphemers, and Witches, and such like; and we of those false Accusations being clear, and our Lords Truth, the Testimony which we hold, wholly innocent, and are willing to be tryed and proved, and made manifest to the Inhabitants of this City and Nation, in the sight of God. This therefore am I moved to give forth; and hereby in the name of our Living Eternal God of Heaven and Earth, whom we serve and worship, in that Way which is called Heresie, to send it abroad as a Challenge to all you Teachers, and pretended Ministers, of what sort and form soever, and to all you People whom it may really concern; and especially to all you in the City of Dublin, and Pla∣ces elsewhere in Ireland, to whom this may come; that you meet us in the City of Dublin, at some publique Place, at a convenient time appointed by you, at which place and time if the Lord permit (by the permission of the Council of Ireland, whose Prisoners we are) we shall meet you then there, to have a fair and sober Dis∣pute in the presence of all People, who may desire to be informed, or satisfied, concerning us and you, in these things whereof you can accuse us; and also of those things, by way of sober Questions, which we have to propound to you, not for any end to our selves, nor to set up a Kingdom of our own (God is our Wit∣ness) but that the Way of our God may be made manifest, and all deceit and er∣ror discovered, and all People may be informed the Way to Salvation; and as you are true to your God, and will answer for him, and are willing to be made ma∣nifest in your way of Worship, and Doctrine, and Ministry, you are not to
neglect, but herein to answer our desire and the desires of many hundreds, that you and we may be made manifest in the sight of God, to all mens Con∣sciences, who are in Truth, and who are in Error, that Shame and Condemnation may come upon the guilty, and Truth may be exalted over all Deceit. Given under my hand, who am a Prisoner for the Testimony of Iesus, whose name in the This was also subscribed by F. Howgill. flesh is, Edward Burrough. Sent forth the 23d of the 12th moneth, from the Sergeant at Arms his house in Dublin. You are desired to send your Answer of these Propositions to us, and if you consent to meet us, let sufficient notice be given abroad, that the Inhabitants of the City, and Country may know five or six dayes time before. This was sent to the Priests of Dublin, but no answer to this day have we received from them; whereby it is manifest that they are not true to their God, nor willing to be tryed and made manifest; but love Darkness, and hate the Light, and back-bite in secret, and cannot give a Witness openly, but fall before the tryal, and Truth reigns over them, and is exalted over their Deceit. A Discovery of the Idol dumb Shepherds in that Na∣tion, and a Lamentation over their Starved and Strayed Flocks. THe Day of the Lord is approaching, and the Day of account draws near up∣on you the Inhabitants of the Earth; the time of your Covenant is expired made with Death, and Hell; and the Lord God will plead with you, and reckon with you, and give unto you a just reward, every one according to your deeds, even the condition of your Bond. Ye Shepherds, and Pastors of the flock, and Teachers of the people, what account will ye render to the Lord in the Day of his appearing? Should you not have gathered the Flock, and fed them, and taught them in the Way of Righteousness, and preserved them from straying abroad, but instead there∣of you have scattered them upon the barren Mountains, and have starved them, and have strayed them, and led them into by-paths of Idolatry, and made a Prey upon them, and have fed your selves of them, and the Heritage of the Lord hath been wasted by you, and the Pastures of the Fold eaten up by Wolves, and Devouters, and Lyons Whelps, which made the Flock affraid, driving them into secret corners of Darkness, Leanness, and Poverty, where they are dead for want of Food. O ye Shepherds, your account will be woful, and miserable in the dreadful day which is hastening upon you; not one Lamb have you brought forth to Perfe∣ction, to lie down in Peace in the Fold, but have nourisht it into the nature of a Doge, and a Wolf; and you have fed them with Swines-flesh, and with the Husk; and Milk they have not received from you, thereby to grow up unto God in his Image; and not one Fleece hath the Lord gathered from all your Flock. You Teachers, Shepherds, and Pastors, your debt of wickedness is a gross sum of great abomination in the Record of account; you have taught innocent Chil∣dren into subtle hypocrisie, out of Uprightness into Guile: you have taught Lyes instead of Truth, and thereby have the People been instructed into Error, Sects,
and false Opinions; and not one Child have you taught perfect in the Way of the Lord, neither one of your Hearers have you presented perfect in Christ Jesus unto the Father, but for Gifts and Rewards have you taken the charge of the Hea∣rers, and not one hath come to the Knowledge of the Truth, by you under your teaching; for you have been a cursed Example, in Pride, in Coveteousness, in Oppression, and in Hypocrisie; And how could you teach Children in the Way of Purity, when your selves have walked in the way of Idolatry? The lan∣gge of Babylon have you instructed the People, and not one verse have you lear∣ned in Sions Record; you have nurtured them in the nature of whoredom, and their Virginity have they lost. What will ye do ye Shepherds, and Teachers, the Arrest of Judgment from the Court of Equity is come forth against you, and sealed never to be changed? Whether will you flee to hide you? Gods Judgments will pursue you, and your Reward will be Indignation and Vengeance, and your charge will be the devou∣ring and murdering of souls, and the Flock will be required of you: and eve∣ry Lamb, which carelesly you have starved, the blood thereof will be put upon your account; and every Child you have taught in the way of iniquity, the iniquity thereof will be laid to your charge. O Doleful reckoning! when the Lord appears, a grievous sum are you guilty, which you are never able to pay; and just he is that calleth you to an account, and the truth of his Bill will be sealed with the Light in your own Consciences, which is the Lords Witness, which hath been privy to all your abominations; one year, after another have you been spared, and interest upon interest will be put upon your score; not one day of faithful service and true watching over the Flock can you give testimony of; but idle Shepherds have you been, and slumbring Watch-men have you proved, and the whole Flock have been devoured, and scattered, and not one Lamb is found in the Fold, nor one strayed sheep brought home from wan∣dring, but the Fences of the Fold are laid waste, and the door is shut up, and bolted against him that would enter, and you have removed the Pastures out of the pleasant Valleys, into the desolate and wilde, and untilled Mountains, where every wilde Beast playeth, and every desolate Bird inhabiteth. What will you plead for your selves? Oh, ye deceitfull Hirelings, who have run, and were not sent, by whom the People are not profited at all: But you Leaders of the People have caused them to err in unknown Paths, and you have taken the charge of that you were not able to perform; you have wasted the the Masters goods, and his Children have not been taught the Way of Holi∣ness; you have spent his Portion among Harlots, and have given your Lord's Money to abominable uses; nothing is gathered of your Vines, but wilde Grapes, and sower Grapes, which the Lords Soul loatheth; no Figs of your Thorns have been reaped; but your best fruit have been of a loathsom taste, the most Inno∣cent among you have been found guilty of Innocent Blood of Souls. Wo is me for you, ye Flocks of these Shepherds Folds; alas, alas, your souls are starved, and your feet are strayed, and into by-Paths of Whoredoms have you been instructed, and the door of the true Shepherds Fold hath been shut against you, and the Key of true knowledge hath been hid out of your sight, and obscuri∣ty and darkness hath been cast before you, and the Way of the Lord hath been undiscovered to your understandings, and into secret and subtil Idolatry and Witchcraft have you been nurtured, and your wounds have been healed falsely, and will break out into more incurable dangers. O how have you been dri∣ven away into strange Pastures, and into barren Heaths and Desarts, scattered lo here, and lo there, by the voyces of Strangers; now when the Lord is come to search you, instead of Lambs, you are found in the nature of Wolves, and Dogs, and Lions, biting, and devouring, and scorning, and reproaching the Children of the true Seed; and instead of Children of Light and Truth, are you found strong men of Darkness and Error: How is your nature changed since the first creation in the Innocent Image of God? strayed have you been, and
not one brought home by your Shepherds into the Fold of Truth; you have been a prey to the Devourers, and meat for the wilde Beasts of the desolate Forrests, and a strange Language have you learned of the Egyptians Character, and your delight have been therein, even you have loved to have these things so; and like Shepherds like Sheep, Strayers and strayed, Devourers and being devoured, What account will you give in the Day of the Lord? For your sins are written with a Pen of Iron, sealed in your foreheads, children of the womb of wick∣edness: A gross sum of abomination is put upon your account; even Lovers of Darkness, and Haters of the Light; How many times have you been called by the true Shepherds Voice, and you neglect, and will not be gathered? How many good instructions have you heard? And what profit have you received? Much Teaching and many Sermons have you heard, and yet to this day the Way of Truth have you not learned, but are groping in the dark, in blindness, and ignorance; and you Blind have been led by the Blind, and the mouth of the Ditch is opened to swallow you up together; and you have refused Know∣ledge, and cannot endure to be reproved; you love to stray rather then to be gathered, and you delight in leanness and poverty upon the barren Mountaines, rather then to be fed in the fat Pastures of true Food. Shall not the Lords Soul be avenged upon you? Ye Shepherds and Flocks, ye Teachers and People, your debt is summed into a large sum of grievous abomination, the Indictment of Vengeance is read, and sealing against you, proved to be just in the Register of Heaven; everlasting Prison in the pit of Darkness, and everlasting Banishment from the Presence of the Lord is signing against you, in the eternal Law and righ∣teous Decree; the Light of the Lord Jesus Christ which shines in all your Con∣sciences will arise to be the evidence of this just proceeding. God is grieved with you, you spiritual Idolaters. Repent, repent ye Idol Shepherds, and deceitful Teachers, and ye scattered Flocks, and deceitful People; This is the day of your visitation, and a warning in your ears, the Sword of the Lord is drawn against you, the Whirle-wind of his Wrath is gone forth; your builded wall shall fall, and the pillars of your Habitation shall be shaken. God will gather his Flock out of your mouths, and feed them in his own Fold, and your nakedness shall appear, and your deceits shall be laid open, and your secret whoredoms shall be discovered; your beginning was in Darkness, and your time is out of the Light, and your end will be in de∣struction, now you have all time, prize it. From him who is a Lover of all your souls, but a Witness against all your deceit. Edw. Burrough. Written in Corke City in Ireland, as moved of the Lord concerning the Shepherds and Flock, the Teachers and People in that Nation. An Invitation to all the poor desolate Souldiers to repent, and make their peace with the Lord, and their Duty shewed them what the Lord requires of them. TO all you poor desolate Souldiers of the lowest rank, who are scattered up and down, in this desolate Land of Ireland, and live a careless and a desolate life, without the Fear of the Lord, in Lying, in Swearing, in Drunkenness, in Whoredom, in Oppression, and in the Wickedness of the World, and are past feeling, and sensless of the Opperation and Power of God, careless of your eternal happiness. The dreadful Day of the Lord God is coming, in Power the
Lord is risen, and the Wrath of the Lord is gone forth, with the strength of indignation and fury will you be besieged, and fearfulness shall surprize you. Repent of your transgressions, and fear and tremble before the Presence of the Living God, who is Commander in chief over Heaven and Earth; prize your souls, this is the day of your visitation, and make your Peace with the Lord: The righteous Judge, the Lord, seeth you in your darkness, and searcheth you in your desolate obscurity, and his soul is pressed under your iniquities, and he hath not disrespected any of your persons or desolate places; but God is Light, and hath lightened every one of you with the true Light of Life Eternal, if you love it, and be guided by it; or of death everlasting, if you hate it, and disobey it, and walk contrary to it; that is the Light which convinceth you of Sin, of Lying, and Swearing, and Cursed-speakings, and Drunkenness, which are the fruits of the cursed Tree, which cumbereth the Ground of the Lord, which the Axe is now laid to the root of, to cut it down, and cast it into everlasting burning: and while you act against this Light in your Consciences, you cruci∣fie the Life of Christ Jesus, and are Enemies unto him, and Servants of the De∣vil, and love your evil deeds, and Upholders of the Devils conquest, which is the dominion of sin. This Light reproves you in secret of violence, and false ac∣cusing, and all unjust words and actions which are contrary to God;  turn your minds to the Light, which will lead you to repentance from dead works, out of the broad way of destruction, which many are in (as Christ Jesus saith) and it will teach you in your places to serve the Living God, and to do vio∣lence to no man, but to be Terrors, and Reprovers, and Correctors of all vi∣olence, and of such who live in it: And it will teach you not to strengthen the hands of Evil-doers, but to lay your Swords in justice upon every one th doth evil: And it will teach you not to make War, but to preserve peace in the Earth; and this is your Place and Duty required of you from the Lord Go Commander in chief, unto whom you must all give an account, and receive  just Reward according to your deeds, everlasting punishment to him that do evil; but if you stand in the Fear of the Lord, your Sword will be a ter and dread to them that fear him not, but live contrary to the Light in their own Consciences, which Light if you love, it is your Command to march by▪ and your Rule to judge by, and Weapon to fight withal, and your chief Com∣mission for duty. And now you have all time take heed to your selves, go not on in your course of evil, nor take not your pleasure in unrighteousness, but to th Light in your Consciences take heed, it is your Teacher to God if you love it, or your Condemnation from God if you hate it. And this is yo Terms with the Lord, prize the acceptance of his Love to your souls, and the Day of your visitation, lest you perish in your rebellion eternally. Written in love to your souls, Edw. Burrough. Written in Ireland at Caterlough. A Warning from the Lord to you the Natives of the Nation of Ireland, who are made a Curse and a Prey to be destroyed of your Enemies. REpent, repent ye that remain from being devoured, whose dayes are  stretched forth, that you may return to the Lord, from whom you are grievously degenerated into filthiness, and uncleanness, being a cursed Brood, and are become unhuman in your impudent shameless practices of ungodliness,
and are brazened in your filthiness, and cannot blush when you have done evil; the Plagues of God, and his Wrath waits to consume you from off the face of the Earth; you are shut up in blindness, and covered with darkness, which may be felt; and you are as deaf Adders, void of understanding, and past feel∣ing, and given up to work all unrighteousness with delight, counting it your glory to work wickedness, having sold your selves to commit sin; you have wholly slain Gods Witness, and are become wilde and brutish as the Beasts of the Field, and untamed as savage Colts; the Indignation of God is against you, who are as dead Trees, and withered Branches, and scorched Heaths, not sensible of good nor evil, but as wild Asses, who neither fear God nor regard man: To the Light in your Consciences wherewith Christ hath lightened you, do I now speak: Gods murdered Witness shall answer me, by which you are inexcusable; for with the Light you know Lying, Swearing, Stealing, Murder, Drunkenness, and Whoredom are Sins and Transgressions; the Light will let you see these abound among you, by which you are reproved, and eternally to be condemned if you do not repent of these your grievous abominations: And if you love the Light, and turn to it, it will lead you out of sin, and out of your vain foolish Traditi∣ons, and Immitations, and Sorceries, and Witchcrafts, which deceive your souls: And this Light in your Consciences will change you into Soberness, and Huma∣nity, and will lead you into the Way of Life and Salvation, out of the way of Death and Hell, wherein you walk to eternal misery. Therefore prize your souls, and the dreadful God fear; and tremble before him ye prophane Wretches, and cease from your filthy, nasty, poluted wayes of Idolatry, Lying, Swearing, Stealing, Drunkenness, and such like God forbideth, with the Light in your Con∣sciences; and he that doth these things shall eternally perish in condemnation for ever. And this to you is a Warning, in pity to your lost souls, whose hearts are de∣sperately wicked, and set to do mischief; the Vengeance of God is against you; the Light in your Consciences shall witness me, and justifie the Lord in the Day of recompence, when every man receives according to his deeds, the Righteous unto Life, the Wicked unto eternal Wrath. Now you have time prize it; the Light is your Teacher loving it, and your Condemnation for ever, hating it. By one who suffers for the Seeds sake, waiting for the building of destroyed Sion. EDWARD BURRUGH.
A Trumpet of the Lord Sounded forth of SION; Which gives a certain sound in the Ears of all Nations, and is a true noise of a fearfull Earthquake at hand, which shall shake the whole fabrick of the Earth, and the Pillars of its standing shall fall, and never more be set up again. Or fearfull Voices of terrible Thunders, uttered forth from the Throne, to the astonishment of the Heathen in all the Quarters of the Earth, who are not sealed in the forehead. And is an Alarm, and preparation for War against all Nations where Gog and Magog resideth. And sheweth the wounding Sword of the Mighty God, from whose blow, the Kings, nor the Captains, nor the mighty men, cannot flee to escape. Declared and written by a Son of Thunder, as a Warning to all the Inhabitants of the Earth, where the great Image is standing, or any part of it worshipped, speedily to meet the Lord by Repentance, that in the day of his fierce Wrath they may be hid. With a Salutation to the Seed who are gathered into the Fold, and with the Chil∣dren of the King: The Tongue that was dumb sings a joyfull Song of Sion, in an unknown Language, which none can understand, save the Redeemed of the Lord. BY Order and Authority given unto me by the Spirit of the Living God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the One and thirtieth day of the tenth Moneth, in the Year of the Worlds account 1655. about the fourth hour in the morning, when my Meditations were  my God, upon my Bd in Kilkenny City, in the Nation of Ireland, at that time the Word of the Lord came unto me, (from the Righteous Iudge of Heaven and Earth, who was,  is, and is to come, who sitteth on the Throne of righteous Iudgement, judging Nations, and Kindreds, and Tongues, and Peoples, equally) saying, Write my Controversie with all the Inhabitants of the Earth, unto all sorts of People, as I will shew thee: By this same Authority and Commission declared, this I send unto you, the Tribes of the Earth, and this upon your heads shall stand for ever, to be witnessed by the Light of Christ Iesus, in all your Consciences, in the dreadfull day of Vengeance, which upon you, O Inhabi∣tants of the Earth, is coming. Prepare, prepare to meet the Lord, O Nations, Tongues, and People, unto you all hereby a Warning is come, and a Visitation from the Presence of the Li∣ving God, which you are straitly required to put in practise, as at the terrible day of dreadful Vengeance you will answer the contrary. Given under my hand, and sealed by the Spirit of the Eternal God who liv for ever. Through a Servant of the Lord. E. B. O Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord, and awake, awake, awake, all ye Inhabitants thereof, and give ear, give ear, unto the con∣troversie which the Lord hath with you, Noble and Ignoble, listen un∣to the Word of the Lord; men of high degree, and men of low degree, be not stout-hearted, nor stop not your Ears, for the Lord hath spoken; People of
all sorts, and men of all conditions, the Word of the Lord is towards you, even from the Princes and Nobles that sit-upon the Throne, unto the Slaves and Bond-men, that are made a prey; The Lord's Controversie is against you, and the migh∣ty terrible Day of the Lord is coming upon you, wherein he will plead with you, because of your Transgressions which cannot be numbred, but do exceed theirs in former Generations, who were cut off by his outstretched Arm. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Now also will I arise, as a mighty man of War, and will appear in my Majesty, to gather the Nations, and to fan them, and to try them, in the wind of my Wrath, and to purge them, and to refine them in the Furnace of my Fire, of Indignation, and Jealousie. And this from my mouth is a Warning to you, and a Sound in your ears, by authority from my Spirit. To thee, Oliver Cromwell, called Protector. THus saith the Lord, My Controversie is against thee, because thou hast not been faithful to the end, in my Work, but hast taken thy rest and ease and pleasure upon thy high and lofty Mountain of Pride, and vain Glory, and hast set up thy self to be worshipped, exalting thy own Horn, and hast not fully given Glory and Honour to me, of that which I have done by thee, but in thy heart boasts thy self against me, who hath hewed with thee, and made thee an Instrument in my Hand, to do my Will upon my Enemies; and now thou performest not thy Vows made to me in the day of distress, but thou hast broken Truce with me; and now thou sufferest grievous and hainous Oppression, and Cruelty, and Tyranny to be act∣ed in thy name upon my People, whom I have chosen, and elected to exalt my Name by; by unjust Imprisonments, and grievous Persecution do they suffer in thy name, which the Cruel-hearted make a cloak of for their cruelty, and even such who have been thy Enemies, thy name is a cloak unto, to hid their cruel intents, and wicked purposes against my People, whom they tread upon; and this is not unknown to thee, and therefore the less excusable art thou in my sight, and the greater will my Judgments be upon thy head, which suddenly I will bring upon thee, except thou repent, and return to thy first integrity; which if thou dost, I will honour thee next unto my Chosen, and give thee the necks of Princes to tread upon, and their Dominions for thy Inheritance; otherwise thus shall it be done unto thee, if thou wilt not hear, and obey my Voice, saith the Lord. To all ye his Council. THus saith the Lord, My Controversie is against you, because ye are one with him, and every whit fully guilty of his Transgressions, and feed him and your selves in the valleys of vain glories, with vain shews, and hopes; and your endeavours are more to secure your selves from Mischief, and Plots, and wicked Intentions, which remain in the hearts of the Rebellious against you, then to de∣fend and preserve the Innocent; for you neglect to take off Oppression, and to ease the Oppressed; but make your Fingers as heavy as your Fathers Loynes, who were cast out before you; and the same Laws stand still in force, by which Ty∣ranny and Oppression is acted; and the same false Prophets you establish by a Law, which deceive the Nations, and flatter you by subtil Speeches, and there is no pure Reformation wrought in the Earth; but you with your power joyn with the first Beast, who was wounded by a grievous blow of fury, to make War against the Lamb and his Followers; and you seek to set up that which I am about to throw down, and you are not ignorant of the grievous Cry of the poor, under the burthen of oppression laid upon them by your Laws, by which they unjustly suffer the imprisonment of their Bodies, and the spoiling of their Goods, and
you suffer this wickedness to be done, and shut up your compassion, and the hands of Evil-doers hereby are strengthened, through your forbearance they are hard∣ened in their cruelty, and because you profess more of the Name of the Lord, then some that have gone before you, and perform as little, the greater is your abomi∣nation, and the deeper is your hypocrisie, and the greater will my Judgments be upon your heads, except you speedily repent, and walk in my Counsel, which if you do, honourable in Counsel will I make you, and your Renown shall Ge∣nerations to come exalt; otherwise, if you refuse my Word to hear, I will make you a Reproach, and a Curse to Ages for ever. To all ye Iudges, and Lawyers, and your Train, and to all that handle the Law. THus saith the Lord, My Controversie is against you, because of your abomi∣nations, for you are the very Actors of the allowed Oppressions; and in judging for Gifts, and Rewards, and Bribery, some of you have exceeded all that ever went before you, and many just Causes of the Poor have been neglected for want of a large Gift; and many unjust Actions of the rich men have you plea∣ded against Equity, for advantage to your selves; your Council have respected Persons, and in Bribery and Gifts have you delighted, and thereby have made your selves as Lords in the Earth, and have set your selves upon high Hills, and you have followed the counsel of your own heatts, and your human wit and lear∣ning, in seeking out the justness of a Cause, and in judging thereof; and my righ∣teous Law of Justice have you not regarded to be your Rule, but through the policy and craft have you hidden the simplicity of the Law from the Ignora, in unknown Languages, and obscure Sentences; and your wills many times have been your Law, and true Judgment have you turned backward, and made a Fe against Equity, that it could not enter. Some of you are guilty in a high degree of that cruelty and tyranny which of late years hath been acted upon the Inno∣cent; yea, you have grinded the face of the Poor, imprisoned the Harmless, and laid heavy burdens and oppressive bonds upon the Guiltless, who have not trans∣gressed any Law, much less the Law of Righteousness; you have made my free∣born Children your Slaves, and have highly attempted to sit Lords in my Thr of Conscience, and some of them have deeply suffered by some of you, for the exercise of their pure Consciences, because they could not Swear, or worship and respect your Persons, nor pay Tythes (that grievous Oppression) nor bow to your wills and lusts in things of the like nature of Cruelty: And you are guilty in a gross sum, of upholding the false Prophet, which prophesieth Lyes, and falsly, with flattering words of guile, and he covers himself under your sha∣dow, and under your unjust Law, which is his staff and strength, and he ri upon the Beast, till you be both taken alive, and cast into the Lake of everlast∣ing Indignation. The Cup of my Vengeance will awaken you, and my Law  for ever condemn you, and my Counsel of Equity shall plead against you in the Court of Justice; and my eternal Judgment from my Throne of Righteous∣ness shall proceed in sentence of wrath, and my faithful Evidence, the Light in your Consciences, which hath been Eye-witness of your villany against me, shall testifie against you, and shall accuse you guilty of everlasting Torment, except you repent.
To all Astrologers, Magitians, Southsayers, and Wise men. THus saith the Lord, my Controversie is against you, because of your Witch∣crafts, and Inchantments; you have digged deep as the pit of Hell, to hide your counsel from the Lord, and have discovered your selves, in finding out se∣crets to another, then me, in your natural Arts and knowledge you are cor∣rupted, the ground being cursed in which you stand. You have in Policy and Witch∣craft sold your selves into the power of Darkness, and your Original of Science and Languages is the Serpent, whose Image and mark you bear; your Wisdom is devillish, gained by the strength of corrupted reason, which is the Habitation of the Serpent, whom you have chosen to be your Instructor, and exalted for your God: There is a Secret sealed from you, and a Star whose course you do not know, and a Sun eclipsed of which you make no mention, and a Circuit of Heaven of which you know not the compass; and you cannot find out the secret by Divination, but the discovery of it will be the discovering of your Sorceries, and the making bare of your Inchantments; your knowledge is in time, and leads not into the understanding of things everlasting, which are without beginning: My flaming Sword is against you, and doth divide you from the Tree of eternal Life, of which you cannot touch and live: My Wrath shall sweep you out of the Land of Peace, and my Eye, which seeth you, shall be the Star of Condem∣nation, and Darkness unto you, to the confounding of your Sun and Moon for ever. To all you Generals, Colonels, Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers, in England, Scotland, and Ireland. THus saith the Lord, My Controversie is against you, for some of you are wofully fallen from that Uprightness and Integrity which once was in you, and you are aboundantly waxed fat, and exalted through Victories and Deliverances; now you kick against the Lord, that hath handled you as In∣struments in his Hand to do his Will; and many of you who have been raised out of the dust, and are set down in your high nest of liberty, in the lust, and pride, and filthiness of the flesh, and vain glory, and fleshly exaltations abound, and with greediness you divide the spoil; and some of you take more by your cruelty, and hard-heartedness, then justly was given you in victory; and now you being at ease, have forgotten many former straits and dangers delivered from; and in your hearts you say, Our hand have gotten the Victory, and do not ex∣alt the Lord herein, who sometime eminently hath appeared for you, your Ene∣mies themselves being Judges; and now you tread under foot, by your might and beastly power, many of my innocent and harmless People, some of which have served you in many tryals, and now they being redeemed from that nature of strife, you hate them, and do and suffer violence to be done unto them, and regard it ot, and set it at naught; and though you have said, you have laboured for liberty of Conscience in your long travel of War, yet in the birth you have turned your Victory into carnal and fleshly liberty to your selves, and into bon∣dage to your brethren; and many Promises have you vowed, which you neglect to perform; and the same Oppression and power of Cruelty stands in dominion under another Appearance and Member of the great Image, the Head being but one; and you have only slain the Name, and live in the Nature, and while
some of you have been zealous to break down the Idols and Images without, and herein have served the Lord; you are now become Worshippers of Idols within, and of Images set up in your hearts, to the greater dishonour of the Lord, who are turned into spiritual Idolatry, and more subtil Hypocrisie, and secret whore∣dom, and herein also live in the nature of that which you cut down in the name; and the Founder of Images is not yet confounded, and you are not the least of all that are guilty (for it is not unknown to you) of that grievous Oppression, and Tyranny, and Cruelty acted upon my servants, who in times past have born a part of the burden with you in the heat of the day; and though some of you see these iniquities abounding, and the neglect of fulfilling your own vows, and are already ashamed of the Oaks which you have designed, and of the Gardens which you have chosen, and now are accused guilty in your own Consciences, for pulling down and setting up, one thing in the nature, though different in the name, yet you are greedy of your Prey and Spoil, and do not confess Truth against Op∣pression, being Branches of the same Root, lodging amongst the Boughs; and thus are you fallen from your first integrity, into pits and snares, and become one with the Harlot, and Partakers of the Adulterer, murdering and crucifying the just, loving to be blinded by the God of the World, for love to his Treasure: Mine Arm terribly shall come against you, and my Force shall compass you about, and my Sword shall cut you off, and with a mortal Blow I will wound you, and deliverance to my Chosen will I bring another way; and though I have reproved Princes by you, yet you will I reprove; and though I have chastened the Mighty and the Rebellious by you, yet you will I correct, and all your might and power will I take away, and your weakness shall appear, and dispersed shall you be before the Arrows of my Wrath; my Alarum will I beat against you, in defiance of your power, and through you, by my Weapon of War will I charge to your overthrow and defeat everlasting, except you repent, saith the Lord, in this day of your Visitation, wherein you have a time given to make your peace, and to return to your first integrity, out of your rebellion against me, that my hand may be towards you; for my great work is yet to do, which I have thought to bring to pass, and this overturning was but a making way for it; and yet again will I overturn, even you, and all that oppose me here∣in; that my Son may reign in his Kingdom for ever, whose Bond-men and Slaves ye shall be, if you submit not, before you be conquered. And this to you is a Message for Reconciliation, sent from me, and sealed with my Spirit, saith the Lord. To all the Priests, and Prophets, and Teachers of the People. THus saith the Lord, my Controversie is against you, above all other, and my Judgments shall be upon you to the uttermost; for you in hypocrisie, and deceit, and abominations hath exceeded all other that ever went before you, and are less excusable then they, and more vile in my sight then they that have been made an utter desolation; abominable, and loathsom, and haious is your filthiness in preaching for hire, and for gifts and rewards, and in ma∣king a prey upon the People, through divining for money, even feeding your selves with the fat, and killing them that are fed, and have wofully wasted the heritage, and scattered the flock upon the barren mountains, where yo treacherous∣ly have devoured them, and made merchandise of their Souls, and have cried, Peace, peace unto the wicked, one of you building a Wall, and another daubing it with untempered Morter, you have not stood in my Counsel, but have erred from my Way, and have not known my Judgments, but through covetousness
have dealt most wickedly, and profaness is gone forth from you into all corners of the Earth, so that none could turn from his evil way, nor learn the Way of Righteousness and Salvation; How shall it be declared and laid open? Your transgressions have much more abounded then in former Generations; ye have shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men, to the destruction of Thousands and ten Thousands, who have perished under your Ministry, whom you have cau∣sed to err, and led them out of the Way; and the blind Hypocrites have led the Blind, till ye both fell into the ditch of perdition. It was your Generation of the same seed that put the Apostles to death, and now you make merchandize of their words, and exceed in hypocisie and double-heartedness; and have turned everyway according to the changing of the power of the Beast: Some of you were Teachers for the King, and Bishops, and were ordained by their Law, and your prayers have been to your Idol-god, for all sorts from whom you could receive a Reward or be advantaged; and you are now divided in many Sects, and Judgments, and false Opinions, and have divided the People into divers ways of Idol-worship, throwing down one part of the Image, and setting up, & ex∣alting another; and your Offerings, and Oblations, and Prayers, and Praises hath been a burthen and weariness to my Soul, saith the Lord; and you now are at war in your minds one with another, divers in your Language (though but one Original) which is the womb of Witchcraft, and your Kingdom is Darkness, and a heap of Confusion, under the dominion of Death reigning; but you are at concord in War against me, and against my Servants, whom I have chosen from among you, to bear witness against you, and you are the most of all guil∣ty of that great Persecution, and unjust Suffering, and Imprisonment, through Tyranny laid upon them; for you stir up, and interceed the power of the Beast thereunto, upon which you sit, till you both be cast into the Lake: You are risen in all your power to manage War against my Kingdom, which is appearing to make yours a Desolation for ever: The Beast is risen in defence of you al∣ready; and you pray to your dead gods, and preach to your ignorant People, against my Heritage; deceiving Thousands, whose blood of you will be re∣quired, who are ever learning of you, but never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth by you, being kept in infidelity and blindness under you, whose blood you are absolutly guilty of; your rebellion is the crime of Witchcraft, who cannot cease to do evil, for you have bound your selves in the Covenant with Hell, and are at Agreement with Death while you are upon Earth, and would bind the People with you in the same Faith (or rather Unbelief) that none can be perfectly saved from sin while they live upon Earth: But you are the filthy Dreamers, who do defile the flesh, and when you awake you will be found empty of all Righteousness; your Cup is full of Fornication, and of the Wine of Whoredom and Idolatry; my patience will be turned into fury against you, and my Cup of Indignation is the assured Portion of your ot; and blood shall you have to drink, as your Gift and Reward from me; and your present pleasure shall be turned into howling everlasting; and your songs shall be changed into Wo was the day: My Plagues shall remain with you upon Earth, and follow you to the Lake, and your staff and strength in which you trust, even the power of the Beast shall be broken with you, and be buried in the Grave of everlasting contempt, to rise in reproach unto my Heritage for ever; and my Fire of Indignation is already kindling upon you, which will burn forevermore, and not be quenched.
To all you called Papists, to your whole Body and Head at Rome, the Word of the Lord reacheth. THus, assuredly, saith the Lord, My Controversie is against you, and my Ven∣geance, and Wrath, and Fury shall for ever, World without end, be upon you, though you pardon one another, yet will I not pardon any one of you, for your grievous Adulteries and Abominations have surpassed all other Genera∣tions; in the womb of Whoredoms your Children are conceived, begotten by the seed of Adulteries, in the very strength of the man of sin, and at the Breasts of murther and cruelty, you are nourished in sucking hainous and cruel Tyranny▪ you are seated upon the highest Mountain of Oppression and Idolatry. Peter was not your Predecessor, but the Devil himself you succeed, in blood, and envy, and cruelty; and he is your rock, with whom you shall fall in everlasting perditi∣on, being upon him builded, in your whole body; and he is the Father of your faith, received from him by succession, traditionally: And your Religion is of Cain's antiquity, who was the Antient in your Profession of offering Sacrifice, and killing the Just; your Sword hath been made fat in the blood of the Inno∣cent; you have sought to slay even the very likeness of Righteousness, and have stood armed with cruelty against the Upright, waiting for the blood of the Guilt∣less to asswage your thirst: And your seat at Rome, which once had the Faith of Jesus Christ in purity, where Members of his Body inhabited, you have turned into the habitation of Devils, and it is become the open Mother of profest Whoredoms, which brings forth cursed Children of Witchcraft, and is the abiding place of members of an abominable Harlot, and the Profession of Jesus have you turned into cruelty against Jesus, and into the murther of him. Some of you are made a curse already, and with Vengeance and Indignation shall the rest be pursued, till your Body be rooted from off the Earth; you have been strong in your Seat of Darkness, upon your seven Mountains of perfect abomination, and none were able to encounter you in your strength of Infidelity, but it shall be turned into weakness, and your whoredoms shall appear, and your present honour shall be turned into contempt everlasting; for whilst you say, You have wrought to me∣rit Life eternal, your unbelief will bring death everlasting, and your Works me∣rit my Fire of eternal Judgment and Condemnation; and while you have said, You eat and drink the Flesh and Blood really, you have crucified his Life total∣ly, and your consecrating of things unto your Idol-god, hath been your de∣filement and pollution in the sight of the true God; to Images and Pictures have you bowed, and have worshipped the Saints Dayes and Names, and bowed to their likeness of mans inventions, but have slain their life, and trodden under foot their nature and glory, and buried their righteousness and knowledge in the grave of your wickedness and ignorance; and in imaginations have you rested, and in vain superstitions have you hoped, honouring the Name of Christ, and killing his Life; the Womb of Darkness are you shut up in upon Earth, and it will be your bed for ever in Hell and Death; and your Purgatory will deceive you, and your cleansing will never come: Defiled, defiled and loathsome are you in the pure Eye of Light, which the secret of your deceit searcheth, and your darkness feeleth, and shall judge you for ever. Rome, Italy, France, and Spain, and your Dominions, to all your Kings, Princes, Bishops, Priests, Jesuits, Pre∣lates, and Friers, and Nuns, and whole train of Idolators, The Cup of my Vengeance is towards you, and the Dreggs thereof you shall drink; and my overflowing Whirlwind of Wrath, as an inresistable Flood is against your Banks, and my Fire of eternal Fury shall burn through your Stubble; and my everlast∣ing Light shall make search and inquisition for the blood of my Elect, which is found in thy skirts. Thou abominable Harlot of loathsome adultery, Tremble,
tremble, at my dreadfull living presence, ye Worshippers of dead Images; the day of repentance is well nigh past, your long Idolatry will my long pati∣ence turn into everlasting Misery and Judgment; and Nations shall see your shame, and in the sight of your Lovers shall you be tormented. And this from Authority by my Spirit of Glory is sent you a Warning, and is the voice of a Trumpet, which gives a certain sound against the mighty dreadfull Day of the Lord, which upon you is coming, to make you a Desolation for ever and ever; and the Eternal Decree is sealing against you, never to be altered. To all you called Protestants of the Eldest sort. THus saith the Lord, my controversie is against you, and my hand will be upon you; you have a strong taste of the Bottle, wherein the Wine of Fornication is, and your scent is leavened with the first vessel of abomination, you are seated in darkness, pitched upon six of the first Mountains, under another Branch of the first Tree (Ignorance) and are thildren of the first womb, begotten in another appearance of the Whores Beauty, and are more comly in stature then your eldest Brethren, and little is your difference to be discerned from the first Beast in your appearance, and nothing at all in the ground; you say you believe for Eternal Life, but your unbe∣lief will bring upon you everlasting death: your talking of Christ, and his righte∣ousness imputed (which you profess) will not cover your infidelity and filthiness, for you are in the enmity against his Life; the working (of the first) for life, and your believing for life, springs both out of one ground; and while you say you eat and drink the Body and Blood of Christ in the figure, you kill and cruifie him in the Substance, and art partakers of thy Sisters sins, in Whoredom and Idolatry, and must partake of her plagues. Wo, wo, will be your Inheritance in the Pit of Earth for ever, instead of a heavenly glory (which you dream o) above the Sky; I have armed my Armies to do my work herein, which hath in part, and will ful∣fil it, to break you to pieces, the intents of your heart have been known to be al∣ways against my people, neither could you bear any appearance o me, but blas∣phemes my Name and Truth in every discovery; you have loved darkness upon Earth; and in its Chains shall you be bound in the Lake for evermore. To all you that are called Presbyterians and Inde∣pendents. THe Lords controversie is against you, for you are a higher branch of the first tree, deeper rooted in the cursed ground of fleshly and sensual wisdom, and the Womb of your conception is the first Whores daughter, more comely decked, and your Cistern holds the Wine of Fornication, at which you drink in a measure her abomi∣nation, and where you say, you believe for Justification, and applies the Promises for Savation; your works of Wickedness and Hypocrisie will bring Damnation, and gains the promise of Condemnation, who are in pride, and high-mindedness, and double-heartedness, which is the condition of that promise, and you are found wanting every whit, the conditions of the Promise of Eternal Lie; you have reformed the outward man into the obedience unto another likeness of the Truth, without the Life, and are as vile in the inward in hypocrisie, and self-exalting, and hath covered your selves with the Saints words, and laid up more in store of the report of their riches, then your fore-fathers, and now you are become Wor∣shippers of the form and words of the Saints, and are grown in the knowledge, more then some of your Fathers Children; but in extolling the Saints words, you
limit their Spirit, and keeps in Death their Life, which was not of the World, neither in appearance nor ground; and while you say you eat and drink the Flesh and Blood of Christ in secret, and separate, you put him to death openly, and among the multitudes, your hearts are full of bitterness against my Remnant, whom I have called; and aloud you cry Heresie, and Error, and Blasphemes my Name, and loaths the Honey-comb in your full stomachs; you worship the same God, as your fore-fathers did, only in another appearance, more refined through stronger wisdom, and appears in the reformed old man, thinking him to be the new man, and deceives your Souls hereby, and are zealous in your blind∣ness, in your will-worships, and feigned humility, which is without the know∣ledge of God; and you depend upon your imaginations, thinking to have life in the Scripture, as they did which put Christ to death, and will not come to Christ that you may have lie; you are in the knowledge gathered from without you, which is natural, and in it you are corrupted; and some of you are bruit∣ish in your knowledge, and are thereby pufft up into pride and vain-glory; your separation from the World is sensual, and self-separation, and differs but a little in your appearance, and nothing in the ground; for the cursed ground stands within untilled and unbroken, and you worship God ignorantly, at a distance, and feeds upon the report of a thing done many hundred of years ago, and your Faith doth not give you victory over the World, for it is set in your hearts, and the vanities of it without is followed, pride, and oppression, and ful∣ness: Some of you are hot and furious in your blind zeal, and cannot endure sound Doctrine; your fruits will wither, and all your knowledge will perish, and all your hopes and expectations will fail, and all your praises and prayers, and all your good works brought forth in your own wills, in that nature in which the enmity lodges, is a lame and a blind Sacrifice, and of Cain's nature, which God accepteth not; you are in the liberty of the flesh, and the daily Cross of Christ you do not know, but lives daily to the World, and dies not to it, and your knowledge of Christ is without you; by what such a Prophet, and such an Apostle spoke of him; and the witness of the operation of his Spirit and Power you have not in you, nor his sufferings you do not know in your life, but by your life make him to suffer in you, in his Life; the horrible filthy thing is commited amongst you, and your Teachers are perfect in the false Prophets steps, and (some of you are as bruit Beasts in their knowledge, gathered in by vain study and hu∣mane learning, through Phylosophy and vain deceit,) and have large Quarters from which they seek their Gain, and through Coveteousness with feigned words make merchandise of souls, and are compleat in Balaams way of Idolatry, fol∣lowing his Error, loving the Wages of unrighteousness, teaching for filthy Lucre, devouring souls for dishonest Gain, by trading with the Scriptures, and selling their Imaginations upon them for money, gaining many thousand of pounds a year thereby, having stolen the Saints words into their unclean hearts, uttered forth by them for advantage to themselves, when the Lord hath not sent them, nor spoken unto them, nor ordained them for his service; but their Call and Or∣dination have been by man, and their work and testimony of themselves, and have not profited you at all, and yet you have loved to have it so; but what will you do in the end thereof? Even you that have been helped, and they that have holpen shall both fall together in the Day of the Lord's Recompence, which will fall grievously upon you, and none shall be able to deliver you, but miserable Comforters, and Physitians of no value shall all be unto you, and your long applyed Promises shall suddenly fly away: No Peace from God is to the Wick∣ed, neither do I sow Pillows under your Elbows, but to the Light in your Con∣sciences (I commend these things) which Christ hath enlightened every of you withal; which shines in Darkness, and you cannot it comprehend, nor in it be∣lieve, but at it stumbles, and by it shall be broken; which if it you loved, it would teach you in the Spirit the Living God to worship, and would condemn all your set forms of worship in the imaginations; the Light is given you of Christ Jesus, unto Life Eternal, or unto condemnation everlasting; when the
Hand of the Lord is upon you, remember you had Warning; and when you are in the Lake, and in the Pit, remember you had a day of Visitation upon Earth: The Light in all your Consciences shall witness Gods Judgments to be just, and your mouths shall be stopped. To all you that are called Anabaptists. WIth you also is the Controversie of the Lord, for you are Children of the same seed, more purged in the Fire of blind Zeal, and begotten in the transforming of the Serpent, into more secret hypocrisie, and deeper subtilty; your covering being larger, the greater deceit and abomination lodges under; Death reigns among you, and your Kingdom is scituate in the Mountains of ex∣altation, and you feed aboundantly in the Valleys of pride and vain glory, and are nourished with the bread of prosperity; you are grown high, and great in your number, and have joyned your selves for advantage, and glory in your strength, having through Policy and Craft, and bowing to the beastly power, highly exalted your own Horn, and by Flattery have gained much of your do∣minion, which you hold in possession by the Law of guile; many simple Ones have by your curious colour, and bed of fair pretences been deceived to commit Adultry with your Image, brought forth in the likeness of the Saints God; by imaginations from the Saints words you worship the Practice and exercise of the Saints, with the same mind that the Papists do worship their Names and dayes: You allow not Idols without, nor a vain conversation in the World, but you are strict in observation in your outward conformity, in your self-righteousness, which is your greatest sin; you are cloathed with the Saints words and practices, which you have climed up in your own wills to obtain, not having entred in by the Door; and while you say, you eat and drink the Flesh and Blood of Christ in the Saints manner, shewing forth his Death till he come to Salvation; you kill him as the Heathens do, till he appear unto Condemnation; and you shew forth dai∣ly that you crucie him in the World, eating and drinking to your selves condem∣nation: you say Christ dyed only for you as Elect but your works make manifest that he dies by you as Reprobate: You take up a command from the Letter, and imi∣tate the Apostles (some of you in a lower, and some of you in a higher degree) in that mind and nature which in the Apostles was crucified; and you say Christ commands it, when the Letter doth but declare it, and you are not led with the same Light which gave forth the Commands declared to observe them, but say, in such a Verse of such a Chapter, such a Command is, not having received the Com∣mand by the same Spirit. Here you are proved to be them which use your tongues, and say, he saith it, when God hath not spoken unto you, but as you read it without you, as the false Prophets may do the words of the true Prophets; and thus you are in the Witchcraft, as they were, Gal. 3. who take on things in your own wills, and observe Commands without from the Letter, thereby drawing from the Teachings of God within by the Spirit; you are zealous as they were, for the Traditions and Figures, and cannot see him, which is the end of all that which perisheth with the using, so you are not dead with Christ from the World, who are yet subject to Ordinances which are of the World: They that obeyed Christ, and followed him, were led by the Spirit, and not by the Letter; for they were not Ministers of the Letter, but of the Spirit, and such were judged to be in error; and this is your condition, who say, such are Breakers of Christ's Commands, and Makers void of the Scripture, and Destroyers of the Ordinan∣ces, who witness Christ the Substance, and him to be King, and Judg, and Law∣giver, and in whom, and upon whom the Scripture is fulfilled, and so it establish∣ed, and the Commands of Christ kept, which are in Spirit, and his Law daily walked in, which condemneth sin. And this is not contrary to the Scripture, but
a fulfilling of it in Principles, in Doctrines, and in Practise, and in Conver∣sation: The Apostles were sent to preach the Gospel to every Creature, and they were all led by the same Spirit, and did not go before it in their own wills, as you do, neither did one go from the Command which had been given to another, using anothers words, and excercising themselves in anothers practises, when the Lord had not commanded; but such they bare witness against, which did use their tongue, and transform themselves into the likness of true Prophets, and A∣postles, as you have done, and are in the love of the World, and only separated in the appearance, and not in the ground. You stumble at the ight, and there∣fore know not the Door of entrance, nor where the Commands of Christ are to be received, and the Will of God to you is to be known; and so your obedience is the conformity in your own wills, to that which was the Will of God to ano∣ther; this Sacrifice is also lame and blind, and God saith to you, Who hath re∣quired this at your hand? For if you have observed and done all those things, which the Declaration of the Law and Gospel doth require, you are unprofitable Servants, and yet one thing do you lack, the dying with Christ, and the Suffe∣rings and Cross of Christ is not known; but in the liberty of the flesh you are, and not in the condition of the Promise to Life Eternal. Friends, you have ru into the form of Godliness, without the Power; into a Church which is not in God, but of the World; into a Baptism which doth not wash away sin; for you live in sin, and plead for it, while you live upon Earth; into a Communion which is not with God, which no unclean thing can enter into, for the Proud and Co∣veteous partake with you; and while some of you have said, they that preached for Hire have been Antichristian, you your selves are fallen into the same abomi∣nation, taking Gifts and Rewards, and large somes of Money, and upholding such who do it; Here you are unjust to your own Principle, and are for condem∣nation with the Light in your Consciences. Let shame cover your heads, ye Hy∣pocrites; your covering will not hide you, nor your high talking of Christ with∣out you, so long professed by you, will not justifie you, while you are found diso∣beying this Light in your Consciences, which Light is one with God, with Christ, and with the Spirit in its measure; and it doth convince you of sin, and is a command to you, and would lead you (if you walked in it) from all iniquity, which is the Will of God to you; and to that mind which is carnal, which rul∣eth in you, the Commands of Christ which are Spiritual, are not given, nor can be received; but say, Lo here, and Lo there Christ is to be found; with the Light you are comprehended, which if the least measure of it you did own, it would lead you to the Baptism inward of the heart, and to the Church which i in God, whereof Christ is the Head in every Member, and into the Communion with God, and to follow the Lamb of God wheresoever he goeth; and out of your imitations, and liknesses, and strife, and contention about the words given forth from the Spirit; who are in your own unity, in Division, and several Mean∣ings, and divers Constructions, and Judgments, and several wayes of Obedience and Worships, and Belief, which by your imaginations you draw from the Scrip∣ture, which is the Declaration but of the one God, and one Truth, of one O∣bedience, and of one Faith; and thus you exalt the great Image of many mix∣tures, your selves being a chief Member of his body: You say the Scripture is your Rule, but are divided into Opinions and Conceits contrary to the Scripture, every one worshipping that which you imagine from the Scripture, not being in the Unity of the Spirit, which gave forth the Scripture, which is one, and not divided in Obedience, Worship, or Faith; and while you say the Scripture is your Rule, your lives are squared by the spirit of the Divel, and hewn out into Pride and Hypocrisie, and love of the World.
And to you who are called Free-willers, who say Christ died for All. HErein you affirm that whereof you are ignorant, which may be true in Christ, but a Lye unto you; for you are not dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the World, but are alive against him in the World; they for whom he died, are dead; and they who yet live put him to death. Free-will unto the wayes and fashions, and vanities of the World stands in you, & you know not the daily Cross of Christ, which is unto man's will; nor what it is to follow Christ, and obey him, which is contrary to man's will. You say, He that is condemned, it is because he will not believe; this is true in Christ but not in your carnal apprehensions of the natural man, in whom there is no power to believe. He that hath an ear, let him hear. There are some true desires among you, but your minds are not truly informed, to the fulfilling of your desires; and your minds are outward, and apply peace to that which is for condemnation. Your reason and wisdom is cor∣rupted, and cannot receive Truth, but call it error, and this is your sin. Death over you hath passed, and reigns over you, as over all men, and your knowledge is in time, and you cannot hear of things which were before the World was; your wisdom is sensual, and your comprehension is strong, and the little simplicity in you is betrayed, by the subtilty which hath dominion in your Governour; Your Crown must be laid down; and Fools must you become, before you be truly wise, or can be crowned with the Lamb. And among the rest, Remember you had war∣ning, and a Day of visitation before you were destroyed; and this shall be by you witnessed in the day of the Lord. To all you who say you wait, and believe, for the Com∣ing of Christ to Reign in Person upon Earth. HEre you the Lord's Controversie which he hath against you. The Way of his coming is not prepared, but Rocks and Mountains are standing, and Valleys are not filled up, and rough and crooked is your present way; your hopes and expectations in that ground wherein they spring will wither and fade away as the Grass; for your hope of his comming hath no whit purified you, as he is pure; for you are in the flesh, and in the liberty of it, which is Rebellion to his Reign; and Christ is kept in Prison, in exile with that mind, and the Di∣vel is yet at liberty working in your earthly members, and leads you captive in∣to his covenant in his government, in seeking your selves, and to strengthen your selves in the Kingdom of the World; and murmur that any should be above you, and that is he, which put Christ to death, and will not have him to reign in his Power over the Earth; and to you, what purpose is it to desire the day of his coming? for with wrath will he come, and with vengeance will e appear, and will break your Kingdom like a Potters vessel, for suddenly will he come, but your ex∣pectation will be prevented, for his Reign and Kingdom is not of this World. Your high nature stands, and Satan is not bound, nor one of the dayes of the thousand years; for his limit is not yet come; your minds are outward, and they are your own thoughts, which are vain, & you know not of what Spirit you are: The Sufferings of Christ must you know, before you can see him Reign; and through his War must you strive before you can obtain his Victory; and him must you own, in his convincing you of sin, before you can witness his reign in Glory upon Earth over sin.
To all you that are called Ranters. THe Controversie of the Lord God is against you, your Seat is in the mystery of iniquity, and Satan transformed into an Angel of Light is your god, and King, and the Kingdom of the second Beast is your Dominion, your dead∣ly Wound is falsly healed, and Satan thereby hath enlarged his Government; you continued not to the end, but the Prince of Darkness is more strongly en∣tred, and your latter end is worse then your beginning, and your last end will be the worst of all; while you have scorned self-righteousness, your selves have been impudently poluted with the spiritual Wine of Whoredom; and though you have cryed against, and abhorred the form of Religion, your selves have been in the highest power of Iniquity, sold to do wickedly, and given up to com∣mit sin with greediness, glorying in your shame, and are become vain in your I∣maginations; your foolish hearts being darkened, because when ye knew God, you glorified him not as God: The womb of your corruption is the wel-favour∣ed Harlot, begotten by the false Prophet; Plead with your Mother, for she is an Adultress, and hath aboundantly gone after other Lovers, loving their Bed of Adultry, where ever she saw it; naked shall she be stripped, and set as in the day that she was born, and no Mercy shall be to you her Children: You had a Con∣vincement under the Law, and were brought under condemnation some of you, but as the viperous Generation, you have fled the wrath, and now are become Enemies to the Cross of Christ, and turn the Grace of God into wantonness (which largly to you appeared) which would wholly have sanctified you, if i it you had walked; but having slain the Witness of God, you now are in the curs∣ed peace, following Drunkenness, and cursed Speaking, and Swearing, and beast∣ly Lusts, and beggerly Vanities, sporting your selves as in the day time; and you are the Crucifiers of Christ afresh, and Putters of him to open shame in the sight of the Heathen: And while you speak swelling words of vanity, your selves are the Servants of corruption, and of sin in the highest degree, and free from Righteousness in the least measure, doing despite unto the Spirit of Grace, and being bound in the Chains of darkness; and your professed freedom is devilish, stolen by you, and is not the Freedom of the Son of God, purchased through death; you never came through the Law, but by your Oaths, and Drunkenness, and Prophaness, have cast it behind your backs; you that are in wantonness do kill the Just, and you that are in pleasures are dead while you live, and you that live in fleshly lusts, are in War against your own souls: Iezabel is your Prophe∣tess; and the Dog that is turned to th Vomit again, is your example; and se∣ven unclean spirits worse then the first, are entred upon you, that is your Para∣ble, and your House is become the Den of Robbers, which was once the House of prayer; the Hand of the Lord is against you, and his Breath will kin∣dle the torment of Tophet upon you, and everlastingly shall it burn upon you, and shall not be quenched; and your professed love shall be turned into my Wrath and Fury, and sin shall you find in its Vengeance, though you have seen none in the action; and my Witness which you have slain, to gain peace, shall arise to your everlasting trouble, saith the Lord; and your myrth shall be turned into everlasting sorrow, and your communion in unrighteousness shall become your unity in the just indignation of wrath; and your liberty enjoyed in the World shall be turned into your bondage, in the ake of Fire; and your wisdom and knowledge shall rot in the pit. and your righteousness and uprightness which once was in you, shall never be mentioned to you, for your own iniquities shall you bear in the Day of the Lord: With the eternal Light you are comprehended; your beginning which was in judgment, and your time which is in false peace, and false liberty, and love, and fleshly joy, and your end, which will be everlastingly miserable: And though you speak of the Light, and what it once wrought, yet
being from it, turned into Darkness, bringing forth fruits of Darkness and unrighteousness, the Light is your eternal condemnation; and because you are the highest stone in the Building of mystery iniquity, the greater will be your fall into the Ditch of deeper perdition: you have been the greatest dishonourers of the true God, and in the way of the upright are you a stumbling unto this day: your state is read, and your portion is foretold, and this prophesie shall not fail, but upon your heads shall be fulfilled. To all you that are called Seekers and Waiters. THe Lord hath many things against you, and his Controversie will be with you; you are the highest in the Image of many mixtures, and your Tent is pitched in the Plains of feigned humility, and your goodly building stand; upon the Sand, re∣paired and beautified by the scattered stones, gathered out of the ruins of the for∣mer Cities of confusion; among you there is a simplicity, and a calm spirit, for you have been poured from vessel to vessel, and your scent is not so strong as the former, neither is your growth so perfect in the mystery of iniquity, as by appear∣ing in so perfect a shape of the Serpent; you seek not at the true Door, nor wait not at the Gates of Life, and your seeking will end before life eternal you find; for you with the rest, stumbles at the Foundation; and in him who is the Light of the World, and enlighteneth every man that cometh into the World, you cannot be∣lieve; you are airy in your words and knowledge, and speak of that which through death you never obtained; your knowledge is high, but it ariseth out of the cursed ground, which is not removed in you; Form; outward you deny, but your Form is inward, and your chiefest Idol is in your heart; and while you say you eat and drink the Flesh and Blood of Christ, in the Substance you slay him in his least measure, and your wills prophesie a false peace, which will be turned in∣to true trouble; and when you speak, the mans head is covered, and the womans head is uncovered, and this is a shame, that the woman hath not power on her head: your Seeking and Waiting is of your selves, and in your own time, and the Lord is not all, and in all among you, for your Mother is not the Lords wife, but mar∣ried unto a Harlot, and your seed is mixed with strange Children: A Prophet was your Father, and a Whore brought you forth, and your Profession will wither as time passeth away, and your covering is too narrow, and your righteousness no more regarded then your sin; for the Spirit convinceth of it, as of sin; with the Light everlasting your height and depth is comprehended: And this to you is a Warning, for a Preparation to meet the Lord, and to put away your other Lovers. The Beast which all the World wonders after (but they whose names are written in the Lambs Book of Life) hath many Heads, and many Horns. ANd the great Image set up in the Earth worshipped by Nations and People, is of many mixtures, and it shall fall before the little Stone, which strikes at the Bottom; All your several Forms, and divers appearances outward, and diffe∣rent Judgements and Opinions, will stand you in no stead in the dreadful day of the Lord which upon all flesh is coming, and hastning in its glory. Wo, wo will be the end of all profession, when Christ comes in his own way, contrary to all your divi∣ded expectations, and groundless hopes, He was before the world was, and doth
and shall reign for ever, when it is not: and in this his day will the Lord God set up an everlasting Kingdom, of whose Government and Dominion there shall be no end, but it shall abide for ever, and your divided Kingdom of the Beastly power and authority shall be dashed to pieces, never more to be found; and your Mountains shall be burned, and your righteousness and your sin shall meet in the Pit of everlasting Wrath, receiving the Sentence of eternal Judgment, from him that sits upon the Throne of infinite Power and Glory; and your rich Treasures shall be spoiled in a Day; and your sun and light shall be dark∣ned at Noon-day, and all your goodly Buildings shall be thrown down, and shall become the Habitation of Dragons: I have viewed you all in the eternal Light, and you are weighted in the Ballance of Equity, and all your wise Buil∣ders stumble at the Foundation, and at the Corner-Stone; and Christ Jesus is become an offence unto you in his Light, by which he hath enlightened every man that comes into the World, of which you are unbelieving, and therefore shut up in darkness and confusion, groping as blind men, being many Branches of one Root, planted in the barren cursed ground of enmity: And though you are divided as Herod and Pilate, yet do you joyn your selves in one Body, to war a∣gainst the Lamb and his Followers, who cannot bow to your great Image; and you are listed in the Records of Gog and Magog, against whom the Lamb is risen, and his Followers come forth, having the Bow and Sword, conquering and go∣ing to conquer, and will make you a Desolation for ever: All your Sacrifice is corrupted, and the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is weary with your Oblati∣ons and Offerings; your hearts are far from him, and your hands are full of blood, and the Just lyeth slain in every corner of your Streets; and the Earth covereth the blood of the Innocent, and the Slain cryeth, How long Lord, how long? But he hath heard in an acceptable time, and will come forth in his Might, and will slay, and his Hand shall not spare, and will wound, and his Eye shall not pity. Awake, awake, ye Careless and Slothful, that have laid at ease in the dark night of Slumber; and Come out, come out ye Upright-hearted, and separate your selves, and touch no unclean thing, nor no longer partake of their Idola∣tries and Inchantments: The Lord is now coming to gather his own, and to make up his Jewels of the Despised; and his Angels are gone forth to Reap the Earth, to bring in the Wheat, and to bind the Tares in bundles, for the fire of everlasting Fury; and Babel shall be thrown down, and the great Whore shall be rewarded, which sits upon the Nations, and Tongues, and People; and the Dregs of the Cup of Wrath shall be wrung out unto her, and the Kingdom of the man of sin shall utterly be laid waste, and every Subject shall be utterly dri∣ven away into everlasting captivity of Vengeanee; and all your Sects, and O∣pinions, and many Wayes, and Forms, and Worships shall become heaps of Con∣fusion for ever, And your talking of Christ without you, so long and large∣ly professed by you, shall not save you, nor justifie you in another World, who are found Enemies and Actors against his Light, present in the World, which is but one in you all, at which you all stumble, and by which you shall all be bro∣ken, and which shall grinde you to powder, and be your eternal Condemnati∣on, in this World, and forever; which Light shines in your darkness, and con∣vinceth every one of you of your sin; which Light if it you love, is your Way to Peace with God Eternal, and will lead you into one Truth, to be of one heart and one mind, and to serve one God with one accord, in loving him with all the heart, and your Neighbour as your self, and this is Sacrifice of the living God only ac∣cepted. And to you, all sorts of People, my Conscience do I clear, to the Light in all your Consciences (which is but One) without respect to your Persons, whe∣ther you hear or forbear; And this to you all is a Warning, and A Trumpet soun∣ded out of Sion; your many gods and Idols to forsake, and your Forms without power to turn away from, and all your graven Images set up in your hearts to
cast away: And this is the Word of the Lord to you all, which upon you all shall be fulfilled, and by you witnessed, when the Book of your Conscience is opened, and your eternal judgment rewarded by the just Judge, that sits upon the Throne of true Judgment, judging nations, and People righteously. TO all you who are in the Light of eternal Life, which doth comprehend the World, who are born from above, of the Immortal Word, which doth live for ever, who are not of the World, nor of the many Opinions in Divi∣sions, but of one Heart, Soul, and Spirit, Worshippers of the one living God, with whom there is no change, nor shaddow of turning, who are not known to the World (though by it scornfully called Quakers) even you doth the Lord also remember with everlasting Kindness, and infinite Love, of whose be∣ginning and end there is none, and whose height and depth, measure, and li∣mit cannot be found out; for you hath he chosen above all the Families of the Earth, to place his Name among, and to stablish his everlasting Covenant with, of Righteousness and Peace forever; and Redemption, and Salvation to you is come, Judgment and Mercy in you is met, Righteousness and Peace in you hath embraced each other; In the womb of eternal Love undefiled was your Conception, begotten by the Word of immortal Life, unto the Inheritance in∣corruptable, whereof you are Heirs of the faithful Promise, made free by the Son, through the slaying of the enmity upon his Cross, whereby you are nou∣rished up into Immortallity, to reign over Hell, and Death, and the Grave for evermore: With thoughts of eternal Love are you remembred, and read in the Lambs book of Life, recorded by the eternal Spirit, and of the Lord cannot be forgotten: Your Mother is a Virgin unspotted, and your City is new Ierusa∣lem, come down from Heaven, and glorious, and full of Pleasure is your Dwel∣ling place, there is no need of a candle, for the Lamb is the Light thereof, and the Temple therein: Your God is no Image, nor your Worship no Imginati∣on, nor to the great Image you do not joyn, nor his power hath no domini∣on over you; but the Yea and Amen is your Covenant, and the I am, whom there is none besides, is your God, and he that lives forever is your Rock and sure Defence, and Salvation is appointed your VValls and Bulwarks, Gladness is sown for you, yea, everlasting Mercies shall you reap, and your long mour∣ning shall be turned into everlasting Rejoycing, and your present Heaviness into durable Joy; your VVaters shall be sure, and your Bread shall never fail, your Fulness shall abound, and your Plenty shall be enlarged, never more to hunger nor thirst, but your little Seed shall become a great Nation, and the whole Earth shall be replenished thererewith, and your despised Government shall rule over Kingdoms, and your Laws shall all the Nations of the Earth be∣come subject unto. Ye are no part of the Image of Idolatry, but your begin∣ning is the little Stone cut out without a hand, and it shall fill the Earth, and become a great Mountain, whereupon the Fowls of the Heaven shall be refresh∣ed, eating the flesh of Kings and Captains. You are found faithful in your Tryals, and the glory of the VVorld cannot steal away your Hearts; you can∣not be moved, for your feet are set upon a Rock: Satan you scorn, and the glo∣ry of his Kingdom you utterly disdain, upon his power you tread, and your feet trample under foot his majesty and renown. Your King reigns for ever, and of his Government and Dominion there shall be no end, but the uttermost parts of the Earth shall be given for a Possession to him; his Scepter is Righteous∣ness, and his Law is Equity, and his Statutes are full of Justice and Judgment. And thus saith the Lord of Hosts, your God and King, Because you have been found faithful, and have not loved your lives unto death for his Names sake, and for his Glories sake, but have continually abased your selves, and laid down your Crowns, that you might honour him; therefore you will he honour and exalt, and will establish your Kingdom in peace forever; and all that riseth up in judgment
against you shall be consounded and condemned, and his Hand will be against all your Adversaries, to their overthrow, and dishonour everlastingly. You have loved Righteousness and Judgment upon Earth, and your Path hath been in Equity, and you have born the Affliction and Storm with patience, and have endured with joy the Burden of the Oppressor; you have been tryed to the bot∣tom, and have been found Innocent and without Guile, before the Throne of God, clothed with the Garments of Uprightness; your Light is the Candle of the Lord, and your Life and Glory is the Possession of the Most High. Ba∣bylon is given you for a Prey, and the riches of Aegypt is given you for a Spoil; and you are free-born Children of the Seed Elect, the first Fruits unto God, and unto the Lamb; your Purchase is obtained through death, and your Crown of honour is purchased through suffering; and the glory of Babylon is no whit equal, for thou excellest in Beauty and Vertue, Whereunto shall thy Beauty be compared? O thou fair and comly Virgin! unto whom shall I liken thee? O thou choice and free-born Daughter of Sions King! thy long travel of sorrows in the womb of Anguish hath brought forth Children of a comly stature, thy Babes are truly lovely, upright, and faithful-hearted; thy Young-men are no∣ble, bold and valiant, chosen of thy God, and Victory is with them; thy Vir∣gins are perfect in Beauty, pure, and undefiled, and no spot in their Garments; thy Old men are lively and honourable, and stedfast in the Path of Righteous∣ness, and their gravity shall be truly respected; thy Body is perfect in the Lords Record and Remembrance, and with an eternal Crown of infinite Glory shall the Righteous Judge honour thee, because you have delighted to do his Will, and have kept his Covenant undefiled, which abides with you for ever, sealed and signed unto you by the Spirit of Promise, decreed before the World was. All Nations shall call you blessed, and of your fulness shall they partake: Who is like unto you? A People saved by the Lord, elect, and chosen, and redeemed out of Kindreds, Tongues, and People, and have a name better then of Sons and Daughters. Praise ye the Lord, and Glorifie him for evermore. Young-men and Maidens, Old-men and Children, and all that breath, Praise you the Lord, for thereunto are you called, and for this cause are you brought forth: Clap your hands, and sing for joy of heart, your Redeemer is the holy One, and your Maker is your Husband; I know you, and to you am I known; and I read you within the Vail, and do behold you, the Train of the Most High fil∣ling his Temple: Follow him forever, and let his Name be testified of through∣out the Earth. Make War in Righteousness, and prepare your selves to do his service; Let not your hands be slack, neither be you sloathful in our Lords Design, but wound the Head of your Enemies, and mannage War against Gog and Ma∣gog, throughout all Generations; Ride on and prosper tread down the fen∣ced Cities, and enlarge your dominion, and let the Children of Strangers, of the Seed of Esau, be your Slaves and Bond-men; and fill the Earth with your precious Seed, and sow it in the morning, and in the Evening with-hold not your hand; though you are despised of men, yet the Lord hath made you truly honorable; in his Glory you appear, and his Righteousness is your clothing, which will never wither; and though some of you for a moment suffer Bonds for his Names sake, yet you are free everlasting, and are not ashamed of your Te∣stimony before the Princes and Nobles of the Earth. O Sion! thou art desira∣ble, because of thy Beauty, and thy Dwelling-place is scituate in a very fruitful Hill, and thou feedest in the Valleys of fat Pastures of eternal Pleasures, where nothing that defiles can enter, nor no Devourer treadeth on thy Mountain, nor no Lyons Whelp treadeth in thy Path; it is the Way of the Ransomed of the Lord, who hath blotted out thy Transgressions, never more to remember thy Sins, thou Seed of Iacob. The Lord is your God for ever, while you be his People. Therefore walk before him in Righteousness, and let his own works praise him, and give him of his own, and glorifie him with it eternally. Be low in thy heart and be not exalted because of thy Beauty and Riches, and glory not but only in
the Lord: Be diligent in thy mind, and watch against all thy Enemies, and be not of a careless heart: Eat not of the Vine of Sodom, nor drink not of the Cup of Whoredoms; give not thy strength to Strange women, nor let not thy desirable Beauty be overcome of Harlots, but keep thy self undefiled, and mingle not thy Seed with Strangers; but be fruitful in thy pleasant Land upon thy beautiful Mountain, and bring forth aboundantly unto thy God, who hath turned thy Wilderness into a fruitful Field, and taken away thy reproach of Barrenness; in Conversation upright and blameless do thou daily appear; in Praises, and Honour, and Fear do thou abound, and let thy God be thy Teacher▪ in his Light and Truth for evermore, that thy Enemies may see and be confoun∣ded, and may behold, and be ashamed before thee, unto whom thy Rock of defence is a stumbling Stone of Offence, wherewith the Kingdoms of the Earth shall be dashed to pieces, and broken as a Potters Vessel before thee. Come forth in thy Beauty, and appear in thy Glory to the Nations. Arise, arise, why shouldst thou sit as alone, as in obscurity and darkness undiscovered? Let the Princes of the Earth see thy excellency, and appear before the Nobles in thy Robes of perfect Honour, wherewith thou art decked, and trimed, as a Bride pleasant unto thy Husband: Do thou judge among the Judges, and give thy counsel among the Prudent, and appear in thy Authority before Kings and Princes: All the Dominions of the World are not equal in Treasure and Wis∣dom unto thee, but all the Children of Whoredoms shall see their shame, and be laid naked when thou appearest in thy purity; The Nations long for thee to be partakers of thy vertue, therefore shew thy self, and appear, that the rest of thy Flock which yet remain upon the barren Mountains may come in unto thy Fold, to rest under thy Shepherds Power. O Sion, thou art prepared of thy God, to beat the Mountains to dust; thou art fitted for his Service, to thresh the Hills: Make no tarrying but come away, spread thy self into every corner of the Earth, for the Upright thirst for thee aboundantly; who lie under the oppression in the Land of Darkness, which may be felt, from whence thou art freed into the everlasting Light; And why shouldst thou, O Sion, lie at Rest, while thy own Seed, the Children of thy Womb are op∣pressed, groaning in the captivity, under the Uncircumcised who have driven away thy Remnant, and scattered it from thee? Put on strength, O Arm of the Lord, for thy Heritage hath no other Helper, nor none that pitieth her: And shine forth thou Seed of Iacob, and bring in the Kingdoms of the Gentiles to par∣take with thee of thy everlasting Substance, and lay out thy self to gain in thy ho∣ly Seed out of the power of Aegypts King; O think upon and remember thy own former Bondage, while thou was thy self Captive in a strange Land; and let thy Bowels be filled with compassion towards thy own Mothers Children; and be not straitned in thy help and deliverance; for thy God hath given thee an Instrument with Teeth, to beat the Rocks to powder; he is not wanting unto thee in Power and Wisdom, thou chiefest Son of his Love. Give up, give up to obey his Voice, and love not thy life unto death, till the Seed of thy Inheri∣tance, and the blood of thy Chosen be avenged upon the head of Iezabel, who hath slain thy elect in all Generations, and nourished her self with the blood of thy Innocent. Call upon thy God, and awake him to Vengeance, to smite and to slay thy Adversaries, and to consume their Habitations from off the Earth, who have been too strong for thee, Why shouldst thou not come forth in the power of thy Judgments; to judge the Earth in Righteousness, and to exalt thy name in thy Glory, which all men have despised, and seen no Excellency in? And thou O Sions King hast been as a Stranger, and unknown in the Earth, and thy Trea∣sure hath been wasted amongst the Harlots, and empty to this day hast thou re∣turned, from gathering fruit of thy Vineyard; for sloathful and aboundantly idle have the Labourers been in the Harvest and it is time for thee to arise and work; for thy Law hath been made void, and thy Statutes and Judgments have been neglected, and all the Princes of the Earth contemn thy Laws, and count
the Sons of thy chosen Heritage as Slaves and Bond-men, and decree unrighteous Decrees, and seal them in the pit of their unbelief, upon the Mountains of their rebellion against thee. How long Lord? How long? When wilt thou appear to lay their honour in the dust of confusion? Is it not the fulness of thy Time which thou hast pro∣mised? How long shall the Remnant of Sion sit as a Widow, bemoaning her Children? Thy Host and Chosen wait for commission from thee to do thy Will; that thou who art our God, and our King, our Judge, and our Law-giver, whom our souls have chosen, may forever be exalted in thy Majesty and Throne of Justice and Judgment, and thy Camp wait to see the honour of Kings and Princes over∣thrown by thee, and thy Dominion set to rule over their heads; that all Na∣tions and Kingdoms may become subject unto thee, and the Kingdoms of this World may become the Kingdom of thy Son forever and evermore; and saith my Soul, Come Lord Iesus, come quickly. By one whose name is truly known by the Children of the same Birth, but unknown to the World, though by is called, EDWARD BURROUGH.
A 1656 DESCRIPTION OF THE State and Condition Of all Mankind upon the face of the whole Earth. And a Discovery unto all, shewing what man was in his Creation before Trans∣gression, and what he is in Transgression; how he is become a degenerate Plant, bringing forth cursed fruit, to the grieving of the good Husband-man, who is thereby provoked continually against the Works of his own hands, to destroy that which he hath made, be∣cause it is defiled through mans Transgression. Also the Way of Restoration, of Salvation, Redemption, and of Life Eternal, is here declared unto all the Sons and Daughters of Adam in the whole world, that all may come to the knowledge of the Creator, and to have fellowship with him again, from whom all the Children of men are separated in the state of en∣mity, and are ignorant of him, and drove from his presence. This is to go abroad into all the Earth, through the whole world, as a Call and Vi∣sitation unto all mankind, that they may hear and consider their condition, and may return from whence they are fallen, and may be restored again to serve, and worship, and glorifie the living God, who made Heaven and Earth, and all things therein. THis is chiefly to go abroad into the dark parts of the World, among those called Heathens most especially; but its service reacheth to all men and people upon the face of the Earth: And out of love unto the Creation, and to all People in the World was it written, and is it brought forth in publick, that all that have ears to hear may hear; and it is to be translated into several Languages by any who are moved of the Lord thereunto; for of a truth the Lord is risen among us, and God hath given the Word from his Mouth, and many are they that pub∣lish it abroad through the World. TO all the Sons and Daughters of Adam in the whole World, this is the Word of the Lord God, the Power that made you, and that made Hea∣ven and Earth, and all things therein, your State and Condition con∣sider, How that you are all drove from God your Maker, and from the knowledge of him and of his Wayes, which are Life and Peace, and are in Dark∣ness, Blindness, and Ignorance, separated from that Power that made you, and in the enmity against it, and are Enemies to it in all your wayes and words, where the sorrow, anguish, wo, and trouble is. But the second Adam, the Lord from Heaven, the Power by whom all things were made, who is called Christ Je∣sus, hath lightened every one of you with the true Light, which shines in your hearts in darkness, to give you the understanding of the knowledge of him that made you, and of his Salvation, and Redemption, and of eternal Life, if you love the Light with which you are all lightened. And first, The Light measureth every
mans state in true Judgment, and with it you may all see your selves in the state wherein you now stand, which is a state separated from God; and the state where∣in man was created, which was blessed. Therefore search, and consider your State and Condition in him, that is the Light of the World; of the dust of the Ground were you made, and into man was breathed the Breath of Life; from the living Power which formed all things; and man was made a living Soul, and brought forth into the World in the Image and Likeness of the Power that made him, every one in particular that be come into the World, for Male and Female in the Image of the Creator created he them, without sin or evil: And man was a noble Plant, wholly a right Seed, planted with the choicest Vine, and placed in Paradise, the Garden of the Creator, and there was set to bring forth Fruit, and to glorifie and honour him by whom man, and all Creatures were made; for man was made perfect and upright, set in the Counsel of his Maker, without sin, or spot, or evil in his sight, and was the glory of the Creator, and was made for his glory; and Power and Wisdom was given unto man to rule and govern in Dominion, in Righteousness, and in Wis∣dom over all living Creatures, and was Lord over all things, and had rule and authority over all the Creation, and was Steward over all things which the Creator had made, who made all things for man, and made them subject unto him, to be ordered and governed by him, and used to his Glory by whom they were made; and in that day when man was in the Counsel of him that made him, and was subject to his Will, he was blessed above all Creatures, and unto him were  Creatures blessed, and not any thing was evil that was made, but good in hi Sight that made it, and good unto man that was to use it, he being brought for in the Image of the Creator, and had a measure of his Wisdom, and his Powe to teach him, and to lead him in the exercise of all Creatures, and was in perfe freedom over all things, to rule in the Wisdom of God. And this was the sta of man before transgession, which state was blessed, and not subject to the cu of misery, or sorrow, nor trouble, nor torment; but man disobeyed the Pow∣er that made him, and went from its Counsel, and contrary to its Will, and griev it, and vexed it, till it became his Enemy to fight against him, and to curse him▪ for he had transgressed against it, by feeding on that part which he should not, with the knowledg of things, and so became wise, and lost Uprightness, and touched that which the Power that made him had forbidden, and so his mind and heart adulterated from the Creator, into the visible glories, pleasures, and things which were less then himself, and so he became unprofitable to his Maker, by transgressing against him, and only profitable to himself, to feed, and nou∣rish, and delight and please himself in the outward Creation, and forgot the Power that made him; and thus being with his mind turned into the Earth, there the evil entred; and the Devil overcame him with his temptation, and the power of the earthly darkness gained dominion over him, to sway his affections, desires, and lusts into vanities of the Earth; and he lost his dominion over the Creatures, and they gained dominion over him, to serve and worship them, and to please himself with them, who became captive with his mind, to be ruled by them in vanity and in evil: And thus man became unprofitable to his Maker, and unfruitful in the Garden, and kept it not undefiled; and being turned from the Covenant wherein he was set; into his own willing and desiring in the outward Creation, the evil defiled him, and he became evil, and a fruitless Tree that cumbred the Ground, and an enmity was placed in him by disobedience, and all things became evil to him, and the door of all misery and sorrow was opened, and let in the curse upon him inwardly and outwardly; for he became dead in transgression to the Life and Power, and Wisdom of the Creator, and every moment was subject to die in this World also. And through transgression of the Power that made him, he was cast out of the Creator's Garden, and out of his Love, to labour under the curse, in unprofitable Ground, and also out of his own dignity, and honour, and dominion was he cast, and became Heir of death and Child of wrath, and an Enemy in his mind unto the Creator, and an enmity
was placed in him against the Power that made him, and rebellion in his mind from which all the works of unrighteousness proceed, and innocency was lost, and man became hurtful to himself, and to all Creatures, and grieved continu∣ally the Power that made him, and was drove from the presence and feeling of his Creator, into insensableness: And in this state unto this day are all ye the Sons and Daughters of the first Adam, in the enmity against the Power that made you, every moment transgressing it; and death reigns over you all, and the power of Darkness rules in you all, and the Law of sin, and death, and trans∣gression are you all subject to, and led captive in your minds, affections and de∣sires, at the will of the power that leads into transgression, called the Devil; and in that state you are all strangers to God, and are without him in the World, and ignorant of the knowledge of his Wayes, and are in the perishing state for want of Knowledge, and subject to the curse of the power which you trans∣gress, and are Heirs of his Wrath, having no part of the Inheritance of Bles∣sing; for a vail of Darkness through sin hath overspread you all, and cover∣ed you all from the sight, and hearing, and feeling of the Creator, and of the mystery of his Glory and Wisdom; and every one in particular, and none excepted of all the Children of Adam upon the face of the whole Earth, but all have sinned and transgressed, and death reigns over all, and blindness of heart hath possessed all, and all have fallen short of the glory of the Creator, and all men are concluded (by his Spirit) to be under sin, and Children of Wrath, and Heirs of Corruption, and in disobedience, and rebellion to the Life that gives all men a Being: The whole World, and all People in it, with∣out exception of Tribes, Generations or Nations, this is the state and condi∣tion of all the Sons of men; all flesh hath corrupted his way upon the Earth in his sight that made it, and the wickedness of man is great in the Earth, and the imaginations and thoughts of every mans heart are evil continually, and grieve the Creator; for the whole Earth is filled with violence through mans trans∣gression; And now not any Stock or People have priviledge one above ano∣ther, to Redemption and Salvation, and to the Kingdom of Peace and Glo∣ry, but Iew and Gentile, Wise and Foolish, Noble and Ignoble, Male and Fe∣male, all People without exception are in transgression, and by the line and mea∣sure of true Judgment are shut out from the Knowledge of Life and Salvation, and of the Inheritance of the Father, in that state of enmity wherein every man in the World is fallen into; and by one the Offence came, and so death upon all men, which reigneth in the hearts of all, and opposeth the Life of the Creator; and everyone is imperfect in the sight of the Lord, blind, deaf, dumb, lame, and without the sence of the Power of him that made him, and brought him forth; his Eye sees not, for it is covered with a vail of darkness; neither doth the Ear hear, for it is stopped; nor the Tongue speak; nor the Understanding perceive any thing of the Secrets of the Lord; but all are separated and divi∣ded from the Tree of Life, and are cast out from his Presence by whom the World was made, into blindness of heart, and to the loathing of your selves, and are more ignorant of your Maker then the Ox is of his Owner, or the Asse of his Masters Crib; for you know not him that gives you life and all good things, and that upholds you by the Word of his Power: And this is his Word unto you all, You are all under the power of Satan, and subject to his will, acting in ini∣quity and in evil, bringing forth the fruits of death from that ground in which you now stand, which is cursed and your Maker hath no pleasure in it; for your fruits grieve his Spirit that made you, and vex his Soul that brought you forth; for man is degenerated into the plant of a strange Vine; and brings forth wild Grapes and cursed Fruit which are of a bitter taste unto the Lord's Soul, who planted all things for himself, who is the good Husbandman; but the whole Earth is corrupted, and all Mankind in it, and man is not now acted, nor led, nor ruled in his heart by the Power that made him, which gives him all good things; but the power of Satan, the Serpent, the old Dragon, which deceived from the beginning, who is in the enmity against the Life of the Creator; he acts man, and
rules man to the abuse of all Creatures, and to his own destruction; and every particular man is liable to the wrath, and to the curse, and to everlasting wo, and misery, and torment from his Maker, in that state of disobedience whereinto all mankind is fallen, not one upon the face of the Earth excepted from transgression, and so from misery; nor none priviledged one above another unto happiness, but as I have said, Male and Female, who were made in the Image of their Maker in the first Creation, but now every man in the whole World is in the enmity a∣gainst the Life of the Power that made him, and is a Child of wrath, and shut up in blindness and unbelief, under the Devils power, which power abode not in the Truth, but is out of the Truth; and all mankind is left in this condition with∣out Help, or Helper, or Deliverance, or Means, or Way of Salvation from himself or any other Creature upon the face of the whole Earth, but is a Sheep without a Shepherd, straying and wandring in the thoughts of his own heart af∣ter vanity, and that wherein there is no profit to the Lord, nor to his own Soul, but death and sorrow in all his wayes, having forsaken the Fountain of living Wa∣ters, and gone a whoring after other Lovers, and defiled himself, and so brought destruction upon himself, by his own doings; who abounds in all Evil, Lying, Theft, Murder, Envy, Strife, stealing; and Whoredom, and such like, which are the fruits of the Ground that is cursed for mans sake. But now unto all Peo∣ple, the Sons and Daughters of Adam, the first man that ever was made, Though you be thus fallen into misery by transgression, and helpless from your selves, or from any other Creature, yet hath the living God, the Power which made you, and which you have transgressed against, ordained and prepared a Way to be re∣stored and healed, and to be brought to the injoyment and feeling of the Creator, from the disobedience, and from the curse, and misery, unto the blessing and hap∣piness; and unto all mankind in particular is prepared a Way out of Death un∣to Life, out of the loss which every man hath received in Transgression, to Sal∣vation, and Redemption, and Deliverance out of the captivity and bondage, which all are fallen into, into liberty and freedom, to serve his Maker, and to glorifie him; for he hath not been served nor glorified, but grieved and vexed by all men on the Earth; and so he hath brought misery and the curse upon all, by for∣saking them, and leaving them under the Power which made them not, to be led and guided by it in rebellion unto destruction. And now this same Power by which man was made, is mans Restorer, and Deliverer, and Redeemer, and Savi∣our, though he hath transgressed against it; for when there was none to help no to save of any creature upon the face of the Earth, the Arm of that Power which made all things stretched forth it self to save the Creatures which were made; and that same Power which is transgressed is the Redeemer of all mankind, though it is offended, and burdened, and pressed as a Cart with Sheaves, by trans∣gression against the Creator; and that is the Power which works out Salvation and Deliverance by slaying the enmity, and condemning iniquity, and removing the cursed ground out of mans heart, that the evil fruits may cease, which it brings forth; and by this Power all must be saved that ever are saved and delivered from wrath. And this all men have been ignorant of, and not felt, nor known, nor tasted of the Life and Power of the Creator, though it hath been near unto every one; and all men and Creatures live move and have their being by it, and suste∣nance from it; and yet man transgresseth it, and grieveth it, and is not led by it. Therefore all People upon Earth, consider your condition and state, and hear∣ken to the Power that made you, a measure of which moveth in the hearts of all mankind upon the face of the Earth; and it moveth against the evil, and against the defiled and transgressing part in every mans heart that is come into the World; and this Power by which all men were made, and which they have trans∣gressed against (a measure of it from the Father is made manifest to all mankind upon the face of the Earth, and convinceth of the evil, of Murder and Adultry, and such like; and condemneth the works which are evil in every particular man,
whether Heathens or Christians (so called) and unto all People, here is the Way to be restored into covenant with your Maker, a measure of his Power in you, se∣cretly moves upon you, and calls to you to return to it, to be led and guided by it, in fear, and obedience, and subjection to it, from which you have been driven, and against which you have transgressed; and this Power, the Creator, hath sent his Son into the World, and given him a Gift unto all mankind; and he hath gi∣ven Light and Understanding to every particular man to know Good from E∣vil, Truth from a Lye, Right from Wrong, Justice from Injustice, and Equity from Falshood: And this Power of the Son of God in you doth witness to you, and accept you, when with it you be guided, and when according to it you speak and act; and it justifies the good, and the right, and the equal, and excuses all men in that from condemnation; but against Lying, and Wrong-dealing and Deceit, and Injustice it testifies, and when you do these things, you transgress against that Power that made you, which should save you, and justifie you, and excuse you, and with it you are accused and condemned; and it brings trouble upon you, and the curse of misery and sorrow: And this Power in you will search your hearts, and try your reins, and let you see your thoughts, and make mani∣fest unto you the state and condition of mankind, who is become Enemy to his Ma∣ker, in following that which brings death, upon which the Wrath remaineth, till there be a returning unto the Power by which man was made, a measure of which (as I have said) moveth in the hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Adam in all the World: And now if every one of you do turn your minds from the World and from the glories and vanities thereof, and from the evil which hath possessed you in thoughts and actions; and if you stand still for a moment, from willing and de∣siring to your selves, and after the World, this shall you find secretly moving in you, which shall draw you towards the Creator, to enjoy him, and to see his Glory, which none that are still in transgression against him can ever partake of, or behold; and if to that you hearken within you, and heed it, and follow it, which witnesseth to that Power that made you, to be great, and mighty, and wonderful, this will shew that you are short of his Glory: And it will condemn evil in you, in all thoughts, words and actions, which proceed out of the cursed ground, in which the Creator hath no pleasure; and this will take away the vail which is spread over you all, and open the blind eye, and unstop the deaf ear, and bring you to hear, and see, and understand the things which are eternal, which belong unto your peace; and if you all come to be guided by that which moves in you all against evil, it will lead you up to its self, to be renewed and chang∣ed (out of the evil and from under the Devils power, under which every man hath been subject, which power hath been out of Truth) into the Image and Likeness of the Creator, and to be restored to his Inheritance, to enjoy Rest and Peace forever. And this is the Word of the Creator of Heaven and Earth to you all, and to all mankind, this is the way unto Redemption, and Salvation, and unto the Bles∣sing, out of all Sorrows, and Troubles, and Afflictions, and Torments, and Woes, and Miseries; which are the Portion forever of all that disobey this Pow∣er which moves against evil in you, which is the Power of him that made all men and things which move in your hearts against all that which the Creator never pla∣ced in you, but which are fruits of Darkness. I say unto you all, This Power in you must you own, and believe in, and follow, and be guided by it, and bea its condennation, and judgment upon all that which is contrary to it, if ever you be restored to the blessed State; and all Anger, and Wrath, and Murder, and Lying, and Dissembling, and Whoredom, and Drunkenness, and Brutishness, and Beastliness, and Wontonness, Backbiting, and Theft, and all these things whatsoever must be condemned in you; for who act these things are Enemies to the Creator, and are led by the Power of Darkness which is the Destroyer of you, soul and body, and the cause of the curse upon you, and the ground of all sorrow, and sufferings, and afflictions, and troubles which come upon that Part in you which is in transgression against the Power of God; for there is a birth
born of the flesh which brings forth, and goes after fleshly wayes, fleshly joyes and delights, and pleasures, and fleshly words, and vanities, which murder the Just, and blind the Eye, and grieve your Maker, and this birth must not inhe∣rit eternal Life; but all that ever do inherit must be born again of another Seed, and into another Nature, where all the former things are passed away; for all glories of this World will wither, and all your joyes and pleasures will come to an end, and you will be left miserable and wretched. Therefore, Oh Earth, Earth, and all the Children of Adam in the whole World, be Awakened, be Awakened, & stirred up to consider of your state & conditi∣on, for the Creator of all things is risen to gather his People up to himself, and his Voice soundeth abroad through the whole World: If any hath an ear to hear, let him hear, Terror and Vengeance is against all the Rebellious, and to Judgment must all come before the Maker of all things, to be judged by him according to the Power which moves in every man, which is just and equal, and witnesseth in equi∣ty, which is a measure of the Power that made the World, and all mankind unto it shall confess, to its greatness, to its justness, and to its authority, and to it must all the Children of Adam bow, and before it tremble; and he that hath done good, and lived in Meekness, and Soberness, in the Truth, and in Justness, in all that which is good, and not in any evil, shall receive Life, Peace, Rest, and Glory from the righteous Judge, the Power by whom the World was made, and he shall be excused from all condemnation; but he that hath done evil and trans∣gressed against the Power of God by which he is upholden, who is degenerate, and brings forth rudeness, wildness, and wickedness, he shall receive tribulation and anguish, and be deprived of happiness in this life, and forever: And all who do not own the measure of the Power of the Creator in you to be guided by it, such do neglect and reject the day of your visitation, and shut your selves out from the Glory of God, and are unworthy of Life and Peace; but all that ow this, and are subject to it, the Power of his Son, who is the Maker of all things and do follow it, this will reconcile you, and slay the enmity, and bring you in∣to unity with the Creator; and this will lead you out of darkness, out of death and evil, and all the wayes thereof, and will save you from all the effects thereof, and you will be excused and justified in the sight of the Creator. Therefore all People upon Earth consider, this is the day of your Visitation; the Way of Life and of Death is set before you, the Way unto Peace, and the way of Trouble. Prize the day of your Visitation. This is to go abroad through all the World, to all the Sons and Daughters of Adam; it is a Warning from the Creator and Maker of all, by a Friend unto all People, and a La∣ver of their souls. HEre is the Estate and Condition of mankind described, whereby in the sigh of the World all may come to understand how all the Sons and Daughte of the first Adam are degenerated, and subverted, and fallen from the state where∣in man was created in the beginning, who was blessed of his Creator, being brought forth in his own Image and Likeness, to rule in dominion over all li∣ving Creatures, and to use them to the Glory of the Creator; & in that day man was not subject to the curse of misery, or sorrow, or vexation; for that door wo was not opened for the curse to enter, but man was altogether blessed in the state wherei he was brought forth, until by disobedience unto the Power that made him, ano∣ther Power gained dominion over him, even the seed of enmity placed it self in mas heart, which prospered by mans rebellion, and became a great Tree of bitterness, bringing forth much fruit in the hearts of all the Children of Adam, to the vex∣ing, and grieving, and dishonouring of the Spirit and Life of God the Creator, even to the making void of his Purpose in creating man, who created him for his
Glory; but man disgraces him, and dishonours him altogether, and brings forth fruit not accepted, but grievous, and of a bitter taste; and the Lords Soul hath been pressed as a Cart with Sheaves, under mans Transgressions, who hath back∣slided, and revolted, and turned aside for a thing of nought, and hath cast himself down from his excellency of Dominion into shame and dishonour, daily pro∣voking the Long-suffering of the Lord, and wearying his Goodness,; and he hath been provoked to cut off the Works of his own Hands, which Satan hath entred into, and defiled and made loathsom and abominable to the Maker; for Satan hath made man barren of all good, and fruitful in all evil, and he is wholly subverted into another end in all his works, then wherefore he was created; he that reads let him understand (the Creator of all things planted a Vineyard, with the choicest Vine, his own Image) and he dressed the Vineyard, and watered it, and he came to look for Fruit in the season, and behold the Vineyard it was degenerated into strange Plants, and brought forth only wild Grapes, and sower Grapes, and crossed the expectation of the good Husbandman, for the fruit of his Vineyard was loathsome to him, of an ill Smell, and of a bitter Taste, and his Soul was not satisfied, but grieved, who laboured for himself, that he might gather Fruit of the Plants which he had planted with the choicest Vine; but behold, the Vine∣yard (all mankind) was barren of good Fruit, and no pleasant Fruit could the Husbandman reap to himself, but the Vines were degenerated, and all brought forth wild Grapes, and sower Grapes, which the good Husbandman hath no pleasure in, but is vexed thereby; for his Vineyard is barren of all good Fruit, and the fruits of unrighteousness have abounded, whereby the good Husbandman is provoked to fury and indignation against the Vineyard which he had planted, being become degenerate Plants, and strange Slips; this a Parable and describeth the Condition of all Mankind: If any have Ears to hear, let him hear, and read himself, how he was planted in the Image of his Maker, but is now degene∣rated and turned aside from Truth and Righteousness, from all good, and from the wayes of Peace, out of the Love and Pleasure of his Maker, and is now in all evil, in deceit and unrighteousness, and in the Wayes of sorrow and trouble, and in the Makers displeasure; and the Seed of Enmity ruleth in him, and is suffered to be King in the Wrath of God, and must be taken away in Gods displeasure and anger; for that is not the annointed of God, but is in rebellion against his Au∣thority, and breaks his Law, and transgresses his Commands, and must be con∣demned into perdition; for all cursed Fruits do spring forth from that seed, to the vexing and grieving of the Lord God, injustice, oppression, deceit, hypocri∣sie, false-heartedness, lying, murther, whoredom, theft, envy bitterness, pervers∣ness, devouring one another, covetousness, idolatry, and all manner of evil which gives an ill savour, and a corrupted taste, and a loathsom sight in the Presence of the Lord God, who made all things, Oh, how abominable are all the wayes of man become unto his Maker, who hath no delight in any of his ways, nor pleasure in any of his works! Oh, how is the Lord grieved, and his Soul from day to day oppressed, and his Long-suffering provoked by the wayes and works of his Creatures which he made for himself! but they are become the Devils, and subject to the power of the enmity; and all mans works are brought forth in that nature which is evil, and out of that ground which is cursed, his good works are not accepted, and his evil deeds are condemned, all which springs forth of one root of bitterness and enmity, which is in the displeasure of the Creator: Oh Earth be awakened, and all ye Sons and Daughters of Adam call to mind your state and condition, and repent, and return before Destructi∣on, when no time of repentance can be found. Hearken to Instruction, and let your Ears be open to hear; here you may all hear and understand the Way to Restoration, to be restored and recovered out of this condition, and out of this enmity, and from under this curse of mi∣sery and destruction; for a Way hath God prepared unto all mankind; and is making it manifest unto the whole Earth, that the Sons and Daughters of Adam may again know their Maker, and have fellowship with him; and this Way is but
one, which is ordained for all People upon the face of the Earth, of what Tribe or Nation soever: And all that come to the knowledge of the Creator must walk in this Way, which is called Christ Jesus, who is the Son of the Creator, the se∣cond Adam, the Lord from Heaven, the Power and Wisdom of the Creator, and by him all things were made, and without him was not any thing formed that was brought forth; he is the Restorer, the Redeemer, and the Deliverer; for he can∣not be overcome of the evil, but overcometh and treadeth down all the Powers of Darkness, and Death, and the Devil, which rise against him in all the World; and the Creator hath so loved mankind, though he hath transgressed against him, and grieved him, yet he hath given his Son into the World, into all Nations, with∣out respect of Persons or People, to be the Saviour of all that believe in him, and receive him, that they may come out of Death and Darkness, from under the De∣vils power, and may be translated, and changed, and renewed out of sin, and death, and ignorance, and rebellion, and out of the Kingdom of the Devil, into Truth and Righteousness; and into the Kingdom of God. And this Restorer and Saviour, the Power and Wisdom of the Creator, hath lightened all mankind, every one that cometh into the World is lightened by him, that every one may follow him, and be guided by his Power and Wisdom; and every one that doth receive him; sin, and iniquity, and transgression is condemned; and the seed of the en∣mity is cast out by his Power, which is revealed against all unrighteousness, and he subdues it, and works it forth of the hearts of all men, and so reconciles man again to his Maker, to have fellowship with him: And this Restorer, the second Adam, comes to be revealed within every man, who executes true Judgment upon the Trans∣gressor, and bindeth under the rebellious nature, and death and condemnation passes upon the seed of enmity, and all its fruits; upon the Devil, and all his works; upon him that is born of the flesh, and all his wayes; his joy is turned in∣to mourning, his pleasures into sorrow, his glory and rejoycing into sadness of heart, and the life which he hath lived comes to be crucified, and the wayes which he hath walked in comes to be hedged up, and no more followed; and his strength is turned into weakeness, and all his wayes and pleasures fade and perish, and the Birth which is Immortal comes to be brought forth, which is not of this World, but Heir of the Creators Inheritance, who hath no glorying under the Sun, nor no pleasure in the glory of this World, which passeth away, but lives unto God in all things, and brings forth fruit unto the Father, and is replan∣ted into the living Vine, and is leavened into a new lump, and placed in the Garden of God; all the old Garments are put off, and old things are passed away, the Devil is cast out, the blind Eye is opened, and the Vail is taken away which hath been spread over all, and the deaf Ear is unstopped, and man is again re∣turned unto his Maker, and hears, and sees, and understands the things which are eternal, which belong to his peace; the Fear of God is set up in his heart, and Gods Secrets are revealed unto him, & he is become the Glory of his Maker, to praise him, to glorifie him, and to magnifie him for evermore, being restored again unto God's Image, and guided with his Power and Wisdom, and hath received domini∣on and authority from his Maker, to reign and rule over all Creatures, and to be ex∣ercised in all things to his Glory by whom they were made; he is not in bondage to any Creature, but in liberty over it, and the Creatures are become his Ser∣vants, and he servant to his Maker, and the Earth yeilds its encrease unto man; the Curse is removed, and the Blessing restored in the Covenant of Peace and Righteousness, where all Creatures come to be injoyed; the covenant of Death and Hell being broken and disanulled, where the curse stood, and standeth in all the World where the restorer of the second Adam is not received, who moveth by the measure of his Power against the evil in the hearts of all men; and he knocketh at the door of the heart, that he may be received, and come in, and dwell with the Children of men, whose delight is with the Sons of men; and every one that openeth to him, and hearkeneth to his Cry, who calls by the Light, and moveth by his Power, by him they receive Life and Peace, and Fulness from the Father; and are raised from Death to Life, and redeemed from under the
power of Satan to the Power of the Creator; all evil in the ground, and in the fruits, judgment goes upon it all, and condemnation: And thus mankind comes to be restored again to God his Maker, to be the Children of God, and Heirs of his Inheritance, and is no more of this World, but redeemed by Jesus Christ out of Kindreds, Tongues, and People, out of respect of Time, Place, Crea∣tures, or Things, and sees through all Creatures, to be before the World was, be∣yond all the glory of this World, to the Glory of the Lord; and here is the praising, and singing, and rejoycing, the living, and walking in that Life which cannot change, and in the World of which there is no end; and here a greater Glory is known then the first mans glory, a greater State then that which was overcome of the Devil, a greater Dominion then that which was lost, this Dominion never can have an end; Death is swollowed up of Life, all sorrow and anguish is swollowed up of rejoycing; all tears are wiped here, and there is no more sorrow; the quickning Spirit is felt and witnessed, which hath quickened again to God; God's Tabernacle is with men, and his Dwelling∣place with the Children of men, and that is felt, and seen, and tasted, which was before the World was, before any Creature was made; and the whole World is comprehended, and mans state in his first Creation is here known, what it was; and mans state in Transgression is also known, what it was; and mans state re∣stored again, is also witnessed; and the difference perceived betwixt the first Adam, which was overcome of the Devil, though he was innocent and without sin, and bore the likeness of his Maker, and of the second Adam, who cannot be over∣come of the Devil, whom Satan hath nothing in, who is the express Image of the Creator it self. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear; Eye hath not seen, Ear hath not heard, it hath not entred into the heart of man that which the Father hath re∣vealed by his Spirit, things not lawful to be uttered, of which there is no decla∣ring, that which is Infinite, Endless, Eternal, and in this I shall end. By one who hath measured and viewed in true Iudgment the condition of all Mankind, who is a Lover of Souls, and a Friend to the Creation of God, known in England by the name of, EDWARD BURROUGH.

Truth Defended: OR CERTAIN ACCUSATIONS ANSWERED; CAST Upon us who are called Quakers, by the Teachers of the World, and the People of this Generation. WITH A clear Discovery who are the false Prophets, and when they came in; and how they may be known, and who they are that deny Christ, and that preach another Gospel; and who deny the Scriptures, Churches, Ministers and Magistrates, whereby the Magistrates and People of this Nation may see they justifie that which the Scripture condemns, and condemns that which the holy men of God justified, and may read their exam∣ple, and our example through the Scriptures. The Epistle. To all you who call your selves Ministers of the Gospel, and all People in all Rela∣tions under what form of Worship soever in England, or in all the World, wh profess your selves Christians. THe mighty day of the Lord is come, according as he promised of old, and this day is witnessed, wherein he is establishing his Mountain, and exalting it above all Moun∣tains, and is gathering his People which have been scattered in the dark and lo Night of Apostacy, which Christ and his Apostles saw coming into the Churc then, and hath had dominion long over the World, and hath reigned till now, and reigns n in all the Professors in all Forms every where. But now the time is come wherein the Kingd of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ; and thousands wit∣ness it to the praise of his everlasting Name. And therefore the Nations are angry, and  Pinces of the Earth, because Michael one Prince is arisen to plead with all who make  against him. And now Herod and Pilate, and all Jerusalem are in an uproar, and Amm and Amaleck, and the Egyptians, and the Philistines are joyned now against him. And all you who live in Forms, and know not the Power, do now persecute and joyn your selves t∣gether, being in the same nature as the Persecutors of old, which were born after the Flesh. And now you Sons of Bondage, and of Hagar are to be cast out; and now you are all  manifest that you are in the Flesh; for all your Bows are bent, and all your Arrows are  at a People which are accounted by you as the filth of the World, and as the off-scouring of all things, whom the World calls Quakers, in whose foreheads is written the Name of the living God; and unto you I say that make war against them, and now take part with the Drag against the Lamb, you shall all drink of the Cup of Fury and indignation of the Lord,  unto the Living God who is holy and jealous for his own Glory and Name, which hath mani∣fested his Mind and Will by his eternal Spirit unto us, shall you all bow and stoop. For now the
Lord hath rent the Vail of the Covering which hath been spread over  the Nations in all Professions; and you are all seen by the ternal Eye which is opened in thousands, even all from the highest to the lowest▪ who have stoln and painted your selves with  ens words. And all your Images which you have set up, and all your traditions from en, in which you have walked, are all seen to be stubble, and ill not abid in the day of the Lord. And all your Churches which you have gathered together by imitation from the  shall all be scattered; and there you all are▪ for you all deny Revelation, and say it is ceased; and so you call the Letter the Light and the Word: but with that which was before the Scripture you are seen and judged, even with that which shall endure for ever. And seeing you have cast reproach upon the Name of the God of Hea and Earth whom we worip, and which you call delusion▪ for the truths sake are we moved to lay open your akedness, that you may be judg∣ed by that which you say is your rule. Here in this Little Book thou who hast any honesty in thee, or any desire of truth, and wilt search the Scripture, thou wilt see th  the teachers of the world in all Forms, and all Professors ever cryed out (who had but the Form) against them who had the Life and Power, as you all  now against them who Worship God in the Spirit, and have no confidene in the flesh: and therefore in this following Discorse which  written by the same Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, thou shalt see who are the false Pro∣phets, and who they are that preach another Gospel, and who they are that deny the Scrip∣tures; and thou mayst see when the false Prophets came in, and who they are clearly proved to be, by their own rules. And all you who call your selves Magistrates and Christians, you may see your selves to hold up that which Christ, the Prophets and Apostles cryed o against, and Persecute them who stand in the counsel of God, and them th Declare against all the deceit, as the Holy men of God did: and so you are the beast which holds up the false Prophets and those whom the Scripture declareth against. God is arisen to d to pieces all them who withstand him: and therefore come out of Babylon, d out of all your painted forms, and come to own the first Principle which will change your mindes, even the Light of Christ which he hath enlightned every one withal; and by it you shall see what you are doing. Now if you deny this, you deny the Corner-stone, and you stumble and shall be broken, and by th which you call natural shall all your Image of gold and silver, and all your mixed invented worship be dashed to pieces, and  for the Pit▪ Therefore all be silent and speak not evil of those thing you know not; for now you are all seen, you who say you are ws and are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan, and your voice is known, for none is turned from the evil of his way; and therefore is wrath coming upon you to the utmost. A Lover of your Souls, but am a Witness against all your deceit. F. H. VVHereas we are accused by the Teachers and People of this Gene∣ration, That we are false Prophets, and Deceivers; and that we deny the Christ which dyed at Jerusalem; and that we preach another Gospel then the Apostles preached; and that we deny the Scriptures, and the Ordinances of Iesus Christ; and that we hold Free-will, and establish Self-righteousness, and teach Peo∣ple to act in their own strength to obtain Life; and that we deny Churches, Ministers, and Magistracy. To all these false Accusations I Answer. It is no new thing, nor no strange thing to the Children of Light, who are separated from the World, and worldly Wor∣ships; and from the works of Darkness, to be accused falsly, and to be standered, by being called Deceivers and Seducers, by the Generation of chief Priests and Pharisees; in which Generation are the Teachers and Professors of this Age, who have a Form of Godliness, but deny the Power. Christ was called a Deceiver and a Blasphemer; and the Apostles were called Movers of Sedition, Hereticks, and Turners of the World up-side down▪ by them who professed in word what
Christ was in Substance, and what the Apostles witnessed, and so it is now. We who are scornfully called Quakers, do live in, and declare forth, no other thing but the Substance of what the Priests have preached upon, and the Pofessors have talked upon in their carnal minds by their imaginations. He is a false Prop and a Deceiver which hath not the Word from the Mouth of the Lord, but takes that which the Lord spoke to Another, and calls it his, and us his Tongue and saith, The Lord saith it, when the Lord never spake to him: And here are the Teachers of the World themselves guilty of that whereof they faly accuse us; for they take the Prophets words, Christs and the Apostles words to talk upon, but have not received the Word from the Mouth of the Lord; and their prophesie and preaching would soon be ended if they had not the Scrip∣ture, which is other mens words, and that which was spoken to others, to spe their imaginations from: And these are the false Prophets and Deceivers, which run, and are not sent, which speak to others, pretending they be sent of God▪ but walking contrary to all that ever God sent to declare his Name in fo Generations, and so are known to us by their fruits, having no example from the Prophets, Christ, nor his Apostles for their practice; but do walk in the ex∣ample of the false Prophets of Israel, of the Scribes and Pharisees, and of the false Brethren. O foolish People which have eyes and sees not, which have hea and do not understand: Is the Lord changed from what he was? Were they fal Prophets and Deceivers in Isaiah's time, which he was sent to cry out against, which sought for their Gain from their Quarter? And are not your Teachers false Prophets now, which act the same things? Were they false Prophets and Decei∣vers in Ezekiel's time, which  was sent to cry against, that fed themselves wi the Fat, and clothed themselves with the Wool, and made a Prey upon the Peo∣ple? And are not your Teachers false Prophets and Deceivers now, which  the same thing? Were they false Prophets in Micahs time, which he was sent  cry out against, which preached for Hire and divined for Money, and cry peace to them that put into their mouthes but prepared war against them that  not? And are not your Priests false Priests and Prophets which act the same thing Were they Deceivers of the People in Christs time, which he cryed wo agai▪ which were called of men-Masters, and which had the chief Places in the ∣blies, and which stood praying in the Synagogues, and went in long Robes,  which loved greetings in the Markets; And are not your Teachers Deceivers of the People now, which are found acting the same things? Were they false Teach∣ers and false Brethren in the Apostles time, which they declared against, which through coveteousness with feigned words made merchandise of the People, and went in the way of Balaam, for Gifts and rewards, and preached for filthy Lu∣cre, and which Paul saw come and coming in his dayes; which were proud men, coveteous men, self-willed, and fierce men, heady, high-minded men, having a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power, which alwayes taught People, b none were able to come to the knowledge of the Truth under their teaching? A are not your Teachers false Teachers now, who walk in the same steps? To e Light in all Consciences I do speak, which will witness the truth: A sottish and ignorant People, which cannot discern who the false Prophets, and Deceivers▪ and false Teachers are; the Lord is the same that ever he was, and his Spirit  no whit changed. Was it once an abomination to the Lord in the false Priests and Prophets of Israel, to seek for their Gain from their Quarter, and to feed them∣selves with the Fat, and clothe themselves with the Wool, and make a Prey upo the People, and to preach for Hire, and to divine for Money? and are not these thing and they that uphold them abomination to him now? Did the Spirit of the Lord in his Servants declare against these things then, and against them that up them then; and must not the same Spirit, where it is made manifest, declare agai these things, and against them that uphold them now? Was it once an abomi∣tion in the sight of Christ in them, to be called of men Master, and to have  chief places in the Assemblies, and to stand praying in the Synagogues, &c. and are not these things an abomination to him now in whom they are upheld? D
Christ cry wo against such things, and against them that upheld them then; and must not the Spirit of Christ, where it is made manifest, cry wo against such things, and against them that uphold them now? Were these mars of false Teachers then, to make merchandise of the People, and to go in the way  , for Gifts and Rewards, and for filthy  and to be proud, cove, eady, high-minded▪ self-willed, and fierce men? And are not they false Teachers now which bear these marks? Did the Apostle give warning to beware of such, and to turn away from such? and must not the same Spirit where it is made manifest give warning to beware of such, and to turn away from such now? We wit∣ness to have received according to measure, the Spirit of the Prophets  which they spoke▪ and the Spirit of the Apostles by which they spoke, which is, Christ made manifest in us, and happy are all they that receive our Testimony. For by the same Spirit of Christ we do declare against these abomination now, as the holy men of God did then▪ for God and his Spirit is the same as ever was, and what he once aed he hates forever; and no other Christ do we clare forth, which we witness to be made manifest within, but that Christ which dyed at Ierusalem, which suffered by the chief Priests and Elders of the People; he was and is the true Christ, which said, He was the Light of the World; And was the Light which had enlightened every man that comes into the World; and which said, Except a man would deny the World, and take up his daily cross, and fol∣low him, he could not he his Disciple; And which cryed wo against them which were called of men Masters, and that had the chief Places in the Assemblies, and that stood praying in the Synagogues, &c. and they who denyed him to be the Light of the World, and which too not up the Cross, and which were called of men Masters, and had the chiefest Places in the Assemblies, and stood praying in the Synagogues, and went in long Robes, these were Antichrists, and ere acted by a contrary spirit then the true Christ. And here again, I charge all the Teachers and People (in the presence of the Lord God, who deny Christ to be the Light in every one, which reproves for sin) and who are called of men Masters, and stand praying in the  and go in long obes, and who uphold such things, and who take not up the dai∣ly Cross of Christ, but live at liberty in their wills and desires, that they are An∣tichrists, and that their spirit is not the Spirit of the true Christ, which dyed at Ierusalem, but the spirit of a false christ, and so they are guilty of that them∣selves, whereof they falsly accuse us▪ and the same Christ do we witness which the Saints of old witnessed, whose blood cleansed them from all sin, and in whose Power they had power over sin, death, and hell. And here again I charge the Teachers and People, who say, That the Saints must not be cleansed from sin, nor cease to commit sin while they are on the Earth; That the Christ which they profess is not the Christ which dyed at Jerusalem, but a spirit contrary, and not the Christ which the Saints witnessed; and all the People are blind which cannot see these things. Did the true Christ once say, He was the Light of the World, of every man that comes into the World? And is that his Spirit in the Teachers and Prssors now, which say, Every man hath not the Light of Christ in him? Was that the true Christ which said, Except you take up my Cross daily you cannot be my Disciples? And is that his Spirit in the Teachers and People that hath its liberty, and live in Pride, in Lust, and Vanity▪ and their own Wills? was that the true Christ which cry∣ed wo against them that were called of men Masters, and that had the chief Pla∣ces in the Assemblies, and stood praying in the Synagogues, &c, And is that his Spirit in the Teachers and People which act and uphold those things: Was  the true Christ which the Saints witnessed, by whose Blood they  clesed from sin, and had power over sin, and is that his Spirit in the Teachers and People, which saith, The Saints must not be clesed from si   to ct sin while they are  Earth? Oh blind and ignorant People! who cannot discern between the  Christ and Antichrist, which is contrary to Christ, and which leads now to act and
speak contrary to what the true Christ once acted and spoke: and no other Gospe do we preach, but that which the Apostles preached, which they received not fro nor by man, but by the revelation of Iesus Christ, which was contrary to man, and which suffered by man for the preaching of it; who preached to the Spi in Prison to redeem the captives, and by which the fleshly man was judged in the  that man might live according to God in Spirit; and this Gospl we witness to have received not from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, which is con∣trary to man, for which we are persecuted and suffer by man: neither do w speak to the wisdom and reason, but we preach to the Spirits in Prison, that the fleshly man may be judged in the flesh, that man may live according to God  the Spirit; this will many witness with us, that by the preaching of our Gospe liberty is brought to the captives, and the fleshly man is judgest, and the Spirit which was in Prison is set free. And here again I charge the Teachers of this Generation, That their gospel which they preach is not the Gospel which the Saints preached, but another gos∣pel, and they are guilty of that themselves whereof they falsly accuse us; for they have received their gospel from man, and by man, from the Printers a Stationers, and are made Minister of it by the will of man, at Schools, and ∣niversities; and their preaching is in the will of man, a limited time and place neither do they suffer by man, but are set up with man, and feed the wisdom  reason of man; and the fleshly man is not judged, nor the captives redeemed  their gospel, which they preach; here they are accursed which preach anot gospel, as saith the Scripture: And ye are a blind and ignorant People which can∣not see these things; Did they that preached the true Gospel receive it contrary to the will of man? and can it now be received by the will of man? Did they which preached it suffer for it by man? and can they now who preach it, be up by man, who live in the same persecuting nature? Did the true Gospel o judge the fleshly man,) and lead to live according to God in the Spirit? and do it now give liberty to the fleshly man, to live after the flesh in the lust of it,  the Teachers and Professor of this Generation do, who profess the Gospel,  are discovered not to be come to the Law? And the Scripture we own to be  true Declaration of the Life which they lived in which spoke them orth; and  the same Spirit from which they were spoken (which we have received) do we  to our seals, that they are rue; and the Scripture is ours, who walk in the Life  it; proud men spoke it not forth, nor they that sought for their gain from the quarter; nor they that preached for hire; nor they that were called  men master, but persecuted them that spoke it forth, and denyed it when it was spoken. And here again, I charge it upon the Teachers and Professors of this Genera∣tion, that they deny the Scripture, and are guilty of that themselves whereof they falsly accuse us; for they say, None must be perfect upon the Earth; when as  Scripture declares of such as were perfect upon Earth: And they say; None  be free from sin; when as the Scripture declares of such as were free from sin, and were the Servants of Righteousness: They say, Christ hath not enlightened every  the Scripture saith, He is the Light of the World, and hath enlightened every one &c. can they now who live in the same persecuting nature, and walk in the  steps as they did which persecuted them who spoke forth the Scripture (as the Te∣chers and People do) own the Scripture in Truth? Their professing of the Scrip∣ture is as theirs was, which made a great profession of it in the outward appear∣ance, but put him to death who had the Life, and was the Substance of it: They then, as the Teachers of the World do now, denyed the Spirit and Life whic gave sorth the Scriptures. And the Ordinances of Jesus Christ we own and witness, Preaching, Pray∣ing, Baptism, Communion, Singing, and whatsoever was ordained for his Saints to practise in Life and Power; we witness these things in the eternal Sub∣stance, having passed through the earthly figures, which was but to stand for its time; by the Eternal have we been led, by the Command of it within us, and
got by tradition from the Scripture without us, And we deny all such who have taken up these things in their own wills, by conforming the outward man to the out∣ward Letter, and have not entred in at the Door. True Preaching we own, and do witness, in which is the Cross of Christ, and the Power God unto Salvation or Condemnation, it is foolishness to the World, and its wisdom, now as ever it was; and we deny all speaking of imaginations from the Scripture, which is in the wisdom of the World, and which stands in the will of man limitted to a set time, day or place. Prayer by Spirit, and in the Spirit we own and witness, which is not limitted to a time and place: And we deny all the Worlds formal customary Preaching and Praying for a pretence. Baptism we own and witness, which is, With one Spirit, into one Body, into the Death of Christ: And we deny all Baptisms which are imagined and imitated, by conforming the outward man to the outward Letter, which is but a likeness of the the true Baptism. Communion we live in, which is, In the Light by the Spirit, which will en∣dure eternally: and we deny the Worlds imitation, which is in word and decla∣ration, and visible carnal things which will pass away. Singing which is with the Spirit and with Understanding, of the redeemed of the Lord, we own and witness; but the Worlds singing in Rime and Meeter, proud men singing, That they are not puft in mind; and prophane men singing, That the Law of God is dear to them; this singing we deny, for it must be turned into howling, the Lord hath said it. And here again, I charge it upon the Teachers of the World, That they deny the Substance and Power of what Christ commands his Saints to practice, by up∣holding their own imitations, and so deceiving the People; but where the Sub∣stance is witnessed, the figure is denyed, and the false imitations are discovered and denied: And mans free-will we do deny, for the will of man shall never enter to God, but leads out from God into the lust, and into the flesh, and, keeps in the power of the Devil; and man hath free-will unto that which is evil, but not to that which is good; and all who follow Christ the Light of the World, must de∣ny their own wills, and take up the Cross of Christ, which is to the will, and walk in the Light, contrary to the will, in the strait Way which leads unto Life, which is out of the will of man, in the Will of God, which the will of man doth resist and oppose. And I charge it upon the Teachers and Professors, who do not witness the daily Cross of Christ, that they live in their own free-will, and holds it up, and are led by it, into pride, and coveteousness, and lusts of the flesh, which stand in the will; and here they are guilty of that themselves whereof they falsly accuse us, living in their own free-will, and walk not in the daily Cross of Christ. And Self-righteousness we have denied, and have seen it in the same Light which Isaiah did, to be as filthy Rags; and we declare against it, and against them which live in it; for self must not be saved, it is accursed from God, it is wholly unrighteous (and makes the best of actions so) and is, and must be cast out from God: Christ Jesus made manifest and revealed in us is our Righteousness, and self is judged and condemned by him, who is made unto us Righteousness; neither do we teach People to labour in their own strength to obtain Life, but do direct People to the Light of Christ within them, which walking in, will be strength to them to lead them to Life; the Light which is of Christ, to which we direct all to wait in, to be taught by; it will lead out of self-righteousness, and from under the power of self, to witness the power of God, to lead, and to act, and to witness Christ Jesus revealed, the Righteousness of God. And the Church which is in God, which is the Body of Christ, whereof Christ is Head, we witness, and are members of it, gathered and joyned by the eternal Spirit, and not by tradition in the wisdom of man. And we deny all the Worlds Chur∣ches, whereof they were made members by visible things without, and gathered by traditions (and not by the Spirit) whereof the Serpent is head (and not
Christ) and which is the body of antichrist, some of which commits Idolatry i an Idols-temple; and the ministry of this church we deny, for it stands in  will of man, and the Ministers of it are such as all the Servants of the Lord wit∣nessed against: the Churches, the Ministry, and the Ministers are contrary to God; but the Ministry which is to the Seed, which is out of the will of man, we own and witness, which ministers Life unto life and Death unto death, and di∣vides the Word aright, judgment to the fat and to the strong, and feeds the ∣gry, and looseth the Bars of wickedness, and breaks not the bruised Reed,  quencheth not the smoaking Flax; this Ministry we deny not, but are Friends unto it; and who are Ministers here, we have union withal; but proud men, and such as are called of men Masters are cast out of this Ministry, and are Mini to the body of antichrist, and know not the Mystery of the Ministry of Jesus Christ, which is to the Spirit in Prison. Magistrates and Magistracy we deny not, but do give respect unto for Con∣science sake; for who bears the Sword of Justice, who use their power to be a terror to the wicked, and for the praise of them that do well, are Ministers of God; and we desire that there were more Magistracy here, and that the Magi∣strate would more use his power, to be a terror to Lyars, to Swearers, to Drun∣kards, to Railers, to false Accusers, and to proud Men, and Oppressors, this  are Friends unto; but to such as act by their own wills in corrupt Laws, and  thereby violence to the Innocent, and strengthen the hands of Evil-doers, we cannot be subject, but choose rather (then to transgress the Law of God, whi is written in our hearts, by submitting to such mens wills and laws) to suffer by the corrupt wills of men, under corrupt laws for a moment. And thus I have answered those false Accusations which are cast upon us, and  declare it to be the same spirit in the Teachers and People of this Generatio which accuseth us, as it was in the Scribes and Pharisees, which accused Chr and his Disciple; and this the Scripture witnesseth unto; as they did unto him,  would they do unto us. A further Answer to that Accusation of being false Prophets, and Deceivers. JEsus Christ prophesied and said, That in the last dayes should many false prophets arise, which should deceive many, and if it were possible the very Elect. Now the Teachers and People of this Generation do say, That we (who by the World are called Quakers) are those false Prophets and Deceivers which Christ prophesied of. Of this their false accusation have they, Drunkards, Lyars, Swearers, and all the ungodly People in every profession to witness them; but their Accusation and their Witnesses we do deny, though they preach it among the People for doctrine. And now in answer to this false Accusation and Slander, I am moved to write a little, and shall to that Principle of God in every mans Conscience clear my Conscience, and declare what I know from God concerning those false Prophets; who they are, when they came in, and how they may be known; and shall leave it to eve∣ry honest heart to consider of, The Apostles and Ministers of Jesus Christ saw the same false Prophets which Christ prophesied of to be come, and coming in their dayes, before a Quaker wa heard of: Iohn said, By that they knew that it was the last time: for, said he, Even now are there many Antichrists and false Prophets gone out into the World; such wer they who confessed not Christ to be come in the Flesh; and they were of the World, and spoke of the World, and the World heard them. Now here I charge it upon the Teachers of the World, that they are of that Ge∣neration which went out into the World then; for as they then confessed not Christ to be come in the Flesh, so these uphold those things which were under the Law, which was before Christ came in the Flesh outwardly; and so confess Christ
not to be come in the Flesh, and so they are Antichrist▪ They uphold an outward Temple, and an outward Worship, and take tythes, as the Priests under the Law did, as a Type and Figure of Christ, but when he was come, and sacrificed, these things (which were to stand for a time) were put to an end: and none who wit∣nessed Christ come, and were sent by him to preach the Gospel, did uphold those things, but witnessed forth the Substance, and denied the figure; they denied the outward Temple, and witnessed they were the Temples of God, and that God dwelt in them, and denied the outward worship, and witnessed the Worship of God in Spirit and in Truth within them, (for they who worshipped without, wor∣shipped they knew not what, as they do now) and they denied to take Tythes, but lived of the Gospel; and said, They that preached it, should live of it; but the Teach∣ers of this Generation are of the World, living in its pride, lusts and vanities; and they who live in the same worldly nature uphold them, and hear them. Iohn also said, Every spirit that confesseth not Christ to be come in the Flesh, is Antichrist. And here I charge it upon the Teachers of the World, that their Spirit of Pride and Covetousness, and Envy, and Hypocrisie which rules in them, is the Spirit of Antichrist, and confesseth not Christ to be come in the Flesh; for where he is made manifest, and come in the Flesh, this spirit is destroyed; For, (as saith the Scrip∣ture) he was made manifest to destroy the works of the Devil. Paul was also a Witness of the false Prophets and Deceivers which Christ prophesied of in his time; for he gave warning to beware of such, and to turn away from such whom he saw then come, and coming in, but came more fully in after his dayes; he said of this sort, They were lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, heady, high-minded, fierce men and dispisers of those that were good, given to filthy lucre, and to pleasure, and were false-Accusers, and Blasphemers, and without natural affection, and unthankfull, and unholy, and taught silly women, who were led with divers lusts, but were not able to come to the knowledge of the Truth by their Teaching: they were men of corrupt minds, and reprobat concerning Faith. And here again I charge it upon the Teachers of the World, that they are of that Generation which came in then; for they are Lovers of themselves, they take money of poor people, to whom they are more able to give; and they are proud and covetous men, that go in their Ribbons and Cuffs, and gaudy attire; and they preach to them where they can get most money; and some takes money of them, and sues them at the Law, to whom they preach not at all: they are heady and high-minded men, for poor people bow to them in the Streets, and call them Masters: They are fierce men, and dispise those that are good; if any speak against them, (of the truth) they are fierce against, and despise such: and they are given to filthy lucre, and are lovers of pleasure, for where they can have most money, there they will abide; and they live in pleasure, in idleness, and lust and vanity; they are flase-Accusers, they will call them Deceivers, which are not; and that Blasphemy, which is not; and they are Blasphemers, and without natural affection. They say the Letter is the Word, and the Scripture the Light, which is contra∣ry to Scripture, for God is the Word, and Christ is the Light; and they will suf∣fer the rude multitude, and some will set them upon it, to hale, beat, and strike out of their Assemblies, which is without natural affection: They are unthank∣ful and unholy; they have great sums of money from the people, and are not thankful, but compel them by a Law to pay them; and herein they are unholy by their actions which are declared, which is oppression; and they teach always, but men and women are ignorant still, and none able to come to the knowledge of the Truth by them; and they have a Form of godliness; they profess the Scrip∣tures, That the Children of the Lord are to be taught of the Lord; and that Christ said, Take no thought what to eat, nor what to drink, nor wherewith to be cloathed; but who wit∣ness themselves taught of God, and that they need no man to teach them; and that take no care what to eat, nor what to drink, nor what to put on, and so wit∣ness the promise of God, and abide in the Doctrine of Christ, these you call De∣ceivers, and idle and careless persons, and thus deny the power of what they have
professed; and herein their minds are corrupt and reprobate concerning Faith for Faith is the Substance, and purifies the heart from these things which they are guilty of. And Peter and Iude also were Witnesses of those Deceivers and false Prophets which Christ prophesied of, in their time; for they saw such were come, and coming, which should bring in damnable Heresies, and through covetousness, with feigned words, make merchandise of the people; they walk after the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and despise Government and Dominion; presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of Dignities; they speak evil of things that they understand not; they have eyes full of adultery, and they cannot cease from sin, beguiling unstable Souls; an heart they have, exercised with covetous practises; cursed Children, which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam, who loved the Wages of unrighteous∣ness, they themselves are the Servants of corruption; ungodly men, turning the Grace of God into laciviousness, and defile the flesh; these are Murmurers, Complainers, walking after their own lusts, and their mouthes speak great swelling words, having mens persons in admiration because of advantage; these be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. And here again I charge it upon the Teachers of this Age, that they are of that Generation which came into the World then; for they have brought in, and do uphold damnable Heresies, telling people, That sprinkling Infants with water is the Baptism into the Faith; and that singing David's Experiences in Rime and Meeter, is singing to the glory of God; and that a House of Stone is the Tem∣ple and Church of God; these are damnable Heresies: and they do through cove∣tousness make Merchandise of the people; if they can get more money at another place, thither they will go; and thus people are their Merchandise: they wal after the flesh, in the lusts of uncleanness; they walk in pride and in lust; and some of them will be drunk, and lye, and swear, and talk uncleanly; and they despise the Saints Government and Dominion (for they walk in the wayes of the World, in the Customs and Traditions of men, and follow their own wills) and whom the Spirit of God governs, and hath dominion over, follows Christ for their Example, whose Government and Dominion they are under; but they live in pride, lust and vanity, and according to the flesh; and herein they despi Government and Dominion, and speak evil of this Dignity, and of the Myste∣ries of God revealed in his Saints, which they know not, nor understand not, cal∣ling it Error: They are presumptuous and self-willed; they have presumed to call themselves Ministers of Christ, and all the Towns where they live, must serve, and be subject to their wills; and they are adulterated from God after honour and riches, and the vanities of the World; and they cannot cease from sin themselves; for they say, None must cease from it while they are on the Earth; and herein they beguile many Souls; for, till sin be ceased from the Soul, it is beguiled; they have a heart exercised with covetous practises, and they follow the way of Ba∣laam, and go for gifts and rewards, and love the wages of unrighteousness: they take money of poor people for sprinkling Infants, and for burying the Dead, which are covetous practises: they take money for Hens and Eggs, and for Smoke passing up the Chimney, which are unrighteous Wages: and thus they have forsaken the right Way of God, and of all the Saints which spoke forth the Scripture; and in these things they are Servants of corruption, and are un∣godly men, and turn the Grace of God (which shines in their Consciences, which shews them their ungodly wayes) into laciviousness; and through the lust they defile the flesh: and many of them will murmur and complain for want of Wages, even to spend upon their lusts; and they speak great swelling words, speaking of the fame of Christ, of his Life and Death, and Resurrection, but cannot witness by the Spirit of Christ within them, what they speak of him; and they have mens persons in admiration because of advantage; some of them had the Bishops in admiration, and some the King in admiration, and now they have others who bear rule in admiration; and thus they deceitfully have twined to admire mens persons, only because of advantage; many of them have separated themselves,
none who are not of their Judgment must joyn with them in their worship; but ither they, nor their Separates have the Spirit of the Living God, but do deny  infallible Spirit; and they are sensual in their wayes, practises and wisdom d these have deceived many, even whole Nations. And here you see plainly when the Deceivers and false Prophets came in; they were come, and coming in, in the Apostles dayes, and then was the Prophesie of Christ fulfilling and fulfilled: and the Apostle suffered under Tyrants, and were put to cruel deaths, and then they came in more fully; for since the Apostles days hath been a great Apostacy, and many Forms of Worship, and Wayes of Reli∣gion have been imitated from the Letter through imaginations, and but one Gene∣ration of Teachers, though one above another, in the comprehension & sensual wis∣dom, and at enmity one against another, though all in one birth and nature. But they are all discovered by the Light, Praises (from all that know God) to him for ever. Since the Apostles dayes hath darkness been spread over all, though the Lord had some which he preserved for himself in the midst of Apostacy and darkness; who the false Prophets are which Christ prophesied of, to every honest heart and single eye may be known: Christ said, By their fruits should they be known; and the Fruits of the Teachers of the World are plainly made appear to be the fruits of Decei∣vers, and not of the Ministers of Christ; none have gathered Grapes nor Figs from them. And thus I have cleared my Conscience in the Presence of God concerning the false Slander and Accusation which the Teachers and People of the world do cast upon us; and to that in every ones Conscience it is made appear, who they are to whom this Accusation justly belongs. Wo unto all you who strive against the Lord, and justifie that which the holy men of God, (which spake forth the Scripture) in the Scripture declared against; and which condemn that which the holy men of God in the Scriptures justified, and witnessed for: You who live in Pride, in Coveteousness, in Double-dealing, and in Hypocrisie, and in the Lusts of the flesh; you strive against the Lord God, and a∣gainst the Light of God, which is in your Consciences, which shews you these things to be sin: You resist the drawings of the Father, which would draw you by the Light to follow the Son. Wo and Desolation is to come upon all you who will not be taught by the Light of Christ Jesus, which he hath enlightened you withal; which Light all the Holy men of God were taught by, who gave forth the Scrip∣tures, but do set up Teachers without you, such as all the holy men of God, the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles declared against. Oh blinded, stiff-necked People, which are not ashamed to call such Ministers of Christ, and of the Gospel (and by your corrupt Wills and Laws to defend them) which seek for their gain from their quarter, and which feed themselves with the Fat, and clothe themselves with the Wooll; and which preach for Hire and divine for Money; and prepare War against them that put not into their mouthes: here you justifie such as the Prophets of the Lord were sent to cry against, and deny Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Micah, to be true Prophets; for if you did believe that they spoke from the Mouth of the Lord, the Word of the Lord, and understood what they spoke, then would you not uphold them which act those things which they declared against; for that which was abomination to the Lord then, is abomina∣tion to him now; and that Spirit which declared against these things then, can∣not uphold them now. And here the Teachers and People are tryed, not to have the same Spirit which was in the holy Prophets of the Lord, but the spirit of the false Prophets, acting by it that which they acted, which the true Prophets cryed against; and thus by upholding that which the Lord sent his Servants to declare against, you strive against the Lord, ye Magistrates and People. And you are not ashamed to call such Ministers of Christ which (walk in the same steps, and that act those things that they did, which Christ, cryed wo against) are called of men Masters, and have the chief Places in the Assemblies, and stand praying in the Synagogues, and go in long Robes, and love greetings in the Markets, as they did: here you
justifie such as Christ cryed wo against, and deny that Christ spoke the Truth, what was the Mind of his Father, or understood it not; for if you did believe that he spoke the will of his Father, then would ye not uphold these that act the same things which he cryed wo against; And he changes not; that which he once cryed against, the same spirit where it is witnessed, cries against the same things. And here again the Teachers of the World are tryed, not to have the Spirit of Christ, but the Spirit of the Scribes and Pharisees, who act that which they acted, which he cryed wo against: And herein Magistrates and People strive against the Lord God, by upholding that which Christ cryed wo astainst; and such who are Ministers of Christ, and walk in his doctrine, and in the same steps which he and his Apostles walked in, witnessing for that which they witnessed for, and against that which they witnessed against; them you call Deceivers, and false Prophets, and accuse them for Vagabonds, and wandring Beggars, and idle and careless Persons; and that they have left their Families, and carelesly wander up and down. And herein you Magistrates and People strive against the Lord, by persecuting, and slandering, and false accusing, and condemning such as the Scripture justifies, and the Servants of the Lord which spoke forth the Scripture do witness of to be true. What would you have called Christ, who had no where to lay his head? He was no vagabond, nor idle, nor careless Person. And what would you have called the Apostles and Ministers of Christ? who had left their Families and Callings, and went up and down, and had no certain dwel∣ing Place, but went from City to City, and cared not for the World; nor what to eat, nor what to drink, nor wherewith to be clothed; this they did, and yet were no Vagabonds, nor idle, nor careless Persons, but abode in the Doctrine of Christ: they were hated by your Generation, as we are now by you; and they were called, Pestilent Fellows, and Movers of Sedition, and Heriticks, and men of erro∣nious Iudgments: And they said, They were Troublers of their Cities, as you do now call us false Prophets and Deceivers. I do declare this Generation to be the same which persecuted the Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles, as it doth persecute us; for by the same Power we stand, as they did, and by the same Power we are com∣manded and acted, as they were. And to the Power by which we stand, and are commanded, shall all the power of men, and of the Earth bow, and be subject. O all you Magistrates and People, consider of your blindness and ignorance, who do absolutely justifie and uphold such as the Scripture declares and witnesses against, and do condemn and persecute such as the Scripture justifies and witnesses of, and do put them out of your Synagogues, and Villages: Search the Prophets, and Christ, and the Apostles Writings, in them you may read your Example, and our Example. In Jeremiah 20. You may read how Pashur the chief Governour, when he had heard what Jeremiah had said, smot him, and put him in the Prison, and in the stocks, and dealt wick∣edly with him: Now Jeremiah is our example, who had the Word of the Lord, and spake freely; sometimes in the streets, and in the Gate of the Lords House, and feared no mans face, but prophesied against the Priests and false Prophets, which used their Tongue, and had not the Word from the Lord, but was given to lightness and covetousness: And Pashur, who smote him, and put him in the Prison, is your example, whose measure of wickedness you fulfil, in doing as he did; and by your oppressions is the sufferings and reproaches of Jere∣miah fulfilled in us, who is made a derision daily, and a scorn to the wicked, since we spake in the Name of the Lord, as Jeremiah was in that Generation of Evil-doers, who is your example: Also in Amos 7. you may read how Amaziah the Kings Priest sent to the King of Israel, and they conspired against him; and Amaziah forbad Amos to prophesie any more at Bethel, for it is the Kings Chappel, and the Kings Court; and said he, The Land is not able to bear his words. Now herein Amaziah the Priest, and Jeroboam the King, who were both Persecuters, is your example, who takes Counsel against the Innocent, and thrusts out of your Countries, and Cities, and Towns, and makes Laws against the Servants of the Lord, and forbids us to speak any more in your Courts or Chappels, and beats, and persecutes us, and do say, The Land is not able to bear such things as are spoken and written by us:
And Amos, who was no Prophet, nor Prophets Son, but a poor labouring man is our example, who was innocent, and spake the Word of the Lord against the Songs of the Temples, in the Chappel and in the Kings Court; and his example doth witness to our practises, as the ex∣ample of the Wicked in their wickedness, do witness your practice, whom you succeed in op∣pression. And also you may read through the Scriptures, how the children of God, who were called of him, were hated and persecuted by the seed of Evil-doers, they slew the Prophets, and persecuted them that were sent unto them: David was a Scorn, and a Reproach, and a Hissing to his Enemies; and Job was mocked of his Friends, and counted a Mad-man; and many of the Servants of the Lord suffered cruel deaths under the Hands of the Oppressor: and they that were Sufferers, and were mocked, scorned, and persecuted, are our Example; and the Mockers and Persecutors are your example: Christ and the Apostles in their time were Sf∣ferers; and you may read how Herod and Pilate, and the Officers, and chief Priests caused Christ to suffer unjustly, by Imprisonments, and Scourgings, and Sufferings, and reviling, though no evil could be justly laid to his charge; and he is our Example in the like things, and as they did unto him, so you do unto us, as being of the same Seed, and th he aid: And Herod, and the cruel Officers, and chief Priests are your example, of whose seed you are brought forth, fulfilling their measure of wickedness and cruelty, in this your day and time, and oppressing the just with cruel bonds of iniquity. And you may read how the Apostles were persecuted through the whole Book of Acts, and put out of their Towns, and Stoned (some unto death) and were forbid to speak any more in the Name of Iesus, and were thought to be men not worthy to live upon the Earth, were called, Pestilent Fellows, and Movers of Sedition, and Turners of the World upside down; and these were our example, who had left their Callings, Countries, and Relations, and gave themselves to be spent for the Lord's sake, and declared against the false ministry, which preached for Hire, and Gifts, and Rewards; and against them that had the form of Godliness, but not the Power; and went in∣to the Idol Temples, and declared against them, and against their outward traditional worships: In these things and many more, we follow them as an Example, even as you follow the wicked in their cruelty and oppression, Nero, and Festus, and Caesar, and such like, who were E∣nemies unto God, as you are, and brought forth the same works as you do, being of the same nature, and following their example; so that now as ever, He who is born of the flesh persecutes him that is born after the Spirit: And the wisdom of this World is enmity against God, and cannot receive the things of God's Kingdom: Therefore repent, when you have read your example of wickedness, then read your example in the cursed end of wrath from the Lord God, which came upon the Persecutors of old, as it will come upon you. The Vengeance of God you cannot flee, his fierce Wrath will come upon you, and Weeping, and Howling, and Lamentation, and Misery will be your Portion. O tremble to think pon your ignorance; To what purpose have you made a profession of the Scriptures, who tifie those things, and those men which it plainly declares against; and condemns those practices and those men which it plainly witnesseth of? Repent, and take warning betime, before the De∣cree of the Lord of Host be sealed against you; for I have cleared my Conscience, in letting you see your own ignorance and blindness, ye Magistates and People: And thus you are left without excuse, whether you will hear or forbear. By one who is a Labourer in the Vineyard, who is not known to the World, though named of the World, EDWARD BURROUGH.
THE TRUE FAITH OF THE Gospel of Peace Contended for, in the Spirit of Meekness; and th Mystery of Salvation (Christ within the Hope of Glory) Vindicated in the Spirit of Love, Against the secret opposition of Iohn Bunyan a pro∣fessed Minister in Bedfordshire. Or, an Answer to his Book, called, Some Gospel Truths opened, &c. W in also he hath mixed many Lyes and Slanders, and hath secretly gainsayed the Way of Truth, and Doctrine of Salvation, under the account of Error and Heresie, as the Generation of chief Priests ever did. Or, A Return of Truth in simplicity, in the denial of his false Accusations, a his dark Vail of false Reproaches taken off, and the Innocency of the Up∣right appearing. With some Queries given forth for him to answer, that Truth may further app and Deceit may be ashamed, where ever it is found. READER, UNto whom this may come, especially you in Bedfordshire, for whose sake, chiefly, t sent forth, after the false Reproaches of a professed Minister among you, who hath  called himself in his Title, Unworthy, as is proved in this Return; wherein the  hearted may see, that I have not striven for Mastery, by multitude of words, nor many  Arguments, to obtain a name, but in simplicity of heart have born my Witness against  Lyes, and Vindicated the Truth as it is in Iesus; not in a curious mind, but in the simpli of the Gospel. And unto you that are honest, in any measure towards God, and towards  I leave this and his to be judged, with an impartial mind, and what is made manifest to be T let it be owned by you; and this is the end wherefore it is given forth, that Truth may be  braced, and Deceit condemned, and the Light of the World may be followed, which leads  eternal Life, and without which there is no Salvation. E. B. HOw long ye crafty Fowlers will ye prey upon the Innocent, and  at him secretly? How long shall the Righteous be a Prey to your tee ye subtil Foxes who seek to devour? The just One (against whom yo Bow is bent) cryes for Vengeance against you in the ears of the Lor yet you strengthen your hands in iniquity, and gird your selves with the zeal  Madness, and Fury; you think to swallow up the Harmless, and to blot out t Name of the Righteous, that his Generation may not be found on Earth: Y
shoot your Arrows of cruelty, even bitter words, and makes the Innocent your Mark to prey upon: You dispise the Way of Uprightness; and Simplicity, and the path of craft and subtilty you tread; your Dens are in Darkness, and your mischief is hatched upon your beds of secret whoredoms. When will you cease to grind the face of the Poor, and to oppress the Humble, upon whom you tread in your vain glories, and outward shews of Holiness, as though you were the bles∣sed People? And you are exalted above Innocency in your feigned Hypocrisie, and subtilty, and yet are found out with the searching Eye of the Lord, who knows your thoughts afar off to be wicked, and your purposes to be vain; and as with a Whirle-wind will he scatter you, and your name shall rot, and your memorial shall not be found; and the deeper you have digged the Pit for another, the greater will be your own fall, and the more miserable your desolation, which comes upon you suddenly, in a day you expect not: How are the Innocent, and he that is de∣parted from iniquity become the Table-talk of the Prophane, and the Song of Drunkards? And how are we become the study-work of the Wise, and of the Lear∣ned, and their subject of wicked doctrines: Surely the Diviner is gone mad, and the Wise-men are become Fools, and the heart of the Disobedient is set to do evil; but the Lord taketh our part against our Enemies, and therefore are we preserved, and our Enemies shall be confounded, and Lyars and Slanderers shall fall together, and the Innocency of the Innocent shall shine in its Beauty, and the vails of Re∣proaches, and Slanders, and false Accusations shall be clean removed in the day of our God; and for a moment we are willing to submit under the present suf∣fering, by slanderous tongues, that we may reign for ever. It is not unknown to many, how that in this day wherein the Lord hath made known his Power, to the gathering of his People, and to the bringing forth of his own Seed to inherit the Land of Peace; how that the powers of Darkness, and the strength of Hell is ri∣sen, and joyned in a body to make war against the Lord, and to prevent his pur∣pose; and men are sorely disquieted, and all is on an uproar, and to defend them∣selves they are come forth, to vindicate their interest in the region of Darkness do they appear; and because their Kingdom is deeply invaded with the face of a dead∣ly Enemy, therefore they have put on their strength, and fortified themselves, and shewed their strength and force under several colours; some in open Perse∣cution, Imprisonments, and Beatings, and cruel Oppressions, and some in Scorn∣ing, and Back-biting, and open Lying, and Slandering; and others appear in the Garments of deep dyed Hypocrisie, and Smite secretly, and Shoot in the Twi∣light, between Profession and Prophaness, and forge secret Slanders, and Lyes, and seek the Life of the just One: And thus poor desolate Zion is compassed about with Enemies, and they lay siege against her, to make her an utter destruction (How long Lord, how long? hear and consider.) And Iohn Bunyan, and his Fellow, who have joyned themselves to the broken Ar∣my of Magog. Now in the heat of the day of great striving are not the least of all guilty among their Bretheren, of secret smiting the Innocent, with secret Lyes and Slanders; who have shewed themselves in defence of the Dragon against the Lamb, in this day of war betwixt them: And though some of their Party, which have shewed themselves before in the open Field have come off with loss and shame, and disadvantage; yet needs must the rest appear till they have filled up their mea∣sure of wickedness, and so be made a perpetual curse for ever: and they must spend their strength till shame and confusion overtake them, and they be left with∣out hope or stay, in the ditch of deep perdition, never more to rise up a∣gain. Friends I have viewed your discourse, and numbred up part of your work, and this is the sume thereof, A corrupted Grain of little value of Babylons Treasure, and if a Merchant of your traffique gain it, he cannot be the richer, yet doth your King (the Prince of Darkness) accept your labour, and your substance; for had you been more learned in his subtilty, and more stockt in his craft, a larger por∣tion; and more to the purpose might have been brought in, but with such as you
had, or could procure, from your Neighbours are you come, and have gained a report, and a name in the record of Mischief against the Lamb, and his Followers, whom you have made your subject to treat Lyes upon. And for the sake of the Simple I have taken in hand to return a few words in an∣swer to you, in those things (at least) wherein you mention the Quakers; who be∣ing falsly accused, and slandered by you in many things; I am bound in the Law of Righteousness, as a Friend unto them, (at least) to vindicate their innocent Cause against your reproaches, which may be as a stumbling stone in the eye of the upright; & though I know not your faces, yet your spirit is tried & your generation is read at large, & your stature and countenance is clearly described to me; to be of the stock of Ishmael, and of the seed of ain, whose line reacheth unto the murthering Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees; & though you profess Christ in words without you, yet are you found Enemies to him revealed within his Saints (without which there can be no Salvation) and this I find the subject matter of your discourse, and the length of your tedious travel: I shall not transcribe your whole matter, only the heads of some particulars I shall draw into a sum, and write a few words thereunto, not in a large manner. And in the first Epistle have spoken something, As of God and man together, making up one Christ, who is the Saviour, &c. then thou shamelesly sayst, This is quite contrary to those commonly called Familists, Ranters, Quakers, and others, &c. Either deny Chris to be a real Man without them, blaspemously fancying him to be God manifest in their flesh; or else make his human Nature, with the fulness of the Godhead in it, to be but a type  God, to be manifest in the Saints, &c. 1 Answ. Here thou hast (as thy Fore-fathers, the chief Priests and Persecuto did) numbred the Innocent with Transgressors; Quakers with Ranters, between which there is no more union and likeness, then between Light and Darkness, good and evil; and thy secret subtilty more appears, and the wickedness of thy Slan∣der, because thou hast joyned in thy Accusation such who may be guilty with the Guiltless; for the Ranters I will not justifie, neither at present the Familists, except I better knew their Principles; nor any others will I vindicate, who are guilty  thy Accusation: Though thou art condemned for numbring the Innocent in thy Accusation, and falsly hast secretly slandered the Guiltless, who are free from thy Slanders herein: But yet further I say, If thou darest lay thy charge only upon the Quakers, write thy meaning in plainness, and bring testimony of thy accu∣sation, and thou mayst receive a further Answer; and cease to smite with secret Slanders in the dark, lest thou be condemned in the Light with the guilty, for numbring the Innocent with Transgressors, and charging the Guiltless with the Guilty. I dare not plead for Ranters, Quakers, and others, till they be sepa∣rated, lest I should justifie the Wicked and condemn the Righteous, but thy wick∣ed heart hath joyned them in accusation, that thy Slander may be covered, and some ground thou mayst have in appearance for thy wicked tongue, who hath hatched mischief against the Upright. And thy second Slander is like-unto the first, where thou again unjustly numbers the Quakers with some high-flown People, and sayest, These high-flown People are i this very like to Familists and Quakers, undervaluing the Lord Iesus Christ, God Man, and though they speak much of Christ, yet they do not savingly and rightly lay him for their Foun∣dation, &c. 2 Answ. The sum of this broken confusion is thus much, Two Slanders upon the Quakers undervaluing the Lord Jesus Christ, &c. and not laying him as a Foundation, &c. though thou wilt not through thy subtilty separate the Guilt∣less from them who may be guilty in thy Accusation, yet now must I in simplici∣ty, in my return to thee, and cannot but openly charge thee to be a secret Shoot∣er of Mischief against the Righteous: We prize the Lord Jesus Christ God Man to be precious unto us, and unto all that do believe, and have owned him alone to be the Foundation, whom God hath laid for Salvation unto the ends of the Earth, and in his Light are we saved, and therein do walk; and because hereof are we ha∣ted by thee; and the Generation of Hirelings, and false Prophets, who speak
much of Christ without you, but knows him not in you the hope of Glory, and take back to thee thy false Accusations, for thou art faln in the Pit which thou hast digged for another, a slanderous tongue dwells within thy house, and Christ Jesus the Saviour, of all that believe, is thy Condemner, who believes not, but art found a Lyar, and a false Witness, slandering unjustly, and by thy unbelief, and wickedness herein, undervalues Christ Jesus who is pure and holy, and is the Foun∣dation of Righteousness and Peace, and not of Wrath and works of Darkness, wherein thou art builded in thy works of Mischief. And for the rest of this first Epistle, I shall say little to it, only thus much is the mind of the Pen-mans spirit, secretly smiting at the Doctrine of true Faith and Salvation (to wit) Christ Jesus within, and directing altogether without, and afar off, and saying in his heart, who shall ascend, and who shall descend, and is not mindfull that the Word of Faith is in the Mouth, and in the heart, and thus much I say, if they be Reprobate who have not Christ in them, then is it the most profitable doctrine, and thing of greatest concernment to seek for him, and to find him within, seeing many can speak of him without, who are manifest Enemies to him in their hearts and works; and thus much to Iohn Burtons Epistle. Let him go learn what this means. The next thing that I shall mind is this, in the second Epistle, where a Question is asked, Who are the men that at this day are so deluded by the Quakers, and other per∣nitious Doctrines, but those who thought it enough to be Talkers of the Gospel, &c? This man appears to be of the same spirit with his Fellow, and will more abound in Lyes, in respect of the number, then he that went before; and the sum of this transcribed is, That the Quakers are Deluders, and thou hast joyned them with a Thief also, and numbred the guiltless with the guilty, and hast shot secretly in the dark, and far missed thy aim; for thy bare words are no true witness, and thou must not both slander, and be Witness thy self; though I perceive thou may have the witness of all that walks in the broad-way to evidence falsly for thee. And this is no new invented Lye, for it hath been ever; the Children of God were counted De∣ceivers, as in the Scripture we have a cloud of witnesses, and Christ Jesus our Lord was counted so by thy Generation; and as they did unto him, so must you do unto us, and must fulfil their measure of wickedness, as Christ hath said. Answ. And this is my Answer in full, That way which thou calst Heresie, and delusion, do we worship the God of our Fathers, and are not ashamed of the Reproaches for his Name sake. Then further thou sayest, They be such kind of people who at this day are car∣ried away with the Quakers, namely, loose Ranters, and light Notionists, and here and there a Legallist, which were shaking in their Principles, &c. Answ. The Substance of this is as much as the wise Scribes and Pharisees said concerning Christ, None believed in him, said they, but a company of poor people, which know not the Law, which were accursed; and doth any of the Rulers believe on him? Friend, though some of all sorts of people be brought to God, yet thou seemst to be offend∣ed herewith, that the wicked should be turned from his wickedness, which is no evidence against us, that we are Deceivers, but an evidence against thee, in thy wicked slander, who hath brought forth thy Lies without fear, as though thou shouldst never in this life be put to prove them, nor in the time to come shouldst ever answer for them. But the Ranters, and light Notionists, and Thee we do deny, in that state wherein they and you do stand, till you turn to the Lord by repentance; and whatever you have been in your profession or practice, if you turn from your iniquity; we dare not deny you. And whereas thou givest this Character of a Notionist, Such a one is puffed up in his fleshly mind, and advanceth himself above others, &c. This is thy own condition, and thou hast read thy own Character, who art pufft up in thy lies and slanders, and advancest thy self above the Innocent, who exceeds thee in faith towards God, and in good works towards men, and whose conversation is in Heaven; but thine is among the Hirelings, under the Marks of all the Deceivers of old, as may after∣wards appear.
Then thou goes on, and sets down some of the Lyes which thou sayest the Devil perswads those men to believe. And first, That Salvation was not fully and compleatly wrought out for sinners, by the ma Christ Iesus, &c. Answ. Friend, the Devil hath perswaded thee to believe Lyes, which is a degree higher, A Slander is more then a Lye. This Accusation is clearly false, wickedly cast upon us; for there is not salvation in any other, nor is it wrought by any other, but by Jesus Christ fully and compleatly it is brought forth by him unto every one that believes, who receives the Testimony of it in themselves; for if thou have no Testimony of it, but without thee, the Pope and his Idolaters have as much as thou, and may be more; take back to thee thy Lye again with shame and confusion. Then thou goes on, and sayst, This is another of his Lyes wherewith he deceives; bid∣ding them, follow the light that they brought into the World with them, telling them that this light will lead into the Kingdom, &c. Thou hast here mixed Truth and a Lye together, this is falsly laid down (The light that they brought into the world with them) but this is the Truth of God, and no Lye of the Devil, That to follow the Light of Christ Jesus, wherewith he hath lightned every man that comes into the world, and it will lead into the Kingdom of Peace and righteousness; for, saith Christ, I am the Light of the World, he that fol∣lows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life; and this is that which thou wouldst fain call the Lye of the Devil; and therefore to cover thy wicked∣ness and impudency, thou hast changed and mixed the terms of words, that thou mayest have a ground for thy Slander; but thou art seen and comprehended, and thy folly appears. Then thou sayest (we say) It will convince of Sin, Swearing, Lying, Stealing, &c. of Sins against the Law; and this thou makest a thing of little account, to be con∣victed of sins against the Law, by the Light of Christ; for there is nothing else that doth convince of sin. (mind that) And this Light thou seems to acknowledge every man hath, and this Light I do affirm to be the Light of Christ Jesus, and to bid People follow this; the Light of Christ to lead into the Kingdom can be no Lye of the Devil; for he which convinceth of sins against the Law leads up into the fulfil∣ling of the Law; and though thou and thy Generation would leap over the Law, yet must the righteousness of it in Judgment be fulfilled upon you, and by Christ Jesus in you, if ever you receive the Salvation to your Souls. Learn wht it means. Much more thou ramblest over, which I pass by, as being not pertinent to the thing in hand; but Fools love to be meddling, though little to the purpose, and as I have said, thy Maker will not blame thee, for thou hast brought in of thy chiefest substance, though it be but as Clay, and as Dirt (at least that of it which is against the Quakers;) and the substance of many Pages following is this that I have gathered, denying (or at least opposing) Christ revealed within, and in opposition to this quotes many Scriptures, of what he did in his own Person, which Scriptures I own, and the Truth which they bear witness of; yet must we be witness, that without the Revelation of Christ within there is no Salvation: Howe∣ver, so much is or may be spoken of him without, as the Pope can do as well as thou, yet are you found to be one Generation, persecuting the Life under the zel of profession of the words. Then the next thing that I mind, is a Question which thou hast asked thy∣self. Do not the Scriptures make mention of Christ within, &c? And I shall ask further, Doth not the Scripture witness that all who have not Christ within, are Reprobates? But thou hast proved deceitful in answering thy self, and shuffled, and I may much fear thou wilt not be faithful in answering mine, however it rests upon thee to answer it, or to stop thy mouth. Then the next thing is thou sayest, This design of deceiving, the Devil carries o, by pretending if they follow what is made known to them from the Light within.
Answ. I observe all thy whole purpose is a secret smiting against the Light within, which Christ hath given to every man; and thy whole work is to render his ight odious. But this I further answer. The design of the Devil in deceiving souls, is thy own, and I turn it back to thee, but this is truth as it is in Jesus. He that comes to eternal Life must follow and walk in what is made known by the Light of Christ within. And thou sayest, Beg of God to convince thee by his holy Spirit, &c. And thus thou utterest thy confusion, sometime treating for it, and sometime against it, secretly smiting the Just, mixing the Truth with Lyes, that thereby thy Slanders may be covered, and thy deceit hid. The rest of thy Epistle I pass by, being from the same spirit which thy Lyes are from; and thy Lying Spirit the Children of God cannot own, and therefore must needs deny that which proceeds from it. And thus much in answer to thy Epistle. Sixteen of thy first Pages are filled with this (to wit) proving that there is a Christ, and that he was promised, and that he was waited for, and expected, &c. To all this I shall say nothing, except thou hadst proved it in opposition to some body; for what is Truth I own by the Spirit of the Lord, as it is Truth in Christ; but as it comes from thy lying spirit, I do not so well own it; I own the words, and I de∣ny thy voice, and this is my Answer. Only I find thee wresting some Scriptures, whether through subtilty, or for want of wit, I shall not judge, especially this hast thou encreased, Revel. 13. 8. and faisly sayst, The Blood of Christ was shed before the World was; and it is, Since the Foundation of the World; betwixt which is great difference, the one being a very Lye, and the other very Truth. Then thou goest on proving, That he is the Saviour that was born of Mary, &c. which thing we never denied, and therefore I need the less to answer thee, except thou hadst spoken it in opposition to us, which I find thee not altogether, un∣til the thirty seventh Page, where thou again secretly smitest, in mixing some Truth with thy Lye. And thou sayest, How horribly are those deceived, who look on Iesus to be but a Sha∣dow or Type? This is thy Lye, I know not any who do it, and yet thou sayest, Of something that was afterwards to be revealed, &c. Answ. This hath some truth in it, which is this, The same Christ which was born of Mary, which wrought Righteousness in his Person, by doing, and suf∣fering; which was & is the Substance, was afterwards revealed in the Saints: And this is no horrible deceit, to witness Christ revealed, or to wait for him to be revealed within. Then thou sayest, When he was come, then was an end put to the Law, &c. And here I ask a Question, Did Christ Jesus put an end to the Law for them who yet live in the transgression of the Law? or doth be justifie that which the Law con∣demneth before the work of the Law be finished? What is the meaning of the Scripture, Not one tittle shall fail, till all be fulfilled? What assurance have any that it is fulfilled for them, who are yet transgressors of it in themselves? An An∣swer to this may satisfie the simple. Then thou goest on and sayst, How are they deceived that think to obtain Salvation by following the convictions of the Law, which they call Christ, &c? Answ. Here thou confessest the Law convinceth, then it is not put to an end, or fulfilled, or taken away, because it yet works; and it is no deceit to mind that which doth convince of sin, to lead to Christ, to take sin away; for the Scrip∣ture saith, The Law is a School-Master, to bring to Christ; but thou art in the de∣ceived state, who healest up falsly, and daubest with untempered Morter, and wouldst teach People to apply the Promises unto Salvation, while they are in a con∣dition of damnation, condemned in the sight of God by the Light in their own Consciences, nor will not own that which discovers sin; and how then can they own him that takes it away, and purges from it by his Blood? which thou sayest is
done, but hast no more witness of it, by the fruit of ceasing to commit sin, then the Pope hath, who lives in your sin; then how is it taken away? Then thou sayest with an impudent Tongue, Its not of works, least any man should boast, as these fond Hypocrites called Quakers would do. Answ. Thou Slanderer, When didst thou hear any of the Quakers boast, or see them live in Hypocrisie: God shall judge thee thou deceitful heart; but further I answer by a Query, Will that faith which is without works justifie? And must not every one receive according to their deeds; he that doth good, Life, he that doth evil, Condemnation? but such is thy faigned fancy of Faith, who seekest to be justified by it, whilst thou bringest forth the fruits of unbelief. Then thou speakest of living by Faith, which as thou sayest, Is to apply the Lord Iesus Christ, his Benefits, as Birth &c. I say, if to talk of him was Faith in him, and to live by his Faith, then few would want him; for many have gotten the words which are without the Life of Righteousness through Faith, and to live by Faith; says not who shall ascend or descend to fetch Christ for Salvation; neither doth it say, When shall he come from afar ot save his People, but Faith speaks thus, What saith the word of the Gospel, which is within the heart, as thou mayst read in the Scripture of Truth; hadst thou but an ear to hear, but thou sayest, Lo here, and Lo there, false Prophet like. Then thou sayst further, How are they deceived who own Christ no otherwise then as he was before the World began, &c? Answ. Here thou hast discovered thy self more plainly, Did not the Saints own Christ Jesus the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, for Salvation; and is there any other Christ then he who was before Abraham was, and is he not now glorified with the same glory, (mind the same Glory) which he had with the Fa∣ther before the World was, according as he prayed? is this deceit, or is it thy grievous ignorance to call it so, to own him as he was before the World was for Salvation? thou ignorant man, that was the very Christ the Son of God, who was equal with the Father, which was in the beginning, and in time was mani∣fest in Bethelem, and calls himself the Light of the World; thou hadst better have said nothing, then by multitude of words to lay open thy shame: Friend that spiritual Rock whcih the Fathers did eat and drink of, which followed them, that Rock was Christ the Salvation. The next thing that I take notice of, is thy exposition upon that Scripture Iob. 4. 3. And thou sayest this is the meaning, Every Spirit that doth not confess that th Christ that was with the Father before the World was, did in the appointed time of the Fa∣ther come into the World, took upon him a Body, and was very Man, as well as very God, &c. Answ. If every spirit be of God which doth in words confess this, then is not the Pope himself antichrist, seeing he confesses as much of this (it may be more then thou dost) neither canst thou justly condemn us for denying this; for we do confess it with our hearts, and not only with our mouthes, as thou and the Pope doth. But Friend, Is every one saved that saith, Lord, Lord? nay, it is only he that doth the will of the Father, and who in many Nations do not con∣fess this to be true, and yet there are but few in all Nations in the Way to Life, that shall be saved by Christ Jesus; and it is not much better nor more accepted to confess Christ in words to be come, and yet in works to deny him, then it is both in words and in works to deny him; the one is wicked in Prophaness, the other is wicked in Hypocrisie; the one is a Lyar, the other is a false Wit∣ness, and whether of these are most vile, let them who are spiritual judge. Then thou exhortest, To receive no Christ except God's Christ, &c. To this I say, The Christ of God is a Mystery not known to the World, and this is he which was in the beginning, whom God gave into the World, to be the Light and Saviour thereof, even he is God's Salvation unto the ends of the Earth; and unto him he is Light, and shall be Salvation and Redmeption where his Person
never came; and yet it cannot be said, Here is the Place where the Son of God is not. Let him that reads understand. Then thy next thing is, proving many things concerning Christ, which I pass by as not having any thing therein against the Quakers, only in one particular, where thou numbers again them with the Ranters, so that I pass by also, lest thou should say I justifie the Ranters, and do rather choose to let the Innocent lie under the suf∣fering of thy reproach, whose innocency will appear when thy black vail of Lyes is taken away. Then the next thing I mind is, where thou seems to reprove the Quakers for wresting the Scripture, Iohn 1. 9. whereby thou sayest, They split themselves, and endeavour to split others, &c. Answ. Wresting is thy own, and not ours, for we take the Scripture in plain words, without adding or diminishing, as our enemies shall witness for us. Then how wickedly dost thou say we wrest it, when we neither add nor diminish. But thy folly must appear by thy much meddling. And then thou takest in hand to speak to the thing, and thus thou sayst; Every man, as he comes into the World, receives a light from Christ, as he is God, &c. Answ. What less hast thou said then we, except thou wilt say, he hath not lighted man as he is Christ, and so divide the Father, and the Son, which is error; for what the Father doth, the Son doth also, and they are equal in power and ope∣ration, and cannot be divided. Then thou sayst, This Light is Conscience, that some call Christ, though falsly. Answ. Them I leave for thee to reprove, and do deny them, and thee together; if thou hast not falsly made a Lye of some Body, and told thy own Lye, through the wresting of their words, let the Light in thy Conscience judge. Then thou sayest, This Light will shew a man there is a God, and will discover the eternal God by his works, and it will reprove of sin, and make sin manifest, and by it the un∣regenerate man is able to know the sins against the Law are sins against God, &c. Answ. Also this will the Light of Christ do, wherewith he hath enlightened every man to Salvation, or condemnation, even that Light of which we declare: so that thou hast said no less hitherto, then we in this particular and the Scriptures say. They saw the Eternal Power and Godhead, by that which was made mani∣fest of God in them, (mind, in them) which once they knew of God, but turned from it; and the Scripture saith, That which reproves of sin is the gift of the Spirit of God, John 16. and also the Scripture saith, That which makes manifest sin is Light, and whatsoever is reproved is made manifest by the Light, even the true Light the Apostle speaks of, Ephes. And the sum of all this which thou wouldst reprove in us, is no more then the Scriptures bare witness of, and which thy self hath uttered and confessed. And Friend, dost thou know this Light that is given of Christ and God, unto every man, is sufficient in it self for Life and Salvation unto every one that be∣lieves? if thou say it is not, wherein is the blame, in God, or in this Light, or in the Creature? shew if thou canst. Then thou again sayst, This light surely is that wherewith Christ, as he is God, hath enlightned every one that comes unto the Word which doth convince of sin. Answ. Thus far thou art forced to confess Truth, (I think against thy mind) and thus far in words only we agree as in this particular; then why dost thou say, By wresting that Scripture, John 1. 9. we split our selves, and endeavour to split others, seeing thou thy self hast confessed no less then thou callst wresting in us. I reckon up thy confusion, and leave it for thee to read, and them to whom this may come. Then thou sayst, The neglect of this (Light) will be sure to damn, though the obedience to the Law will not save them, &c. Answ. Here again thou hast confessed truth. If the neglect of the Light will be sure to damn, as thou confessest; then I say, surely it is not good to neglect it, that must needs follow, deny it if thou canst; therefore the sum of thy words is the same with us, that every one mind the Light of Christ Jesus, least they be
damned for the neglect of it. And Friend, to the second part of the clause, I say, the Law must be obeyed, and the righteousness of it fulfilled within thee, if ever thou come to Eternal Life; if it be not, thou cannot escape damnation. Learn what this means, Then further thou sayst, Though Christ doth give a Light to every one that comes into the World; yet it doth not therefore follow, that this Conscience (or Light) is the Spirit of Christ, or the work of Grace wrought in the heart, &c. Here thy confusion is seen at large, who wouldst seem to divide between the Light of Christ, which thou confessest is given to every man, and the Spirit of Christ, and the Grace of God. However thus far I say, the Light of Christ given to every man, is not contrary to the Spirit of Christ, nor to the Grace of God, but one in their nature; and a man cannot possibly love one of them, and hate ano∣ther; neither can any obey one of these, and disobey the other; therefore are they one in the union, leading in the same way unto the same end. And where doth the Spirit of Christ give light, or the Grace of God work, or lead, if not in the Conscience? And can there be any surer thing for the Creature to look to, to walk to Life, or to come to God by, then the Light of Christ in the Conscience, which thou confessest every man hath that cometh into the World? Then thou sayst, Heathens, Turks, Iews, Athiest, &c. have that that doth convince them of sin, yet are so far from having the Spirit of Christ in them, that they delight to serve their lust, &c. Answ. This Query I ask of thee, Do they or thou, or any man serve sin or your lusts, because Christ hath not given you light to discover your sin, or because you hate that Light that is given? answer me. And surely by this which doth convince of sin, is every man in the world inexcusable, so it works for God in all men, either to justifie or condemn. And tell me, is not the Spirit or Light of Christ the only thing which doth convince of sin? Or doth any thing convince of sin contrary, or besides, or without the Spirit of Christ? if nay, then it must needs be that it is from, or by, or something of the nature of the Spirit of Christ, which is in the Heathens. And the sum of thy doctrine is no less in the profession of thy words, then what we say; then why dost thou condemn us? But it seems thy tongue speaks one thing, and another thing is in thy heart, and this is Hypocrisie. Then thou sayest, Those that are alive to sin have not the Spirit of Christ, &c. But I say it is given to every man, though every man receives it not; and it strives with the wicked man, though he follows it not. And some other vain Arguments thou usest to prove, That every man hath not the Spirit of Christ, which I pass by; only thus much I leave with thee, till thou provest the Light of Christ (which thou confessest every may hath) to be contrary to the Spirit of Christ; I shall say every man hath that which is one in union, and like the Spirit of Christ, even as good as the Spirit of Christ, according to its measure. Then thou goest on, and sayest, That the Devil might be sure to deceive (or to that purpose) he saith, Turn thy mind inward, and listen within, and see if there be not that within thee that doth convince of sin, &c. Answ. Thou hast confessed that the Light within which convinces of sin is the Light of God and Christ; and now thou sayest, the Divil, to deceive souls, bids turn to mind the Light within, which doth convince of sin; thou hast, lyed of the Devil: Oh thou blind Priest! whom God hath confounded in thy language; Was ever such a thing spoken, That the Devil can deceive any by the Light of Christ, or that he uses any such doctrine. Friend it is the Voice of the Gospel to bid listen within to the Light, even to the Word of Faith, within the heart, as Paul preached. But thou further sayst, They are ignorant of the Gospel, who clasp in with these Mo∣tions of the Light within, (or Conscience) which doth command to abstain from the evil, and to practice good. And here thou hast shewed thy blindness and ignorance, more then can be ut∣tered,
as though the motions of the Light of Christ in the Conscience, which command to abstain from evil, and to practice good, were another thing then the Light of the Gospel: what, and how doth the Light of the Gospel work, if not in the Conscience, and to command from evil, and to practice good? Surely thou preachest another Gospel then Paul preached: for his Doctrine was, Abstain from all evil, and follow that which is good, and listen to the word within in the heart; but this Gospel thou deniest, and so must needst preach another Gospel, and so art the accursed, as Paul saith. Then thou sayst, Thus the poor Soul is most horribly carried away head-long, &c. into the belly of Hell, &c. thus much is the sum, by turning the mind within, to the Light which doth convince of sin, and listning thereto, and clapsing with the motions in the Conscience which do command to abstain from evil, and to practice good, and closing with something within (which thou hast confessed is the Light of Christ) hereby, or thus is the poor Soul carried headlong, and at the end of its life doth fall into the belly of Hell, as thou sayst. Let shame cover thee, if thy heart be not altogether hardned; was ever such Doctrine preached? surely, malice hath carried thee out of sence, else thou wouldst not have uttered these things, but it is answer enough to reckon thy con∣fusion up into a sum, and I leave it to every honest heart to read, and judge thereof. Then thou further sayst, The Devil counterfeits the works of Grace, and makes the Soul believe, if it will be led by what is made known unto it, by the Light or Conscience with∣in, it shall do well. Answ. Wo unto thee that callst good evil, and evil good; Art thou not ashamed to utter thy mind so wickedly, and impudently? doth the Light of Christ within deceive? or is not this Christs Doctrine, I am the Light of the World, he that fol∣lows me shall have the Light of Life; and he that walks in the Light stumbles not? and this shamelesly hast thou called the Doctrine of the Devil; but if ever thou knowst God it must be by following, and by being led with the Light within, which God hath made known unto thee, else the Light is thy condemnation eternally. Then thou sayst, The Devil counterfeits the new birth, by perswading it is wrought by following the Light of the World, &c. Answ. This Doctrine is as wicked as the former, and from as lying a spirit; but answer me, By what is the New-birth wrought? and how, if not by following the Light of Christ in the Conscience? is there any other way to God but Christ Jesus, who hath lighted every man that comes into the World? and whereas thou beginst to scorn, in thy vain mind, at living upon Bread and Water, and wear∣ing no Hatbands, and not speaking except the Spirit moves, &c. The Scorner and the Lyar go together, the Lord rebuke thee thou false deceitfull heart, and lying tongue; it grieves thy lust to know any to live upon bread and water, and it tor∣ments thy pride, that any should forsake their pride; and it is easily known of what spirit thou art, and that thou goest on in thy own will, before God leads thee, and scornst to wait till the Spirit of God moves upon thee, or scornst them that do wait; but thou runst, and art not sent, like unto thy Fore-fathers; and therefore thou dost not profit people at all. Then thou accusest us of sad Blasphemies, and horrible Doctrines, but namest no∣thing, and so slanderst without witness; and take back thy own words, for they belong to thee, as is sufficiently proved in this Answer to thy Book, let the wise in heart judge: And thou hast said, Thou wonderst, that the ground do not open and swal∣low us up, or else the Devil fetch us away alive, &c. And this most fully discovers thy spirit to be without the fear of God in any measure, who utterst such wicked Lan∣guage, for which thou hast no example among all the Children of God; and is not this horrible Doctrine, and little less then sad Blasphemies? It is answer suf∣ficient to gather up thy confusion, and send it thee to read; if there be any honesty in thy heart, repent, and cease thy wickedness, lest God smite thee with a Curse, and make thee an Example of Destruction. Then thou goest on, and hast asked thy self a Question; Is it not the Spirit of Christ that doth make manifest, or convince of Sin? The Question is good, but thou
hast consounded it in thy Answer, and not answered plainly, but hast covered Truth under the vail of thy many words: Thou sayst, There are two things that do make manifest, and convince of Sin; first, the Law; and secondly, the Spirit of Christ. I query further, Doth any thing convince of sin contrary to the Spirit of Christ? if not, then that which doth convince of sin is like unto, or one in the Union, or something as good in its Nature as the Spirit of Christ; and thou instancest in Iudas, whom thou sayst was convinced of sin by the Law, without the Spirit of Christ; to which I say, the Law of God is spiritual, and is not contrary, but one with the Spirit of Christ in its union, (at least) and that which let him see Christ to be innocent, was not words, syllables without him, but must needs be within him; so if I should say the Spirit of Christ was not in him, yet was the Work of the righteous Law of God written in his heart, which is spiritual, and Christ Je∣sus was not without his own testimony in Iudas, which is Light, by which Iudas was, and is condemned eternally; And though Iudas was at the same time posses∣sed of the Devil, as thou sayest, yet there was that within him also, which disquieted, and tormented the Devil, which discovered the Devil with his works, by which he saw his murderous mind, and the Blood of the Just One, I say; it needs must be contrary to the Devil, and to his works, which condemned him; I call it the Light of God, which is spiritual, call it what thou canst. Then thou goest on, and seems to shew a difference betwixt being convinced by the Law without the Spirit of Christ, and the convincement by the Spirit of Christ, but art confounded in thy discourse. I say the power of the Law of God is spiritual, and though thou make a little thing of it to be convinced by the Law, of sins against the Law, yet I make it a thing of weight; And this is the condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and men love darkness rather then Light, because their deeds are evil; and the Law is Light, as saith the Scripture; and Christ is come to discover and reprove sin; and I put thee to prove in all the Scripture where any such thing ever was distinguished, as something to convince of sin, without, and besides, or contrary to the Spirit of God; and till thou provest it, thus far I have answered thee concerning it. Then thou sayst, Though some say, they are not only convinced of Sin, but have gotten some power over it, to abstain from those things forbidden in the Law; yet thou further sayst, This may be done as those blind Pharisees, called Quakers, think they do, and be but natural men, &c. Answ. Thou perverter of the right Way of God; how long wilt thou go on in thy uncleanness, uttering thy wrath against the Simple? It seems, to get power over sin, and to abstain from those things forbidden in the Law is a thing of no value with thee; but is it not further then thou ever camest? let that of God in thy Con∣science judge and answer, and shew me if ever any natural man did it through∣out the Scripture: And as for the Pharisee, it is thy own, I return it to thee again; thou art called of men Master, and hast the chief Seat in the Assembly, and standst praying in the Synagogues, as they did in Christs time. Friend, how fain wouldst thou clear thy self to make others guilty; but the guilt stands at thy door, and rests upon thy own head, and I rather chuse to be of that profession which ab∣stains from those things forbidden in the Law, and to have power over sin, then to live in the transgression of the Law, and under the power of sin: Yet talking of belief in the Son of Mary, whose Name (Mary) I may have ground to judge thou worshipst as the Papists do; and the same I say, much as Paul did, The uncir∣cumcision of such who keep the Law, shall condemn thee, in thy false faith, who breakst the Law. Then thou again confessest, That Christ, as God, hath enlightened every man that comes into the World with the Law which doth convince of Sin; but to this I have spoken, so shall pass it, only mind the Scripture which thy self hast quoted, The Law is Light, then the Light is the Law, and gives the knowledge of sin. Then thou sayst, If the Spirit of Christ convince thee of Sin, then it convinces of more Sins then against the Law. And to this I say, It seem there is some sin, against which there
is no Law, by thy confused Story, or that the Law is not against all sin: Friend, shew, if thou canst, any sin which is not against the Law; if thou canst not, Repent, and cease thy confusion. Then thou speakst against self-righteousness, but hast forgotten to reprove thy self, of thy Lying, and Slandering, and false Accusing; and it is thou that preach∣est another Gospel then the Apostle preached; he directed every one to the Word within, in the heart, and turned to the Light within, from darkness; but thou di∣rects altogether to a thing without, dispising the Light within, and worshipping the Name (Mary) in thy imaginations, and knowst not him who was before the World was, in whom alone is Salvation, and in no other. Then thou sayest, The Light convinceth of Sins, but of no other then Sins against the Law; as though there were some sins which were not against the Law; but to that I have spoken. And thou sayst, It doth not shew the Soul a Saviour, or Deliverer, &c. Answ. Thou art here in a Lye, for the Light which comes from Christ doth ma∣nifest a Saviour, and Deliverer, and nothing else; for if the Light of Christ doth not shew Christ, what then can, unto every one that walk in the Light? Then the next thing thou provest is, That God only is our Saviour, there is none beside him, &c. But how contrary is this to that in page 42. where thou sayest, They are wickedly deluded, who own Christ no otherwise, but as he was before the World was, for Sal∣vation: For if God be the Saviour, and there is none beside him, then it is no de∣lusion to own him as he was before the World was; and thus I sum up thy confusi∣on and contradictions, and leave them for thee to read. The next thing I observe is, where thou art proving the Resurrection, and slander∣est the Quakers with making light of it; but yet again wickedly numbring them with other Infidels, that thou mightst have a cover for thy slander; but I put thee to prove, where they made light of the Resurrection; or else prove thy self a Lyar in the sight of all Just men; thou secretly slanderest, but proves nothing. Then thou hast raised a Query from Ephes. 4. 10. but hast not answered it; though many words thou hast uttered, yet little to the purpose; and I return thee the same query again to answer; and many other things, and Arguments thou hast made, to which I shall say little, only mind thee of thy carnal sottishness, who speakst of Christ to be four or five foot long; let shame cover thy Lips, thou blind Sot; when didst thou see Christ in that length? hast thou not here spoken of that which thou knowst not, and art a busy body intruding into things, whereof thou art ignorant, but Fools love to be medling, to manifest their own folly, among whom thou art; and much more stuff, which I pass by, as not worth naming; only thy malice is against the Kingdom of Heaven within, and utters thy carnal sensual knowledge of the things of God, which thy imaginations shall never know. The next thing I observe is, where thou reckonst the Quakers to be the false Prophets which Christ speaks of, which shall be before his coming, and to be the Scoffers which walks after their own hearts lust which Peter speaks of. Answ. To which I answer; those false Prophets which Christ spake of, came in, in the dayes of Iohn; For, saith he, by this we know that it is the last time; for now are there many Antichrists; and this was before a Quaker was heard of; And if we should diligently search, we should find thee in their steps, through feigned words, through coveteousness, making Merchandise of Souls, loving the wages of unrighteousness, and such were the Scoffers, which Peeer speaks of, among whom thou art found, in thy practice, among them who are preaching for hire, & love the error of Balaam, who took gifts and rewards; and Christ hath said, we shall know you by your Fruits; and the same Fruits that ever were brought forth among the false Prophets of old, grow among you in many things I could instance; but he is wholly blind that sees you not. Before thou wast accusing us of drinking water, and now thou accusest us of walking after our own lusts; but such is thy confusion, thy wrath overcomes sense. Then thou speaks of some who told thee to thy face, thou usedst conjuration and witchcraft, because what thou preachedst was according to Scriptures, &c. To which I say, Let the guilty be reproved, for we deny thy Accusation to be
true upon any of the Quakers, which some may think thou speakst of; so thy Accusation rests between thee and them, and we are clear; for every Truth which the Scriptures bear witness of, we do own, and do not condemn any for preaching according to the Scriptures. Then the next thing I observe, is thy crying so loud against Christ within, which indeed is the only thing, without which there is no Salvation; for, Except Christ be in you, you are Reprobates. And this also I observe from thee, as having traced thy path unto the end, and numbred thy work into a total sum, which is a secret smiting and obscure shoot∣ing against the Manifestation or Belief of Christ within, which there can be no Salvation without, as I have proved; and in words only I find thee exalting Christ without, and worshipping the name of (Mary) like the Pope, I have good ground so to judge. And whereas thou callest the Doctrine of Christ within false Opinions, and take in hand to discover it, as in Page 203. I say to all honest men, who have but any knowledge of the Letter of the Scripture, thou art hereby sufficiently discovered, who callst the chief thing, which is the chief unto Salvation, and without which can be none, false Opinions; God shall judge thee, thou wicked heart; and much more I need not say, but shall leave this to the view of any that are honest to judge; so have gone through thy Book, and passed by many things; only I have spoken to that in which thou hast treated any thing upon us; and the Truth I have cleared from many Lyes and Slanders, and thy Vail of false Reproaches is rent, and our Innocency doth partly appear, and thy vail of Hypocrisie is a little removed, and thy deceitfull heart weighed and seen: And as for the rest of thy Book whicg I have not medled with, thus much I say of it, I suppose you will confess it was all given forth by one spirit, and it is proved some of it is given forth by a lying spirit; then let the Reader judge what the rest of it can be; though the words be true, yet is thy spirit false, and at the best, what thou hast said, is but bearing false witness (as to thy self) of a true thing; I own the words, and I deny the voice; and here I deal plainly with thee. Thou then askst a Question; Doth not the Scripture speak of Christ within? unto which I further add, answer it as thou canst. Doth not the Scripture say, Christ is within except you be Reprobates? And is not this thus much; all are reprobate but they in whom Christ is within? Answer i plainness, and darken not knowledge by words without wisdom. And towards the end I find thee making up the sum of thy wickedness with this, numbring the Quakers with Ranters, Sin, Death, and the Devil: I will not bring a railing Accu∣sation against thee; but the Lord rebuke thee thou unclean spirit, who hast falsly accused the Innocent to clear thy self from guilt; but at thy door guilt lodges, and I leave it with thee; clear thy self if thou art able. And thy wicked Reproaches we patiently bear, till the Lord appear for us: and we are not greater then our Lord, who was said to have a Devil by thy Generation; and their measure of wickedness thou fulfils, and art one of the Dragons Army, against the Lamb and his Followers; and thy Weapons are Slanders, and thy Refuge is Lyes, and thy work is confused, and hath hardly gained a name in Babylons Record; and by us (so much of it at least as is against us) is cast by as our spoiled prey, and trampled upon in all thy reproachfull speeches, who art unclean, and of more price to us is thy hatred and envy, then thy love can be, except the gund were better in which you stand. Now a few words I may write in Answer to the Queries in the end of thy Book, which thou directst thus Some Questions to the Quakers, or a few Queries to those possessed with a Spirit of delusion in this Generation. Question 1. If (sayst thou) that every man hath a measure of the Spirit of Christ within him; why say the Scriptures, That some are sensual, having not the Spirit, a Christ saith, The World cannot receive it? John 14. Answ. Some men are sensual, and have not the Spirit, because they received it
not, & some cannot receive it, because they believe not in him from whence it comes, yet is the measure of the Spirit given unto every man to profit withal, as the Scripture saith. And it is given to within him, to reprove him of sin, but few do receive it; and when thou canst learn to distinguish between a thing being gi∣ven, and a receiving of such a thing, then thou mayst be answered in thy self. It is one thing in God to give the Spirit, and another thing in the Creature to re∣ceive it: He gives it to many that receive it not, to follow it and to be guided by it: thus far I answer, and let them that are led with a spirit of Delusion answer thee further. Qu. 2. What is the Church of God redeemed by, from under the Law; is it by some∣thing that is done within them, or by something done without them? If it be redeemed by something that worketh in them, then why did the man Christ Iesus hang upon the Cross in Mount Calvery, without the Gates of Jerusalem, for the sins of his People, and why do the Scriptures say, That through this man is preached unto us forgiveness of sins? &c. Answ. The Church of God is redeemed by Christ Jesus, which is revealed within all that believe; and Christ Jesus wrought in them mightily, and it was he that wrought in them to will and to do; this is plain according to Scripture. And the man Christ Jesus was hanged upon the Cross on Mount Calvery, because they wickedly judged him to be a Blasphemer, and through their envy persecuted him to death, because he bore witness against them; and as in their account he died, and hanged upon the Cross for an Evil-doer, and this is one ground (at least) why he hanged upon the Cross; and the Scriptures say, That through this man is prea∣ched the forgiveness of sins, because there is no other that can forgive sin, nor the blood of any other thing that can take away sin; but the Blood of God, as it is written. And thus far I answer: If thou wilt have more, seek it from them who are led with a spirit of Delusion. Qu. 3. What Scripture have you to prove that Christ is, or was crucified within you, ri∣sen within you, ascended within you? Answ. There is no Scriptures that mention any one of our particular names; and thy Query is raised from thy mis-understanding of us, so I judge; but Christ is within us, that we dare not deny; and he is the Lamb that was slain in the streets of the great City, which is spiritually called Sodom and Aegypt, (mind spiritual∣ly) and he is now risen, and ascended, this we know through Faith in his Name: And I leave thee to receive a fuller Answer from them that are led with a spirit of Delusion (if they will give it thee.) Qu. 4. Is that very man that was crucified on Mount Calvery, between two Thieves, whose Name is Iesus, the Son of Mary, is he the very Christ of God, ye or nay? Answ. Yea, he is the very Christ of God, which was before the World was, by whom the World was made, who was made manifest from Mary's womb, and was persecuted to death by the Scribes and Pharisees, in whose steps thou treadst, in asking subtil Queries to insnare the Innocent, as they did; read thy Example, and thy self to be an Enemy to the Christ of God. Qu. 5. Is that very Man, with that very Body, within you, yea or nay? Answ. The very Christ of God is within us, we dare not deny him; and we are Members of his Body, and of his Flesh, and of his Bone, as the Ephesians were: They that are led by a spirit of Delusion shall answer the rest of this thy Query, if they will. Qu. 6. Was that very Iesus that was born of the Virgin Mary, a real man of Flesh and Bones, after his Resurrection from the dead, out of Josephs Sepulchre, ye or nay? for the Scrpiture saith he was, and if so, then did that Man go away from his Disciples, and not into them in his Body, as the Scriptures declare? or did he with that Body of Flesh go into his Disciples, as some fond Dreamers think? Answ. What the Scriptures speak of Christ we own to be truth, and own him to be what the Scriptures speak of him, and all mens imaginations of him we deny,
and their fals interpretations of the Scriptures concerning him; and let the fond Dreamers who are in their thoughts be reproved; for we dare own nothing to be truth but what the Spirit of the Lord bear witness of according to the Scripture, thus far I anwer in behalf of the Quakers; let them who are led with the spirit of Delusion answer the rest which concerns themselves. Qu. 7. Hath that Christ that was with God the Father before the World was, no other Body but his Church, if you say no, as it is your wonted course? Then again I aske you, What was that in which he did bear the sins of his Chrildren; if you say it was his own Body on the Tree, then I ask you, whether that Body in which he did bear our sins, was, or is the Church of God, yea, or nay? Again if you say he hath no Body but his Church, then I ask, what that was that was taken down from the Cross, &c? Answ. In this thou hast not only queried, but Slandered; therefore first thy Slander I do remove, It is not our wonted course to say, that Christ hath no other Body but his Church; thou art herein as in other things, a false Accuser, but we say the Church is Christ's Body: And it is sufficient for Salvation to know Christ Jesus to be head in us, and over us, and our selves to be Members of his Body, and what thou intendst by making so many foldings in one Query; it may be judged is to insnare, and in that thou answerest thy self for us in somthing, that thou mayst have a further ground to lay a deeper snare; we do deny thee, and thy spirit, and see thee to be only feeding in thy imaginations upon the report of things without the Life, and thy religion stands in disputes, and controversies, and querying, and many words; but our Religion stands in the exercise of a pure Conscience towards God and towards man, whether we speak or be silent Thus I have answered thy Queries, or so much of them as concerns us; and as I have said, if thou wilt be further answered, go seek an Answer from them who are led with a spirit of Delusion, and let them answer their part, or else be thou unsatisfied; for I shall not answer them to satisfie thee, nor I may not feed thy Serpents wisdom, nor subtilty, which cannot receive of the things of God, not understand a reason of the Hope of Christ in us, if we declare it to thee: For all throughout thy Book I do observe it is that which thou strikest against, even Christ within, which is our Hope of Glory: And it is that Mystery which long hath been hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifest and declared. And though the wise of the World cannot receive it, but speak evil against it, yet is it dear unto us, and so much more precious, because despised by such as thee, and thy Generation. And such things are a testimony to us, and against you; and go thou with them that are led with a spirit of Delusion, for you are one in Nature, and the Children of God, who are redeemed, cannot but deny you together. Some few Queries propounded for John Bunyan to answer. Query 1. Whether is any man justified by Christ Jesus in the sight of God, but he that follows Christ? and is it not a work to follow him, yea, or nay? and what is the sight of God? Qu. 2. Whether will that Faith justifie a man which hath no works, seeing the Apostle saith, Faith without works is dead? and what is that which works Faith, and where is it, within or without? Qu. 3. Whether any man is justified, but he who is born of God, and whether doth he that is born of God commit sin; and is that within the Creature, or without him, which works the new Birth? Qu. 4. If Christ hath lightened all men as he is God (as thou confessest) then whether hath he not lighted all men as he is the Son of God; and is not the Light of God sufficient in it self to lead unto God, all that follow it, yea, or nay?
Qu. 5. Whether it is not the same Light in him that hates it, as it is in him that loves it, Iohn 3. if there be a difference in the Light, shew it wherein it lies, whether in its nature, or otherwise? Qu. 6. Whether it is possible that any can be saved without Christ manifest within; if no, then whether it is not the Doctrine of Salvation which is only necessary, to preach Christ within; and it is not the whole Mystery of Salvati∣on, God manifest in the flesh? Qu. 7. Whether is it not possible that many may profess as much of Christ without, as thou hast said of him, and yet be damned; and if this be the faith to profess him born, dead, risen, and ascended without, then is there any Un∣believer in England, seeing all in the outward sound believe, and professe as much as thou hast said, yea or nay? Quer. 8. Whether hath that man faith in Christ, who is not changed in the Nature? and is not the Lyar and Slanderer an Unbeliever, and of the cursed Nature, yea or nay? Quer. 9. Whether doth any man receive Christ, who receives him not into him? if not, shew how Christ can be received? and whether many do not pro∣fess him, which never received him? Quer. 10. Whether to preach for Hire, for Gifts and Rewards, and to Di∣vine for Money, and to make Merchandise of People, for so much a year for preaching to them, is not true Marks and Signs of a false Prophet, or can any give truer Signs of the false Prophets, then Isaiah, and Micah gave yea or nay? Quer. 11. Whether must not the Devil be chained before Christ reign? and what is that which chains him? and whether art thou come to one of the dayes of the Thousand years, yea or nay? Quer. 12. Whether dost thou know any Christ, or preach or profess any Christ, who hath not lighned every man that comes into the World with the true Light of Life, or of Condemnation? and is he not a Deceiver that ex∣horts People for Salvation to any other thing then the Light of Christ, yea or nay? And how hath Christ enlightened every man in the World, if not within him? These Queries, with some more in my Answer, I put forth to thee, that Truth may be cleared from all Slanders of envious tongues, and shall leave my work and thine to be weighed in the Ballance of Righteousness, to be considered of by every honest heart to whom they do come, and God shall be the chief Judge be∣twixt us in his day. A Postscript. ANd now seeing we have taken in hand to discover and lay open the deceits of Deceivers, that all men may come to the knowledge of the Truth and be saved, and led out of the snare of the crafty Fowlers; these things further we shall add, which are contrary to the Doctrine of the true Gospel. First, Iohn Burton said in a Discourse with some Friends, That Christ had two Bodies, and one of the Bodies was out of the sight of the Saints. Secondly, Iohn Bunyon said, Christ's second coming  not his coming in Spirit, for his coming in Spirit is no comming. Thirdly, Iohn Bunyon said upon, Discourse, Of the Word of God being in the heart, in the presence of divers People, That there was nothing in him, nor in any man to be taken notice of. Fourthly, One of their Brethren said, That Christ and the Word of Life were two things.
Fifthly, Some others of the same Members, in the Market of Bedford said, That they scorned that Light which we (meaning the Quakers) speak of, which is the Light that convinceth of sin, which Light they confessed to be in every man, in the same discourse which was with some of them called Quakers. Much need not be said as to the laying open of these particulars, for by the words themselves the wickedness and ignorance of the broachers of them are fully seen, to every one who is spiritual, and to them I leave this to be judg∣ed; onely this I shall further say, They have not spoken onely that which can∣not be proved by Scriptures, but some of the particulars are also contrary to the Scriptures, and are damnable Doctrines of Devils, as might be largly laid o∣pen, in the third and fifth particulars. But I delight not in raking in such unsavory Stuff, but do trample over it, and return it to the Authors. Ha∣ving summed up their Wickedness into a Sum, I leave it for to be weighed by themselves and others; and if any question the truth of the particulars charged against them, sufficient Testimony may be given by such who were a Witnesses. By one who hath chosen rather to suffer affliction with the despised People, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin, EDWARD BURROUGH.
Stablishing Against Quaking Thrown down and overturned, and no De∣fence found against it. Or an Answer to a Book (called, Stablishing against Quaking) put forth by Giles Firmin, a professed Minister in Essex. WHEREIN His many Lyes, and Slanders are rebuked and witnessed against; and all his thir∣teen Arguments confounded, and clearly confuted; and he manifestly proved a false Prophet in several particulars; as in his Call and Maintenance: And while he hath thought to discover the Prince of Darkness in others, he is found secret∣ly lodging in his own house, and powerfully working in him; and is found truly guilty himself of that whereof he falsly accuseth the innocent People, called Quakers, who are Gods faithful Witnesses, against this subtil Genera∣tion, though for a moment they are a Prey to the seed of Evil-doers, and a Re∣proach to lying Tongues. THe Lord from Heaven, in this his day, is risen and come forth, to make War with all his Enemies, being the fulness of time, wherein his pur∣pose is to cut down, and destroy the man of sin, by the power of his coming; and he must reign, whose right it is; and of his Kingdom and Government there shall be no end, and Nations shall flow into it, and Kings shall lay down their Crowns at his Feet, whom God hath appointed to exalt in his Throne of Righteousness and Judgment; and the war is proclaimed in his Name, & the Standard of the Lord is set up before him, to gather together the Nations, to fan them and to try them; and to search and to seek out his own, where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day, and a prey made upon them, by every wild Beast of the Mountain: But the Lord hath opened his Ear to the cry of the Just, and his Bowels are filled with compassion, towards the Seed of his Inheri∣tance, whom no man regardeth to take pity upon, but are altogether hardened in their iniquities, and become equal with the Oppressor; therefore in Judgment is the Lord appearing, to work the purpose of his Heart, and to fulfil the intent of his Mind, and will not spare to punish the transgression of the wicked upon his own head; and is already clothed with the Garments of Vengeance, and clad with Zeal as with a Cloak, and hath proclaimed Indignation in the face of the Ungodly; and his Enemies, against whom his wrath is kindled, is joyning battel with him; and Gog and Magog is prepared, to resist the day of Recompence; and the whole body of Darkness, from the head to the tayl is risen to gainsay the Lord, and strive in confusion together; and their armour clashes one against an∣other, and they over-run each other, through the confusion of their blind under∣standing, and they will not be perswaded unto Reconciliation, but goes on in re∣bellion till they be left without strength, as a wounded man, who shall never more vise again, nor recover his deadly blow; for the strength of Aegypt shall fail in
the midst of it, and the Warrier finds not his hand in the day of his necessity, but terror is upon his loynes, and fearfulness in his heart, and the wrath remains upon him; and wisdom is become madness, and prudence is hid, and the wise men of this Generation are become foolish, What do ye mean? Ye that have gathered your selves together, all ye Sects and Opinions, and ye that profess the Law of Righteousness, Is your Religion turned into Envy and Wrath, whereby you would slay the Upright? You have made Lyes your refuge, as your last defence to cover your selves from the Storm; but your City is besieged, and fear shall com∣pass you about, and the refuge of Lyes shall be swept away▪ For, in vain, and to no purpose do men strive against the Lord, and without effect (as to that which they intend) do they gather themselves together, and band themselves in deaths covenant, to war against the Lamb; for the more you strive the more you are entang∣led and the deeper your pit is digged for another, the greater is your own fall into it; for the purpose of your hearts; and the intent of your wicked minds doth the Lord make void, and turneth them upon your own head; and strongly are you bound in your own snare, which you secretly lay for the foot of the Inno∣cent, to make the Upright a prey. How long ye men of the Earth will ye  counsel together against the Lord? How long shall the Righteous be a prey to your teeth, to shoot your Arrows of Cruelty and Reproach against? When will you give over your Oppression, and Violence, wherewith you think to spoil the tender Grape of the Lords Vintage, and to devour the Seed of Iacob from off the Earth, that you may rule in the kingdom in peace? When will you be weary  your wickedness, and cease from your deceivings, seeing the Lord makes you a Curse in whatsoever you take in hand? You travel in wrath, and bring forth no∣thing; you strive all the day long, and gather nothing but stubble, and the fire kindles upon it, and makes it a heap of Confusion in a moment▪ When will you learn wisdom, and refrain your selves from vanity? Do you think to persist in the way wherein you walk? can you overcome the Lamb? or can you bring to nought the purpose of the Most High? Will you make your selves equal with him, and will ye gainsay the working of his Power? Nay, you shall fall into everlast∣ing confusion, and the remembrance of your destruction shall not suddenly pass away: for the purpose of the Lord shall surely stand, and his Counsel shall  be made void; for you are but suffered for a moment, till your measure be ull, and your transgression be finished, that you may be cut off for ever, and id waste as the Wilderness▪ Long hath been the night of Darkness over all Nations, wherein you have played, and sported your selves, as though no eye had seen you, and your works of cruelty had laid hid in your bosomes, but now they do appear, and the day hath made you manifest, and the Light hath discovered you, and now ye are tryed, and weighted, and searched; and the Fire of the Lord is kindled up∣on all your works, and the end o them is confusion and misery; and in sorrow shall ye lie down, and no eye shall comfort you, nor no Physitian shall heal your bruise; for with a grievous blow will the Hand of the Lord be upon you, all you who pervert his Way, who have joyned your selves in battel against the Lamb, and his Followers; some of you smiting the Innocent with your hands, and some with your tongues, and in your envy deal cruelty with the Lord's Chosen, who are become a Proverb and Prey to the wicked, and as a Butt to shoot at, against whom you bend your Tongues, and speak bitter things, even from the head to the tayl; the whole body of Darkness is prepared to war, and every member of the great Image is stirred up in its strength, thinking to prevail through subtilty, against the innocency of the Simple, and Lyes are become o Enemies refuge, and their trust is in a broken Reed, which fails their confidence and hope; and we are preserved under the shaddow of the Almighty, and we are delivered out of the snare of our Enemies, and through suffering for a moment, shall reign for ever and ever over the Beast and his Image. And unto thee Giles Firmin I do write a few words, in answer to thy Book, cal∣ed, Stablishing against Quaking; who hast helped up the measure to fulfil the wick∣edness of the wicked in adding thy Lyes, and Slanders, and Reproaches unto
thy Brethren, and hast cast in thy Mite into the heap of Babylons Confusion, and ast set thy seal against the Lord's People, and hast put to thy hand in the record of Sions Enemies; Whom do you thus strive against? And against whom is your ury thus kindled? What are you doing in your drunken fits of fury, wherein you stagger with the wine of Envy? Surely when you are sober you will consider, nd when you are come to your selves you will be ashamed, and will not open any more your malice and wrath which hath drownded your honesty and civility; and n your knowledge you are as bruit Beasts, which are to be destroyed; you do but ga∣her your selves together that you may be scattered and broken to peices; you are uffered to heap up your confusion, in Lyes and Reproaches, that the Lord may make you ashamed, and judge you out of your own mouths. And Friend, what hast thou done, and who hast thou established? the wicked n his wickedness, and the unclean in his filthiness, and hast hardened the hearts of the ungodly by thy Lyes and Slanders, least they should turn from their ungod∣iness, and be saved from their sins, and so against quaking for transgression hast hou stablished them herein; and this will be laid to thy charge in the Day of he Lord, who healest up the Wound slightly, and criest Peace, Peace to the wick∣d, unto whom the Lord hath not spoken Peace: And Friend, thou art the man n whom the Prince of Darkness is discovered, which now works in thee, and rom him hast thou sent forth thy pack of Reproaches against the Innocent, and leadest thy own cause, and judgest hereof in the sight of men, and hast sought he praise of men, and not the Praise of God; and so seek to obtain a good re∣ort by flattery, and not by faith; and this sufficiently appears in thy first E∣istle, wherein thou hast given flattering Titles unto man, and in vain hypocri∣ie hast fought a proof to the authority of thy Book, thinking thereby the more o make it of force to do the work, which thou intendest by it; even to oyson the simplicity of the Upright, and to devour the woman which brings orth the Man-Child, by casting floods of evil Speeches and Lyes after her, but hy flatteries are of no worth to thee, nor thy subtil words of guile availeth thee ot herein; for in the Light thou art seen, and by it tried, and thy snare which hou, hast laid will fetter thy own foot, and the mischief thou intendest is fallen pon thy own head, and whilst thou hast thought to discover the Prince of Dark∣ness in another, thou hast covered and cloaked him in thy self, under thy feigned words of flattery; but through that vail he is seen, and unto all men shall be made manifest, and the Spirit of the Lord doth judge him, and thy Rock of flattery shall not cover thee from the Wrath of him, whom thou hast set thy self to oppose. And in thy second Epistle thou sayest, Thou madest one Sermon, to discover this Generation (meaning the Quakers) and thou, sayst thou, found good success of it. Friend, thou hast more fully discovered thy self, and that abommation which lodged in thy heart secretly, which thou hast not let out into open view, then thou hast in the least measure discovered us, or detected us, or justly reproved us, in Doctrine or Conversation to be contrary to the Saints in Generations past, who are our cloud of Witnesses, as being guided by the same Spirit according to the measure as we have received; but this is rather a discovery to all the Upright that were of God, because we are spoken all manner of evil of, falsly by thee and thy Generation, who are sufficiently proved in all your wayes and worships, to be of the Generation of them that ever persecuted the righteous Seed of God: And as for the success, thou hast found little profit thereof, for the Judgments and Wrath of God will succeed thy Lyes and Slanders; and this shalt thou find, and they that are deceived by thee shall perish together, and this will be the reward of thy duty, which thou sayest called upon thee now to speak. And seven of thy first Pages hast thou filled in pleading for thy own kingdom, and unjustly justifi∣ing thy own cause, in Preaching for Hire, and in Divining for Money, and in seeing for thy Gain from thy Quarter, false Prophet like; it well appears that sometime thou hast been bit upon thy sore, and searched where thy guilt hath lodged, and now thou hast endeavoured to heal up the wound, and cure thy self,
and hast brought many arguments, and hast sought to clear thy self by guile  not by innocency; and hast gathered many Scriptures together, which as th supposest might make for thy purpose herein by preaching of them: How f wouldst thou blind the eye of the Simple, that thou mightst alwayes act thy ab mination, and not be seen; and even as Satan brought Scripture against Chri so hast thou against the Truth, and to uphold thy iniquity. Thou sayest, It is the great clamour of the Quakers, that you are no Ministers of Chri Isa. 56. 2 Pet. 23. Ezek. 34. Mich. 3. 5 Tit. 1. 11. 2 Tim. 34. 5 because you Preach for Hire; Divine for Money, and are Covetous, &c. This is true, and I will add much more, which thou hast spared, You are gree∣dy dumb Dogs, and can never have enough, every one of you seeking for yo Gain from your Quarter, and through Coveteousness make merchandise of Sou and make a Prey upon the Flock, and feed your selves with the Fat, and cloa your selves with the Wool; and cry, Peace, Peace to them that put into yo Mouthes, but prepare War against them that do not; and are given to filthy  cre, and love the Wages of unrighteousness, and go on headlong in the Error  Balaam and Cain, having the Form of Godliness but denying the Power; bei heady and high-minded-Men, and false Accusers, and proud Boasters, and Lo∣vers of Pleasure more than God, &c. Much more also is true upon you accor∣ding to Scripture; for whatsoever the true Prophets and Apostles declared, as  giving a description of the false Prophets and Apostles, by their works and sig the same way may truly be said upon you, as being every whit guilty of what ever was charged upon them by the Spirit of the Lord; so that all thy wresting Scriptures will not clear thee and thy Brethren, who have, some of them, said as  as thou canst say, in this particular; but Truth stands unmoveable, and you  altogether discovered, and made bare and naked; and your shame doth appear thy answer to this which thou callest, The Quakers clamour. Thou sayest, False Teachers may and have preached freely; then be sure free Te could not prove you to be true Ministers, &c. Reply, Thou and this Generation of Teachers exceed such in abominati who have not yet so far transformed your selves like unto true Ministers, as  teach freely; and your condemnation will be the greater, insomuch as you exc them in wickedness; and it is confessed, that free Teaching would not prove  to be true Minsters, for you are false, and deceitful in every account, and  nisters of Antichrist, under many considerations more then one; as in your Ca and Worship, and many other things: And thus thou hast laid open thy own  ly, that thou mayest be judged out of thy own mouth. For in the Margent th sayest, The Quakers teach not freely, for at one Town thou hearest, that one of the Qu∣kers had about five Pound gathered for him. Friend, This is a Slander and a false Accusation, and thou hast heard and be∣lieved a Lye (if not made a Lye) and thy Lyes will be no refuge for thee in  Day of the Lord; for I testifie against them and thee, and him to be no Qu who acted such a thing, if any such was acted. Then thou goest on, and draw many vain conclusions and arguments to no purpose; and bringest the Scriptu 2 Cor. 11. 8, 9. and thinkest this for thy purpose, because of the word (Wges) and now boastest as though thou hadst overcome; but all this will not clear th from guilt, nor prove thee to be a Minister of Christ; he reaped where he had sow, and not of the World; he eat the Milk of the Flock, and did not by a Law co pel People to pay him, as thy Generation doth; neither was he chargeable to any, as you are, but made the Gospel of Christ free; and used not his liberty in the things, but you go beyond the liberty of equity, and by a Law obtain your Main∣tenance, oppressing the Poor to make your selves rich; living in Pride, Idleness, and Fulness; but Paul did not thus, but was in Cold, Hunger, and Nakedness; and the Wages he took was not to do himself service, but them, as it is evident▪ So Pauls example herein will not cloak thy filthiness, nor cover thy shame; hewas a Minister of the Spirit, and did sow spiritual things, and was no Hireling, as the false Prophets, who through coveteousness made merchandise of souls; and this is thy example, and not the practise of Paul, whom thou wouldst fain make like nto
thy self; but he is justified, and thou art condemned in the Sight of God, whose work is not of his nature; he gave freely and might reap where he sowed; but thou makest a Covenant to reap before thou sowest, and sowest not, and so de∣ceives the People. Then thou sayst, We provide for our selves (when we wander up and down) men must provide us Lodging, Food, &c. Are not People bound to provide for you, as well as to entertain us, &c. Thou alwayes pleadest thy own cause, and so hadst thou need; for the Chil∣dren of God cannot plead for thee, but testifie against thee: It is Christ's Do∣ctrine, Into whatsoever House ye enter, eat such things as are set before you; but it was ne∣ver his Doctrine, Take so much by the year; and if they will give you such a Sum, preach to them; this is the Doctrine, Way, and Wages of Balaam, in which thou art found. Many other Scriptures dost thou wrest, and many a vain Argument dost thou make unto this purpose. And thou sayest, He that will be a Minister indeed, will say, He findeth all little enough. For shame cover thy Lips, and stop thy Mouth; thy stuff stinks with raking in, who sayest, That men cannot be sufficient Ministers without Arts, and such poor blind stuff, of which I am ashamed, and pass by it as not worth the mentioning. Then thou goest on in the matter of Tythes, seeing the Rule and Law of Scripture will not fully bear thee out in thy wicked practise of pleading for Hire; goest to the Law of the Nation, and so the Gospel which you preach will not man you according to the Apostles Doctrine; but by a Law are maintained, through the grievous oppression of the Innocent, as is witnessed in this Nation; and thou art put to all thy shifts, though but beggarly some of them, to blind Peoples eyes, so that you may have your Hire; and in thy Arguments thou pleadest, That Tythes are no mans own, but the Ministers, &c. But I say, if poor men did not labour, and improve their time, and strength, and money, you could have no Tythes; so that if the Land was not tilled through poor Peoples labours you might go without; so Tythes are not paid out of the Land, but out of mens labours thereupon; and so you rob poor mens labours, and not the Land, that you may live in filthiness. And thou sayest, Care is taken for you already many hundred Years before you were born, in setting an Estate. &c. Yea, the Pope settled Tythes upon his Priests, whose Generation you are of; a poor shameless shift to plead such things, leaving the Rule of the Scripture, and defending your selves both in your Ministry and Maintenance by a Popish aw, which was the supreme Power in the Nation when Tythes were first established in England, but neither the Rule of Scripture, nor of the National Law will make your works justified; all People shall see your nakedness, and God will make you ashamed of your way: And as to particular, Had we lived in the primitive Churches, when the Magistrates were Heathens, &c. This I shall answer by a Question, Doth not the works of some of the Magi∣strates in England (I do not say all) prove themselves rather to be Heathens than Christians, by their unjust imprisoning of the Innocent without ch of any Law, and so to be rather Destroyers of the Church (which is the Body of Christ) then careing to preserve it, and also in giving treble dammage to the Hirelings for Non-payment, thereby wasting and making havock of poor mens Estates, as is in many places to be witnessed, and these are they who are most zealous for you, some of them I leave this Question to be answered, which being but truly answer∣ed, will discover whether you who by oppression take Tythes, ho o of the exercise of a pure Conscience cannot pay Tythes, and so are Sufferers, and you Oppressors are Carriers on of the designs of Hell and Rome, as in thy eleventh Page thou speakest. Then thou sayest, So much for the Ministers Maintenance, &c. Yea, more then enough, but that thou mightest lay open thy own folly, there∣fore wast thou allowed, that thy shame might be fully laid open, and thou uncover∣ed,
who hast acted thy part as others of thy Brethren before thee, in pleading your own unjust cause of Idolatry, to uphold your grievous Oppression of Tythes and set Maintenances, under which at this day many thousands do sadly groan, and not pittied by you; but though you regard not, the Lord God doth and will avenge their Cry upon your heads, who have made your Ministry and Religion the most grievous Oppression in this Common-wealth, and so are fallen into greater abo∣mination than the Heathen, and are higher than they in ungodliness, and deeper in subtilty; and go to the Heathens, and they will shame you; and take thy own counsel, and practise it, as in thy tenth Page: And much more of thy stuff I pass, thus much is sufficient to discover thy deceit in this particular. Then thou goest on, and from thy Text thy observation is this, It hath been of old, and it is the practise still of the Prince of Darkness, to transform himself into an An∣gel of Light, &c. To which I answer, It is proved by the Scripture, that it hath been of old his practise, and it is proved upon thee, that it is still his practise; and thou art the man upon whom thy observation stands true, who art in thy good words, and fair speeches, and pretences, transformed only in the appearance, and not in the ground, out of gross wickedness into secret hypocrisie, and so makest an Image without Life, and so as Iannes and Iambres, art resisting Truth; yet art thou seen and comprehended, though thou sayest, Satan is never less seen then when he acts as an Angel of Light; which I suppose thou speakest by experience, as being acted therein, undiscovered to the Simple, because of thy hypocrisie. In thy Page thirteenth, thou sayest, that The Scriptures are the true Light. Here thy blindeness and error is discovered, who speakest herein contrary to the Scripture, which saith, Christ Iesus is the true Light, 1 Iohn 9. Here th wouldest exalt the Scriptures in the Seat of Christ, and thereby deny him, in say∣ing the Scripture is that which he only is, and nothing else, (to wit) The tr Light of the World; which lighteneth every man that comes into the World; and the Scrip∣tures are a Declaration of him, and not him. And thou goest on, and sayest, Because these Quakers each People they must do just∣ly, do no body wrong, nor Lye, &c. some take it for granted they come from Christ, &c. But this thou snuffest at, and makest light of, by which is easily discerned of what spirit thou art; the Scripture witnesseth, He is a Minister of Christ that tur from Darkness to Light, and from sin unto God; and could we but wink at sin, and cloak it as you do, and cry Peace, Peace to them that walks after the imaginations of their own hearts, then should we be loved, and not hated of the World. And in thy fourteenth Page, Thou reckonest us with the Fryars and Popish Ge∣neration, but them and thee we do deny, and that holiness and righteousness which is in the will of man; for because we cannot run to the same excess of riot with you, you think it strange; and therefore thou accusest us (as with a matter of fact) That we drink water, and fast, and wear no Lace, &c. That which tho wouldst make us abominable in by the sight of men doth our innocency and upright∣ness appear in, in the sight of God, and his Children. Then thou goest on in thy confused language, and in that which thou callest thy use, Take hed that you be not deceived. To whom dost thou speak, to them that are in the Truth? If tho speakest to thy own flock, thy word might have been, Search, lest you be de∣ceived; for we know the whole World lies in wickedness, and this Generation under the deceivableness of a blind Ministry, which leadeth not unto God, but keeps in Darkness, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth. And in thy Page ninteenth, Thou hast put forth a Question, which is, How shall we know this transformed Angel of Light, &c? To which I answer, Where he rules he is not known nor discerned, for the god of the World hath blinded the eye which should make him manifest; and this is true in thee, who art led by him and perceivest it not, and art doing his work
and understandest not; but the brightness of the coming of the Son of Man in the Children of the Father, hath discovered him in the World, and in thee; and though thou woulst fain put him among the Quakers, yet he is found in thy own house; thou endeavourest to prove thy Accusation by vain consequence and false conclusions; but our Assertion is proved by the Spirit of God, and stands upon thy head, and shall be witnessed by the Light in thy own Conscience. Now something in answer to thy Arguments, and false Conclusion. And thy first Argument is, That the Light of the Quakers will not admit of, nor endure the Tri∣al, therefore the Light of the Quakers is the light of Satan, &c. Answ. Thy proposition and ground of thy Argument is a Lye, and so thy con∣clusion is to no purpose; for we deny not a Trial, but exhort People thereunto, that they search the Scripture, to see whether these things be not so, and are tried by the Scriptures in Doctrine and Conversation, and proved to be simple thereby, to be in the Truth as it is in Jesus, and are testified of in Scripture by the Holy men of God, who are unto us a Cloud of Witnesses, in our Faith, and Life, and Sufferings, and Tryals, &c. Friend, thou hast fained a Lye upon us, and hast confuted thy own Lye; this is an easie way to prove us Deceivers, if it would stand in trial; neither is thy proof, That w do deny tryal, any wit to this purpose, as I. N. against F. Harris, Page the tenth, which thou quotest, let the ho∣nest hearted read; but subtilly hast thou wrested the words, to bring thy false Conclusion and Lye about, to take place among the ignorant People: Thy Lye is condemned, and thy refuge is taken away, and thou art left naked for the De∣stroyer. Thy second Argument is, The Light of the Quakers putteth out the Light of Na∣ture; therefore their Light is the light of Satan, &c. Thou sayest by the Light of Na∣ture, thou meanest the inward Law; which God set up in the heart of all mankind, chk∣ing many sins against God and man, &c. Answ▪ What blind confusion is this, which is uttered from thy dark mind? no whit savory, but stuff hardly worth stirring in, and quite contradiction to thy own words, Page fifteen, where thou chargest us with directing to the Light in the Conscience, which thou callest Natural, but we call it Spiritual, and this is it which cheeks the sins against God, which thou sayest our Light puts out, and that we preach any thing for Light which puts out this light (which is the work of the Law of God written in the heart) this Argument is also a Lye, and so thy conclusion is made void likewise; but that the Knowledge, and Wisdom, and Prudency of the natural man, which is corrupted, must be put out, this we own; and the Quakers Light, which is the Light of Christ, shall confound the Wisdom of the World, and be no transgression against God, nor from a light of Satan, but of Christ; and the proof of thy Argument is, as thou sayest, W deny honour to all Superiours, and seemest to be greatly offended with the word (Thou) quo∣ting many Scriptures against it, but let the wise in heart judge thee herein; none of all these Scripture, will prove that ever any of the Saints gave flattering Titles unto men, or spoke (You) to a particular Person, which thou art to prove, or else thou sayest nothing, that the word (Thou) to Superiours is any denying of honour due unto them; and herein thy conclusion is also false, being the foundation of thy Argument is a Lye; and thy Argument made up of confusion, saying, That Light is Natural, which is the inward Law set up in the heart, check∣ing the sins against God and man, this is one Lye; also saying, That our Light puts out the Light, This is another Lye: Friend, if Lyes would prove us Decei∣vers, thou wouldst accomplish it; How easie a thing it is for thee to confute thy own Lyes, when thou hast made them? Thy third Argument is, Such is the Quakers Light (viz.) which teacheth men to forsake the Scriptures, setting up a spirit in man, which shall not be examined by the Scrip∣tures; therefore, it is the light of Satan, &c. Answ. The first part of thy Argument is a very Lye, and also the last, as thou hast laid it down; our Light teacheth not men to forsake the Scriptures, but in∣to the fulfilling of them, to walk in the Life of them; and it teacheth to exalt
the Spirit of God in man above all things, and in its fruits and opperation may be examined by the Scriptures, but it self is the Searcher of all things, even of the deep things of God; and this is not the Light of Satan but of Christ, which teacheth men into the fulfilling of the Scriptures, and to exalt the Spirit in man which gave forth the Scriptures, which is the trial of all spirits; and whatsoever conclusion be gathered for an Argument, whereof a Lye is the foundation, as of this, the conclusion must needs be vain, and a Lye, like its foundation. And in thy proof of the major position, thou sayest, The Scriptures are left by God, to be your Light and Rule, &c. And the Scriptures say, Christ is the Light, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, (and so the Rule) and so thou hast set up the Scriptures above Christ, and by thy lying spirit crosseth the Scriptures; but thou art accu∣stomed to Lye, and so art expert therein: And thou sayest, Christ bids you sec the Scriptures, Iohn 5. 39. It is true, he bids the Pharisees, who had not Christ Word abiding in them, and who had not heard God's Voice, nor seen his Shape, but persecuted Christ, them he bad search the Scriptures; and justly hast thou thr in thy self among the Pharisees, and so art an Enemy to Christ, according to thy own confession: And for the proof of the minor position, thou hast not at at  proved by any way of the Books quoted thy proposition, That the Quakers Lig teacheth men to forsake the Scriptures, &c. Let the wise in heart judge. And thou sayst, But to speak truly, The Quakers make nothing of Scriptures, &c. This is the very falsness, and of thy lying tongue, and no truth in it; and a Question here I ask, Whether he be the more guilty of forsaking Scriptures which live the Life thereof, and in the fulfilling of them by the Spirit, or he that talks in words of them, and makes a trade thereof, but lives in Lying and false Accusing, and Pride, and vain Glory, and te filthiness of the Flesh? This Question being answered, will open the understanding of the simple, and our innocency thereby will appear from all thy grievous slanders, and wicked wrestings of our words. As in Page twenty five, in thy false conclusio of this particular, thou sayest, The Quakers divide the Spirit from the Scripture, &c. Yea, the Spirit, and the Scriptures are low things, though they bear wit to the truth of each other, thus are they divided, That every one that hath the Scriptures hath not the Spirit, and this is no error, nor from a Light of Sa∣tan; but thy Lyes are from the Darkness of Satan, and not from the Lig of Christ. Thy fourth Argument is, Such is the Quakers Light (viz.) which makes the Scrip∣ture cross it self, and that in things known by the Light of nature; therefore the light of Sa∣tan, &c. Answ. This is also false in the foundation, and thy Arguments and Confusions made without effect: Friend, whilst thy foundation is a Lye thy Building wi not endure, be sure of that; the Scripture was given forth by one Spirit, and bears witness unto one thing, and doth not cross it self in the Light of the Spirit that gave it forth, though to thy carnal wisdom it may seem so: And for the proof of thy minor proposition, thou sayst we quote that Scripture, Iames 2. Have not the Faith of our Lord Iesus with respect of Persons, &c. to overthrow all re∣spect of Persons, &c. Doth this at all prove that our Light makes the Scripture to cross it self? Where is it said in the Scripture, Have the Faith of our Lord Jesus with respect of Persons? Such a one thou must bring, or else thou hast said nothing to this purpose: And thy second Scripture is, That we say as Christ said, Swear not at all: Will this Scripture being quoted by us, prove that our Light makes the Scripture cross it self? What blind confused stuff is this which proceeds from thee, thinking to make us odious and vile, but thou hast the rather made thy self ignorant and blind in the sight of all the Children of Light, who compre∣hend thee in thy subtilty; and as to that of Swearing, which thou hast strived in thy Argument to prove the Lawfulness of it, thou hast thereby made thy Argu∣ment against Christ's own words, who saith, Swear not at all; and thou art he whose Light (or rather whose Darkness) would confound the Scriptures, to blind the eye of the Simple; and thy conclusion stands true upon thy self; hence thy light is the light of Satan, not of Christ. And thou sayest, The Quakers bid
men be guided by the Light of God within, &c. How doth this contradict thy own words, page twenty second, where thou sayest, The Quakers Light puts out this light, the inward Law set up in the heart, &c. when wilt thou be ashamed of thy igno∣rance, and stop thy mouth in the dust? Thy fifth Argument is; Such is the Quakers Light, viz. which takes men off from that Rule which is perfect, and cannot err, and sends them to be guided by a Light which is im∣perfect, and may and doth err; therefore the Light of Satan, &c. Answ. Hast thou given up thy self wholly to lyes, and to make them thy refuge? thy work is to make a Lye, and then to confound it; this is an easie way to prove us De∣ceivers, as I said; and in the proof of thy minor Proposition, thou hast fallen short of proving what thou takest in hand, and sayst, The Word of God is perfect, but the Quakers do not send men to the Word, &c. This is false, we preach the Word, and send men to it; even that Word of Faith which the Apostle preached, which is in the heart, and in the mouth, and that Word is perfect, and errs not, and this we send men too, to be guided by it, and to receive faith in it; then thou sayest, The light of Conscience is imperfect, and may err, and takes accasion to speak of that Scripture, 1 Ioh. 8. but to what purpose I know not, except thou wouldst prove that Light of Christ to be imperfect, and err, which we say hath lightened every mans Conscience in the World, and is a perfect Rule in the Conscience, where man is guided by it; and this Light leads up unto Christ, to exercise the Conscience, and he to rule King and Lord in the Conscience, and so to make Conscience one with him in the unity; and this is true wisdom, and no folly as thou accountst it in thy blind∣ness, page twenty nine: Then thou goest on, and hast intimated a falsity from I. Ps Query, and then confutes thy own Lye; I. P. doth not say, every man is lightned with a saving Light; but asks the Question to be answered, which for the simple sake, here I do answer, Christ hath lighted every man in the World with the true Light, which is saving Light to every one that believes therein, and con∣demning Light to him that believes not, yet is the Light true Light, and no error nor imperfection in it; and they that hate it are such as know nothing of Re∣demption, Justification, &c. and a great part of England is in that conditin, though they have heard the report, yet they know it not in truth and righteousness; and this Light is in the World, and the World knows it not; yet doth not this confute that he hath lightned every man that comes into the World, as thou wouldst ignorantly make it appear in the same page: Then thou sayest, If you speak of reason and understanding, so Christ lighteth every one, &c. Here thou hast confessed Truth with thy lying Spirit; it is the purest reason that every man should serve his Maker, and act nothing contrary to his Maker; this the ight of Christ lights unto, and leads unto; and it is the best understand∣ing that gives a man to understand the Way of eternal Peace and Rest for his Soul, if he love the Light, and lets him understand when he acts against his Maker, &c. and this hath Christ lighted every man unto; Then thou sayest, Conscience may err, and provest it from Paul's example of persecuting: If Conscience be not guided by the Light of Christ, it erreth; but it was not the Light of Christ in Pauls Con∣science which led him to persecute, but his thoughts and imaginations, which were in the high mind above the Light in the Conscience; then many false conclusions from our words hast thou drawn, through thy wresting of them; thou sayest, as in all our books, the word of God written is made of no account, &c. thy lying tongue will God rebuke, the Scriptures we account of, and set them in their Authority, and bring them as a Witness against thee, and all thy wayes, who art out of the Life of them, thinking thou dost God service in speaking evil of his people; and thy Rules by which thou walkst, is proved by thy works and words to be imperfect and erroneous, and thy darkness is of Satan, and not the Light of Christ. Thy sixth Argument is, Such is the Quakers Light, that it destroys the institutions of Christ; therefore is the light of Satan, &c. Answ. Hast thou no foundation but a Lye to place thy. Argument upon? surely, thy time is neer an end, because thou hast no refuge but a lye to fly unto.
Thy major Proposition is not altogether sound, for that light was the Light of God, and of Christ which commanded circumcision, and the seventh day to be kept a Sabbath, and the Worship in the Temple, which was instituted by God, &c. And that was the Light of God, and of Christ also, which led the Disci∣ples from these things, to deny them, and bear witness against them, and yet no offence in God, nor no contradiction in the Light of Christ; but this to thy dark mind is a mystery sealed, and I leave it as a Parable to thee. Then for the proof of, thy minor Proposition, thou instancest, That we de Baptism, and breaking of Bread; yet darest thou not contend for sprinkling of In∣fants; (that imagination of man, and no institution of Christ.) But makest use of the Baptist herein, unto whom I perceive thou art an Enemy; what poor shifts art thou fain to run unto now, when thou art likely to be discovered, and ram∣bles up and down, wresting our words to blind the eyes of the simple? for you that live in your filthiness, yet professing the Supper of the Lord, it is made manifest you eat and drink your own damnation, and discerns not the Lords Body and while you are of the World, and not come to Repentance, you have nothing to do to speak of the Institutions of Christ, which was to his Church, to be practised therein only, and not among the Children of this World; so thy darkness is of Satan, and not of Christ, and thy Conclusion it is to thy self. Thy seventh Argument is; Such is the Quakers Light, viz. Which denies agre Work of Christ in the hearts of them who believe in him; therefore it is the Light of Sa∣tan, &c. Answ. What hast thou nothing but a Lye in thy mouth to ground thy Discourse upon, and to draw thy Conclusion from; we deny not the work of Christ in the hearts of them who believe; the proof of this minor position makes it not at all e∣vident, when thou hast wrested our words as much as thou canst, much less if the simplicity of our words were used; so it being a Lye in the ground, I need no much pluck down the building, for it fals of it self, as being not so firm as upon the Sand; for we hereunto exhort, that every one may know and witness the work of Christ in the heart to change and translate, and to give power over the World: But among thy many blind Arguments thou sayest, Thou deniest that the Righteousness of Christ whereby a Believer is justified doth dwell in him, &c. The Scripture saith, Ex∣cept Christ be in you, you are Reprobates; and where Christ is, there is his Righte∣ousness, for they are not divided; and the Word of Faith, which is the Righteous∣ness of Christ, is in the heart, as Paul saith: but I have cause to think thou art not much ashamed of being proved a Lyar, because thy impudency hath overcome simplicity and honesty; for when thou hast committed abomination, thou canst not blush, nor be ashamed; but thy shame will the Upright see. Thy eighth Argument is, Such is the Quakers Light, (viz.) which teacheth men o omit their duty to God; therefore it is the light of Satan, &c. Answ. Thou Enemy of God, when wilt thou cease thy Lyes, and to pervert the right way of God? we teach no man to omit his duty, neither doth thy witness of thy minor Proposition stand any whit for thy purpose; we are our selves daily exercised in Prayer unto God, and omits it not, as thou falsly accusest; but to bear Testimony against the Sacrifice of the Wicked, prayer, self-righteousness, &c. that it is abomination, and not accepted of the Father, this is no whit to the pur∣pose of teaching men to omit their duty, as thou falsly accuseth us; and thy mul∣titude of vain Arguments are to no purpose herein; and thou shews a vain wonto spirit. at I. Ns words, whose Exhortation is to wait for the Spirit, which we testi∣fie no man can be heard, or accepted of God in what he doth, without it; and this is the Duty of the Children of God, to wait upon the Father to be led by his Spirit, and he who is without the Spirit, hath not received Christ Jesus; and though thou scornst at this, yet of it we are not ashamed; and thy false conclusion is like thy foundation, both to be condemned with the Lyar. Thy ninth Argument is, Such is the Quakers Light (viz.) which teacheth men to say, they have no sin; therefore the light of Satan, &c.
Answ. In the proof of thy major Proposition, thou sayest, The Light of Christ doth teach, that all his People are freed from the dominion of sin; and Christ Je∣sus no where saith, That any are free from the dominion of sin, who are not free from the committing of sin; but the contrary he saith, He that commits sin is Iohn 8. 34. the Servant of sin; and such a one is under the dominion of it, where he is Servant, sin is Lord; so he who is redeemed from the Dominion and committing of sin, and cleansed from all unrighteousness, by Christ Jesus through his Blood; if he saith he hath no sin, he is no Lyar: but if before confession and forsaking of sin, he saith he hath no sin, he deceives himself, according as the Scripture witnesseth unto both these conditions, 1 Iohn 1. 8, 9. Again, He that is born of God sins not, as the same Apostle saith; and if he that sins not, saith he hath no sin, he is no Lyar, but his Light is the Light of Christ, and not of Satan: And thy blindness is seen in that thou sayest in effect, as though some may be free from the dominion of sin, and yet not free from the committing of sin; if thy Light teacheth thee thus, it is contrary to the Light of Christ, which gave forth the Scripture; our Light teacheth from the committing of all sin, and gives dominion over all un∣righteousness, and of this Light we are not ashamed: This is the strength of thy Argument, which is answered; so much of the rest I pass by, only may mind thee of thy confusion. Thou sayest, Where sn hath no dominion, that man is perfect, &c. And thou allowest that the Light of Christ teacheth men that they are freed from the dominion of sin; and it is proved that none are free from the dominion of sin, but who are saved from the committing of sin: And the sum of thy doctrine is no more then that which thou wouldst make error in us, though sometimes thou art railing against Perfection, and sometimes owning it under some particular accounts, not under all; and so one while builds up, and another while throwest down, and so art in Babylon. Thou sayest, There are thousands of perfect men in Eng∣land, &c. yet thy false conclusion is, because we hold Perfection, Therefore is our Light the light of Satan, &c. I leave it to the simple minde, to read thy con∣fusion, and shall rake no longer in it. Thy Tenth Argument is, Such is the Quakers Light (viz.) Which teacheth men to revile, and throw filth upon the true Ministers, and true Churches of Christ; therefore it is the light of Satan, &c. Answ. This Foundation is another Lye, and thy Arguments are to no purpose; We revile not, neither do throw filth upon the true Ministers and Churches of Christ; Thy proof of thy minor position gives not evidence of thy assertion; let the wise in Heart judge: So much need not be said, because both thy propositi∣on and thy proof is false; Doth I. Parnel, telling Of the Churches being in God, &c. prove that we revile & throw filth upon Ministers? &c. What blindness is this? but yet this will be the Question, Who the true Ministers and Churches of Christ are? for we judge it not, (neither doth the Lord) to be reviling and throwing filth up∣on the true Ministers and Churches, to call you greedy dumb Dogs, that seek for your Gain from your Quarter, and can never have enough; and Hire∣lings, Isa. 56. Mich. 3. 5 Ezek. 34. Ier. 5. Tit. 1. 11. that preach for Hire, and divine for Money; and Devourers of the Flock, who feed your selves with the Fat, and make a Prey through Covetousness upon the People; acting the horrible filthy thing, which Ieremiah cried against; and to call you evil Beasts, and Slow-bellies, which teach for filthy Lucre, as l did: And much more such like may truly be spoken of you, by the Spirit of the Lord, and no railing against the Ministers of Christ, no more then the true Pro∣phets, which spoke the same Language: for who act those things which the Pro∣phets of Christ and his Apostles declared against, are no Ministers of Christ; and here we find you in the steps of the false Prophets, and Scribes, and Pha∣risees, and false Apostles; (if any ask the particulars, I can give testimony here∣of) so that we make a great difference between reproving and condemning false Teachers and Hirelings, and reviling the true Ministers of Christ; prove your selves to be true Ministers of Christ, and we shall joyn with you; otherwise we must set to our seal against you, for your abominations, and shall as justly de∣ny
your Idol Temples, and Worship therein to be the true Churches of Christ, as we deny you to be Ministers; for your works do make you manifest, even your wickedness is discovered; what rudeness, and wildness, and pride, and vain glo∣ry is among you; and Christ never had such a Body, who were made up of such Members; but I do the rather pitty your blind People than you, for you are the blind Leaders of the Blind, and shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men, and enter not your selves, nor will suffer others, This is true upon you, and so are proved to be the Generation of Vipers, and Serpents, and Hipocrites: This is no reviling, but the Language of the Spirir of God, which Christ once spoke to such as you; (I speak of thee and thy Generation) and we own and honour the true Ministers and Churches of Christ, and revile them not; but deny you, and bear our witness against you. Then thou sayest, See what is required by the Apostles Example, to bring you into the Ministry, and prove you have it not. To which I answer, You have not the call of the Apostles, who were called by the imediate Spirit; none of you dare own this that I have yet heard of; neither have you received your Gospel as they did, by the Revelation of Jesus Christ; and thou hast confessed it. In Page fifty one, thou sayst plainly, You own no such Revelation; and so hast manifested thy selfe, to be without the abillities of the true Ministers, in these two particulars, and many more, which might be mentioned; and also in that which the Apostle saith, He that preaches the Gospel shall live of the Gospel. Now by an outward Law you are maintained, through oppression of the Innocent, as before I have proved; for if you had not a Law to defend you in your Mainte∣nance, you might starve or beg: So your gospel doth not maintain you, but the Law of the Nation, through oppression of the People. And the Apostle preached Christ Jesus to be the Light which hath Lightened every man that cometh into the World; and this you deny: And much more migh be testified against you where∣in you are not only short, but contrary to the true Ministers of Christ. Th thou shamelesly pleadst for the ordination by the Bishops, which I shall pass by, as not worth minding to set pen to paper about it, and in conclusion thou sayest, Th pleadst not for every particular Minister, &c. neither do I plead against any one Minister of Christ, but against hirelings for which thou pleadst, and so thy darkness is of Satan, and not the Light of Christ; take thy Conclusion to thy self, for unto thee it belongs. Thy eleventh Argument is; Such is the Quakers light (viz.) which brags of the infallible Spirit, and yet cannot speak good sence or reason, therefore is the light of Sa∣tan, &c. Answ. This is also false, and a Lye; whom hast thou heard brag, by word or writing, of an infallible Spirit, but the Spirit of God we say is infallible, and that Spirit we have received in its measure; but thy Lye I bear witness against, and thee the father of it: And thou sayst the Spirit of God speaks rationally, and sence; and thou sayst Satan also can speak likewise; then that can be no clear dis∣covery or difference betwixt them, if they speak alike: And thou sayst further, Seeing the witty Jesuits cannot do the business, now try if foolish Quakers can do it, &c. Thou art herein divided from some of thy Brethren, who hath as unjustly as tho accused us to be Jesuits; but any thing you will say which may make for your turn, to uphold the Kingdom of Satan; but your Lyes and Reproaches are unto us great riches, and our innocency will the Lord bring forth in his time, and your wickedness shall fall upon your own heads in a moment: but thy proof of thy minor position testifies no such thing against us, as speaking rational, or non-sence; so thy position is false, that we brag, &c. And thy proof is not for thy purpose, th we cannot speak good sence or reason; so in thy whole business thou art found a Lyar, and the Lyars Portion is the Lake; this is truth, and no reviling; only I perceive thou hast got a catch by some Scriptures being misplaced, and not truly quoted, which may be the Printers fault, for ought I know: But all that ever thou hast spoken proves not the truth of what thou hast asserted, let shame cover thy face.
Thy twelfth Argument is; Such is the Quakers light, (viz.) which affirms sound Believers walking (Evangelically) in obedience to Gods Commandments, to be in a state of Condemnation; therefore it is the Light of Satan, &c. Answ. Thou being neer at an end, hast left the greatest Lye to the last; When wilt thou be ashamed, and stop thy mouth? thy testimony of Lyes is well nigh finished, and thou bindest up the sum with an abominable one; yet thou confes∣sest in thy Margent, We do not say thi in many words, but by consequence, &c. Here let all men take notice of thee, who hast accused us with a thing; and yet confes∣sest we say not the thing; thou hast fully manifested thy self, we need go no fur∣ther to lay thee open; but thou sayest, By consequence, &c. Friend, if thou might∣test be the Interpreter of our Books, its like thou wouldest deal deceifully as thy Generation hath done with the Scripture; but we write not our Books, and leave them for to be expounded by thee, but they are as they speak, simple plain Lan∣guage to the ignorant, that thy may be instructed; thou hast manifested thy skil, in wresting our words, sufficiently; we allow thee not to be our Interpreter; we testifie, he who is a sound Believer, and walks in obedience to the commands of God, is in a justified state in the sight of God; but we put a difference betwixt condemning sound Believers, and speaking plainly in reproof of sin, as if we tell the Lyar his portion will be the Lake, and the Proud he shall be as stubble be∣fore the fire, and the Wicked shall be cast into Hell; and that no Coveteous, Un∣clean, Whoremongers, Drunkards, &c. shall never enter into the Kingdom of God: This Language is not a condemning of the sound Believers, neither is it so accounted in the Sight of God, though falsly judged by thee, and we stand to the Judgment of him, and not unto thy false Slanders. And thou further sayest, and desirest the Quakers, But to tell thee of one man in the Word of God, Heb. 12. 21. Ier. 23. 9. Psal. 88. 15. (meaning the Scriptures) who was Holy, who embraced the Quakers Doctrines, Prin∣ciple, and Practises, &c. David was holy, Moses was holy, Ieremiak was holy, with many more testified of in the Scripture, that were of the same Faith with us, and of the same Doctrines, and Principles, and Practices; for themselves were Quakers, as their own Writings make manifest; and hadst thou been in their dayes, thou wouldst have spoken no less evil of them then of us; for it was such as thou who spoke evil of them, and perse∣cuted them; and hence I do conclude thy spirit to be the spirit of Satan, and not the Spirit of God, Thy thirteenth and last Argument is against our Shaking (as thou callest it) and it is manifest to every one (thou sayest) whence it comes, &c. And railest much against it, and shufflest off, and kicks against the testimony we give out of the Scripture, bringing the like examples of the Servants of the Lord. And thou sayest, We a∣buse the examples of Daniel, Moses, and David, to defend these diabolical actings, &c. God shall reprove thy lying Tongue, and rebuke thee with the reproof of his Judgments; yea, many more than these named can we bring to witness for us, in the same actings of the Power of God. which thou most wickedly callest Diaboli∣cal, and leavest the Reader to observe thy foolish Story, to which in its place I may answer. Then thou goest on, and ramblest over a great deal of stuff from an Author like thy self, who wrote a Book against us also, and whose testimony is no better then thine, as being of the same spirit (against the Seed of God) with thee, and his testimony and thine are both for condemnation; thou quotest his Lyes to prove thine, as though his words were of authority with the Scripture; but wreched∣ness and subtilty lodges under your tongues; and though you be of several Opi∣nions and Judgments in your Worships and Ministries, yet are you joyned, and against us, as Herod and Pilato; and if it was not such a things as would make for thy wicked purpose, thou wouldest scorn to make use of his words, to prove thine; but the shift of the subtil Fox, which would devour the Lamb, is taken notice of in all his actings. Then thou sayest, No you own no such revolation, (viz) by the foregoing words,  you were taught the Gospel by the revolation of Iesus Christ.
And here let all men take notice of thee, to be one that was never sent of Christ, but one who knows not God; for as Christ Jesus saith, No man knows the Father, nor the Son, but he to whom the Son reveals him: And thou having denied the Revelation of the Son of God, hast shut out thy self from his Knowledge: For shame talk no more of the things of God, but let thy mouth be stopped from making mention of his Name, especially on the account of being a Minister; all that know God or the Gospel are ashamed of thee; some of thy own Brethren will not own thee herein▪ some of this I have laid open before. Then thou goest on saying, The pretended revelation of the Quakers, do cross an Article of Faith and Rule of Obedience in Scripture. This is not the least of thy Lyes: I deny the Slander; the same Truth, and Faith, and Obedience as ever was witnessed in the Holy men of God, which declared forth the Scripture, we own, and bear witness of, and no other: The Revela∣tion of Christ in us, in Faith and Obedience is witnessed by Paul, who is our Ex∣ample; and thou art the man whose spirit is contrary to Scripture, as is clearly made manifest, and in thee the man of sin is revealed, and the Light which should discover him is vailed; and I may truly say of thee, as thou falsly hast said of us, Surely the Devil is the Authour of thy work. Then in thy conclusion thou sayst, Much more might be gathered out of their Books, whereby it may appear by what spirit these Quakers are led; by the spirit of Satan, scarce trasnformed into an Angel of Light. Now, to all the honest hearted, unto whom this, and thine may come; even to thy own Hearers, at least unto such who have but moderation in their spirits; and to that measure of God in their Consciences I do appeal; that they by it may judge whether thou hast more discovered the spirit of Satan, in us, by any thing which thou hast in all thy Books justly proved against us to be evil, or sin, or er∣ror, (except thy Lyes and Slanders may stand for a testimony) or in thy self: who hast slandered us unjustly, and wrested our words deceitfully, and spoken many  grievous untruth of us; and I say to all who read this, and thine, let them ob∣serve with an impartial mind; and try all things, and hold fast that which is good; and let not the envy of the wicked one so prevail over you, but search all things with the Light of God, according to the Scriptures, before you judge any thing, least your zeal in your hasty untamed minds and spirits betray the honesty, which may in sobriety be instructed, and you informed the Way of Salvation, which now the Lord of Heaven is discovering to them that seek him in truth and sincerity: And because the Purpose of the Lord is to reveal his Glory, and to discover and condemn the secrets of the well-savoured Harlot, who hath sat long as a Queen in the Earth, deceiving Kingdoms and Peoples; therefore also is He∣rod and Pilate joyned together, and Gog and Magog is risen in their Power, to re∣sist the Counsel of God, and to disannul his Purpose; but in vain do they strive, and weary themselves to no advantage; for Sions King shall reign, and Ierusa∣lem shall be built, and become the praise of the whole Earth; and Nations shall partake of her Glory, and the Armies of Alients shall flee and be discomfor∣ted: And all the Lyes and Slanders of the wicked one, shall return upon his own head; and the pit which the wicked digs for the Righteous, it shall swallow the wicked up, and his foot shall not escape the snare: so that I testifie unto all Peo∣ple this one thing concerning Jesus, Him hath God given a Light into the World, a Judge, and a Reprover of all the works of wickedness; and with his Light every man that cometh into the World is lightened, with the Light of Life all that believe, and with the Light of Condemnation all that believe not: If you every one turn in your minds from the vanities of the World, unto the measure of the Light given you, a present Teacher in the Wayes of God; this Light will be in you, to direct your steps in Righteousness and Peace; for as it is written, The Lord is the Teacher of all his People, and all the false Teachers and Hirelings will be denyed; and the Scribes and Pharisees, and their leaven, will be born witness against, and the old man with all his deeds will be put off, and▪ the new Man will be put on, which is the Likeness and Image of the Father; and then will you witness the Life of the Scriptures, and in you they will be fulfilled, by
the Spirit that gave them forth, which Spirit all the Sons of God are guided by; and this Spirit the World cannot receive, no further then to be reproved by it of sin, and condemned for unrighteousness; and to every one who hath in the least received a measure of the Spirit, and is guided by it; to them only I leave what I have written, and the Writing answered to be judged, as in the sight of God, with an impartial mind. I have not striven for mastery through subtilty and de∣ceitful speeches but in innocency I have written to vindicate the Lord's Truth, from the Lyes of his Enemies who make i their work  render the Way of Truth odious, lest their deceits should be laid open, and they judged. And this same Giles Firmin hath done his part sufficiently herein, who hath not ceased ly∣ing and slandering, from the beginning to the end of his Book, unto which I might have written much more, yet desire not to multiply, words with such as are impudent, and cannot  when they have done evil▪ but to the main Particu∣lars, a few to each of them I have written, passing by much unsavory stuff pro∣ceeding from a light vain spirit, (as is easily discernd by the Children of Light) who hath made both Foundations and Arguments very Lyes, and hath laid things to our charge, which we never knew, nor by word or Writing was ever declared; but thou Giles F. hast filled up thy measure of wickedness, according to thy abi∣lity; hadst thou been more subtil, thy work would have been more deceitful: Therefore repeat of thy wickeness, and go not on in thy perverse, way of un∣cleanness, lest thou be cut off with an utter destruction, and repentance be hid from thy eyes. And to the foolish babling story, in the end of thy Book, I do Answer, thou sayst a Minister now in Essex gave the Narration, &c. but hast deceitfully concealed his name, and so he and thou well may, as being ashamed thereof, in laying, slanders too foolish to subscribe his name unto: Yet is Thomas Tillam known, his name and nature; whose Testimony is like thine, and a Minister like unto thee; who was, and is known in all the Parts about Hexam to be a deceitful Fellow; one who prea∣ched for Hire, and sought for his Gain from his Quarter, as is well known; who also made merchandise of souls, through coveteousness with feigned words. And though T. Tillam be or was an Anabaptist, and contrary to thee in his Opi∣nion, yet if he will but give a bubling Slander against us thou wilt belieive him, and call him a Minister; but his wickedness is well noted,, who for wickedness and filthiness, was cast out and denied of the Assembly whereof he was the Pastor; and stands this day as one cast off by them, who are a little more honest than thou and he, though yet Strangers to us, and Opposers of us: And now in that your deceits are discovered, you flee to any bubble for a strength, and make Lyes your refuge, and yet justifie your selves and condemn the Innocent. And thy last Story is an abominable Lye; and a man that hath honesty in either hand or heart, would be ashamed to utter such things; but in plainness of speech, thy Lyes and Slanders I do deny, and unto thee I do return them again, with true Judgment upon them, and dare not flatter thee, nor speak peace unto the wicked; but to the Light of God in all Consciences I do stand clear, by it to be justified, when all the wicked are condemned.

THE Crying Sins Reproved, WHEREOF The Rulers and People of England are highly guilty; WITH Additions to their own Confessions held forth by them in a Declaration of their own, bearing date Septem. 23. wherein these three Nations are called to a Day of solemn Fasting, &c. With meek Exhortations to this present Parliament, that they take heed to themselves, lest they make the Guiltless to suffer upon the account of Blasphemy or Error, &c. while the Evil-Doers go free, and the false Prophets defended. HOw long, how long shall Gods righteous soul be grieved, and his  Spirit vexed with the vain oblations and offerings of them whose hear are far from him, even after their Idols, and in their covetousness, and earthly honours of this vain world, while they honor with their lips and profess love with their mouths in outward observances? How long Lord shall thy Enemies lean upon thee, and say, Is not the Lord amongst us? while they op∣press the Innocent, and make a prey upon the Upright, and tread thy glory un∣derfoot, and despise thy Law and Ordinances, and set at nought thy Children, and causeth them to suffer grievous burdens, under heavy hands of cruelty, every one smiting with the fist of wickedness? Wilt thou be pleased Lord with a Sacri∣fice of the unclean hands, given unto thee from polluted hearts, offered upon the Altars of mens own precepts in set times? Wilt thou be worshipped in mens i∣ventions and traditions, in a set day, of hanging down the head like a Bul ru for a moment? Canst thou accept a fast appointed by the will of man, while t bands of wickedness are not loosed, nor the Oppressed set free? And wilt thou be found in a way decreed by the Children of men, whose way is corrupt before thee? Yea, Lord God, men seeks, but not in thy own Way; and they call upon thee, but not in thy Spirit; and they press towards thee, but not at thy door; they ask of thee the Ordinance of Justice, and they delight in approaching to thee, and they are as a Nation that works righteousness, yet doth their, sins cry aloud in thy ear, and their Oppression and Backsliding calls for Vengeance upon their own heads: When will ye be wise ye Rulers, and learned you Judges of the Earth? for now the jealousie of the Lord burns like fire, and his wrath is kindled more then a little, and yet you do not trust in him; but in the day of your Fast you find your own pleasures, and in the day of your humiliation you hearts are lifted up in vain glory, and you presume in his Presence, and call him Lord, but doth not that which he commands; for the Oppressed is not eased, nor the Cap∣tive
is not freed, nor the hungry fed, nor the naked clothed; the Lords soul is wearied with you, and your Offrings unto him are as if you cut off a Dogs neck, and your Incense is unto him as if you blessed an Idol; you neglect the Fast which God hath chosen, and make unto your selves a Precept and a Day, in which your work is not accepted, whilst your fear towards him is taught by your own precepts, and they that fear the Lord mourn for you, and they that know his Way wish good towards you, that your eyes might see and your hearts understand that which belongs to your peace; but you despise the reproof of Instruction, and choose your own ways, and do that which is high in the sight of your own eyes; and you weary the Lord from day to day, and he is pressed under your iniqui∣ties as a Cart is pressed with Sheaves: And shall not his Soul be avenged upon you, and upon such a Nation as this, whose fear towards him is taught by the Precepts of men, and whose Worship of him is exercised in the vain Traditions of their own inventions? Hear ye Deaf, and look ye Blind, behold the Lord's Hand is upon you, and you know it not; his Judgments are nigh you, and you are not aware, but exalt your own horn, and some of you seek unto your selves a King∣dom to rule in oppression over the Poor and Needy, who cry to the Lord day and night under the heavy hand of cruel burdens, which lie upon the Innocent, but you will not touch them with one of your little Fingers: Wo is me for you, for your destruction comes upon you as an armed Man, and your desolation as an unresistable Flood; for you regard not the oppression of the Poor, but make it a thing of nought, you that pass by: Hear and consider ye Parliament of Eng∣land, ye are something concerned herein; if you mean to be established loose the oppression of the Innocent, and let the Oppressed go free; for this the Lord requires of you more then your Oblations and set dayes of Humiliation, wherein you make a shew of repentance to the Lord, and hang down the head for a day like a Bulrush, when your hearts are not truly upright to the Lord. A Declaration I have viewed, proceeding from you, as the first work of your hands; and therein you declare your selves to these three Nations, in seem∣ing relentings before the Lord [I wish your hearts were as you profess] and first you say, Such hath been the outgoing of God for his People in this our Generation; that non as men but must say, It is marvelous in our eyes; and none as Christians but must cry out, It is the Lords Doings. Unto which I shall answer, Indeed true it is, that the out-goings and dealings of the Lord hath been, and are mighty, and are wonderful in this Nation, even for his People, which now are trodden upon, and oppressed, to the shame of some of you; and indeed some of you were partakers in a good degree of his Power and Out-goings with you, while you stood in his Counsel, and then it was marvelous in your eyes, and you could cry out, It is the Lords Doings. But Friends, will you consider how you now stand, and into what ye are fallen; so as that instead of being the Lords People, you are turned Enemies to the Lords People, and he is departed from you, and hardly goes out with you any more: While ye were little in your own eyes ye loved Justice and Judgmet, but now you are exalted and lifted up, and have forgotten the marvelous doing of our God; and Judgment is turned backward; and Equity is fallen, and the hand of oppression is laid heavy upon the Lords Servants: Oh, that you would lay it to heart before the decree be sealed against you, when no time of repentance can be found by you. And further you say. [He] the Lord hath alwayes been a ready Help in the time of need, and never did his poor Servants seek his Face in vain, neither did he ever lend a deaf Ear to the voice of their weeping. To which I answer, Verily its true, he is alwayes a ready help for us his Ser∣vants in time of need, neither did we ever seek his Face in vain, even when we lay under the grievous oppressions of the Enemy; nor you your selves (some of you) sought not in vain while your hearts were upright with him, but had the Deliverance desired by you out of the hands of all your Enemies, and their
necks to tread upon, but it is not so now, inasmuch as you are become va formal Seekers, and Hypocritical Fasters; and a deaf Ear will the Lord lend to you, and to the voice of your weeping, till you remove the Oppression from off the neck of the Distressed; and you shall seek his face and find no answer from him, for the Vision shall fail unto you; and though you howl unto him, and ca upon him, yet will he hide his Face more and more, and leave you to your selves, and will not regard the voice of your crying; and though you have found him a present Help in time of trouble, and of your need in the day of your Integrity, yet trouble and destruction shall come upon you, and no help from him shall you find, till you return to him with all your hearts and spirits, and lay down your own crowns, and exalt him the Lord of Glory, who is now appearing in Power. And further you say, In the midst of Such unequalled and signal Mercies, how gre hath been and is your ingratitude and unfruifulness. To which I answer, Truely have you spoken, to your own shame; for your in∣gratitude and unfruitfulness exceed many that went before you, which justly were cut off for the very sins of which you are highly guilty; and more may I add unto your confession, How great hath been and is your Oppressions, a Pride, and Vain-glory, and Self-exaltings, and hypocritical Fastings, and Con∣fessions with your mouths, when your hearts are far from the Lord; yea,  your Mercies have been unequalled, so your sins cannot be numbred, as thou you sinned that grace might abound, or did evil that good might come; or to liberty to your own hearts lusts, from your former Mercies and Deliveranc received. Then further you say, Should the Lord say unto you, as once he did unto Ephraim, Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone; that same Sentence would be your ∣sert; as insensibility is your crime, so it might be too justly made your punishment. Answer, Yea verily the Lord may say so unto you, many of ye Rulers  England are joyned to Idols, let them alone; and that same Sentence is your ∣sert, but insensibility is not wholly your crime; for you have had a day of vi∣tation from the Lord, in warning of you by the mouth of his Servants, and y are not altogether unsensible of your crime of great Oppressions, and false Wor∣ships, and Idol Shepherds Oblations, which you are joyned unto, and your pu∣nishment will justly be the same; for the time comes that it shall be Darkness a Night upon you; and you shall seek the Word of the Lord but shall not  it; for God will smite your Idol Shepherds, and break down your Idols Alta of vain Traditions; and the Lord will leave you to your selves to wallow i Darkness, and in the way of Death; and the Servants of the Lord shall le you alone, and shall no more weary themselves with seeking to reclaim you. And further you say, Who hath been melted with Mercy? Who hath been broken b Iudgments? A sinful Nation; A People laden with iniquity; A seed of Evil-do; Children that are Corrupters: They have forsaken the Lord; they have provoked the ∣ly One of Israel to Anger; they are gone away backwards; Why should ye be stricken  more? ye will revolt more and more. And further you say, As those sad words do C∣racterise us as filthy as those of Judah; so if that sad destruction should also be our doom,  could not but acknowledge the Lord is righteous in all his Wayes. Answ. Verily few of you have been melted by Mercies, or broken by Judg∣ments, but are a sinful Nation, a People laden with iniquity, a feed of Evil∣doers; and ye have read your own Character fully; for you have forsaken the Lord, and are Children that are Corrupters, and are gone away backward, an provoke the Holy One of Israel to Anger; and true it is, Why should you he strick∣en any more, or warned? For you will revolt, and turn aside more and more; how truly have you numbred up the sum of your own state, even to your shame and confusion of face, and to the justifying of the Lord, when he in Vengeance ap∣pears to judge you, and even assuredly that sad denunciation will be your doom, and the same Judgments shall overtake you when the Seed is gathered out from
among you, even desolation of Cities, and madness of Prophets, and God will smite you together with confusion, and you shall not bring forth deliverance in the Land, neither shall the Nations have peace in your dayes, while you revolt when you are stricken, and persecute the Innocent when they warn you. And in the day of your recompence, you shall indeed confess to your condemna∣tion, that the Lord is righteous in all his ways; and further you say, How deeply have you grieved your God, in not mourning as you ought, for that profainness and bness that is so ripe amongst you, even under such means of knowledge and grace, and in not being sensible under, nor making a sanctified use of those rebukes you have of late received. Answ. Yea, you have, and do daily even in your set days, and times of Fasting, deeply grieve the Lord God, in not mourning and fasting, with a heart prepared to the Lord, but even in hypocrisie, and even for strife and debate: indeed igno∣rance, and prophaneness, and barrenness abounds among you, and you are ripe therein to be cut down for the fire, even the more ye are inexcusable, because you have neglected the Messages of the Grace of God, and means of knowledge from the Mouth of the Lords despised Servants, whom you have persecuted, even in cruelty, some of them unto death, and have imprisoned others unjustly, while your false Prophets and Diviners have been set up by you, who have daubed you with untempered Morter; and you have made your hearts unsensible, by hearden∣ing your hearts against reproof and rebukes, which some of you of late have re∣ceived; the Messengers of which rebukes have been evil and shamefully entreated in your Towns, Steeple-houses, and High-wayes, and elsewhere in your Domini∣ons; and how should you but be ignorant, and prophane, and barren, while you cannot receive the Message of Light, but stumbles at Christ Jesus the Light of the World, and cannot believe in the Light wherewith Christ Jesus hath enlightened every one of you, which is the way to knowledge, and to receive righteousness into your Souls, and therein to be fruitfull to the Lord. And you say, Every individual man hath helpd to fill up the msure of their s; First, in not improving ercs so fully as might he been to is glory from  they were received. I answer, Indeed I believe not one of you may be excused in the sight of God, but are all guilty in filling up the measure of transgression, and even i not impro∣ving mercies to the glory of God; for had you improved the great mercies of your Deliverance and Conquest over your Enemies, the Nations had been in peace and rest before this day; but you strove to glorifie your selves, and sought a King∣dom of Riches and Honour to your selves, and who might be the greatest and the highest, to the pleasure of some, and to the grief of others; and you impro∣ved mercies to your selves, and not to him that gave them; and therefore is your Dominions filled with distractions, and fears, and troubles are on every side, and your Dominions are as broken Vessels that cannot be joyned together, but are full of wickedness, and false Sects, and Idol-worships, and in your own Councels are you filled with confusions: and thus it is justly come to pass upon you, because of your transgressions. Again you say, In the s neglect and wt of Activity, Resolution and Integrity in Magistrates, and others impowered therein, for the punishment and suppression of Vice and crying Enormities. I answer, True, it is a sad neglect; and want of Activity and Integrity in the Magistrates hath been, and is, to punish and suppress vice; and therefore it abounds in all fulness in the very Streets, and it hath been wholly contrary; for Vice hath gone at liberty, while the Magistrates, and such who have been im∣powered, have been active, and full of rigour, and no neglect found in them to punish (or rather to oppress and suppress) the Innocent and Meek of the Earth, and even they have done violence to the Harmless, witness most parts of Prisons this day in England, how many have been beat and abused, and haled, and knock∣ed down with Staves, in the sight of some of the Magistrates, and how many have been imprisoned for passing on the High-wayes, and through their Towns, and some for declaring against Vice and crying Enormities, which one day must be
laid to yours and their charge; for a sad neglect hath been for want of Justice and true Judgment, and they that have been impowered, have turned their power against the Lord, and have been active to lay their Sword upon the guiltless, while the guilty have gone free, witness many who have been beat in your Steeple-houses by violent men, and afterwards committed to Prison, while the Peace-breakers and Violent have gone free; and indeed it is time to lay these things to heart; for till you purge your selves from these iniquities, you shall never be established, nor your Dominions in peace; for these things, and such like abominations are you filled with distractions, and fears compass you about, and that justly from the hand of the Lord, as the Light in your Consciences shall answer in the dreadfull day of account, which cometh suddenly upon you. Again you say, In the abominable blasphemies vented and spread of late through the Apo∣stacy of, and the abuse of liberty, by many professing Religion. Answ. No doubt but Blasphemy is a crying sin, whereof the Land is guilty, if you were able to judge thereof but rather indeed this cause is not rightly stated; for you call that Blasphemy, which is Truth, such is the grievous ignorance of some of you: And this, I am sure, is your greater sin, condemning the guiltless, rather then suffering the guilty in this particular. Friends, beware, lest your judgment be so corrupted, that you call evil good, and good evil, and thereupon approve the evil, and reprove the good, being given up to hardness of heart, and blindness of mind; and such were the sins of the Rulers in Israel, who persecuted the true Prophets under the account of Blasphemy, and such like, and approved of the Prophets that prophesied falsly, and of the Priests that bore rule by their means; for the People loved to have it so, Ier. 5. My soul wisheth that you Rulers may be wise, and ye Judges may be learned in this particular, lest you go in the way of your fore-fathers to destruction, persecuting the Innocent without cause, through false judgment of the way of Truth, which may be called by you Heresie and Blasphemy, who in the blindness of your minds cannot discern of the things of God; for in that way which the wisdom of the World calls He∣resie, do we worship the God of our Fathers: and verily, so much the more I may warn you herein, to take heed for the time to come, because you have some of you been highly guilty of this transgression of late, even in condemning the guilt∣less concerning this offence; so that thus for you I may more truly state the particular, In the abominable violence and oppressions acted of late upon the Innocent, and them who have worshipped God in the Spirit, through the wickedness of some Rulers, and the abuse of liberty, by them, which have professed love to God and his Way, through the false judgments, and unsa∣voury opinions of many, who have called Truth Error, and the Way of God Blasphemy: And this is your sin, of which, if you that are guilty repent not, and turn from it, and beware of it for time to come, your honour shall fall into the dust, and your fall shall be more deeper into confusion and destruction then any that have yet gone before you; for of late the Lord powerfully hath begun to work, and to vent his Truths through the Mouthes of his Servants, and to bring out of the Apostacy and Blasphemies (which hath reigned since the dayes of the Apostles) the true and pure Religion, which stands in the exercise of a pure Conscience. Again you say, In the little love and tenderness which is even amongst Professors them∣selves towards one another, who whilest they contend for things disputeable, lose th which is certain, even charity; without which they become as sounding Brass, or tink∣ling Cymbals. Answ. This is also your sin, and the sin of the Nation, want of love and ten∣derness in Professors towards God, and one towards another; and that love which appears, is but the shew, and in the form and likeness of things, and not from the true ground of love and peace; and these are they that hate the Light, and walk not in the Light wherewith Christ Jesus hath lighted every man that comes into the World, in which the unity of the Saints doth stand, and in which their love is one to another; and they that are out of the Light, are without charity,
which is the bond of perfection; and these that know not the Light of Christ, to guide them in the Wayes of God, are in all their profession, and words; and acti∣ons, as sounding Brass, and as a tinkling Cymbal, and these are they that are in the Disputes, and Contentions, and Strife about the Letter, drawing their own Consequences and Deductions from it, in their own wisdom, and knowledge, and sensual understanding, and those lose the Substance, and know not that which is certain, Christ Jesus in them, to be Ruler over them; but are as dry Trees, to be plucked up; and all their Profession will wither, and all their pretended love will perish, and their shew of things in the outward appearance will be confound∣ed, who know not the Light of Christ to guide them; which Light is the ground of true love and tenderness, and brings to the knowledge of things certain, out of the contention of things disputable. But further you say, In allowing difference in Forms, more power to divide Christians, then Agreements in fundamentals has to unite them, one of the dangerousest and fruitfulest seeds that hath been sown by the envious One. Answ. Christians are they that follow Christ Jesus, who are not so only in name, but in practice; and they are one, and cannot be divided as they walk in the Light which comes from Christ, who is the Foundation, or Fundamental Principle of the Religion, which is not in Form but in Power, agreeing in the Foundation, and in the whole building: But Friends, you seem to charge the late Powers of the Nation, if not your selves, yet some part of your Body, which now are in power, with great things, with no less then to be Satans Seedsmen; for if allowing difference in Forms be the dangerousest and fruitfullest Seed that ever was sown by the envious One, as you say it is; then who do you blame, either the fore-going Parliaments, of which some of you have been, and so cannot be clear from that evil, or the Protector himself? and this seem to be a very great charge upon him (whose judgment is appearingly to give allowance unto diffe∣rence in Forms) to be the Seedsman of Satan, or to allow the envious One to sow the Seed which you call dangerous; it is not Christians that are divided, but the Sects and false Opinions, men of corrupt minds. Thus much in answer to the words as they are laid down: but I rather chuse to speak to the mind or intent of the Penmans spirit of your Declaration, which im∣plieth an inclining to be against many Forms, and to bind up all into one Form of Worship; and so thereby, though some which is evil would be shut out, yet would the true spiritual Worship of the Saints above all assuredly thereby be exclu∣ded, and the tender spirits of People, who truly seek God, would be oppressed: But keep your selves from that evil, I warn you, lest you be broken, and never bound up; and lay no Law, nor make no Law upon Religion; but let Religion defend it self; only lay your Law upon Peace-breakers, and violent men, and bind not mens Consciences to a Worship by your Precepts, either made already, or by such as may be made; if you ease the Oppressed, so God will establish you in peace, if you fulfil his Will herein. Again you say, In not being fully sensible, though the Lord in the depth of his wisdoms and righteous Iudgments hath for some years last past been overturning several Authorities in these Nations, and hath, as it were, been pouring them from Vessel to Vessel, he hath been pleased ever since his people publickly contended for his Truths, still to set up Rulers who have allowed them the free exercise and profession of them. Answ. Indeed you are not sensible of the righteous Judgments of God in over∣turning several Authorities in the Nation; and therefore you go in the same abo∣minations as they did who were overturned, till you also be overturned, as they were: But take heed to your selves lest you be more then poured from Vessel to Vessel, even spilt in the dust of misery, and never more gathered again. Your last part of this particular is false, for we that are in the pure Religion, and in the Exercise of our pure Consciences, have not from some of you our Liberty, but are cast into Goals and Dungeons, and banished out of yo Towns and Ci∣ties some of us, by some that have been Rulers set up; if this be doubted by you, examine through your Nation, true testimony may be given; so that here you
have spoken better of the Rulers then indeed it is, and would make the Nation believe untruths to establish you; though I condemn not all, but my words are towards the Guilty, that they may repent, lest they perish in their ini∣quities, and be cut off in their transgressions, and the Curse be upon you all for the sake of some. Again you say, In that Athiestical and luke-warm Spirit, too commonly agst you, whereby not only the Form, but also the Power of Godliness is reproached, and ac∣counted as a vain thing; but also too many have fallon from their first love, and others este themselves rich whilst they are miserable poor, and blind, and naked; sins which e the highest aggravated, by being committed in Countries where the glorious Light of the Gos∣pel shins clearest. Answ. This you have confessed truly to your own shame, in the sight of other Na∣tions; your spirit is not only luke-warm unto Righteousness, but it is too m∣mon among some of you to be zealous and hot in persecuting the Way of Righ∣teousness; and indeed many of you are grosly fallen from your first Love and In∣tegrity, and thereby the Power of Godliness is not only reproached by you, but persecuted and counted vile, and they that live in it oppressed; such is your zeal in your dead Form, some of you, that even you count the true Way and Worship of God madness; and you are the men that esteem your selves rich while you are miserable, and blind, and naked, and your sins are aggravated the more and higher, because God gives you warning daily by the mouth of his Servants, who hold forth the Light of the glorious Gospel, and bears witness unto your faces against your Abominations and Idolatries committed by you, yet for all this you continue in your iniquities, and evil entreat the Messenge of Peace unto you souls, and are the men indeed which are Athiestical, ev many by their work, saying in their hearts there is no God, and as truly as yo have confessed your sins, so must you confess the justness of the Judgments of God upon your own heads, if you return not unto the living God, and own the day of your Visitation. Again you say, In being more dissatisfied that you have not obtained all you aimd , then thankful that you have obtained so much as you now enjoy. Answ. Verily this is not the least of your sins, but exceed some others; fr you aim at that which you shall never obtain till you be thankful, and walk wor∣thy of what you enjoy; and this is the way, Ease the Oppressed, and take of the yoke of the Poor and Needy, and of the Lord you may be heard; and seek not your own honour, for that is the ground of dissatisfaction and unthankfulness among you, and the cause why you abuse the Mercies which you do enjoy, having lost the sence of the former dealings of the Lord with you. Further you say, All which, with other the grievous sins of these three Nations ca aloud upon all the good People in them, to lie low in the sight of our offended God; and b Prayer and Humiliation (away which in our deepest distresses we have found both our D∣ty and Comfort to tread in) to seek to appease his Wrath; and that he would be pleased f his own Names sake to remove whatever accursed thing there is found amongst us; and the as he is our God, so we may be his People. Answ. Indeed, many more grievous sins are highly abounding in these three Nations, your own oppressions, and self-seeking honours, and vain glories in your self-performed righteousness, with your persecution of the Innocent by grievous unjust Fines and Imprisonment, not regarding the cry of the Poor, which lie under the heavy hand of Oppression, of you subordinate Rulers; these aboundantly add to the measure of the iniquity of these three Nations, all which abomination cry aloud for vengeance upon the heads of some of you rather then for humiliation; for sin cries not for humility, this is your ignorance; but the good People of God do lie low in his sight, whom you highly offend every day; and they lament you, and suffer under your iniquities, though you reward many of them with persution, and hard censures of cruel dealings, till of which your wickedness you repent, and turn from it, all your Prayers, and Humilations, and set Dayes of seeking God in your rebellious hypocritical hearts, shall never ap∣pease
God's Wrath, but the rather shall add thereunto, and kindle it more aboun∣dantly against you: Away with your vain Oblations, and false divining Pro∣phets; they are a weariness to the Lord, and his hand is against them, while your hearts are not upright before him; & though sometimes some of you have found God near in deep distress when you called upon him, even when your hearts were in a measure upright with him; yet in vain you now set your selves to seek him, and your cry he will not hear; nor his Wrath shall not be appeased; for you have tru∣ly confessed the cursed thing is amongst you, even the Idolatry of the deepest na∣ture, both in Teachers and People; and till you repent and remove every burden from off the Innocent, the cursed thing cannot be taken away; but for his Names sake, which is Equity, and Justice, Judgment must he bring upon your heads, and unto you he will be a God of Vengeance, and unto him shall you be a People of his Curse, except you break off your sins by Righteousness, and your iniquities by shewing mercy to the Poor. Further you say, and this you desire, That he will infatuate the Counsels, and de∣feat the designs of those that labour to exalt themselves against the Interest of his Son and his People. Answ. Friends, you or some of you are the men that seek to exalt your selves (and not it) and therefore against the Son of God and his People; instance the unjust suffering of many of God's People, who know the Son in them to rule them under your Laws upheld by you, and acted in by some of your selves; and you say in your hearts you will not have this man to reign over you, for you own not the Bringers of that Message, but uphold your false Prophts, which speak smooth things to you, and cry Peace while you follow your own wayes; and verily, herein you go to seek God against your selves, to your own destruction, as being some of you the very men guilty of the Abominations which you set and propound to your selves in your Humiliation to pray against: Your Eyes are blind, and your Hearts unbelieving, and ye know not what you do; and your own Counsels and Designs, or so much of them at least, as are against the In∣nocent, are sure to be infatuated and defeated, and you shall receive from the Lord the answer of your requests upon your own heads; for you labour against the Interest of the Son, while you seek to bind any mans Conscience to this or that Worship. Again you say, That he will be pleased in a most special manner to vouchsafe his Presence to those who are entrusted with the Management of the Affairs of these Na∣tions. Answ. If you do his Will, and fulfil his Ordinances of Justice and Equity to∣wards all men, not seeking your selves in any thing, but the Lord in all things, and wait on him in his Light, by which Christ lightneth every one of you, to be guided thereby in all your wayes, then his Presence you may enjoy in a special manner, in the managing of all Affairs to his Glory; but if you keep not the Conditions of the Lord in seeking his Honour only, and in denying your selves, his Presence you shall not find with you, but shall be filled with desolations and contentions; and the Nations over whom you are entrusted shall not have Peace nor Deliverance in your days, but they under you shall have Confusion and Oppres∣sions, and the special Pretence of the Lord shall not be shown to you or them; and remember this is a Warning to you. Again you say, That he will appear, the Mighty Councellor experimentally unto them. Answ. If you stood in his Counsel, and walk in uprightness of heart before him in the Light of Christ Jesus, then will he appear to be mighty in his Counsel with you and for you; otherwise you shall be given up to follow the counsel of your own hearts, which shall never bring forth good, but evil to your selves, and to your whole Nations; and this shall you know experimentally by the Light in your own Consciences. Again you say, That he would in all things spirit you unto the Work unto which you
are called, and give you unity among your selves, even the best Unity, that of the Spirit, in the best Bond, that of Peace; that as you are a People abounding in Mercies, so you may abound in returns. Answ. The work is great unto which you are called, and shall hardly be accom∣plished by you, except you receive the Spirit of the Lord, to be ruled therewith in your own hearts; for if you rule for him, you must first be ruled by him, [Mark] and ordered with his Light, which will condemn every evil affection in you; and this is the Spirit of Unity in the best Bond of Peace, which is most precious, which brings forth a humble walking with the Lord in all righteousness before him; and being led every one in particular with this Spirit, and united to God, and one to another, in not seeking your selves, but the Lord: This is the Way where God's Blessing is received, and a re∣turning unto him of praise for his Mercies; but I wish you are not rather ad∣ding sin unto sin, and fulfilling the measure more and more of your transgres∣ssions, till the Wrath of the Lord break forth against you to confound you for∣ever. Again you say, And that at last through the unwearied goodness of our God these three Nations, after such memorable revolutions, may be setled upon the sure foundations of Truth, Mercy and Peace, and his People henceforth being delivered from their Enemies, may serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the dayes of their lives. Answ. Verily the goodness of God hath been unwearied to these three Nati∣ons, in many respects it appeareth, and many memorable revolutions hath come to pass in this last Age, even in cutting down one Power and Authority of Oppression after another, till many great Mountains are removed, and the Nations levelled; and the Lord is now bringing his great Work to pass i overturning once and again, till his Reign and his Kingdom be exalted over all in Truth and Righteousness; and if you shorten not your hand in your Op∣positions and Persecutions, your selves shall also be overturned, that God may in Righteousness settle these Nations (which remain as a wavering Leaf, and as an ungirded Vessel, full of strife and distraction, fears and jealousies) eve among your own selves, unsetled in your Wayes and Thoughts in Truth, Mercy and Peace; but in Gainsayings, and Oppositions, and Confusions, stand tot∣tering like a rotten Hedge; and the Proud are exalted, and the poor are despi∣sed, and they that love Sion are set at nought; and verily you go not the way to settle the Nations upon the true Foundation, but backslides from the Way of Truth: Which is the Foundation, upholding of iniquity, and establishing the false Prophets and Diviners by a Law; and such whom the Lords wrath is against, who upholds the horrible filthy thing, and abominations of the Earth; and confusion is upon them, till they be overthrown, never to deceive the Na∣tions more? Therefore hear ye Deaf, and look ye Blind, and understand ye Hard-hearted, love Truth, and Mercy, and Peace in your own hearts, and and depart from Iniquity; and cast away your Idols, and cease from evil, and learn to do well; and put away the evil of own doings, and turn to the Lord in this the day of your Visitation, and to the Light of Christ Jesus, where∣with he hath lightened you; take heed thereby to be guided every one in par∣ticular, in fear and tenderness, towards God, and towards man; not ruling in Tyranny and Oppression, nor making Laws in your own wills, according to your own thoughts, as some that went before you have done, till they were cut off, as you are Witnesses, who were made in the Hand of the Lord their Ex∣ecutioners; and if you follow in any measure their Example of Wickedness, take them for an Example in a cursed end; in love to all your Souls this I write, and not to shame you in your wickedness, but rather that you may repent, and that you may know how to exercise your selves in the Law of God to∣wards the Nations, and that every Burden may be removed, and the Oppressed may go free, and the Bands of Iniquity may be broken; and this is the Fast ac∣cepted
of the Lord, required of him from you, which if you observe with your whole hearts, a Blessing will the Lord made you unto the Nations in this pre∣sent Age, and unto your selves for evermore; but if you hearden your hearts against the Lord, and tread in the steps of your fore-fathers, and seek to limit the Holy One, or to bind the tender Consciences of the People of God, then shall you fall into their perdition, and be swallowed up in everlasting confusi∣on, and your Memorial shall stink in Generations to come, and shall be a hissing among the Heathen Kingdoms, and deliverance will God bring ano∣ther way unto his People, to your overthrow, if you walk not in the Counsel of the Lord. And whereas upon the considerations and purposes aforesaid, you have order∣ed, that a Day be observed and kept for solemn Humiliation, and seeking the Face of God, through the mediation of Christ, in England, Scotland and Ireland. To which, in much tenderness of spirit I desire to say, That if you seek his Face in the hard∣ness of your hearts, and in the way of your own precepts, while the yoke of the great Oppressions in the Nations are not broken from off the neck of the Poor, his Face you shall not behold, though you seek it, but in vain shall you weary your selves, and shall travel without issue, as to that which you desire, and his Countenance shall be hid from you, till he shew his Face for evil against you, and not for good; and to you it shall be said, To what purpose are your Oblations, and your solemn Meeting? Who hath required it at your hands? even your own doings and appointed Altars of Inventions, which the Lord can∣not accept from you: Therefore give ear ye Mountains, and listen ye tall Ce∣dars; if you establish the false Prophets, which makes a prey upon the people, through covetousness, and which acteth the abominations of Israel, in preach∣ing for Hire, and divining for Money, and in crying peace to the wicked, by a Law, and maintain them through the oppression of the Poor, in the cry∣ing Oppression of Tythes, or otherwise imposing such things upon the tender Consciences by any Act or Statute made or allowed by you, God shall not hear your cry, nor answer your request, nor ever establish you in peace, nor the Nations over which you are set likewise, if you make a Law, or allow such a one to be acted, which any way may tye or limit the Spirit of the Lord in any of his Servants, from reproving the abominations of the Times in Ru∣lers, Teachers, or People, in your Streets or Temples, or places otherwise, at any time whatsoever, the Lord will not hold you guiltless; nay assuredly, if you do but hide your face from the Suffering of such, who through the wickedness of some under you, may be afflicted upon such an account, you shall not be alto∣gether Innocent, but Gods hand shall be upon you likewise: If any for Con∣science sake deny to Swear, upon any account, according to the former vain Customs of the Nations, trained up thereto in ignorance and blindness in humane tradi∣tions, and thereupon suffer Imprisonment, or Fining, or otherwise howsoever, by any Order from you, or any subordinate Powers, you shall be guilty in the sight of God of that suffering the Innocent in such a cause; much more shall you be guilty, if by any means, in any cause, upon any condition, men be compel∣led by any Authority of this Nation to swear; likewise, if any suffer for not bowing the Hat, or Knee to any of you, or any of your Judges or under Offi∣cers, and thereupon be accounted Transgressors, the Lord shall account such things Oppression from your hands, and Tyranny and Cruelty, and you shall not escape unpunished; as the Lord lives, these, and many more Abominations cries for Vengeance against some of you, who have had your hands deeply dipped in such Oppression; and therefore to you this is a Warning to break off these sins by righ∣teousness, and these evils by true repentance, lest your Fasts prove only for Strife, and to smite with the fist of Wickedness: Clear your selves, and wash you hands from these Abominations, lest the fruit of them be given you to eat for Food; and let this, oh ye Rulers, be acceptable councel unto you, that the
dayes of Happiness may appear, and the long expected and waited for day of Li∣berty may yet dawn through this dark night of Bondage which overshadows your heads, that you cannot behold the glory of the Son, and herein shall you be esta∣blished, and we shall have cause to bless the Lord for you, and with you; other∣wise you shall never be renowned; but all your counsels and purposes shall fail, and be cursed of the Lord, and evil shall be upon you, and upon the Nation for your sakes. And all you that fear God, listen and give audience, and let the fear of the Lord be before your eyes, and keep your selves pure from the iniquities which the rest love to drink in; and though your power be shorter, and your vote lower then the uprightness of your hearts desire, yet unto God be faithfull, in bearing your Testimony for him, and against all that which, with the Light of Jesus, yo see to be contrary to him, and be awaked unto Righteousness, Judgment and Mercy; the Light is springing over your heads, and the day of the Lord is dawn∣ing out of darkness, and a Seed is sown in your Dominions which cannot be roo∣ed out, till it have overspread the Earth, with the precious Fruit thereof; and though it be striven against to be plucked up, yet shall the Branch and Root thereof be everlastingly renowned; for it is of the true Jew, and he that falls before it shall never more rise up again. And this is by a true Lover of your Souls, in faithfulness to God given forth  your sakes who fear the Lord. EDWARD BURROUCH
A 1697 Measure of the Times, AND A Full and Clear Description of the Signs of the Times, and of the Changing of the Times; and of the Reign of Antichrist, who hath long reigned, and of his down-fall, which is at hand; And of the King∣dom of Christ, which is now setting up in the Earth. Shewing unto all People in all Nation what the State of things have been in Ages past, and what the State of thing are at this present day; and also, what shall be the State of things hereafter, which suddenly cometh to pass, the time is at hand, for times, are changing, and renewing, and the Kingdoms of this World shall be translated into the Kingdom of the Son of God. And also here is manifest, concerning Teachers of this Age, and the Root from whence they sprang, who are manifest to be of that stock of false Prophets, which Christ prophesied of should come, and which the Apostles saw was com∣ing in their dayes, and how that the night of darkness hath been upon all, for many Generations: and how that the Beast hath reigned over Nations and Kingdoms, and his false Prophet hath deceived the whole World, who have all worshiped the Beast, and wandred after him, who have warred against the Saints, and overcome them, and the whole Earth hath been made drunk with the Abominations. And also, The Restauration is described, which shortly cometh, wherein Christ shall Reign, whose right it is, and shall change Laws and Decrees; and the Lamb shall be the Light of all Nations, and there shall be no need of any other, light, when the Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of Christ, and he alone shall bear the Government, and no other King; for he shall rule all Nations with his Iron Rod; and the Kingdoms of the Beast shall be over∣thrown, and his power subdued, and they that have given their power to him shall be ashamed, and all the Kings of the Earth shall lay their Crown down at the feet of the Lamb, and the numberless number of the Saints is gathering, and the Dominion shall be in their hands, and their King shall possess the utter∣most parts of the Earth. THe Lord hath opened my heart to declare; and the words of my mouth shall be the words of Truth, and of a good Understanding, to every one who hath an ear to hear; whose ear the Lord hath opened to hear, and understand things of old, and the state of things as they have been in Ages, and Generations past; and as now the state of things are at this day. Hearken and consider, and let your ears be open to Instruction; For the Word of the Lord is towards you, that your hearts might understand the things that belong to your Peace, now in your dayes, before the time come that they be hi from your eyes, and your eyes be darkened, never more to perceive, but you le to perish, and to dye with the Uncircumcised. Behold▪ and give ear, ye Inhabitants of the World; see and consider, in what state you are fallen; even in a time of Darkness and Apostacy, wherein thick Darkness covered all the World, and a vail of Ignorance the faces of all
People: Death hath reigned King over all, and the Cloud of thick Blindness hath lain on the hearts of all men. O how hath Darkness, Blindness, and Ignorance covered all men, even as a Cloak and a Garment? How hath the Eye been blind∣ed, the Ear stopped, and the Heart hardened? So that the Lord God, and his Way, his Truth, and Salvation hath not been manifestly known, heard, not selt, nor witnessed, for Ages and Generation: the words thereof have been pro∣fessed, but the Life and Power thereof hath not been enjoye; But men have been deceived with the Form of Godliness without the Power, and cheated with a likeness of things without Life, and have sought the living among the dead, and worshipped Idols, which have been without sence and understanding; and with lying imaginations, and feigned likenesses, hath the carnal part (which ruled in People above the Seed of God) been fed, and with shadows, and out∣ward appearances, and the soul hath been starved. Alas, alas! wo is me, because of these things; my heart within me is broken, and I am perplexed. The shadow of Death hath been the lodging Place of all People, and the vail of Ignorance hath been a Covering, and the darkness of Heart hath been followed for a Law, and a blind Understanding hath been the Guide  Ordinances and Statutes, and Death in the beastly power hath ruled as King in all the Dominions of the Earth, and in all mens hearts; and men have been with∣out the Wisdom of God, even every eye blind, and every ear deaf, and ry tongue dumb, and every heart corrupt and void of understanding, and every  lame, and all men have been altogether imperfect; for the living God hath bee as a Stranger unto the Children of men, less known by men then the Own the Ox, and less perceived then the Crib by the Ass, and all flesh hath corrupted its way before Lord. Wo is me! when I consider how man, who was planted with the chosen , even God's Image, and was a noble Plant, is degenerated into the Plant of a strange Vine unto God, and bring forth wild Grapes, and sower Grapes, wd the Lord's Soul loathes; and thus hath the Vineyard and the Plants th rewarded the Husbandman, with Fruit of a bitter taste, and with the reward corruption; And man is condemned in his transgression, for want of the K∣ledge of God, more then the Ox and the Ass. Pride, Covetousness, Lust, and Envy, Backbiting, Lying, Drunkenness, W∣dom, Theft, Murder, and all manner of evil and sin against God, more the can be expressed, is abounding and superabounding among men in this Gee∣ration, Iniquity is grown to the full, the measure is up, and the number o transgression is sealed, that the Lord may arise; who hath been pressed as a Ca with Sheaves; and now is the Lord arising, and he hath said, Ah, I will ease of my Adversaries, and be avenged on my Oppressors. And Vengeance belong to him, and he will repay, and will destroy the Vineyard with the Plants and Fr thereof, and the Bryars and Thorns shall be consumed; and he will lay waste, an devour, and confound all his Enemies in a day, when his Indignation goes sorth, and his Sword is made bare, and his Purpose cometh to pass, in rooting out t oppressive seed of Evil-doers, which have filled his Habitation, (wherein he shol dwell) with cursed Children, and a brood of evil Births. In the dayes of Christ and his Apostles was the Hand and Power of the  felt, and the Lord gat himself a Name, and a Glory; and he caused his m∣lous Light to spring forth, and his Day to dawn, and the Day was manifest tha many Prophets and Wise-men had desired to see, but was not in their time fee by them, and his Power was made known, and his Arm was made bare in the sight of many Nations; and in that day his Glory was spread abroad, and is Truth and Way was exalted, and his glorious Gospel was declared through  Earth, and the sound of his marvellous Works went forth into all the World Judgment and Mercy was known, and Righteousness and Peace was witne among men, and Life and Immortallity was brought to Light through the Gospel; and the Word of Life by which all things were created, and by which they stand, was handled, seen, felt, and tasted; and the Lord God in that Age was known to
dwell with his People; and to walk in them, and his Covenant was established with many, and his Promises were fulfilled; Redemption, Deliverance, and Salvation was revealed, even Christ Jesus the Son God, the Prince of Peace; And Righteousness was made manifest in the Sons of men, and revealed in many who saw God's Glory, and were Witnesses of his Majesty and Dominion, and were gathered unto him in the Bond of Peace, and were his Sons and Daughters, and were led by his Spirit in all his Wayes of Truth and Righteousness. And ma∣ny went forth into the World, and declared through Nations the things of Gods Kingdom, which was come to them, and was discovered within them; and the Lord God spake from Heaven by his Son unto them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost, and with Power. And the Lord was with them whom he called, and made them Wise, and their Word powerful, and their Message effectual, and their Weapons, were mighty through God, and strong Holds were subdued, and the Powers of Death and Darkness were subjected, and the Hearts of thousands were turned to God, and the Gospel was preached in power through the World, and many were brought to God, out of Darkness into Light, and from Satans Power unto God. And the Earth was filled with Light, and the mighty, and the wise, were confounded, and the bonds of cruel oppressions were broken, and they that set themselves against the Lord and his Way were confounded, and scattered, and brought to nought, though they were many in that Generation. How did all the chief Priests, and Scribes, and Pharisees, Elders of the Peo∣ple, and Rulers, and Governours lift up themselves in the Pride of their hearts, and took counsel together, and persecuted the Innocent, and put to Death and Imprisoned the Children of the Most High? How did they in the dayes of Christ persecute and seek for his Life, till they had taken it from the Earth, by their subtil∣ty and wickedness? The Apostles and Ministers of Christ were persecuted, some were put to death, and others suffered grievous things for the Name of Christ, and were made a Prey and a Spoil unto Destroyers, whose wickedness encreased against the Way of God, till it was fulfilled in its measure, and the Wicked with their work were dashed to peices; and the Lord gave his Way, and Truth, and Servants dominion and power over all his enemies, and whole Nations were brought to the knowledge of God and his Wayes, and his Name was glorious, and his Kingdom was exalted in the Earth, and many were his People, who were gather∣ed by him, and his powerful Word through the mouth of his Ministers, whom he ordained and called, who were Fisher-men, and such like, who were chosen to fulfil his Will, and to do his Work, and not many Wise-men of the World were called, but God chose the foolish things to confound the wise then, as he doth now; and such were honoured by the Lord, and Bearers of his Name, and of his Mes∣sage, and Glad-tidings, though they were contemned of men; yet unto such he gave the authority to overturn the wise, and to out-reach the wisdom of this World, for they were learned of the Father, and had the knowledge of his Wayes, though they were unlearned in the Arts and Crafts of men, which stand more in pollicy and subtilty, then in the Fear and Wisdom of God; and in that day the Lord was with his People, while his People were with him, and he loved them while they stood in his Counsel, and he gave them dominion over all their Enemies, and they were a Terror to the whole World, while the Churches stood in the dread and terror of the Lord of Hosts; yea, all bowed under them, and their feet trod upon the high places of the Earth, and they were blessed of the Lord above all People, even till they waxed fat, and were increased in treasures, and thought they had need of nothing, and then they forgat God, and rebelled against him, and became perverse in their wayes, and grew into strange Idola∣tries and Errors, and left the Way of Truth, and cast God's Law behind them, and the Power of Godliness ceased, and the form grew, and it was exalted more then Power, and love waxed cold when iniquity abounded; and men became Lovers of themselves, more then of the Lord; and the Lord and his marvellous Works which had been brought to pass were forgotten, and hardness of heart and unbelief entred, and then false Prophets and Antichrist came in, which
Christ had prophesied of, and established the form of Godliness without the Pow∣er, and subverted many (even whole Houses and Countries) from the simplici∣ty of Christ Jesus; so that many became insensible, and grew past feeling of the Power and operation of God, and their minds became blinded, and their ears stopped; and God was grieved who had brought up Children, and they forgat him, and rebelled against him; for the Churches became corrupted, and lost the Life and Power of God, and the Holy Ghost, and became Idolaters, and Wor∣shippers of Idols: and as you may read, Paul prophesied that many should de∣part from the Faith, and give heed to seducing spirits, and the doctrine of De∣vils; and grievous Woves should enter, not sparing the Flock, but seeking to devour it, and would make havock and merchandise of Souls, through coveteous∣ness and filthy Lucre; and perillous times would come, wherein there should be a Form of Godliness and not the Power; and in that Generation before, and soo after his decease, this came to pass and was fulfilled; and as you may read in th Revelations, the Churches grew into Superstitions and Idolatries; and the Chuch of Ephesus had lost her first Love, and her Candlestick was to be removed, and so it came to pass; and some in the Church of Smyrna were in the Blasphemy, say∣ing, they they were Iews, and were not, but were the Synogogues of Satan; and the Church of Pergamos, some of them held the doctrine of Balaam, and to eat thing sacrificed to Idols, and to commit Fornication, and some held the doctrin of the Nicolaitans, which God hated, and against them would the Lord fight with the Sword of his Mouth; and the Church of Thyatira suffered that Woman, I∣zabel, to prophesie and to teach, and seduced the Servants of the Lord to comit Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols, and she and her Lovers wer to be cast into a Bed of torment, and her Children should be killed with Death, and all the Churches should know, that God searched the reins and the hearts, and every one should receive according to their deeds; and the Church of S had only a Name to live, but was dead, and her work was not perfect before God, and upon them would the Lord come as a Thief, and they should be in Darkness, and not know what hour he would come; and the Church of the ∣odiceans were luke-warm, neither hot nor cold, and the Lord would spew her ou of his Mouth, for she was wretched, miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and the shame of her nakedness did appear: And if any had an ear to hear they migt hear; these things were spoken by him that lives for ever, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the Amen; so that hereby the Lord's Soul was vexed and his Spirit grieved, and his Wrath was suddenly kindled against them, who were Re∣volters and Backsliders from his Way of Salvation, which he had made manifest to them, through the mouth of his Servants; so that his Fury went forth again them to overthrow them, and to break them to peices, and they being turned from his Law and from his Statutes, he gave them up unto their own hearts desire, and brought in the Heathen upon them, to confound them, who broke them as∣sunder, and trod down many of their Cities, and gained great Parts of their Do∣minions, and made them Slaves by multitudes, and overthrew their Worship, and subjected their Power; even the Turks, and base uncircumcised People, made a Prey upon them, and possessed their Habitations, and set up abominable Ido∣latries in the Place where God's Honour had dwelt; and their Dominions and Treasures without became spoil to the teeth of Devourers; for they having lost the Terror of the Lord, he brought up the Heathen to be a terror unto them, whose power was mightier then they, and overcame them, they being without the power of God; and they justly came upon them, according to the Purpose of the Lord, because of their backslidings: And others of th, who were not so given up to the will of an outward Enemy, yet were they given up to strange Idolatries and Subversion, and setting up Images, and wor∣shipping that which is not God, but abomination to him to this day; so that the holy City, which had been full of Glory; was given to the Gentiles to be trodden down; and under their polluted feet hath it been stamped, and to their mouth hath it been a prey, for such a time, even since these things came to pass unto
this day, as you may read; and the Beast and false Prophet hath ruled in oppres∣sion, and the great Whore hath made all Nations drunk with the Wine of her For∣nication; All the great Men, and Princes, and Nobles, and all the People upon the Earth have been made drunk by her, and touched her uncleanness, and ever since the day wherein the backsliding entred she hath sat upon Nations, and Kin∣dreds, and Tongues, and People, and hath been decked in divers colours, to de∣ceive the hearts of all people; and all Nations have been deceived by her, and the Beast, and his Power, whose Dominion hath been great, hath upheld Wickedness, by a Law, and established Idolatry by Decrees; and all have been out of the Way, and wandring in Blindness and Darkness, even the whole World have worshipped the Beast, and gone after the false Prophet, which sits upon the Beast, and his power protects him, till they be both overthrown into perdition, and cast alive into the Lake, which now the Lord is coming to do in Power and Dominion; and great Babylon is coming into remembrance before the Lord, and as she hath done, so shall it be done unto her; her Children is dashing against the stones, and her Off-spring is withering away; and the Darkness is vanishing, and the Sun is ap∣pearing, and the Beastly Power shall be subdued, and the false Prophet confound∣ed; even the old Dragon shall be bound, and chained, never more to deceive: for the Beast hath had a long reign, with his false Prophet, who have prophesied Lyes, and false Divinations, and led away the minds of all People. For mark, and consider, Christ Jesus, who came into the World with glad∣tidings of good things, even with Peace and Salvation; he said the glorious day was come, and even that day which many Prophets and Wise-men had desired to see; but had not seen; the earth was filled with light, as I have said, yet he far∣ther prophesied, and said, that the night should come, when no man could work; and that in the last dayes false Prophets should arise, and deceive many, and should come into the World, and should cry, Lo here is Christ, and lo there is Christ, and if it were possible should deceive the very Elect; and the Apostle Iohn in his time, who had been an eye-Witness of Jesus, and had handled, and tasted, and felt the Word of Life, and had been with Jesus, and bore a true te∣stimony unto him; in that very Age and Generation he saw the false Prophets and Antichrists come, and coming in, and aluded to the very sayings of Christ; By this we know, said he, that it is now the last time, for there are now many false Pro∣phets and Antichrists gone out into the World; they were not of the true Apostles, but went out from among them (being gone out from the Light in their own particu∣lars) and beguiled the hearts of the simple, by good words, and fair speeches, and went in Balaams way for Gifts and Rewards, and in Cains way to Envy and Murder, as you may read in the Scripture: So that in Iohns time, the false Pro∣phets, which Christ foretold of, were come, and they did deceive many, accor∣ding as Christ had said, and they drew many from the Wayes of God, and sub∣verted many from the Way of Truth, and made havock of the Flock, and were grievous Wolves, according as Paul said; and truth began to perish from among men, and the Power thereof ceased, and the Apostacy came in, and the form was set up for a season; so that Iohn farther saw, and said the whole World went after the Beast and false Prophet, (whom he saw before was come, and worshipped the Beast, and his Image) but a few whose names were written in the Book of Life: And, as I have said, the whole City, with the outward Court, was trodden down by the Gentiles foot, and darkness surprised all, and wickedness abounded more and more, and the night came upon all, as Christ had prophesied, and the Beast grew in his dominion, till there was hardly any man left to bear witness in the Truth, and in the Power of God, unto the Name of Jesus; but all was subverted into dead Forms, and Shadows, and Likenesses without Life; and the Lord left the Earth, as it were, and covered himself in the Darkness, and became a stranger in the World, and did scarce openly speak by Vision, nor Dream, nor Prophet, but all were in the dark, and Ignorance abounded, and Superstition was exalted; the Saints Spirit, and Life which they were in, and guided by, was lost, and then they began to worship the Saints Names, and Dayes, and Words, without the
Life and Power; and that Nature and that same Seed which had persecuted the Saints to death, and gainsayed the Power, and lost the holy Ghost, turned it self into the profession of the Saints Words, which were left upon Record, and con∣formed it self into the Saints Practises, without the Life, Power and holy Ghost. And having lost the Power, from which the Scripture was given forth, and not being guided in the Life which they were in, which spoke it forth; then from the Scripture, in mens own conceptions, and thoughts, and by their reason, with∣out Gods Spirit, they set up Likenesses, and Images, and Sects, and Forms, and ma∣ny Heads, and many Horns grew upon the Beast which all the World worshipped and went after, for they had lost Christ the one Head, wherein the Union stood, and grew into Idolatry under the many Heads which were upon the Beast, who had many Horns, which pushed one against another, as it is witnessed unto this day; do not the Papists and Protestants (so called) and other Sects risen out of them, push one at another, to break and tear one another? and these have ma∣ny Heads: The Pope he is a Head; and the others they have a Head, which every one bowes down under his own Head; the Pope will not bow to the Protestants Head, nor will the Protestants bow to the Papists Head, the Presbyterians and Independ, and Anabaptists, and the rest, every one of them bows to their own Head, and will not bow to anothers Head; and all these with their Horns push one against another, to rend one another; and all these are from Christ, and know not him, the one Head of the whole Body, and the one Horn of God's Salvation unto a People; for Christ which is but one is the Head, and the Horn, which all the Saints, who are now gathered out of this Apostacy and dark Night, unto whom the Light again is risen, worship Christ the one Head, and know him the one Horn, which pushes aganist the Devils Kingdom, which hath long been set up, and rul in the Earth among all these, who have many Heads and many Horns, who are a of them (the very chiefest) but in the night fallen, in the Apostacy and Da∣ness, since the beginning of the reign of the Beast, and the coming in of fa Prophets, which came in, as I have said, when the Churches backslided, with the Whore also, who hath made all Nations and People Drunk with the Wine of be Fornication; and the Beast hath reigned over all Nations in his Dominion and Authority, and the false Prophet hath prophesied through all Nations. And all these came in since the dayes of Christ; for he prophesied that i should be so, as it is come to pass; and they were coming in, in the dayes of the Apostles, as you may read, Paul saw them coming, and largely describes their Character in several Epistles. And Peter, he saw them coming in, and de∣scribed them, what such they were, and should be; and Iude he saw them also; and Iohn more fully then any, both in his Epistles and Revelations, as I have ∣ed at. And when the Apostles were taken off the Earth, some by cruel Deaths, and others were banished, then they sprung in more fully, and grew through all Na∣tions; and to this day hath the Beast, with his many Heads and many Horns ru∣led in Nations, and been worshipped, and his false Prophet hath ever since been defended, and hath riden on the Beast through Nations, and hath deceived Nations with vanity and error; and at this very day the Nations and People are deceived, and lie under Darkness in the slavery and bondage under the authority of the Beast, and subject to the doctrine of his false Prophets. And as I have said Darkness hath been over all, and fancies and likenesses with∣out Life have been bowed under, and the Power being lost, the Form hath been set up, one after this sort, and another after that, according to mens vain con∣ceits and apprehensions upon the Scriptures, and not according to the manifesta∣tion of the Spirit of God, which fulfilleth the Scriptures, and brings to live the Life of them. So in divers Colours, and in divers Appearances, and Robes in several forms and shapes of Garments hath the great Whore been decked, who hath sat upon the Beast, having the false Prophet serving as a Boy or Servant, to do whatsoever the Whore listeth; and the false Prophet, this Servant of the Whore, under the power of the
Beast, hath moved and turned as the Beast would; and according as the Whore hath changed her self into other Garments, and Colours, even so hath the false Prophet changed his Doctrine, and Prayers, to please the Whore, and to keep people under the Government of the Beast. Its known, in this our day, that some who preached and prayed for the King and Bishops, do now preach and pray for others, even for them who destroyed the King and Bishops; so the false Pro∣phets with all his Children, are but the Whores Servants, who hath made drunk Kings, and Princes, and great Men, and People, and Nations, with the Cup of Fornication, and Abomination, in the several Sects and Forms of Worships which have been set up without the power of Godliness; for the Baptism of the Spirit being lost, and not known, then from the Letter by imaginations, were se∣veral sorts of Baptism brought forth, as sprinkling of Infants, that dark folly, and vain vanity, which all these Nations have been deceived withal, by the exer∣cise of the false Prophet: And when the Gift of the Ministry, through the holy Ghost, which the Ministers of Christ had, was lost, and not any more eceived, then began men to make Ministers, by natural Learning, and Arts, and Languages, and humane Pollicy; and when the gift of preaching by the eternal Spirit was lost, through the coming in of the Apostacy, then began men to study from Books and Writings, what to preach, and say, not having the holy Ghost received in them, without which none are Ministers of Christ; [mark that] and when men had lost, through ignorance, the Knowledge of God dwelling in them, and that their Bodies were his Temple, and that he dwelled and walked in his People, then be∣gan they again to build Temples without, and to set up their false worships in them; for having lost the sence of Gods true Worship, which the Saints wor∣shipped in, in the Spirit, and in the Truth, then they began to worship in set Dayes; and set Times, and set Places, and outward Observances, which is not the worship of God in the Spirit, and in the Truth, but Superstitious and Idola∣trous; and when the Word of God was not received immediately from his Mouth; nor the Gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ, as it was in the dayes of the Apo∣stles, then (darkness being come in) they used their tongues, when the Lord had not spoken to them, as the false Prophets did before Christs time; and long have they said the Letter is the Word, and that the Letter is the Gospel, and that it must be re∣ceived by the Scriptures, and by natural Learning, and Arts; and that none can be Ministers of Christ, but such who are learned in the Languages, and knows the Original of Scriptures, Latine, and Greek, and Hebrew, nor any of these have re∣ceived the Gospel by revelation, or the Word of God from his mouth. And when singing in the Spirit, and with the Understanding was ceased, and not known, then began People to get the Form of singing of Davids experiences in Rime and Meeter; and when the pure power of Godliness was lost, which was in the days of the Apo∣stles manifested, and known, then in the Apostacy the deceit grew into the Form of every thing which the Saints had enjoyed in the Power, and so were Shadows set up instead of Substance, and Death instead of Life, and the Form without the Power, which in many Branches sprang forth, some into one appearance, and some into ano∣ther; but all under the power of the Beast, with his many heads and horns defended; and until this day, since the dayes of the Apostles, thus it hath been, and those very Teachers, and supposed Ministers, which now are in this, and other Nations, are of that very Root which sprang forth in the dayes of the Apostles, and they are under the dominion of the Beast, and moveable like unto the great Whore; and this may easily be proved, that they are of that Generation of Teachers, and false Prophets, which Christ prophesied of should come, & which the Apostle saw was coming in, in their dayes, & of those which Iohn saw the world to run after; for Christ said, That by their fruits they should be known; and the Apostles they described their fruits, & them by their fruits; and so we seeing their fruit to be the very same now, which the Apostles described was the fruit of them that then were come, and coming; from whence we do conclude, according to sound judgment, that these very Teachers are of the same Generation, and Branches of the same Root which sprang forth then.
And in Pauls Writings you may read, such they were whom he saw, of whom he bad people to beware, and said, perillous times would come, and men should be Lovers of themselves, Covetous, Proud, Blasphemers, Disobedient to Parents, Unthankfull, Unholy, without Natural Affection, false Accusers, Fierce, Despisers of those that are good, Heady, High-minded, Lovers of Pleasures, more then lovers of God, having a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power; and such, of whom people were ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth; for people were laden with sins, and led away with divers lusts; and these did re∣sist the Truth, as Iannes and Iambres, who withstood Moses, by making likenesses without Life, and they were men of corrupt minds, and reprobate concerning the Faith. Now it is plain, that these Teachers in this Generation are of that very Stock which Paul describes; such he saw would come, and such we see are come, and by their fruits we know them, as Christ said; and Pauls words are fulfilled; for these Teahers are lovers of themselves, and covetous, and proud, this is plain to all people; and Blasphemers, who denies Christ to have lighted every man that comes into the World, and therefore they deny Scripture, and so are disobedi∣ent and unholy men, and without natural affection, who, many of them, have caused the Innocent to be imprisoned, and some have died in Prison, and they the chief cause of this; and this is without natural affection to the Creatures; and they are false Accusers, and Lyars, and fierce in their Books and Preaching, as is manifest through all this Nation; and they greatly dispise those that are good and prepares war against such as do not put into their Mouthes; and they a heady and high-minded, and lovers of vanities and pleasures; this is evident with∣out proof; and they have a Form of Godliness: they say all should be taught  God, but when any comes to witness it, and deny their teaching, they cry agai such as Hereticks, and thus they have the words, and the Form, but deny th Power; and they are ever teaching, twenty, and forty years, and more, but no able ever to come to the knowledge of the Truth by them, but all in blindness a darkness still; and people cries out, who have been learning many years fro them, that they do not know the Truth; and its plain, that these Teachers are of that sort, that Paul spoke of, who brings none to the knowledge of the Truth people that follows them are laden with sins, and led away with divers lusts;  these have, and do resist Truth every whore; they deny that Christ hath lights every man that comes into the world, and so resists Truth, and denies Scripture and the truth, as you may read, Iohn 1. 9. And they are corrupt minded, ever wicked Persecutors, and Suers at Law, and earthly minded, and covetous, and op∣pressors, and are wholly rebrobate concerning the faith: and thus it is plain that the root of these Teachers was springing in the Apostles dayes, and hath grown ever since in this dark night of Apostacy, and hath filled the Nations. Again the Apostle saw that many should depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of Devils, speaking Lyes in hypocrisie, havi their Consciences seared as with a hot Iron Now these Teachers are of the Stock which is departed from the true Faith; for they are without true Faith, and reprobate concerning it, who are in iniquity, and sin, and the works of the World, which are evil; now Faith purifies the heart from all this; but their hearts  not purified, but polluted with Covetousness, and preaching for Hire, and Per∣secution, and Envy; and therefore they had not Faith and so are of that Gene∣ration which departed from the Faith, after the Apostles time, which they  would come; and these do seduce, and their Doctrines are of the Devil, who de∣nies the Truth which the Scripture bears witness of, and say, Sprinkling Infants  water, when they are two or three dayes old, is Baptism into the Faith of Christ; this is the Doctrine of the Devil, and Lyes they speak in great numbers, and in hypocrisie, and write them forth to the World in great hypocrisie, with feignedness, and pre∣tence of holiness; and its plain, many of their Consciences are seared: How do many of them cause the poor people to suffer grievous imprisonment, and spoiling
of their Goods, to the ruin of Families almost, for their maintenance, as Tythes, and such like; which if their Consciences were not seared they could not do; al∣so some of them cried to the rude wicked People, in their Idol-temples, Fight Lads for the Gospel; and many who have born witness to the Truth, and against their de∣ceits, have been beat, and abused, and knocked down, as for dead, in their presence; and their consciences are absolute seared, else they would tremble at these things. Also the Apostle Peter, he saw false Prophets would come in, 2 Pet. 2. And false Teachers, who would bring in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them; and many should follow their pernicious wayes, and through covetousness, with feigned words, they would make Merchandize of people; and they would walk after the Flesh, in the lust of Uncleanness, and despise Go∣vernment, and be presumptuous and self-willed, and not afraid to speak evil of Dignities, and they would speak evil of things they understand not, and their hearts are exercised with coveteous practises, and were cursed Children, and they sport themselves with their own deceivings; and these had forsaken the right Way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaa, who loved the Wages of Un∣righteousness; and these are Clouds that are carried with a Tempest, and they speak great swelling words of vanity, and while they promise to others liberty, themselves are the Servants of corruption: and such were Scoffers, and Mockers, which would come after the Apostles dayes, and they would walk after their own lusts. And now according to this Prophesie of Peter, who saw false Teachers coming in, he gave these Characters of them, whereby it doth plainly appear that this Generation of Teachers are they, and of that Stock which then came in; for these bring forth the very same fruits which they did, which he spoke of, and we know them by their fruits, as Christ hath said; for these have filled the World with damnable Heresies, as holding forth, That sprinkling Infants with Water, is Baptism into the Faith of Christ; and that a Steeple-House is the Church; and that singing Davids Experiences in the World, among wicked People, in Rime and Meeter, is singing to the Praise of God; and these are damnable Heresies, even to the denying the Lord that bought them; for they deny the Light of the Lord Jesus Christ given to every man, to be the only Teacher, and the only Guide of man; and they that do deny the Light of Christ, with which every man that comes into the World is lighted, to be sufficient to lead to Christ, and to the Kingdom of God, (as these Teachers in this Age do) they deny the Lord that bought them; and many, even whole Nations, all the World, as Iohn saw in the Revelations, have followed their pernicious wayes, and run after their Idolatry and pernicious wayes of Superstitions; and they do make Merchandise of souls through covetousness, with their feigned words; for where they can make their Bargain to have the most money, there they will preach, and no where else; and if any will give them more the next year, they will sell that People, and go to another, for very covetous∣ness, by feigned words; and they do walk after the flesh, in the lust of Pride and Covetousness, which is uncleanness of the flesh; and they despise the Saints Government and Order; for they will not suffer the Saints to prophesie one by one in their Assemblies, according to the Saints Government, but do despise that, and persecute it by the government of the Beast, unto whose government they are subject, and not to the Government of Christ and the Saints; and thus they are presumptious and self-willed, presuming to afflict, and cause the Children of God to be cast into Prison, and suffering them to be beat, and abused by their Flock, out of their wicked self-wills; and they are not afraid to speak evil of Dig∣nities, and do speak evil of the Wayes of God, and of his Truth, which they understand not; and their hearts are exercised with covetous practises, and are cursed Children; for they make poor People, that have but ten Eggs, give them One, and that hardly can get any Fewel for the Fire, pay them a Fenny for the smoak; with many such other exceeding covetous practises, as suing men two hundred miles to answer for three Shilling, claimed by them for Tythes.
And these sport themselves in their vanity in their own deceiving, and whe they have oppressed People for their Wages, and make People pay them for who they do no work, and force Wages from them that never hired them, which ar unheard of coveteous practises; they sport themselves in their pride and lustfl∣ness, and they are out of the right Way, and gone astray from the Wayes of God, which are holy, and are in the way of Balaam, who went after unrighteous Wages, who sought for enchantment against Israel, as these do; and these lo unrighteous wages, by taking maintenance from People by force, unto whom is nothing owing by them; and these are carried with a Tempest of every Wid, according as the Powers of the Earth blow; these are carried sometimes under such a Government, and sometimes against it, and so are Clouds carried abot, and are unsettled on the foundation; and they speak great words of Christ, God, and the Scriptures, which are but words stolen by them, because they are not spoken by the spirit of God, but by a lying spirit; and they promise to others liberty, that they shall receive the Kingdom of God after death, and that Christ hath ta∣ken away their sins, with such like Promises of liberty, but themselves are the Servants of corruption, living in Pride, and Hatred, and Coveteousness, and these serve sin; and are Servants of corruption; and they are Scoffers, and Mockers, and Walkers after their own lusts, as it is evident in all mens sight; so that accor∣ding to the Judgmen of Truth, we judge these Teachers of this Generation,  be of the same root which then sprang forth; for these bring forth the same fruis as they in that time did; and in the Apostacy they have over-spread the whole World: And also the Apostle Iude gave a Description of them, according as Pe∣ter had done; he saw certain men creeping in, who turned the Grace of God in to Wantonnes; and they were filthy Dreamers, and know nothing but wh they know naturally, as bruit Beasts, and in that they corrupt themselves; a they have gone in the way of Cain, and run greedily after the error of Balaam; a they are Trees whose fruit withers; raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own shame; wandring Stars; they are Murmurrers and Complainers, walking after their own lusts, having mens persons in admiration, because of advant, and these seperate themselves sensual, having not the Spirit; and of this s which Iude describeth are these Teachers in this Generation, whose fore-fathe crept in, in the Apostles dayes, and these are their cursed Children, which  abound in these Nations at this day; and they are filthy Dreamers, studdying fr what they speak, and dreaming without the Spirit of God an hour in a Pulpit, and what they know it is naturally, by natural Learning and natural Arts, and i that knowledge they are also corrupted, in Pride, and Vain-glory, and Vanities, like bruit Beasts in their Apparrel, and Practises, and not like Ministers of the Gospel, nor Saints; and they are in Cain's way, in Envy, and Murder, and Wrath abounding, no People like them; and they do run greedily after Balaams Error, or Gifts, and Rewards, and unrighteous Wages, which they run after greedily; and they are Trees which bring forth cursed fruits, which will wither and fade a∣way; and they are like proud raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their sha in Lyes, and Slanders, and cursed speaking in publique and private; and they have no Habitation in the Firmament of God, but are wandring Stars, and so∣times in one Opinion, and sometimes in another, but the blackness of Dark is reserved for them, and the Judgment of the great Day; and they are Mur rers and Complainers, and can never have enough, but seek for their Gain fr their Quarter, as the false Prophets did in Isaiah's time; and they have mens p∣sons in admiration, because of advantage to themselves, bowing and worshippi mens persons, who will advantage them in their Wages, or Hire, and Mainte∣nance, begging favour of the Magistrates, and having their persons in ad∣miration, that they may have their advantage in oppressing poor People in Tyt; in this their wickedness is hard to be expressed: and these have separated into self∣seperation, some into one Form gathered, and some into another, but a sensual, and in the wisdom which is from below, and without the Spirit of God.
And thus it is proved that these Teachers of this Age are of the same Generation in their practises, which Iude described to be creeping , in his time. And further the Apostle, 1 Iohn 4. he saw that the false Prophets and Antichrists, which Christ prophesied of to come, were come in his dayes, and said, Many false Prophets are gone out into the World, which is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard, said John, And even now already is it in the World, and they were of the World, and the World heard them; and so are this Generation of Teachers, who succeed them that went forth into the World then; these are of the World, in its wayes, Pride, and Wickedness, Covetousness, and Envy, and all Evil; and thy that are in the evil of the World, in wickedness, hear them, and maintain them; so that accor∣ding to Iohn's Description, these Teachers of this Age are of that same flock which came in then; and Iohn further saw, that all the World was gone after them, and worshipped the Beast which was then risen, & run after the false Prophet, which then came in, and sat upon the Beast, and its plain that the World is all run after them, unto this day, which is a day of bringing back again from the false Pro∣phet, and from under the power of the Beast; and the Beast, and his Image, and the false Prophet, & his Divinations must down to the ground; and according as Ioh farther prophesied, The holy City which had been troddn down under the Gentiles feet, for such a time, should again be gained, and the Saints should have the Dominion, and the old Dragon should be chained, and Christ shld reign, and his Kingdom should e set up in the Earth, and the Tabernacle of God should be with men; and this is the day that the Lord is restoring again the Way of Peace, which long hath been lost, and the the Power of God is again witnessed, which hath not been known for Gene∣rations. So that of things spoken this is the sum of Truth, and the Word of the Lord God to all People on the Earth; that in the dayes of Christ and the Apostles, it was a glorious Day of Light, and Life, and Power; and the Lord gathered a People which honoured his Name, while they stood with him, and in his Counsel walked; but since the dayes of the Apostles hath been an Apostacy, and Dark∣ness over all, and a Subversion upon all, and Night hath been over all, wherein no man could work, as Christ said; and Forms without Power hae been estabish∣ed, the pure Way of God hath not been known in its purity; so that this time wherein all are fallen, is a time of ignorance, of the reign of the Beast, which all the World hath wandred after, and a time wherein the Gentiles feet have trod∣den down the holy City; and a time wherein all the World runs after the false Prophet, and are deceived, and made drunk with the Wine of the Whores For∣nications. I say this is the time wherein all the men of this Generation are fallen, and the Scripture is fulfilled; the Night wherein no man can work is upon the World; and further this is the time of Antichrists dominion, who hath exalted himself in the Seat of God, shewing himself to be God; and long hath he reign∣ed with the Beast, and the false Prophet, even since the dayes of the Apostles; and these same Teachers of this Generation, which now are in the World are ma∣nifest by their fruit, to be of that generation, of that seed, and stock of false Prophets, which Christ prophesied of, should come in the last time after his dayes; and which most of the Apostles saw coming in, in their dayes; by their fruits I say they are known; for these bring forth the same fruits, and bear the same Marks which those described did, in their time; so we see Christ's Prophesie is fulfilled, who said they should come, for they are come; and the Apostles descrip∣tions are fulfilled on these, for these Teachers are such as bear the same Chara∣cters as is proved, as they said they should bear that would come; and long have the Nations been deceived, and kept under the worship of the Beast, running after the false Prophet. And we see Iohns Prophesie is fulfilled, who said, that The holy City was given to be troddn undr the feet of the Gentiles; for so we see it hath been for many Gene∣rations; and also we know, the time is now approaching, that the dominion of the Beast is near an end, and the holy City shall the Saints possess, and the Gentiles
shall be driven out of it, according as Iohn said, who wrote the last of any of the Apostles, and gave ful testimony of these things, which I have declared f (viz.) of an Apostacy, and reign of the Beast, and false Prophet, and a Subver∣sion from the Wayes of God, and this hath been, and is come to pass: Also e prophesied of the gaining of the holy City in again to the Saints, and of a re∣storation, wherein new Ierusalem should be made manifest from Heaven, and shod again be adorned, as a Bride for her Husband, and the Saints should inhabit it, and the Tabernacle of God should be with men upon Earth, and the Lord would dwell for er with his People, and this day is approaching nigh at the doo, for the Fig-tree hath blossomed, and we know it is near at hand, the Summer where∣in the Glory of the Lord shall be revealed unto all Nations, and they shall  that he is the Lord God Almighty, that will take Vengeance upon the great Whe, who hath made all drunk with the Wine of her Fornication. And now after the long night of Apostacy and Darkness, which hath been vp the face of the Earth, is the Lord appearing, and his Day dawning, and his Lig breaking forth as the Glory of the Morning; and the Kingdom of God is reveal∣ed, and his Dominion is setting up, after the long reign of the Beast, who ha had his Power, and his Seat, and his great Authority from the Dragon, after wh the whole World hath wandred, and him hath worshiped, who hath been saying w is like unto the Beast, who is able to make war with him? His mouth for many Ge∣nerations hath been opened in blasphemy against God, and his Name; and he  made war with the Saints, and his power hath overcome them, [Mark] overco them, and then himself hath reigned, and the reign of Christ for many years  not been known, but over Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations hath the Beast had po∣er, and over them hath reigned for many Ages; and all that dwell upon the F have worshipped him, whose Names are not written in the Book of Life;  Earth hath been caused, and them that dwell therein to worship the Beast, and  his Wonders he deceiveth them that dwell on Earth, and as many as would  worship the Beast and his Image, the Beast hath had power that they should be∣led, and many hath he killed, who would not worship him, and are persen∣ted; and both Small and Great, Rich and Poor, Free and Bond, have rec∣ed the Mark of the Beast, and the number of his Name, which is the number  a man; he that reads let him understand; these things have come to pass,  been fulfilled since the Apostles dayes, in this night wherein no man could wor which Christ said would come; but now the forty and two Monthes, which ti the Beast and his Image was to continue, and so long was his Power to remain  make war, and to overcome the Saints. I say the time is well nigh expired and finished, and the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb is risen to make war against the Beast and his Image, who hath reign∣ed over the Kingdoms of the World, and the Judgment of the great W cometh, who hath sitten upon the Beast, and drunk the Blood of the Saints,  with whom the Kings of the Earth (since the dayes of the Apostles) have com∣ted Fornication; and all the Inhabiters of the Earth have been made drunk  the Wine of her Fornication; and all the Merchants of the Earth have been mae rich through the aboundance of her delicacies; and she hath sat upon the scar coloured Beast, and her Cup in her hand hath been full of abominations, and  ness, of her fornication, and her name is Mistery Babylon, the Mother of Harl and all the Kings of the Earth have given their power unto the Beast, and commited Fornication with the great Whore; and she hath sat upon people & multitudes,  nations, and tongues, (since the Apostles days) and even some, who have hated te Whore, and fulfilled the Will of God, and made the Whore naked, yet they gi their power also to the Beast, until the Word of God be fulfilled. Consider these things you that have an ear to hear; but now the mighty Day  the Lord, and the Judgment of the Whore is approaching, wherein she shal be rewarded according to her Works, and doubble shall be given into  Cup, and as she hath loved blood, so shall blood be given her to drink, and the Merchants of the Earth shall lament her, whom they have waxed rich by, who
glorified her self, and lived deliciouslly, and hath said in her heart; I sit as a Queen, and am no Widow, and shall not see sorrow; but now the one day is dawn∣ing wherein her Plagues shall come, death, and mourning and famine, and she shall be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord that is risen to judge her; and the Kings and Merchants; and all the Inhabiters of the Earth, shall lament her, and cry, Alas, alas! and now are they beginning, for the hour is come that her judgement cometh, and all her Merchants, who have trafficked with the Souls of men shall partake of her Plagues, who have partaked of her sins, and lived deliciously with her, and the fruits that her Soul lusteth after shall depart from her, and all things that are dainty, and goodly, shall depart from her, and she shall find them no more at all when her judgement cometh, and in an hour all her riches are come to nought, and all her Merchants at Land and Sea shall la∣ment her; even her that hath ruled over Nations, and sat as a Queen for many Generations, ever since the dayes of the Apostles, until this day; yea, all that have wandred after her, even the whole World shall lament and bemoan her; and such as have served her, and made Slaves of the Souls of men by Merchan∣dize and Traffick, shall bewail her, and their gain shall cease for ever; for in one hour shall she be made desolate, and her glory shall fade, and her beauty shall wither, and the Beast that hath carried her shall utterly faint, and the false Pro∣phet that hath wrought Miracles in their sight, and deceived the Nations, shall be cast into a bed of torment with her, and the Beast, and the false Prophet shall be taken, and cast alive into the Lake of Fire, to be tormented for ever, day and night, World without end; and the Whore, in whom hath been found the Blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were slain upon the Earth, and the Beast who hath caused all that dwell on the Earth to worship him and his Image, for many Ages, and the false Prophet, who hath deceived the whole world, and many Nations, and made them subject unto the power of the Beast, by his Miracles which he hath wrought in the sight of men; these shall be plagued toge∣ther, and tormented together; for the false Prophet and the Beast hath sent forth their unclean Spirits, like Frogs, unto all the Kings of the Earth, and unto the whole World, to gather them to Battel, with their Armies, to make war against him that sits on the white Horse, even the Son of God; and this is the false Pro∣phet which Crist prophesied of to come, which long since came, and hath served the Beast and the great Whore for many Generations, and many, even all Nati∣ons have been deceived, as Christ said, and led aside, and blinded, and bewitched by him. And, as I have said, these Teachers of this Generation are of them, of their Root and Off-spring, which long have flourished on the face of the Earth. But the day is at hand, that the Heaven, and the Holy Apostles, and Prophets shall rejoyce over the Whore, and over the false Prophet; for the Lord comes to avenge us on her; and as she hath done, so shall it be done unto her, now in this day wherein Ierusalem shall be builded again, and the holy City which the Getiles have trod under foot for forty and two moneths, which time is expired, and near an end, accounting from the dayes of the coming in of the Apostacy, un∣till this day, if any have an ear to hear let him hear; this I have received from God I say the holy City shall be measured, and the Gentiles cast out; and she shall be adorned, and as a Bride for her Husband shall she be prepared; and Gods Taber∣nacle shall be with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his People; and God himself will be their God, and all tears shall be wiped away and there shall be no more death nor sorrow; for the former things are passed away, and all things shall be made new. And what I have said are the faithful Sayings of God; every one that is athirst shall drink of the Water of Life freely; and he that overcometh shall inherit all things, and shall be called the Son of God, and shall dwell in the holy City, which long the Gentiles foot hath troden under, which shall again be adorned, and prepared as a Bride for her Husband; if any have an ear to hear let them ear. And the Glory of the Lord is risen, and his Day is breaking forth
more abundantly, and the Lamb is given for a Light, and all Nations that are save shall walk in the Light of the Lamb, and the King of Righteousness, (who hath been long fled into Egypt, while Herod the Beast, which hath sought his life, and driven the woman into the Wilderness, hath reigned) shall again be set upon the holy Hill of Sion, and rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron, and trample upon the necks of all his Enemies; the Nations have not for many Ages been ruled by hi, but the Beast, who hath ruled over Kindreds, and People, and said, Who hath be able to make war again the Beast, and to the power of the Beast hath all Nations be subject, and the Dominion of Christ hath been trodden down and despised, and  holy City hath been laid waste, and his Princely Power hath not been felt, nor wit∣nessed in the Kingdoms of men for Ages and Times, nor him the one head; and the one horn hath not been known, but many heads and horns have been exalted, a all Nations, and all the Princes, and Kingdoms of the Earth have been subject  the Rule and Law of the Beast, and to the Divinations of the false Prophet, & dark hath been over all, and God hath been as a stranger in the Earth, as one not known he hath been worshipped ignorantly, and the inscription every where hath been  the unknown God; but now after all this the glorious God of Truth hath appeared, and great, and mighty hath been his Hand and Power in this our day, in raisg  a righteous Branch out of the Root of Righteousness, and in gathering his scattered People up to himself, who have been scattered by the Idol Teachers, and deceived by false Prophets, & made a prey upon by the wild Beasts of the Forrest. O how have the People been made a prey upon by their Teachers, and greedily devoured by  Shepherd, who have sought themselves, and sought for their gain, every one f his Quarter? for many Ages how have people been led blind, by their blind Sp∣herds, and none to this day come to the knowledge of the Truth by them?  these have run, and were not sent, and therefore the people have not b profitted at all; as it was in Ieremiahs dayes, so it is now, no profit  people in the knowledge of the Wayes of God, but leanness, and barr∣ness, and as the Teacher, so his People, all out of the way, in prophaness,  wickedness; and prophaneness is gone forth from them into many Nations, y the Lord bringing back his Inheritance, which have been driven away into the desolate Wilderness; yea, and the Lord hath caused his Light to shine out of dark∣ness; and unto them that have sat in darkness, and in the shadow f death i the marvellous Light risen, that the Glory of the Lord may be revealed, and God Tabernacle may be with men; and the holy City is preparing, as a Bride for her Husband, and Darkness shall flee away, and Sorrow and Sighing shall no more be known, but Life and Immortality shall again be brought to Light, as it was in the dayes of the Apostles. This I have received from God; and the Lord shall be known to be the God of his People; and for this cause hath he called and chosen faithful Witnesses,  given his powerful Ministry by the gift of the holy Ghost, as it was in the Apo∣stles dayes, and now many are called to declare abroad the things which we  heard, and seen, and handled; and the Gospel of Christ is received by the Rev∣tion of Gods eternal Spirit, and Son in our hearts; and the power is made mani∣fest, and the form of Godliness without the Power is denied and judged; and Christ the one Head is exalting, and the one Horn of Gods Salvation is revealing and the many Heads and many Horns must be broken to pieces, and be confoundd in this the day of the Lord; for his purpose is powerful in carrying on his o work against all his Enemies; so that none are able to hinder. But they that set them∣selves (even the Beast and his Power, which is now struck at) whose Kingdom is in∣vaded, hath raised the force of his power, and the pollicy of his arm; yet shall they be confounded, and no formed Weapon shall prosper against the Lord and his Way, who is now risen to avenge himself of the Beast and his power, and the Whore, and her Fornications, and the false Prophet, and his Divinations, which all must in the Wine-press of Gods dreadful Wrath to be trodden; and all that worship the Beast, and repent not, shall partake of the Plagues of the Beast, and of the Whore;
and though the false Prophet gathers Gog and Magog together, to fight against the Lamb, and to compass the beloved City about, yet he shall, and them that he gathers, be broken to pieces, and driven as dust before the Wind, and as Stubble before the Fire; for the purpose of the Lord shall stand. Great Babylon is come into remembrance before the Lord, to reward her according to her deeds; and the Lord will cause his Truth, and his Salvation to be known in the Earth, and his Name and Power is declared in the hearts of his People, to the overturning of all unrighteousness, and though every horn of the Beast push against this, and every Head, with his Members, set it self against it, yet the Counsel of the Lord shall not be disannulled, nor made void; for the Scepter and Dominion of his Son shall be exalted over all the Earth, and the Princes of the World, and the Kings of the Earth shall lay down their Crowns, and become subject; for the Kingdoms of this World shall be changed; and shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ; the Kingdom of the Beast must down, and the princely power of Darkness must be overthrown, and Laws, and Times, and Things, and Powers of men shall be overturned, and overturned, till he come to reign in the Earth, whose right it is to reign over Nations and People: And because of this the rage of the Heathen hath been great, and the counsels of the Wicked many, and strong, from the prophane Drunkards to the chiefest professed Teachers of this Age; even all the whole Body of the Beast hath joyned it self against the purpose of the Lord; men of all conditions, from the highest to the lowest, have armed themselves with Mischief to offend the Way of Truth. This is written, as moved of the Lord, to go abroad through the Nations, that all may understand concerning the times, and the changing of times, how that the Beast hath reigned in Dominion, over Nations, Tongues, and People; and all have worshipped the Beast, and gone after the false Prophet: here all may come to a good understanding what hath been, and what is, and what shall be; how that when the Power and Government of Christ was lost, through departing from the Faith which ruled in the Apostles dayes, then the whole World was as unstable in Wayes and Judgments as a Sea; then out of the Sea one Beast arose, and another after him arose out of the Earth; and all have been caused, both small and great, bond and free, to worship the Beast, and the Image of the Beast; yea, all the Domini∣ons of the World have for many Ages been subject to the power of the Beast in all things, and not known the Worship and Power of God, and the pure subjection to him; but the Kings of the Earth, and all her Princes have given their power to the Beast, and have received their authority from him, and acted thereby many of them in great unrighteousness, in injustice, and oppression, and cruelty; in pride, and rebellion, and vain glory; in quarrelling one with another, to the murthering thousands of thousands; and this hath all been brought forth under the power of the Beast, and by it; and his Heads and Horns have exalted them∣selves one against another, and smitten one onother, and the great Whore hath made them all drunk, and all People upon the Earth, with envy, pride, wontonness, and all unrighteousness; this hath been since the Apostles dayes, in this Night of Apostacy, wherein the whole World hath been subverted by false Prophets and De∣ceivers, and the Kingdom of Christ hath not been known upon Earth for many Ge∣nerations, but the Beast hath been established in his Throne of Rebellion against Christ Jesus; his Decrees have been Laws, and Statutes, and he hath made wa against all the Saints, and overcame them, and reigned over them until this time, and trodden down their City, and defaced their Glory; but the blood of the Just hath cried day and night, under the Altar, the Souls of such as have been slain for the Testimony of the Word of God, have cried day and night, How long Lord, how long, when wilt thou avenge our Blood upon the heads of our Enemies, even the Beast, the Where, and the false Prophet? and this hath been for many Ages, even while the Kingdom of Antichrist hath been set up and advanced through the World, and his Power and Authority hath reached over Nations, bond and free, from the Prince on his Throne, to the Begger on the Dunghil, even all have been subjected under the power of the Beast; that nature having ruled within every
particular, hath given him the Authority without over all, and admired him, and said, who is able to make war with him. Antichrist hath ruled over all, by inju∣stice, oppression, and Tyranny in unrighteous Laws, and through wicked de∣crees, old Pharaoh-like, he hath laid heavy yoaks, and oppressive bonds upon the Just; for who would not be subject to him, he hath had power to kill them, and none was able to gainsay; such hath been the greatness of his power, and the strength of his dominion over all, that none have been able to make war against him, he hath been admired in all the World, not any Nation excepted where the government of Antichrist hath not born rule, and there have been none left to bear witness against him, or to stand up against him; for the faithfull Witness have been slain in the Streets of the great City, which spiritually is called, S and Egypt, and all them that have dwelt upon the Earth have made merry  their dead Bodies, and rejoyced in their Iniquities over the Slain, and been without a Reprover, and not tormented, nor troubled, but have sent gifts one to another, be∣cause they have slain them, who have tormented them that dwelt upon the Earth; and the government of the Beast hath been enlarged, and the whole World have wandred after him, and been in subjection under him, for many Generations; even f forty and two months, he that can read let him understand; so long hath it be given him to make war against the Saints, and to overcome them, and it hath been given him to reign over all people in the Wrath of God, and in his anger, becse of the Rebellion of all the Earth, and all people in it, but he shall be taken away i Gods displeasure who reigns in his anger over the Nations, who have forsake the Lord, and was given up to the Power of the Beast, to be subjected in Slave∣ry, and Bondage, in Pain, Sorrow and Misery; and through Deceit, Craft and Pollicy, and Oppression, and by the Wisdom of this World, and natural Ar, and Knowledge, his Government hath long been established, and his Domini hath been upon Earth; Times, and Laws, and Things, and Powers of men have been in his hand, to change, and subvert, and overturn into his own Ima and to transform them like to the Beast; none upon Earth, hath bought, or sd, or judged, or given evidence, or been respected in all the World, that  not had the Mark of the Beast, and the number of the names of Antichrist; rich and poor, small and great have receive his Mark, as a Seal of their subjecti∣on to the Beast, whose many heads, and many horns, have subjected all by the force of his arm, and he hath blinded the eye, lest men should see him, and cast darkness over all faces, and the false Prophet hath deceived many, a Christ hath said, and all the Earth hath been wandring in the Wildern of Wickedness, and the Long-suffering of the Lord hath been wearied, and he continually provoked to destroy the Nations, who have followed Antichrist, who hath shewed himself in the Seat of God, to be God, and hath sat in the Seat of God, in the Seat of Justice, Righteousness, and of Mercy, and the Abomination of desolation hath long stood in the place where it oug not, for many Ages, and length of Times; and his many Heads, and many Horns hath swayed the World, through the terror of the Beast, who ha made all worship him, and they that would not, he hath killed, who hath car∣ried the great Whore, who hath made all men without exception, and all Nati∣ons without respect to any, wholly drunk with abomination, and all hath stag∣gered, and fallen into grievous iniquities, and the Dragon hath stood ready continually to devour the Child of Righteousness as soon as it was born, and the Woman hath been forced to flee into the Wilderness, that hath brought i forth, and hath fed there for so many dayes, and for a long season hath the Ld been blasphemed, even the Name of God, and his Tabernacle, and them th dwell in Heaven. But now hath the Lord considered, and looked down from his Habitatin, and of a truth he is risen, and hath taken to him his great Power, that he may reign, and put all things under his Feet, and subdue the power of the Beast, and Antichrist; and all their Government, and Rule, and Laws, and Decrees shall be overthrown, and confounded, & all their worship shall be broken; for great Baby∣lon
is come into remembrance before the Lord, to render her according to her works; the Lamb is now risen, and advanced with his Bow, and his Sword, and he is go∣ing forth Conquering, and to Conquer the Beast, and all that have worshipped him: and they that are with the Lamb are called, and chosen, and faithful, & they love not their lives unto death and they shall overcome him by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of his Testimony; the Dominion of the Lamb is setting up, and his Power is made manifest; and the Stone cut out of the Mountain without hand is a dashing at the feet of the Image, and against the Beast, and his Power, and against all his Laws and Decrees is he risen; and he will change Times, and Laws, and Powers, and the Kingdoms of this World shall become the King∣dom of the Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever; for now the Spirit of Life from God is entred into the Witnesses which have been slain, and they begin to stand upon their feet, and great fear falls upon the great men of the World, and the Devil is cast out into the Earth; who hath sitten in Heaven, in the Temple of God, and deceived the whole World, and his wrath is great against the Saints, and against the Lamb, because he knoweth his time is but short; and the Man-child shall grow; and shall rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron, if any man hath an ear to hear let him hear; he that leadeth into Captivity shall go into Captivity; he that killeth with the Sword must be killed with the Sword; the Purpose of the Lord shall stand who is now ga∣thering, and bringing back such as have been driven away and deceived by the Generation of false Prophets, who have deceived the whole World, and all that dwell therein, and the Lord will take vengeance upon them, upon the Beast, and upon the false Prophet; and great Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall be no more at all, but shall be made desolate; and the voice of Harpers, and Musitians shall no more be heard at all in her; but her Glory shall wither, and fade away in a moment; for he that hath a true Weight and Measure is ap∣peared to divide, and to give due weight, and measure unto every one; and all the wicked, who will not come from under the worship of the Beast, shall have their part in the Lake that burnes with Fire, and he that is unjust let him be unjust still, and he that is righteous let him be righteous still; here is the dividing of all things as they were in the beginning; the Glory of the Lord is ri∣sen, whose name is called the Word of God, and out of his mouth goeth a sharp Sword, and with it be smiteth the Nations, and he shall rule them with an Iron Rod; for his Name is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and he is gathering his Saints together to the Supper of the Great God, to eat the flesh of Kings, the flesh of Captains, and the flesh of Horses, and them that sat there∣on; the Purpose of the Lord shall not be disannulled, though the Beast, and the Kings of the Earth gather together their Armies, to make war against him that sits upon the Horse, who is already gone out to conquer, and the num∣berless number of the Saints are gathering together before the Throne of the Lamb, and they have no guile found in their mouthes. And the day is now dawned, and the night is far spent; Wo unto the World, and to all the Inhabiters of the Earth, who have worshipped the Beast, the Lord is coming to plead with you, and ye that have partaken of the sins of the great Whore shall partake of her Plagues, and she shall be rewarded double, accor∣ding to her works; for her sins have reached unto Heaven: The Day of great tribulation is at hand, of Anguish and Destruction, men shall seek death and shall not find it, but it shall flee from them, when the Lord ariseth and the Lamb standeth upon Mount Sion, and his Saints with him, who shall tread down the Hea∣then, and cast them out, even as they have trodden down the holy City, and the Worship thereof; and the Kingdom of the Beast, and his Seat, and his great Authority, which he hath received from the Dragon, shall all be thrown down; and the Kingdom of the Son of God with his Government, Scepter, and Rule shall be established in all the Earth, and the utmosts part thereof shall be given him to possess; this is the Promise, and this shall come to pass; and
through the whole World Laws, and Decrees, Ministry, and Orders shall be changed and renewed; the Law and Decree of the Most High shall rule over all, and the holy City shall be beautified, and is adorning and preparing for the Saints, and their King to inherit; the Lamb is the Light of the City, and the Temple therein, and all Nations and People that are saved shall walk in the Light of the Lamb; for he hath lighted every man that comes into the World, with the Light of Salvation, in all that do receive him; and Darkness shall flee away, the S is risen, and Praise, and Honour, and Glory, and Dominion, shall be given to the Lamb, who shall reign over Nations, and his Saints shall see him, and his Name shall be in their Fore-heads, and there shall be no Night, but Light and Glory, and the Kings of the Earth shall bring in their glory and honour i it; and the Gates stand open, and are not shut; every one that thirsteth, let him come, the cry is unto all; and yet nothing that defileth shall enter: these are the faithful Sayings of the Lord, who is true, and must not long be sealed; fr the time is at hand, and all men shall read, and all that keep the Commandme of God, shall have right to the Tree of Life; and blessed are they, they shall be healed, though now they suffer all manner of evil, for the Name of Iesus, by the Beast, and under his Power, by them that worship him, who must fulfil wicked∣ness by persecuting the Innocent, till the Lord be raised out of his Habitation; and the dominion shall be given to them; and they shall have power to bind King in Chains, and Nobles in Fetters of Iron; this is their Honour, and this i their Dignity, and they shall rejoyce for ever and ever, and shall glory in the Lord, and not in this World; and this shall come to pass, as the Lord hath said. Wherefore all Nations and People, Arise, arise, and be awakened, Prepare, prepare, and make way for the Lord; be removed, ye Mountains; and throw down, ye Hills; and hewn down, ye sturdy Oakes; and cut up, ye tall Cedars; Make way, and prepare, the Path for the Holy One, who is comming to rule w his Iron Rod, and will dash you all to peices: Be afraid and tremble thou Be, that hast long reigned over the Earth; and all thy false Prophets and Worship∣pers be confounded at this, and bow and tremble at the remembrance hereof;  whom you have hated and crucified, and his Saints, whom you have persecuted, shall come to reign over you all; and to him, whom you have set at nought,  you be subject to, and ruled by, to all your sorrow; for behold the Lord com∣eth with his numberless number of Saints. And this is a warning to all Nations and People upon Earth; Times and Laws must be changed among you; Governments and Orders must be changed; Un∣justice and Oppression shall be removed, and every Yoak and Burden shall be ta∣ken off from the neck of the Poor; true Judgment, and Justice, Mercy, and Truth, Peace, and Righteousness shall be exalted; and all the Nations shall have Judges as at the first, and Councellors as at the beginning; and the Poor shall rejoyce when true Judgment and Justice reigneth, and the false Prophet subdued. And this is a Warning to you all, that you may hear, and consider the Lamb who hath been slain, who is risen to reign, who is the Prince of Peace, of whose Go∣vernment there shall be no end; even he hath lighted all man-kind on the face of the Earth; the Light is the Eye, which will let you see all this, and will bring you to the fulfilling of it' a to the good Understanding; and it shall evidenc the truth of this, even the Light of Christ in all men, which is given to guide  the Way of Peace.
THe Kingdom of Christ is setting up, and it is not of this World, neither shall be exalted, nor advanced by worldly pollicy, and worldly wisdom, nor by carnal weapons, nor by the multitude of an host of men, (its true) the Son of God is gone forth; conquering and and to conquer; and the Spirit of his Mouth, and the Word of his Power, shall get himself the Victory; his own Arm alone, without the help of another, shall work the Conquest; and his Kingdom shall be set up within every particular of his Subjects; for none can know him reign without them unto their Salvation, till they know him to reign first within; for that which opposeth the Kingdom of Christ, and the setting of it up, is within every man, and must be subdued within, where it hath ruled; and the Enemy of Christ's King∣dom, which hath lodged within, must first be subdued, before there be dominion over his Enemies without. This is the Word of the Lord to all People; for he that pursues his Enemy without, and leaves him in his own house, is foolish; and out of the way, and shall be overcome of his Enemy, and shall not overcome him; there∣fore ye that are waiting for the Kingdom of Christ, be awakened, and seek for it where it is to be found, not without you first, but first within; strive not to ob∣tain it with your carnal Weapons, but take the Weapons which are Spiritual, which only will overcome; be not deceived, for through suffering must the Kingdom of Christ be set up, and not by rebellion through Crafts, and Plots, and secret Polli∣cy, and turbulent Arisings, nor Strife in the nature of Enmity, (by these means shall the Kingdom of Christ never be advanced.) And this is the Word of the Lord, and our Testimony which we give of the Kingdom of Christ, who is indeed arisen to make war against all his Enemies, and they that follow him are called and faith∣ful; and chosen, whose Weapons are Spiritual and mighty through God; and reacheth to the killing and subduing of all flesh (and he must war) till all his Ene∣mies be subdued, and must reign over all his Enemies, till the Kingdom be delive∣red to the Father, where he shall be all in all. The 3d Moneth, 1657. All ye Inhabitants of the Earth in all Nations through the World; Hearken and give ear, the Word of the Lord God that made Heaven and Earth is towards you; He is coming to set up his Kingdom and his Domi∣nion, which never shall have end, and the Kingdoms of this World shall be changed, and shall become the Kingdoms of the Son of God. ALl ye Kings, and Princes, and Rulers through the whole World; the Lord is coming up with his mighty Host against you all; he, who will fan you, and sift you, and try you, and search you out; for his Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge you; and you shall all know, that the Kingdom of the Most High rules in the Kingdoms of men; all your Glory shall fade away, all your Majesty, and Honour, and Dignities, and Dominions shall come to an end; all your strength is but as a Straw, all your treasure as a Thing of nought, all your glory as a fading Leaf in the Presence of the Lord God, that made Heaven and Earth; all Nations upon Earth are but as the drop of a Bucket before him, and the hearts of all men are in his Hand, and by him Kings rule, and the Princes of the Earth are at his disposure; and you are all weighed in the Ballance of Equity,
and found too light before the Lord; for all flesh hath corrupted its way before him: Be awakenened ye that have long slept in Darkness, and been at ease in the flesh; ye that have had peace in this World, and pleasure in the vanity thereof, the Lord is coming to make war against you, his Trumpet hath sounded, and his Sons and Daughters are gone forth to bear witness of his Majesty, and Power, and Dominion; and the Lord hath spoken, Who can but prophesie? he hath given the Word, and many are they that publish it: Let your ears be open to Instru∣ction, and kick not against the Lord, neither harden your hearts against him, but make way for him, and prepare his Path; for he cometh to judge the World in Righteousness, and the People with equity, and the Testimony of the Light of Jesus in you all shall witness for him; your princely Powers must become subject to the Power of the Kingdom of the Most High, and your glory must be vailed and darkned before the Glory, which he Lord is causing to shine forth; and we, the Servants of the Most High, do give you warning of the day of your Visitation, which is upon you, and all the World; for the Lord is now risen, who hath long winked at the time of great ignorance, but now e warns you all to repent; therefore bow down, ye Stiff-necked; and tremble, ye Stout-hearted; and be abased, ye Lofty-looks; our King is above you all, our do∣minion is over you all, and the line of true Judgment are you all measured with, and your wayes are not found perfect in the Sight of the Lord, nor your hearts right before him; his Kingdom hath not been known in your dominions, neither hath his Laws and his Judgments born rule, but you have every one been doing that which is right in the sight of your own eyes; and the counsels of your hearts have been nought but vanity before the Lord; Vain-glory hath abounded among you, which the the Lord's Soul hath been burdened by; the honours and pleasures of the flesh have been your delight, and strife and enmity hath been among you, and wars, and quarreling, and fighting one against another, and you have rejoyced in the overthrow one of another, and in destroying one another, and you have ta∣ken pleasure in gaining one anothers dominions; you have striven who should have been the greatest, and greatly oppressed the Poor; you have exalted your selves one against another, and drawn up your Armies one in defiance of another, and the blood of Thousands have been shed to satisfie the humours of your proud hearts; all this hath been evil in the Sight of the Lord, and his Spirit hath been grieved, and his Soul vexed by all this, and he hath forborn till he hath been weary; for he hath been dishonoured by all this, and his Law hath not born rule, and his Judgments have had no place, you have been cruel-hearted one towards another, and merciless, and without pitty, and ouy have not done to others, as you would be done unto, but you have rendred evil for evil, and sought occasi∣ons of evil one against another, and vexed one another through the pride of your hearts; therefore now is the Lord risen to make war against you all, and to dash you to pieces; the Feller comes up amongst you, he that will not spare to slay, and to devour, who will not be afraid of your lofty looks, he will spoil you of your Treasure, and lay waste your strength, all ye Kingdoms of the Earth, and your gathering together against him is but as Briers and thorns; for he will exalt his own Kingdom over you all, and all ye Kings of the Earth shall know, that the Kingdom of the most high must rule in your Kingdoms, and your Laws shall be changed, and the poor shall no more be oppressed; for he is come tht proclaims liberty unto the Captives, who will remove oppression far away, who will change Times, and Worships, and Ordinances, and there shall be no Law, but the Law of God; nor no light, but of the Lamb; nor no worship, but the Wor∣ship in the Spirit, and in the Truth; for all your Worships which the Nations are full of, is nought but vanity, and a lye, immitations, and superstitions, brought forth in hypocrisie, and not in an upright heart; vanity of vanities have abound∣ed both in civil and spiritual affairs; The root in which you stand is wholly cor∣rupted, and no good fruit springs from it, but cursed fruit, which must be  down, and cast into the fire; ye have been evil, and could not bring forth any good; you are corrupted, and your fruit is of a bitter taste, a day of sorrow, of
lamentation, and misery is coming upon you all; ye that have been high and lofty, and stouthearted, fearfulness shall surprise you, and the terror of the Lord of Hosts shall compass you about: I am moved to salute you all with this, as a warning, and when it comes to pass, remember you have been told; ye that know not the Kingdom of the most High ruling men, but are saying in your hearts, this hath my hand done, in a moment shall you be smitten, and know there is one above you which must rule, for it is his right to rule over all Nations, and there shall be no King but Jesus th Aoine o God, o o Government, but the Govern∣ment of the Lamb; there shall be no more war, but war against the Dragon, who hath stood to devour the Man-child, which is now bringing forth, and he must rule with his Iron Rod, and shall subdue all under his feet; We whom God hath warn∣ed cannot but warn you of these things which  come to pass; he is coming to separate between the Just and the unjust; he will gather from among you, that the wicked may be consumed from off the face of the Earth. All you Rulers in the World, I warn you all, take heed how you persecute such as comes to warn you, who brings this Message to you, lest you add sin to sin, till there be no place found for repentance; for ye shall all know our God is the true God that made Heaven and Earth, before whose presence all esh must come to Judgment. By one who hath measured the Times, who is come to the Day that hath made all Things mifest. EDWARD BURROUCH.
A General Epistle and Greeting OF THE Fathers Love t all the SAINTS, Called and chosen to faithfulness in Christ Jesus, the Light of the World, in which they believing, and their faith standing in his Power, many suffer for his Name sake. And this is to all such as are found worthy to suffer, and is an Exhortation to the strengthning of their faith, where∣by they may continue boldly, witnessing to the end. And this is a true Testimony of the Father, and of the Son, witnessed by us who are called of God, in whom his Power is made manifest. TO all the Children of Light every where, who fear and love the Lord, who are begotten of God, and unto whom he is known in the Spirit and in the Truth; this is a Testimony of the Fathers love unto you, Grace, Mercy, and Peace from him that lives for ever, the God of Light and Life be multiplied in you all, that you may daily be renewed in strength, and girded with Truth, and armed with the whole Armour of God, and may be kept by his Power until the day of Salvation, to walk in the Government and subjecti∣on to Jesus Christ, witnessing the Power and Presence of God in you, and amongst you, giving you power to fulfil his Will in all things, and that in all righteousness, and out of all evil you may be led, and preserved unto the end, and in the end, to shew forth the praises of God in this Generation, as a people called of him, and redeemed by him for his great glories sake; even so Amen, and Amen. Dearly beloved, be not ignorant, but this know, This is the Message which came unto you, which is true and faithfull, and everlasting, That the true God is Light, and in him is no darkness at all; and this is the Message of Peace and Recon∣ciliation, and of glad Tidings unto all that have sought the Lord, which we re∣ceived of him, and you have heard, and there is not another to be declared; and all that have received it are gathered up to God, and are in Covenant with him, and one with another, and are in that which reconcileth and joyneth unto Christ Jesus (the Husband) and second Adam, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Prince of Peace, the Saviour and the Deliverer, who is made manifest in power, and con∣demneth the Transgressor, and slayeth the Enmity, and raiseth the Life out of death; and this is he who kills and makes alive, even the God who is Light, who brings down one, and sets up another; who makes war against the mighty, and gives peace to the poo; and besides him there is none: he searcheth mans heart, and trieth the reins, and no the thoughts, and every Creature is manifest in his
sight, who gives to every one according to his doings; and this is he who stand∣eth in the Congregation of the Righteous, even in the midst of us, and sitteth Judge among the gods, unto him must all the gods of the Earth bow, and the In∣habitants of the Earth must tremble before him, and unto him every Tongue shall confess, and the Light in every man shall answer, when he ariseth to Judg∣ment, who is a swift Witness, to condemn or justifie all the children of men up∣on the face of the Earth. This is the God of Truth whom we worship, and who will be worship∣ped in Spirit, and in Truth, who is the God of Abraham, and his Seed for ever; and with him there is no change, nor shadow of turning; and he hath made known his Name, and his Power, and his wonderful Works in this his Day, and hath caused his Voice to be heard in the Earth, and the Dead hath heard, and now liveth. And his Name is exalted on high amongst all that fear him, and obey his Voice; and he hath given his Son a Covenant of Light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the World with the true Light of Life, or Condemnati∣on, that all who receive him may come to the knowledge of the Father, whom to know is Life eternal. And this is the Christ, the Saviour, in whom we have believed, and whom we preach, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, the Foundation of God, which cannot be moved, the Word of God is his Name, and there is no other Name given for Salvation. This is he who was dead, and is alive, and lives for evermore, and there is no other to be looked for; if any preach any other, let them be accursed; and if any bring any other Message, let them not be received. And all you who have believed in this Christ Jesus, who is the Light of the World, and who have received the knowledge of this God, who is Light him∣self, and that searcheth your hearts, I exhort you, and warn you all in his Pre∣sence, that lives forever, to wait upon him, and to fear before him, and to walk with him for ever in uprightness of heart, which is of great price in his Sight; and forget not his righteous Judgments, which he hath made known, least you wax fat through Mercies, and rebel against him, and become disobedient and gain∣saying, and so be destroyed from being a People; but be stayed upon the Lord, and let your hearts be established with Grace; and be not tossed, nor shaken with any wind of Doctrines of men, which is not from the Life of God, nor reach∣eth to the Life in you, but begets into Idolatry, to worship other gods then he who is Light; and be not troubled at Temptations, nor at Sufferings, nor at Re∣proaches, nor any other thing; but stand in the Counsel of God, and in his Long-suffering, and wait patiently upon him, in your own measure of the Grace of God received, which is sufficient for you, to preserve you, that Victory over Death, and over him that hath the power over it, you may receive, to trample up∣on all that which is contrary to the Life of God within you, and without you; neither be you troubled nor offended in Christ; if any among you deny the Lord, and backslide from his pure Way, through an evil heart of unbelief, and so become disobedient Children, and vex the righteous Soul; such shall bear their own bur∣then, and condemnation in the day of the Lord; and shall know, that Truth changes not, but is the same for ever, though the Deceitful-hearted through unbe∣lief depart from it, and choose their own wayes, and despise the Counsel of the Lord, to their own destruction; but be ye more watchful, and faithful, and va∣liant for the Truth upon Earth, unto the end; that you may be found faithful Wit∣nesses unto the Name of the Lord, in this crooked Generation; and may receive the fulfilling of the Promise of God, and may witness God within you, the Ema∣nuel, the Saviour, God with us, and this is the whole Salvation, and there is no other to be expected, or witnessed, then this, That God dwells in us, and walks in us, according to his Promise; and all that know this, need nor go forth to the right hand, or to the left, but Salvation is come unto us, he that taks away sin, and saves from it, and from condemnation; and who witnesseth this are be∣gotten
by the Word of God, and born of the immortal Seed, and are new creatures; but now there is no condemnation, but the reward of righteousness and peace to us, who are not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit; and here we witness the Lord is our God, and we are his People, and he seeth no sin in us who are born of him, nor remembers iniquity; but his Covenant is with us, and the King∣dom is become the Lords, and his Dominion is set up, where God is all in all, where the Prince of Darkness is cast out; and this is the End and Substance of all Ministrations, which we bear witness of: and I do exhort all you that are cal∣led of God every where, patiently to wait in the way of the Lord, and in his Judgements to receive this, and to possess it within you, that you may be Wor∣shippers of God, and Doers of his Will, and may have the Witness, that you are accepted of him, and may know your Calling and Election sure, where nothing that defileth can enter, but that may be taken away, and removed; and him you may feel and witness, whom Satan hath nothing in, who is the Second Adam, and cannot be overcome, but is greater then the first Adam, who was overcome (though innocent) and is lost from the Presence of God; but he in whom there is no sin, and who cannot transgress, comes to seek and to save that which was lost in sin, and to bring back that which was driven away by sin; and he is greater then Innocency, and overcometh the Devil, and is called the Son of God; and to him that over∣cometh, who is the Light of the World, is all Power given of the Father: And know him in you all to be greatest, who is not of the World, nor cannot bow to the Devil, to give you dominion and authority over all the World, and the Powers of Hell and Death, even he who sealeth up the old Dragon in Perdition, never more to deceive: And who witnesseth this, knoweth the Election which it is not possible to deceive, or be deceived; and as every one of you have received him who is the Lord from Heaven, so let your Faith stand in him, and walk in him; and let all your Conversations be ordered by him, in all pure and blameless walking i the sight of your Enemies, that it may be manifest that you are Branches in him, and that you have received power to become the Sons of God, and that you are Heirs of the Inheritance which shall not fade away. And all you that witness this, your eye is open to see God, and you are clensed from sin by the Word of God, and you have received the peace with God, and glad tidings from him in your own Souls; and this is Salvation by the second Ad; herein be established and setled, and look not for another; for there is not any besides this Saviour, and this Salvation; but if any preach another, believe hi not; and if any cry, Lo here, and lo there is Christ, without you, go not after them, nor follow them, but know him within you, which is greater then all; yea, If we our selves, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Jesus, then he that lighteth every man that cometh into the World; or any other Salvation, the God with us, let us be accursed; for this is the Gospel of our Salvation, Christ Jes within us the hope of Glory, the Power and Wisdom of God to rule and reign i us, by which we are changed from death to life, and translated from the power of Darkness into the Kingdom of his dear Son. And now all Friends and Elect of God, who are called and faithfull, you that have received this Testimony which God hath given of the Son, and which th Son hath given of the Father, which in faithfulness hath been testified in this Ge∣neration; I exhort you all in the fear and Counsel of the Lord, take heed to th which you have believed, and heard, and learned of the Father, which is t Truth, as it is in Jesus, and shall abide for ever; and be not removed from yo hope, nor given to change, but mind the Life of God in you all, which is im∣mortal, and is but one, and it answereth to the Lord in Judgments, and in Mercies, and one to another in that which is righteous and just, and witnes∣seth against all the works of the World, which are evil, and not wrought in God. Ye that know this which is of the Father in you, dwell in it, and walk in it, and be not shaken out of it, nor removed from it, for it is the Way of Peace un∣to everlasting Rest, where there is no sorrow, but Righteousness, Peace, and
Joy in the Holy Ghost; and every one in particular, have Salt in your selves to savour withal, that you may resist the Wicked One in all his Temptations, and may not joyn to any thing which is out of union, and contrary to the Life of God, and to the Truth which you have received, that you may never be be∣trayed of your Hope, nor of the Simplicity which is in Christ Jesus, in which the Father is well pleased; and let the Light of the World guide you in all things, that your works may be wrought in God, never to be condemned, nor you to suffer loss, knowing this first, That none are justified by him, but them that are led and guided by him; and to whom he is a Saviour, he is also a Teacher, and he is given to Teach in all the Wayes of Truth. And now let your fellowship be in the Life and Power of God, and know not one another in words only, and in shews, and in outward appearance, but wit∣ness one another in the Spirit and in the Truth, and have communion there, in breaking the Bread of Life, that Christ Jesus may be seen to be the Head in you, and you Members to serve him, and one another, all receiving Wisdom from the Head, and Vertue from the Vine (Christ Jesus) that you may abound in Love, Mercy, and Peace, and all the fruits of Righteousness unto the Fa∣ther; and dwell in the Fear and Counsel of God, and be subject to his Will, not despising the Cross, which is the Power of God, which slayeth the Birth that is born of the flesh, which is not Heir of the Promise; but walk in the Cross daily, that your Understandings may be kept open, to try and discern all spirits, whether they be of God; and believe not every spirit, for lying spi∣rits may arise among your selves, and go forth from the Light, who are not in the Truth, but in the Feignedness and Hypocrisie, with false Visions, and lying Imaginations, handling the Word of God deceitfully, and corrupting and per∣verting the pure Way of God, having the Form, but not the Power, having left the Power, and gone from the Light, and such utter the Words of Truth without the Life, and are but as the Chaff to the Wheat, and they are to be denied and resist∣ed, and not joyned to, lest innocency and simplicity be betrayed, and your Faith made void, and so you destroyed from the Life of God, and Death sur∣prise you, and Darkness enter into your Dwellings, and so Unbelief, and Doubt∣ing, and Murmurring, and Lustings after evil arise in you, and you be pervert∣ed from the Worship of the true God, and grieve his Righteous Spirit, by bow∣ing to Idols, and following of other Lovers, and so the true God, who hath brought you out of Aegypt, and made manifest his Power in you, be forgotten, and the Faith of his Son made Ship-rack of, and your latter end be worse then the beginning, and the Name of the Lord be dishonoured by you, and then wo unto you, his Wrath shall suddenly break out against you: Wherefore hear and fear, and hearken unto the Word of the Lord; He hath caused his Light to shine forth, and his voice to be heard; he hath proclaimed his Name amongst you, and hath caused his marvellous Light to approach, when you sate in Darkness, in the Land of the shadow of death; when you were lost, he sought you, and when you were driven away and scatterred, he found you, and brought you home; when you were in your blood, and no eye pittied you, he had Mercy upon you, and bound you up, and healed you; when you were dead, he said unto you, Live; and it was so: when you were led captive by the Devil under the power of death, he broke the Chains, and set you free; and when there was none to help nor to save, his own Arm brought deliverance and salvation, and the Way of Life and Peace he set before you. And now all this hath his own Arm accomplished, that you should be a Praise unto him for evermore; now if you walk in the Way, which he hath set before you, and keep his Covenant which he hath made with you, and fulfil his Will, and walk in Righteousness, in Love, and Unity, in Meekness, Lowliness, Hum∣bleness, and in Soberness, and Watchfulness, and in Fear of his Name; then shall his Presence never forsake you, nor his outstretched Arm cease to defend and preserve you, but he shall go before you, and be your Reward; and he shall be your God, and you shall be his People, and shall dwell in him; and he shall be your Hiding-place, and he will be to you a Father, and
you shall be his Children, and his Blessing and Peace shall remain in your Habi∣tations, for ever and ever; but if any of you turn aside for a thing of naught, after vanity, and deny the Way of Righteousness, and forget the Lord, and kick against him, and follow the way and counsel of your own hearts, and wor∣ship other gods, and joyn your selves to Strangers, and commit Adultery with other Lovers, and make the Cross of Christ of none effect, and turn from the Light of Christ within you, and fulfil your own wills, and the desire of your own minds, and go out of the fear of the Lord into the liberty of the flesh, (which is not the Liberty in Christ Jesus) and so seek your selves, and strive for mastery to be one above another, and so surmise evil one against another, and the bond of peace be broken, and vain contention and strife appear; then shall the Rod of God smite you, and his Wrath be suddenly kindled against you, and you shall not prosper, but his Countenance shall be hid, and the terrors of the Lord, and Lamentations shall possess you, and Peace shall flee far from you; and such shall be cast out of the Camp of the Lord, and shall have no part in the Inheri∣tance, but the Blessing shall depart, and the Curse shall enter, till utter destructi∣on; yea, and if any of you deny the Lord, unto whom his Way is made ma∣nifest, he will deny you, and you shall have no part in him, but Vengeance in Flames of Fire will he render upon the Disobedient, manifold more then if his Love and Way of Peace had not been made manifest to you, and the Light of the World is your condemnation for evermore, if you turn from it. And in the Presence of the living God, I warn you all, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which brings any other Message then what hath been declared from the beginning; Believe not him which crieth, Lo here, or Lo there is Christ without you, or that draweth from the measure of Christ within you, to hearken to, or to be taught by any other thing; for that spt is not of the Father which preacheth any other Christ then he that is the Light of the World, and lighte every man that cometh into the World, or bring any other Message, then that God is Light in himself, and hath given his Son a Light into the World; and this is the true Testimony of the Father, and of the Son; and he that testifieth any other Message, is to be judged and denied; he is not a Worshipper of the true God, b out of the Truth, and in the Error, and a Deceiver, being deceived. Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which ministreth to o∣thers that which it hath not learned o the Father, but hath the words with∣out the Power, and liveth not in the Power of what it ministreth forth in words, nor is it what it declareth, but is in the outward Shews, in the Hypocris, and Feignedness, and reacheth not the Life of God, but vaileth and covereth it, and that spirit is not of the Father, but is to be denyed, and judged, and not re∣ceived nor believed. Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is at liberty in the flesh, and maketh the offence of the Cross to cease, which is exalted out of the Fear of the Lord, in the liberty of the earthly, which crucifieth the Life, and darken∣eth the Eye; and that spirit will boast of Joy, and Peace, and Experience, and Knowledge, and speak high words in the airy Wind, and that would lead yo out of your conditions, to glory above the Cross, till you be past feeling of the Life; and that spirit begetteth into Feignedness and Hypocrisie, and into the Loe of the World, which passeth away; and beware of that spirit, for it is not of the Father, but to be condemned. Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is hasty, and forward, and rash; for that goeth out of God's Counsel, and betrayeth the Just, and striveth to be greatest, and to be above the Weak, and despiseth him, and would be Master, and not a Servant, and would rule, and not be ruled in the meek and lowly Government of Christ; and that spit will judge, out of thoughts, rashly and unsavourly, and condemn another in secret in what it self is guil∣ty of; beware of that spirit, for it is not of God, but to be judged with the Life of God. Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which seeks it self to have
praise of men, and to be accounted, and would beget into divisions, and would have Parties to it self, and respects persons and glories in gifts, and knowledge, and parts, more then in the Giver, and admires men more then he that gives the encrease, and feeds of the knowledg in that nature which is to be famished, and glories in what hath been done by it, as though it had not received power from the Lord, and is exalted, as though it bare the Root, not knowing that it is born of the Root; and that spirit spends its Treasure (which it received in the Fathers house) amongst Harlots, and despises the poor, and seeks occasion to glory over the weak, that it may be renowned; beware of that spirit, I charge you all, for it is not of the Father, nor to be followed, but to be condemned, and resisted unto death. Again, believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which preacheth not from the mea∣sure of God received, and to be manifest to it in you, and approved by it only; but speaks above the measure, and reaches not to the measure of the Grace of God; that spirit leads after words and outward shews, and cries peace to the Rich, and judg∣ment to the Poor, and the Word of God is not divided aright, but heals up falsly, and daubs with untempered morter, and cries peace where God speaks war; and cries war where God speaks peace; and that Spirit is a Deceiver and a Betrayer, and feeds but the Ear, and not the Life, and darkens the Counsel of God by words without knowledge, and is not of the Father, but of the World, and to be denied and condemned. Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is not subject to rule and order, and is not meck, and diligent, and long suffering, but heady, and high, and untoward, seeking occasions against the Just, and Watcheth for evil; that spirit will not bear reproof, but is idle, sloathfull, and careless, and surmising evil, and backbiting, and conforms in appearance, making a fair shew, but is not unto God, as appearing unto man; and that would go, and is not called; and will not go when it is called; and seeks for the praise of men more then God, and that is fruitless ground, and brings forth Bryars and Thorns in secret, which choaks the Seed of God; beware of that spirit, it is a Lover of this World; have no fellowship with it, for it is not of the Father, but a Deceiver, and is to be a denied. Again, Believe not that spirit, neither follow it, which is tossed and unsetled, and is given to change, and is not established with Grace, that is an Adulterer, and huns for the precious Life, and seeks by flattery to beguile the Innocent; that spirit is zealous for a moment, but is soon overcome, and is stony ground, and brings not forth fruit to perfection, but withers, and its latter end is worse then the beginning. That spirit is exalted into presumption in peace, and cast into desperation in trouble, and the double minde lodgeth in it, and it is unstable in all its wayes, and is a ground for the Seed of Satan, and to it there is no peace from God; and beware of that spirit, for it is not of the Father, but to be con∣demned. Again, Believe not that Spirit, neither follow it, which is more zealous then knowing, whose zeal is without true knowledge, and stands in that which is cor∣rupted, that flourisheth for a moment, but cannot endure for ever; it hath no root in it self, but is furious, and passionate, and not long-suffering; that spirit knows not its self, but would devour its Adversaries with bitterness, and not gain by long-suffering; that is not the spirit of the Father, but must be denied in all. Again, Believe not that spirit which draws back into the World, into its lusts, and liberty, and fashions which passe away; that spirit forgets God, and draws back, for his Soul hath no pleasure in it, but is vexed with it, where the Cross is made of none effect, and the false liberty is walked in, which murders the Life; that spirit is of the Devil, and is to be condemned. And now all Friends of God every where, who knows him, and are known of him whom he hath gathered out of this untoward Generation, be diligent in your Callings, and keep your Meetings in faithfulness, waiting upon the Lord, that you all may receive of his fulness to be filled with it, and may be nourished
up unto himself, as trees of righteousness, the planting of his own right hand, to spread forth his Name and Glory, as a people saved by him, and to who there is none like besides. And this know and understand, that spirit is not of the Father, which confesseth not the Son to be come in the Flesh, who destroys the works of the Devil, and takes away sin; and that Spirit believe and follow whi condemns sin, and destroys it, and takes it away, and so gives peace with God i your own Consciences, and leads you into all Truth, and keeps you from all evil: and you that witness this, the Son you know, and the Father you know, to dwell with you, and in you; and this is the first, and the last; believe in him and follow him, and look not for any other; and in this the Father of Life and Glory, whose Dominion is without beginning and end, establish you, and pre∣serve you, Amen and Amen. I, a beloved Brother, and a Companion unto all the Saints in suffering, and in rejoyci, who have received this Testimony from the Father, do with it in this Epistle salute t whole Church in the Love of the Father, as moved of him by his Eternal Spirit, whi beareth witness to me, that we are of God, and the whole World lieth in wickedness,  that all that are of God heareth us. And this Testimony I give of the Father,  of the Son, and of the Truth, and of the Salvation of which I am made a Witness, and against all that ever shall deny it, or turn from it: And this is thus far the  of my Testimony by the Spirit of the Father, not knowing when the time comes it  be finished, and the night may come when no man can work▪ E. B. To all that suffer for the Testimony of Iesus, and fo his Name sake. THe glorious God of Truth hath appeared, and made known his Way a Truth perfectly in this our day, and hath chosen unto himself faithf Witnesses, to testifie of his Name, and of his Truth before Rulers and People, and hath brought forth a Seed which is not of this World, which cannot bo to the Devil, but is Heir of Gods Inheritance, though a Sufferrer in this World under the Powers thereof; and many in this Generation, who are called, and faithfull, and chosen, bear witness unto the Name of the Lord in Sufferings and Tribulations, whom he will honour, because they honour him, who is exalting his Truth and his People through Sufferings. And now all Friends who are called to suffer for the Testimony of Jesus, and fo the exercise of a pure Conscience, which you hold, be valiant for the Truth up∣on Earth▪ and faint not, but finish your Testimony with joy for the Lord, a against all your Enemies; and look not forth at Afflictions and Sufferings, b look beyond them to the recompence of reward; neither be offended in Christ, though ye are called to suffer for him, and for his Name sake; but dwell in the peace with God, which is a sufficient reward; and take heed to your Life which is immortal, that it you may feel and enjoy, and account that the present Suffer∣ings are not worthy to be reckoned with the glory that is to be revealed, and of which you have the earnest, even present peace with God; and look beyond your Sufferings, and before the rage of man was, and feel the Life of God in yo fresh and lively, which is more then all things, to carry you above all the World, and all its Envy, which is against the Seed of God. And take heed of Temptations, for the power of Satan will work, and is ne to tempt you in Sufferings, to gain dominion over you, and to touch your life, and to cast you down: Therefore mind the Life of God in you to have dominion,
which Satan hath nothing in, which is not given him to touch; and that is more then all; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his Life to enjoy, when he is tryed; (this I witness) and you are tryed by sufferings and tribulations, and your Faith and Patience is proved; therefore approve your selves faith∣ful unto the Lord, by Long-sufferings and Patience, that Satan overcome you not, though he may touch you, and have power to cast some of you into Pri∣son, and otherwayes to winnow you, and to try you for your Life; but be faithful unto death, and you shall receive the Crown of Life Eternal; and keep the Word of his Patience, that you may be delivered, and Satan may bow under your foot. And all you who suffer for Well-doing, who hold fast the Testimony which you have received of God; now when your hearts are searched, blessed from the Lord you are, your Reward you shall possess, which no man can take away, even the Life, and Liberty, and Treasure, which Satan cannot touch nor spoile you of. Ye that suffer because you cannot fulfil wickedness, nor the will of man, but are of the Seed which cannot please man, nor bow to the Devil; ye suffer for Christ, and for Righteousness sake, who cannot walk contrary to the Light of Christ within you, but rather choose to suffer under corrupt men, and Laws, then to transgress God's righteous Law, written in your hearts; you are chosen to fulfil the Will of God by sufferings, and are not of the World, and therefore the World hates you. And all you that suffer imprisonment of Body, or spoiling of Goods, or Travels, or any other thing, because you cannot pay Tythes, this is the Word of the Lord God unto you, You suffer for Righteousness sake, and for the Name of Christ, and unjustly, by the oppression of men, for Well-doing, and not for evil; and the Lord will be your exceeding great Reward; Look beyond your outward Liberty, and know the liberty in Spirit, in the Father, and in the Son, where is everlasting Peace and Freedom, which none can bring into Bondage; and look beyond all outward Treasure and Riches, and see God's Treasure, and possess it, which never waxes old, which none can spoile you of, as Witnesses for the Lord, and for his Truth, and Covenant you suffer; and it is for a Testimo∣ny against all your Enemies, and against Oppression and Oppressors; for the Cry of that Oppression the Land groans under, and for Ages hath done; but the Lord is now risen against it; for its cry reacheth to Heaven, against the un∣righteous Exactors, whose cruel hands have heavily oppressed the Just, and the Poor in this particular; and herein your suffering is for a Testimony against your cruel Adversaries (whether Priests or others) and against the unjust Judges and Lawyers, and their whole Train of Oppressors; for this end are you cal∣led to suffer, and to you it shall be made easie, if you abide in the Counsel of God, till Vengeance overcome your Adversaries, therefore lift up your heads, and fulfil the Will of your Father in Patience, and in Faithfulness, till the Lord ap∣pear for you who hearkeneth to the Cry of the Poor, and regardeth him that Suffer∣eth unjustly, and will recompence the Oppressors, into their bosomes; and will break every Yoak, and be a Terror to all the Cruel-hearted. And all you that suffer, who are moved by the Power of the Lord, to bear wit∣ness against the false Worships, and against the false Teachers, and Idol-Temples, of which the Land is full; and who are moved to testifie against sin, in Rulers, Priests, or People; whether your suffering be Imprisonment, or Beating, and Stoning, or other Abuses or Cruelties whatsoever, which the Devil hath pow∣er to lay upon you; you suffer for Righteousness sake, and for the Name of Christ, and for Well-doing, if in the Wisdom of God you be guided, and the Lord will be your Reward and Peace forever: Lift up your heads, and rejoyce in him▪ and abide in his Counsel, ye that suffer herein for him▪ and for his Names sake; for your suffering is for a Testimony against all this Generation, against the Idol Wor∣ships and Wayes, which God's Soul loathes, and which he will confound; and against the Idol Teachers, and false Prophets, and Priests, who preach for Hire,
and make Merchandise of souls, against whom Gods Wrath is kindled, and upon whom his Indignation will be poured; and it is a Testimony against the sins of Rulers and People, which abound in this Generation, till the measure of it be fulfilled through persecuting of you, who warn them of the evil, and bear wit∣ness against their evil deeds, that God may be justified when he condemneth them; and he is risen against the Worships, and Wayes, and Teachers, and People, whose abominable iniquities have overgrown the World, and prophaneness hath gone forth from them, through Nations; Rulers; and Teachers, and People are all out of the Way, and given to Vanity, to Covetousness, and Idolatry; and the Breath of the Lord shall consume you together (all who do oppress the Just.) Therefore Friends, be patient and content under all Tribulations and suffering, and feel Gods living Presence near you, to overshaddow you, and to be your Hiding-place; and know the Life, which the wickedness and cruelty of man can∣not touch nor reach unto; and dwell in the Power of the Lord, which moves to bear witness for him, and against all those abominations; and that will keep you above all the afflictions which can be cast upon you, and you will be on the top of your Enemies; and the Seed of the Serpent shall hardly bruise your Heel. Wo unto the Idol Worships, and Temples, and Teachers, to all the Hirelings, and Deceivers, who feed themselves and not the Flock, which abound in the World, and in this Nation, they must down into perdition; the Lord is risen against them all, to pluck up by the root, that the branches may wither; and his Arm shall watch over them, to overthrow them all, and to make them desolate, that the Just may be delivered. And all you who suffer any where Imprisonment, or Finings, or reproaches, or any other thing, because ye cannot Swear for Conscience sake; nor respect Persons, according to the vain Customs of the Heathen, but are redeemed out of the Customs and Superstitions of men, which are of the World, and are evil, and not of God, nor justified by him; you suffer for Righteousness sake, and for Christs sake, and are Witnesses for God herein, against the Superstitions, and Wickedness, and Pride, and High-mindedness of men; and the Lord is with you, if you be ruled in his Wisdom, and are faithful to him; and he will lift up your heads, till his and your Adversaries be confounded. And I charge you all in the Presence of the Lord, who suffer for Righteousness sake, in these things, or in any other, who are moved of the Lord to bear witness of the Truth, and against the deceits of the World, be not exalted in the flesh in your sufferings, lest you forget God: Nor be not cast down into sorrow, lest ye be overcome of the Devil; but dwell in the measure of the Power and Life of God, which is above all, and more then all; and feel Gods living Arm to stay your hearts, to watch to his own in you, to refresh you continually. And resist the Devil on every hand, with the Armour of Light and Truth, that your Life may be preserved in Dominion over all things, even the Life which is not of this World in you, may not be vailed nor overcome; for to enjoy the Life of God with you is enough; if you pass through the Fire, and through the Water, it keeps you and carries you above all, [this I witness] and it is more then all out∣ward Freedom, or Liberty, or Riches, or Treasure of this World; and walk herein in Boldness, and Faithfulness, and Patience, as you have us for an Example in Christ Jesus, who are in Jepardy every hour, often in Tryals, Sufferings, and Dangers, and love not our lives unto death for the Testimony of Jesus, which we hold, and that his Name and Truth may be exalted in the Earth; but as the Lord moves are carried through Nations, among Lyons and Devourers, such as seeks our life for their Prey, and yet the Lord is with us, our Defence, and Arm, and Preserver above all. Therefore look you at the Lord in all Affliction and Distress, and know his Reward with you, that your Burden and Yoak may be easie, and not hard; for his Presence makes all things joyful: And know, that it is for the Name of the Lord, and for his Honour, and for his Kingdom, which God will set up through suf∣fering, for this cause are ye called to suffer; and your Life, nor liberty, nor any other thing is not to be measured nor compared herewith,
So uto every one of you I am moved to write, and to warn you all in the fear of God, be content, and long-suffering, and patient, and finish you Testimo∣ny with rejoycing, if ye seal it with your Blood, and dwell with the Lord in his holy Habitation of Peace, out of respect to time, or places, or things; and give up your selves, that his will in you may be fulfilled. And think it not strange though you have fiery trials; neither be moved at any Suffering without you, or troubled in spirit; neither let it break your peace nor fellowship with God by any impatiency, or murmurings, or temptations, for then will your sufferings be grie∣vous to you, and the Enemy within and without will have ground against you to overthrow you; and know, it is that which ever was in all Ages, and no new thing for the Seed of God to suffer by the Seed of Evil-doers, for the wicked al∣wayes strengthened their hands in cruelty against the Righteous, and laid heavy burthens upon the Just, and caused the Innocent to groan under them, for a time, till iniquity was fulfilled, that they might be broken, and the Oppressed delivered, and alwayes the Lord exalted his Name by the sufferings of his people, as we have a Cloud of Witnesses of our Fore-fathers that went before, who did bear witness to the Name of the Lord through faithfull suffering; so it is no strange thing hath happened unto you, but that which is common to all the Saints, who enter the Kingdom through tribulation; blessed are you, if you be faithfull unto the end, that you may reap the reward of your works, of your sufferings and patience, even the Crown of Life that never fades away; so the Lord God of Life preserve you. And all Frieds every where, I am moved to warn you, Dwell in love and unity, and fellowship one with another in the Light, and in the Spirit of the Father, and fulfil the Law of Christ, and bear one anothers burden, and suffer with one ano∣ther, that none be oppressed among you in any thing, whilst others are free; but that the burden of all things, and the care of all things, in relation to the Truth, be equal among you, according to every ones freedom, and as every one is moved of the Lord, so to administer to one anothers necessities, as Members of one Body, to the honouring of the Head, and spreading of the Truth, that there be no com∣plaining, but equallity and justness, and the Government of Christ ruling among you, and his Wisdom in all things: Feed no excess, nor the lustfull devouring mind in any; neither suffer the Distressed to perish for want; but reach one to another in love, and like mindedness; suffering for one another, and all caring for the Truth above all things, that God may dwell among you, and be known that he is in you of a truth; And in this the Wisdom of God guide you all, Amen. By a Companion in Tribulation to all the Saints every where, EDWARD BURROUGH
THE Testimony of the Lord CONCERNING LONDON. Witnessed in Truth and Faithfulness, to the Consci∣ences of all People in it, that they may return to the Lord, and Repent. Also, the Great Abominations discovered of this People, who draws near God with their Mouthes, and professeth Self-Sepa∣ration, when as their Hearts be far from the Lord. VVith a VVarning to all sorts of People in it, what the Lord requires of them. O LONDON, thou art weighed in an even Ballance, and found t light; thou are measured by an equal Line, and found to short, and t narrow, and thy People cannot stand in Judgment; for abundance of iniquity lodgeth within thee, and thou aboundst in all unrighteousness thy sins are grown over thy head, and with transgression thou art covered, as wi a Garment; from the Head to the Foot thou art corrupted, and there is mu unsoundness in thee: O how doth Pride abound! Lightness, and Wantonness, and the lust of the Eye, and all the works of the Flesh are encreased to a large su; aboundance of Idolatry and Vanity springs out of thee; vain Fashions, foolish Customs, and all manner of evil hath its abiding in thee; yea, the very Seat of Satan is established within thy Wall, and works of unrighteousness do proceed out of thee into other Nations; aboundance of deceitfull Merchandize, and of oppressing Merchants, who grind the face of the Poor, do inhabit thy Borders; thy wayes are evil in the sight of the Lord, and his Spirit is grieved, and his So is vexed from day to day, every moment of time. Aboundance of Treachery, Flattery, and Hypocrisie, Dissimulation, and Dou∣ble-heartedness possesseth thine Inhabitants, from Teachers to People, High and Low, Rich and Poor, you are fulfilling your own wills, and seeking your own plea∣sures, and following the counsels of your own hearts, and doing that which is right in the sight of your own eyes; and your hearts are corrupted before the Lord, and the very best of your works are evil, and the purest of your wayes are filthy; and all your Observations, your dayes of Humiliation, and Thanksgi∣vings, and all your Worships, and Sacrifices, are abomination in the fight of the Lord; for no good fruit can spring forth, for your root is not the Vine Christ Jesus, who cannot own the Light, with which you are enlightened, and that makes all your profession vile, and not accepted, but it is wholly unfruitfull in
the Sight of the Lord. Much Profession is in thee of Righteousness, and Religi∣on, and many Forms, and Gatherings of People, which are but as so many Ima∣ges, and liknesses of divers sorts, which must be overturned, and overthrown by the roots. You are all measured with the Line of true Judgment, and your Buildings can∣not stand, when the Lord comes to try you, and search, and try you for your life; for though you profess much, yet you perform little; your knowledg puffs you up, and you are not sincere-hearted, but loose, and unsavory are you in your wayes and words: There is much wisdom in thee, and many wise men whose wis∣dom is devillish, and it doth not lead to God, it must be confounded and trodden down; for it profits you not in the Sight of the Lord, but in it you are wise to do evil, but to do good you have no knowledge; and the Lord God is forgotten, and his Judgments are not known; Vanity, vanity hath so stolen away your hearts, and after Idols are you run, worshipping strange gods, and following strange lo∣vers: Aboundance of subtilty and craft lodges in thee; vain glory excels above measure; Pride, Idleness and fulness of Bread abounds in thee, even as in Sodom, unto whom thou art become equal in trangression. Whoredom, Drunkenness, Wrath, and Envy, Gluttony, and Excess, spending the Creation upon the lust, and all the Works of the flesh, which are ev, have their full growth in thee; and in evil art thou fully ripe. O London! Consider, and be awakened ye Inhabitants thereof; for the Lord is grieved day by day, and his Soul is vexed every moment; the weight of thy Transgression is upon him; thou even makest him to serve with thy sins: Hath there been any evil committed by any Nation, which is not in thee? Hath there been any abomination brought forth, which is not in this day to be found in thee? Oh what Haughtiness, and stretched-out-Necks! Oh what Pride, and Vain glo∣ry appears in thee! Even thy Infants are nourished up in vanity; and thy old Men are over-grown with craft, and deceit; thy young Men give their strength to folly; and thy Maidens are trimed in wantonness; all sorts of People are pro∣phane in their Way; Old and Yong, Rich and Poor, are abounding in evil; all seeking their own things, and few the things of Gods Kingdom; the Way of Truth is even despised, and they that depart from iniquity are become a Prey to the mouthes of the Ungodly, who are grievously prophane, as though the Lord took no notice, or as though no day of account was to come; so great is the iniquity commit∣ted in thee, words reacheth not to manifest it: What Lying, what Swearing, what Vain-talking, and what Scorning, and what Double-dealing appears in thee at every corner? What Pride, what Wantonness, and Wickedness is manifest in all thy Streets; Teachers and People are out of the Way, given to deceit, and to deceiving, Oppressors, and oppressing one another; such is the Devils Pow∣er amongst you ruling, it cannot easily be overcome; so deep is wickedness seated in thee, that it cannot easily be plucked up; so strong is the lust of the flesh grown in thee, that it cannot easily be removed: How is the glorious Name of the Lord continually dishonoured and polluted through thy Wickedness, which is grown into a numberless sum. But the Lord will be avenged on all you his Ene∣mies, and will meet you with Judgments, Plagues, and Vengeance, and the Wicked shall not escape. And as concerning all thy Profession of God, and the Scriptures in a blind Zeal, it is but abomination to the Lord; and all thy several Sects, and Gather∣ings of People, and separate Congregations, who are not separated by the Spi∣rit of the Lord, they are but like so many molten and carved Images, which the Lord will overthrow. All thy Offerings, and Oblations, Preaching, Praying, and Performances God's Soul hath no pleasure in them, but they are a Burden and Weariness to him; and though thou washest thy self never so clean, and makest thy self never so fair through thy own labour, yet cannot thy iniquities be wash∣ed away, nor thy sin covered; for thy iniquities are marked before the Lord, and thy sin is written as with a Pen of Iron, and as with the point of a Diamond. All thy Steeple-House Worship is nought but vanity before the Lord. All thy pub∣lique
Exercises, all thy Saboath keeping, all thy set dayes of Humiliation, and all thy private Duties, and all that ever thou performest unto God, are not regard∣ed of him, while the hearts of thy People are not aright in his sight, and up∣right before him; so the best of thy Sacrifices are but as the cutting off of a Dogs neck, and the offering of Swines blood; for in thee is found the great Abomina∣tion; open Prophainness abounds, and secret Hypocrisie super-abounds, and thou art as abominable in the Eyes of the Lord in thy Hypocritical Profession of Righteousness, as thou art in thy open sins. In thee is found the Abomination of Israel, Mercy and Truth, Justice and true Judgment is neglected; Do not thy Heads judge for Reward? And do not thy Priests preach for Hire? And dot not thy Prophets prophesie falsly? And do not they divine for money? And do not thy People love to have these things so? Oh how art thou deceived by thy Teachers, & led blind by the blind Leaders! even they that lead thee, cause thee to err; and they that should instruct thee, teache thee vain things: Wo unto them, the Lords Wrath is against them; How do they make a Prey upon the People? How do they feed themselves, and cloath themselves, each one of them having a Quarter, from which they seek their Gain, and through Covetous∣ness make Merchandize of souls; he false Prophets of Israel were their Example, and they follow in the Path of Unrighteousness; having run and were never sent of God, and therefore the People are not profited at all, nor turned to God, but from year to year, and time to time, ever learning, but cannot come to the know∣ledge of the Truth. Ignorance abounds in thy old Men, and Rudeness and Wildness in thy Youths, and thy People are without the knowledge of God, and perish for lack of Know∣ledg: Thou art even as a wild untilled Garden, which bringeth forth no ple∣sant Fruit; thy Vines are as the Vines of Sodom, and thy Fruit is loathsome to the Lords Taste; wild Grapes and sour Grapes are brought forth in thee, which the Lord hath no pleasure in; ye bring forth fruit unto your selves, and not un∣to the Lord; ye kindle a Fire and warm your selves with your own sparks; ye sacrifice to your own Net, and ye think to be heard for your much Babling, and your many Performances: Aboundance of the first mans wisdom is among you, it leads you, and guides you, and not the Spirit of God; and through your own wisdom, which is devillish, you conform to the Saints words, and to thei practises in outward appearance, and make your selves like the Saints, and bow unto your own Images and Likenesses, which ye make; and are grown wise, and full of knowledge, but it is not the Wisdom of God, nor the Knowledge that will endure for ever; for you neglect the one thing, which is only needful to Eter∣nal Life. Your Buildings are high, but they are not upon the true Foundation; for many of you stumble at the Corner Stone; your sprinkling Infants is a vry Cheat, and all that believe therein are deceived; and your singing of David's ∣periences, in rime and meeter, is a very Lye unto you; your Worship is but Ido∣latry, and it will not cover you in the Day of the Lord; though none be like unto thee O London, in Profession, nor any City hardly can compare with thee, in re∣spect of the Multitude of thy gathered Assemblies, and self Separates; yet all this will not availe thee, when the Lord searcheth thy heart, which is found not perfect beforethe Lord, but full of vain glory, and lust, and pleasures of the flesh and dissimulation, and guile, which the Wrath of God will be revealed against: A single and an upright Heart is of greater price with the Lord; then all the Performances of Self-righteousness that is done in thee, while your hearts are given to vanity, and continue therein. Wherefore O London, this is a Warning to thee, Let thy Inhabitants repent, the dreadful Day of the Lord is coming; I have heard the voice of War against thee, and not of Peace, the cry of Howling and bitter Lamentation, and not of glad∣ness, nor joy of heart; What wilt thou do in the day of thy Visitation, when the Lord stretcheth forth his Hand to smite thee? To whom wilt thou flee? And where wilt thou be hid, when the Lord shews himself thy Enemy, and appears to take an account of thee? What will become of all thy Treasures? How will
thy vaine glory become a stink,? How will the dayes of thy mirth be turned into grevous sorrow, instead of thy pleasures and delicacies, and mirth, and wan∣tonness, shall be Sighing, and Mourning, and woful Lamentation; all thy gods shall not be able to deliver thee, nor all thy Profession shall not justifie thee, nor all thy self-separating People shall not be able to stand in the gap, to stay the hand of the Destroyer, none of thy carved Images shall stay his fury, nor none of all thy several Sects shal be a mountain to hide thee, when the Lord strips thee naked, and layes thee bare, and gives thee to know what is in thy heart, which will come upon thee in a day not looked for. Wherefore repnet all sorts of People, and turn to the Lord, if there may be mercy found. Cease your Wickedness, ye Wicked, and learn to live Righteous∣ly. Wo unto you Drunkards. Wo unto you Whormongers. Wo unto you Covetous. Wo unto you Lyars, Swearers, and Scorners. Wo unto you Dis∣semblers, and deceitful Dealers. Wo unto you Proud, and Vain-glorious. Wo unto you lustful People. The Lord will plead with you all, and give unto you the fruit of your doings, and reward you according to your works; his hand shall not spare, nor his Eyes shall not pitty in the day that he comes to Judgment, when he takes vengeance upon all the seed of Evil-doers, and to pluck up the wild branches, and to cast them into the fire. Sackcloth shall be put on instead of gay Apparel, and all thy Idols shall vanish away; as for all thy Profession, where is it? All thy many Sermons, and long Prayers, what is become of them? And all thy publick and private Duties, where are thy? shall it be said. Ye shall all know that there is a God, that will execute judgment and justice, and that will plead with all flesh, and in his sight shall no flesh be justified. And all ye who thirst for the Lord, and desire after the knowledge of his Wayes, unto whom iniquity is a burden, by you desired to be freed from, who have long sought the Lord, and have not yet found him, who have prayed, and had no answer, and have been weary and heavy laden, and found no rest: I say unto you, Save your selves from this untoward Generation, come ye out of these abomina∣tions, that you may be delivered from the Wrath: Fear ye the Lord, and do not offend him in any thing, stand in awe, and transgress not, love Righteousness and Truth, touch no unclean thing and the Lord will receive you; meddle not with their Worships, bow not to their Images, nor sacrifice not to their Idol gods; have no fellowship with them in their prophanness, nor yet in their hypocrisie; but hearken ye to the Voice of the Lord, that ye may know his Judg∣ments in your hearts, and his Law and Covenant established with you; depart from all iniquity, and cast away all your Idols, and forsake all your Lovers. Give not your selves to the wayes and pleasures of this World, but give your selves to Chastity, to Soberness, and Meekness, and above all things be upright in heart towards God, and towards man; speak the truth one to another, and let no Guile dwell in your Lips, nor a decetful Tongue in your Mouth. And cease from all Vain-glory, and vain Customs, and Fashions of the World, which are evil. And cease from all Men-teachers, which deceive the People by flattering words, who cry Peace when the Lord hath not spoken peace, & daub with untempored Mor∣ter, such have not profited you at all, but your soules are starved under your Mi∣nistry, and leanness is upon you; though you ever learn of them, yet you cannot come to the knowledge of the Truth by them. Cease from them all, and from all your gathered and self-separate Congregations, and wait upon the Lord that you may know him to be your Teacher, who is the Teacher of all his People, and he teacheth in the perfect Way of Peace and Truth, and giveth Peace unto all that wait upon him, and causeth the heart of the Upright to rejoyce; he taketh away sin, and removes it from his People, and he forgiveth all their iniquities, and healeth all their backslidings, and blessed are all they that put their their trust in him; for he is a God near at hand; for he dwells with his People, and he is worshipped only in the Spirit and in the Truth. He dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, neither is he worshipped in out∣ward
Observations; his Soul hath no pleasure among any self-separate People, who cry, I am holyer then another, neither is he well pleased with the Sacrifice of the Proud; all their Baptisms, and Fellowships, and Meetings, is but a weari∣ness to the Lords Soul; and he hath no pleasure in any of their works, who fol∣low their own spirit, and are not led with the pure Spirit of God alone, but un∣to every one of sch will he look, who is poor in spirit, and of a contrite heart, and of a single and upright mind; he giveth regard unto every one that fears his Name, who thirst and hunger after him in Truth and Righteousness, and this is of exceeding great price in the Sight of the Lord, yea, more then all Offerings and Oblations whatsoever, even more then thousands of Rams, and ten thou∣sand of Rivers of OYLE. Therefore hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord; and seek him with an upright Heart, and thirst for him as for your daily Food; loose not your precious time, but call upon his Name while he is near, for he is come neer unto many; he stands at the door, if any will open, he will come in, and will dwell with them for evermore. All sorts of People, be Awakened, be Awakened, How doth the Lord wait to be gratious unto you? He even tarrieth for you, till you return to him,  his Soul may have pleasure in you, who hath long been grieved by you: There∣fore search your own hearts, and see how you stand prepared to meet the Lord by following of his Counsel, who hath so loved you, and all Man-kind, that he hath given his Son into the World, to be a Light unto you all, and every on of you is lighted by him, and with the Light you will know your evil deeds, and are convinced of them, and reproved for them; and with this Light Jes Christ calleth you Sinners to Repentance, to turn from your evil, that you may be restored. If you love this Light, you love Christ, who will save you from all your ▪ and from condemnation; If you hate this Light, you hate Christ, and you ∣main in your sins to be everlastingly condemned: And thus is the Way of Life a the way of Death set before you all; if you follow the Light of Christ Jesus, it will teach you to deny this World, and all the vanities of it; it will teach you to de∣ny your own wills, and the counsels of your own hearts, and whatsoever is con∣trary to God in thought, word, or action; and in all things it will teach you to fol∣low Jesus Christ, that you may be justified by him: But if you follow not t Light, then you choose your own wayes, to follow your own wills, and yo own lusts, and all temptations, and you deny Christ, and the Way of Truth, and  the Wrath of God abides upon you; for you continue in unbelief, and in hard∣ness of heart, and are the Servants of sin unto death, if you follow not the Lig which Christ hath enlightened you withal, who lighteth every man that comes ∣to the World, that they may believe and be saved. Therefore take heed to the Light, if you be guided by it, you shall not transgress against God, but you w receive the Power of God to overcome all evil; all sin and iniquity will be con∣demned in you, and your hearts will be made clean for the Lord to dwell in, who dwelling is in his People; and you must all cease from professing of what you  not possess, and from talking of what you do not enjoy, for that is Hypocrisie, an to be judged. So all ye Professors, be Awakened, Christ without you will not justifie you, ex ye know Christ within you, the Profession of him will not take away sin, not ∣stifie in the Sight of God, except you come to witness the operation of his Spirit  you, to teach you to depart from all evil, and to lead you into all good. Therefore come to the feeling of the Spirit of Jesus in you, and the worki of it, which changeth, reneweth, and sanctifieth, and bringeth to witness  same Truth to be manifested in the heart, which the Scriptures speak of without▪ and as you receive the same Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures, so you will u∣derstand the Scriptures, and by no other means; For all your preaching, an talking of the Scriptures without the Spirit is but vain babling, and that mout is to be stopt; for God is not known where the Operation of his Spirit is no felt in the heart, nor he cannot be worshipped in Truth, but where his Spirit lead
and guides. Much vain Profession there is in thee O City, in which the Lord hath no delight; and this is the Testimony of the Lord, which I give concerning thee, and do yet once more call unto thee as often I have done, and do seal the Lords Testimony against thee, even against all thy righteousness, and against all thy sin, which are both alike unto God, and both to be condemned. Thou hast been warned, and thy People, and the day of a glorious Visitation hath passed over thee; the Lord hath reached unto many, and stricken many, who have not grieved, but carelesly walked, and slighted the day of their Visitation, and have not hearkened to the Lords Call; Unto thousands hath the word of the Lord been declared, and the Kingdom of God preached nigh at hand, and the very Way of Life and Death hath been set before you; for the Lord hath sent to thee to warn hee, and to shew unto thee what the Counsel of the Lord is; and thousands have been reached with the Power of God, and convinced of the Way of Life nd Peace, who yet continue in hardness of heart, and disobedience, following the ounsel of their own hearts, and the desire of their own minds, which are wholly evil ontinually, and the condemnation of such will be just in the day of the Lord, and greater then theirs to whom the Way of the Lord hath not been known. And yet mongst thy Thousands who are in the way to destruction, the Lord hath a Rem∣ant, a Few among so many, which are precious unto him, and whom his soul de∣ighteth in, who are despised in thee, and set at nought, and cast out of the sa∣our of all men; yet is the Lords Presence amongst them, and his Fear in their earts, and his encrease is unto them, and his Power with them, till all their nemies be vanished as a Cloud; for they are of the true Seed, and of the true irth, which the Lord will bless, though they be accounted as thy Slaves and ondmen, yet are they free in the Lord; and this is the very fulfilling of thy ickedness, and the height of the Transgression of thy Rulers, Teachers, and eople, in that some of them that fear the Lord, and walk with him are perse∣uted in thee; even they are made a Prey unto the Wicked, to the Slanderers, to he Drunkards, to the Scorners, to Unjust and Cruel men; the People of the ord are become a very prey in thee, even as meat for the Devourers. Oh what ilt thou do in the day of thy Visitation, when the righteous Judge numbreth p these things against thee? Thy staff shall fail thee, thy Phisitians shall be of no value' and all thy Comforters shall be miserable at that day. I have truly onsidered thy condition, and measured thy state, and I have often seriously eighed thy wickedness, and pondered what would be the end thereof, & there is no ision of Peace unto thee, but even the day of desperate sorrow, a recompence or all thy works from the Hand of the Lord. I have often truly lamented thee, and seriously hath thy condition entred into y heart; thy iniquities have often pressed my soul, and my Spirit hath been rieved within me, when I have viewed thy great abomination, and how Thou∣ands in thee wholly perish for lack of Knowledge, and even resists and will not be nstructed, despitefully using such as do warn them, even loving and delighting in heir Abominations. These things have often made my Heart sad, who have walked in thee as a Stran∣ger, and measured thee with the line of true Judgment, and this is thy Height, and ength, and Depth, Iniquity lodgeth in thee, and Iniquity covers thee, and Inquity mpasseth thee about. And this is a Warning to thee from the Lord, in faithfulness declared unto hee, whether thou resist, or receive, thus far I am clear of the Blood of all men in hee, who seeketh not any thing in thee for my self, but seeketh (and hath often) o the Lord for thee, that thy People might know him, and worship him alone, ho giveth unto them all good things, and hath caused the fulness of all good Crea∣ures to abound, and hath given plenty of all things, aboundance of which is pent vainly upon the lust to the dishonour of God who giveth it; How much s vainly spent upon Vanity in Meats, Drinks, and Apparel? Its hard to be eclared what aboundance of the good Creatures of God are vainly destroyed in hee upon the lust in the excess, more then what satisfies pure Nature, your glut∣tonny
and high minds devour in aboundance the good Creatures which God gives, and he is thereby grieved with you, who hath taken notice of this your sin, which is not the least of your Transgressions, and he will plead with you for it; even in all things great is your wickedness, and the Lord hath numbred it. And above all things that is done in thee, thy deceitful Profession, and Pretence of wor∣ship of God, is the Lord most grieved with who hateth all your Meetings of ga∣thered Assemblies, which are not gathered by his Spirit; he will confound yo wisdom, and overthrow all your buildings: Wherefore repent ye, and cease from Idols, and all Idolatry, and cease for ever to warm your selves at your own SPARKS; for this shall you have at the Lords hands, Ye shall lie down is Sorrow. A WARNING to you all sorts of People. YE Merchants, and Traders, and Trafickers, and all ye that Buy and Sell, b plain and upright hearted; and Lye not, Swear not, Dissemble not for gai unto your selves, for that is cursed of the Lord, and the gain that is thereby recei∣ved; but speak the Truth every man to his Neighbour; flatter not such with whom you deal by feigned words of guile, whilst secret over-reaching lodgeth i your hearts, to make a Prey upon your Neighbour or Brother, for this is evil in t sight of the Lord, but speak the Truth in all things, and let your yea be yea, a your nay nay, in all your common occasions, for whatsoever is more is evil; a what is advantaged unto you through Deceit, or Lying, or multitude of va Words, it shall be a Curse unto you, and not a Blessing unto you, or to yo Children; Let the Truth guide you in all your dealings one with an other, a let the Fear of God be in your Hearts in all your Enterprizes both by Sea  Land. I Warn you all seek not by any evil means to enrich your selves, neith oppress one another in any thing wherein you deal; for you know not how lo your time shall be upon Earth, nor how soon the day of account will co wherein every word and every work shall be brought to Judgment, yea for every Idle word shall ye give an account, and all those words are idle which are not spo∣ken in the Fear of the Lord; therefore live and act in the Fear of God, that y may be blessed in all that you do. And all ye whom the Lord hath blessed with Riches and Encrease, see that y abuse not that which God hath blessed you withal, but in all things that it be  to the Glory of the Lord, and not wasted in excess upon the lust of your o minds; for the Creation is the Lords, and all things are given by him, and tak away at his Pleasure, and he maketh rich, and he maketh poor whomsoever he will. Therefore every man be content with his own, and covet not one anothers, nor defraud one another, to enrich your selves, for it is cursed of the Lord. And all ye Handicrafts People, and Labouring People, fear ye the Lord con∣tinually, and use no deceit, nor craft, nor pollicy in what you do, in Labour, seek not to blind mens eyes by fair outsides, neither to cozen and cheat the Simpl by slighty work, but let the Truth Guide you, and that will teach you to d for all men as ye would they should do for you, and this is acceptable in the Sight of God; Let your Commodities be just and right, and let all your labo be with a single heart, and do all things as in the Sight of the Lord, and the you cannot do evil if the Fear of God be before your eyes, and the evil in all things will be denied, and the corruption that is entred into in all Callings an Trades, will be judged out; and be Examples one to another of Truth and Righ∣teousness; and cozen not, nor cheat not one another, nor use not many words, not vain jestures, but own the Lord to be your Teacher, which will teach you Truth, to do it, and to speak it in all things.
And all ye young men and Prentises, Learn ye the Fear of the Lord, and take heed of Temptations, lest ye be destroyed both Soul and Body by them; learn not to Dissemble, nor to Defr and, nor take not Instructions how to Cozen and Cheat, but first seek the Kingdom of God and its Righteousness, and then all outward things shall be added unto you. Give not your selves to any Evil, be∣ware of WINE and WOMEN, which steals away the Hearts of many; give not your selves to Vanity, nor fulfil not the desire of your own minds in any thing; Covet not after Riches, neither study how to be Proud and Vain-glori∣ous; Give not your selves to Craft and human Policies, nor to deceive any Peo∣ple, but fear God and keep his Commandments, and be subject to your Masters, and obey them in all things that are good, and be dutiful to them in that which is just and righteous, but deny them in whatsoever is evil; learn not Craft and Policy from them, neither Whoredom, nor Vice, nor Drunkenness, nor Cozening, nor any other thing which is evil, but rather reprove those things, then in the lest to follow them; and if you do the Truth, and speak the Truth in all things, and keep your selves from whatsoever is evil, then will the Lord bless you outwardly, and inwardly, and the Knowledge of God will be your Crown in old Age; And cease from all Gamings, and vain Sportings, and from all Wontonness, and vain Pleasures, and from all the works of the flesh; for they that follow such things shall neither prosper in this World, nor be blessed in the World to come. Wherefore take heed unto your selves all ye that are young in the World, be not overcome of evil, nor follow not evil Divices, but stand in awe continually, and offend not God, who gives you Life, and Health, and all good things. And all ye Masters and Heads of Families, this is a Warning to you, Be Exam∣ples of all good in your Families unto your Children and Servants; rule in Autho∣rity in the Fear of God, but not in Tyranny, nor a Rigorous mind; teach and instruct in fear, and not in cruelty; give no bad example in Pride, Vain-glory, Drunkenness, Whoredom, Dissimulation, nor any other thing, but stand as a Terror over all evil, and as Encouragers of all good; bind not the Conscience of any under your power, curb sin only, and reprove not Righteousness; seek ye to be taught of God, and then may you instruct all under you in his Way; be pittiful towards your Children, and Servants, and pass by offences rather then punish them with cruelty; and make not a prey upon your Servants, to serve your own ends only, seeking your own good only, and not theirs; for such things are evil in the sight of God, and it is to be condemned: Let no Excess, neither let Want be in your Families, but that which is honest and right, love that in all things, and follow it; let not your anger and passion exceed when offence is given you, and do not cor∣rect in cruelty, but in a good understanding; and walk in the Truth, and fulfil the will of God, and not your own, and this is of great prize and acceptable in the sight of the Lord. And all ye Tavern-keepers, and Inn-keepers, fear the Lord God, and oppress not your Guests, neither feed the lust of any till they be drunk, for that is cursed of God both in you and them, and that which he will be avenged of. Oh great is that abomination among you; much of the good Creatures is vainly and wick∣edly spent, and abused in your Dwellings, and your advantage stands in the abuse of the Creatures by excess, and the Lord is grieved with you because of that. And all sorts of People, Rich and Poor, High and Low, Masters and Ser∣vants, Parents and Children, Buyers and Sellers, Trades-men and Labourers, Hearken to the Counsel of God, and seek to know his Will to you in all things, that you may do it, in following all that which is good, and denying all that which is evil, that your souls may live: Let not the Devil lead you, nor his temptations overcome you in any thing, but resist him in whatsoever he would lead you into, which is against God, and contrary to him. Repent of all evil that ever you have acted, and let the Lord be your Guide, that you may not utterly perish, and your City be destroyed for your sakes; the Lords Love is towards you, and he waits to be gratious unto you, and desireth your re∣turn, rather then your Destruction, and would heal you if you did wait upon
him, and would bless your City, and make you happy in it, if you do his Will, and deny your own. I am a Friend unto all your souls, and a Publisher of Peace, and of Glad-ti∣dings to all that thirst for the Lord, and he hath given me Power to warn you of all your iniquities and Abominations, to deny them, and that which is good to warn you to follow; and Oh that ye knew in this your day the things which belong to your Peace, which now ye may know, before they be totally hid from your eyes, and there be no place for Repentance, nor time of returning; and this day will come upon many, and they cannot escape it, who now harden their hearts against the Way of their own peace, and even scorn to be reproved for their Transgression, and such my soul pitties, who are going in the way of destruction, and run hastily into perdition; I have many times been made sad by reason of such, when I have measured the condi∣on of all People; upon my bed, I have pondred what abomination was in thee, and what would be the end thereof, and I have desired nothing so much, as that I might faithfully warn thee, and free my self, and the Lord from the Blood of all men; deep thoughts have been upon me, concerning what the counsel of the Lord is unto you all, that I might manifest the Truth, and discover the Abominations, and I have not spared to cry Repentance unto Sinners, that Sinners might be converted, and turn unto the Lord; and thus far I am clear of the Blood of all men, and the Lord is clear, and if the Wicked perish, it is because of their unbelief, and gainsaying of the Lord; and this is the Testimony which I give unto thee, and unto all thy people, O LONDON hearken and consider, this is the only day of your Vi∣sitation, and there is not another Way to Life, nor to escape everlasting death, and destruction, then that which the Lord hath shewed you, Blessed is he that can receive it, and they that deny it do utterly perish without Mercy. London the 15th. of the 6th mo∣neth, 1657. I am as a Stranger among you, yet well known to the Lord, and the Te∣stimony of God concerning you shall stand for ever, for it is true, and shall'not be confounded, though the wicked reject it to their own de∣struction. EDWARD BURROUGH.
A Just and Lawful Tryal OF THE Teachers and professed Ministers of this Age and Generation, by a perfect proceeding against them. And hereby they are righteously examined, and justly weighed, and truely measured, and condemned out of their own mouthes, and judged by their own professed Rule, viz. The Scriptures, and thereby are proved to disagree, and be contrary to all the Mini∣sters of Christ in former Ages; and to agree and concur with all the false Prophets and Deceivers in their call, in their maintenance, and in their doctrines, and conversation, and practice. And being brought to the Bar of Justice, these things are truly charged against them, and legally proved upon them, and their own professed Rule (the Scriptures) have judged them guilty. Whereunto is added, A short description of the true Ministry of Christ; and of its lawfull and just maintenance, according to the Apostles Examples, and now again justified by the People of God, called Quakers, in England. THe time of Tryal is come, wherein the Lord is trying the Hearts of men; and now it is manifest what lodgeth in the hearts of all mankind, and by the Fruit every Tree shall be judged. The Lord hath beheld the wick∣edness of this Generation, and it is very great, and cometh not short, but rather abounds all other Generations that have gone before: Wickedness is grown high among Teachers and People, and the measure of iniquity is fulfilling daily. Come, let us reason together; What think you? was there ever such a Generati∣on of Teachers as this is? Have they any example, that ever went before, for their Wickedness? To whom may they be compared? or with whom shall we pa∣rallel them? And because they say the Scripture is their Rule, therefore will we try them by it, and their own Mouth shall Condemn them; and such they shall be concluded to be, whose example they do follow, be it Ministers of Christ, or be t Deceivers; unto the Apostles and Ministers of Christ they are compared, but are found quite contrary in many things, and their Practice fitly suteth and agrees with all the false Prophets and Deceivers. And thus I shall prove them, according to Scripture, wherein these men that are Teachers do disagree to the Apostles and Mi∣nisters of Christ, which he sent forth in former Generations; and wherein they do agree with the Deceivers, and Antichrists, and false Prophets, that have run, and not been sent. Act. 1. 8. 4. 31. Matt. 10. 8. 1 Iohn 1. 1. 1. And first of all, The Apostles and Ministers of Christ were made Ministers of Christ by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and by Power from on high only; and what they ministred unto others, they had freely received from Christ, and had Handled, Felt, and
Tasted of the Word of LIFE. But the Teachers of this Generation do not agree with them in this; for they are made Ministers by natural Learning, and Educati∣on, and the knowledge of Arts, and by the Ordination of men, and by the Pow∣ers of this World (and not by the Gift of the Holy Ghost) and they speak that whcih they have heard out of Books, and studied for by Arts, and which they have received from man, and not that which they have received only from the Lord. 2. The Ministers of Christ they were approved of God, and called by his Spirit into Sal. 1. 5. the work of the Ministry, and were not of man, neither by man. But many of these are approved of man, and not of God; and called by man, and maintained by ma in their Ministry, and herein do they differ and disagree; for (as I said) the Mi∣nisters of Christ were made Ministers by the Holy Ghost, and not by natural learning, but these are made Ministers by natural learning, or otherwise, and not by the Gift of the Holy Ghost. 3. Again, herein do they disagree, The Ministers of Jesus Christ went up  down through the World, declaring the Word of the Lord freely at any time, in the Market∣places, Act. 16. 4, 7, 11, 12. Acts 17. 17. 1 Cor. 4. 11. and in the Synagogues, and in the Streets, and went from Country to Country, and were Strangers upon Earth, not having any certain Dwelling-place, or any great PAR∣SONAGES. But these settle themselves in a certain place, for so much Mo∣ney by the year, and spend their time in ease and pleasure, and lust of the flesh, selling to the People for Money what they preach, and herein they disagree; the Ministers of Christ preached freely as they had received freely: but the Ministers of this Age sell for money what they preach to the People: and thus they differ in their call to the Ministry, and in their practise in the Ministry, and in their maintenance also, as is made manifest to many. 4. Again, the Ministers of Christ preached to bring People into fellowship with G by preaching of the Gospel, through converting Sinners unto the knowledge of the Truth, an  Iohn 1. 3. by no other way did they make Christians, nor counted any so but such as h repented, and were changed by the Spirit. But the Teachers of this Age do ma Christians, by sprinkling them while they are Infants, before they preach the Gosp to them, or before they repent of their sins; and they bring them into fellowship by traditions, and a vain shew of Baptism, and not by the Spirit of God; and her also they disagree, the one counted none Christians but such as were converted by the Spirit of God, and knew the operation of Gods Spirit; and the other co all Christians that are sprinkled when they are Infants, while they are without t Operation of the Spirit of God, and converteth them not unto God by their preaching, but tell them they are Christians before they preach to them. 5. Again, they differ in Doctrine; for the Ministers of Christ Preached C Iohn 1. 9. Act. 26. 18. the Light of the World, and said, he lighted every man that cometh into the World. But the Teachers of this Age contend against that, and say, every one is not enlightened by him, but some have no Light from Christ. And the Ministers of Christ they tu∣ed people to the Light, from the Darkness, and from Satans Power to the Power of God. B the Teachers of this Age do not turn People to the Light of Christ within,  2 Cor. 13. 5. to the Saints words without, or to some other thing, and are divided amo themselves, and so in effect ry, Lo here, and Lo there is Christ in this form,  that form; but the Ministers of Christ said, he was within People, or else they were  probates. 6. Again, the Ministers of Christ said, Christ was the Word, and the Scriptur was a Declaration of what they believed. But the Teachers of this Age say, the Let∣ter Rev. 19. 13. and the Scripture is the Word, and say, It is the Instrument whereby God  soules, and say, it is both the Writings and the thing signified, and say, it is the Founda∣tion of Foundations; but thus the Ministers of Christ never spoke of the Letter. An thus herein they differ and disagree, the one preach Christ to be the Word, the other preach the Letter and Scripture to be the Word: The Ministers of Christ said, Chris was the Foundation, but these say the Scripture is the Foundation, and herein they are contrary and shew by their doctrine another spirit then was in the Apostles. Eph. 2. 20.
7. Again, the Ministers of Christ said, they spake wisdom among them that were perfect: and said, As many of us as are perfect be thus minded: and said, that the end of their Ministry was to present every man perfect in Christ. But the Teachers of this Age deny Perfection, and say, None must be perfect in this life; and if any preach 1 Cor. 2. 6. Phil. 3. Col. 1. 28. up Perfection, that it is to be attained, they say it is Error, and damnable Do∣ctrine; Nay, they say, none shall ever be free from sin, or ever have victory over their sin, nor overcome the body of sin while they be upon Earth: But the Ministers of Christ witnessed they were more then Conquerers, and that they had put Rom. 8. 37. Rom. 6. 22. off the body of Death, and were free from sin, and were the Servants of Righteousness. And herein also they differ, and are not of one spirit; and we know that the Ministers of Christ were guided by the Spirit of God, which held forth these Doctrines; nd we know the Teachers of this Age, that their spirit must needs be of the De∣vil, because it holds forth and practiseth what the Ministers of Christ did not, but the contrary. 8. Again, the Ministers of Christ were persecuted, and suffered cruel and grievous 1 Thess. 5. 15 things for Righteousness sake, as you may read in the Acts, and did not render evil for evil to any man, for they suffered patiently. But the Teachers of this Age are not persecuted, but are Persecutors, and cause Men to be put into PRISONS, nd to be Banished out of Towns; and Sue People at Law, and seeks occa∣sion against the People of God; and herein they disagree, and are not of the same spirit as they were, which were Ministers of Christ, but shew a spirit con∣trary. 9. Again, the Ministers and Apostles of Christ were not chargeable to any, but made 2 Thes. 3. 8. 1 Cor. 11. 26. 22. the Gospel without charge, and free, and laboured with their own hands, and did not live dlely, but were often in cold, hunger, and nakedness, and perils, and tryals. But the Teachers of this Age live in Pride, and Covetousness, and Fulness, and do not work with their own hands, but makes the Gospel of Christ chargeable, for ma∣ny Hundred Thousand Pounds in a Year doe but maintain them, which they have ut of poor mens labours, and so these differ and disagree from the Ministers of Christ, and shew they are not of that Spirit that they were guided by, but are guided by a contrary spirit, because they are contrary in their Call, and in their Doctrine, and Practice, and Maintenance. 10. Again, the Ministers of Christ preached by the Spirit, according as the Acts 2. 4. and 20. 7. Spirit gave them Utterance, and sometimes continued preaching till midnight. But the Teachers of this Age are limited by a Glass, and Preach by a GLASS, and when their Hour is out, their time of preaching is ended; and that which they have studied for before-hand, that they preach, and not that which they have received immediatly from the spirit of God. And herein do they disagree, and in many things more, which after may be declared. 11. Again, the Ministers of Christ said, Ye may all prophesie one by one, that all ight be edified; and as every one had received the gift of Christ, so they might Minister to 1 Cor. 14. 31. 1 Pet. 4. 10. Acts 21 9. hers, and desired that all the Lords People were Prophets, and Sons and Daughters d prophesie, But the Teachers of this Age will not suffer all to prophesie one by ne, neither will allow any to preach as they have received from Christ, without such Qualifications, and learned Arts, and Ordinations of men; and hey will not allow a Woman to prophesie or speak among them; and all might speak Ier. 23. 28. he Word of the Lord faithfully that had it, and all might Minister as they had received it; his was order in the Apostles dayes among them, but this is now counted confusion y the Teachers of this Age; and if any speak to them, or any among them, ma∣y such are made to suffer cruelty, or imprisonment, or such like, by their means; nd herein they disagree, and shew that they are guided by another spirit then e Ministers of Christ were guided by, and so are not his Ministers, but De∣ivers. 12. Again, the Ministers of Christ declared what they had heard, and seen, and 1 Ioh. 1. 1. 2 Cor. 10. 16. and 4. 2. lt, and tasted of the Word of Life; and none of them did boast in another mans line, but hat they all had received of the Lord, that they declared, and not their own in∣entions; and commended themselves to every mans Conscience in the Sight of God; and
they did not provide themselves Studies full of Books to gather out of in a Weeks time what to preach on the first Dayes, as the Teachers of this Age do, who by vai study, and humane learning, frame up, and notes it in a Book, an hour, or two hours discourse to the People. And herein they disagree, and shew that they are guided by a spirit contrary to the Ministers of Christ. 13. Again, the Apostles and Ministers of Christ were called from their Her and from Nets, from their Receipt of Custom, and from their Callings; and by receiving  Holy Ghost were made Ministers of Christ, and did not seek Peoples Money to themsel Mat. 4. 19, 29, 21. Mat. 9. 9. 2 Cor. 12. 14. but sought the People to God, and went through cruel Sufferings and Persecutions many ti that they might hold forth the Way of Life and Truth to all People. But the Teachers  this Age, they are trained up from their Child-hood in Arts and Sciences, risi by degrees from one vanity to an other, till at last they arive to the Function of  Minister of Christ, as they call it, and few or none of them have been called from thei ordinary Calling to preach the Gospel; for such a one is hardly allowed of to pre among People; and they seek Peoples Money to themselves, and the Peopl to God. And herein they disagree, and shew another spirit then was in the Apo∣stles. 14. Again, the Ministers of Christ were led and guided by the Spirit of Christ,  Rom. 8. 14, 1 Iohn 2. 27. did not fulfil their own wills, nor the wills of men; and they brought People  the feeling of the Spirit of Christ in them, to teach them, and after they had beg People to God, they said they needed no man to teach them, but as the anointing  them taught them. But the Teachers of this Age follows their own spirits, and  subject to the wills of men; if men admit them to teach, they do; but if m ∣ny them, then they do not preach; but the Apostles did not thus, for when  forbad them to teach, they did not cease to preach, but went on boldly, declaring the NAM of the Lord. And these Teachers do not bring People to know the Spirit of C Acts 4. 17, 18, 19. in them, neither can any through their preaching receive the Anointing to  in them, that so they do not need any man to teach them; but People  ever learning so long as they live, and never able to come to the knowledge of  Truth, and People are not profited at all. And in this thing they disagree,  shew another spirit then the Apostles were guided by, even the spirit of  christ. 15. Again, the Ministers of Christ were low, poor, meek, sober, humble men,  as did not exalt themselves, nor maintain themselves in Pride and Fulness, by  ceiving Heb. 11. 37, 38. of poor Peoples labours. But the Teachers of this Age are Proud,  Heady, High-minded, Self-willed, and Exalted spirits, living in Idleness, P and Fulness, and receive of the Labours of poor People. And herein they  gree, for the Apostles were often in Cold, Hunger, and great Sufferings, and  plexities; but these are as fed Horses, the Proudest of all people, and the  Covetous of any men, and all men must Bow to them, and call them Ma which is quite contrary to Christs Command. And thus they shew another  then what the Ministers of Christ were guided by; and if another spirit, it  needs be the spirit of the Devil; for either the Spirit of Christ leads men,  spirit of the Devil. And now seeing that the Teachers of this Age bring forth fruits contrary to  Ministers of Christ, it shews that they are not guided by the Spirit of Christ, cause in their Calling, in their Ministry, in their Maintenance, in their Life  Conversation, and in their Doctrine they are not the same, but quite contrary the Apostles and Ministers of Christ: What can we conclude of them? We have  cluded already that such are Deceivers, whose works are of another nature,  who are guided by another spirit then the Ministers of Christ were; for C saith, Every Tree is known by its Fruits; and this is sufficient what I have said,  if need require, it may further be made to appear in the sight of the whole Wo and sufficiently proved, that they differ in all these things mentioned, and many more, and are not one with the Apostles, neither in Call, nor Practice,  Maintenance, nor in Doctrine, nor in Conversation, nor any other thing,  do disagree, and are quite contrary so as it is concluded, these are not the Mi∣sters
of Christ, though they profess themselves to be so, because they bring forth fruits quite contrary to the Spirit of Jesus, which the Spirit of Jesus did, and doth reprove; And seeing they are not guided by the Spirit of Jesus, because their fruits are contrary to it, then must they needs be guided by the spirit of Antichrist, and so are the Ministers of Antichrist, and do his works by his spirit. And fur∣ther, I shall shew wherein they do agree with the false Prophets and false Apostles, and wherein they are like unto them in their Ministry, and Practice, and Doctrine, and Conversation; and if the Marks of Deceivers fall upon them in the sight of all people, why should they not bear it? And if the same works be proved to be acted by them, which the false Prophets and Deceivers acted, then why should t be thought a thing incredible among men that these are Deceivers? 1. First, the false Prophets run, and were not sent, and they did not profit the people at Ier. 23. Chap. all, for they stood not in the Counsel of God, and so they turned not any from their iniquity, bt rather strengthened the Hands of the Evil-doers, so that none could turn from their wick∣eess; and they spoke a Vision of their own hearts, and not from the Mouth of the Lord; and they said still to the wicked, The Lord hath said, ye shall have Peace; and to every one that walked after the Imaginations of his own heart, they cryed, No Evil shall come upon him; and the Priests and the Prophets were prophane, as you may read, Ier. 23. And this is a fit parallel for the Teachers of this Generation, they can shew no Call from God, nor by his Spirit, neither are People profited by them, as experience doth shew and teach through this Nation; and they do cry Peace to the wicked, and count all Christians, and followers of Christ, that are but sprinkled when they are Infants, though they live in wickedness; and from them, as from the Prophets of Israel, is prophaneness gone forth into many Nations, and a wicked example of evil these give to all Nations; neither do these speak from the Mouth of the Lord, but a Vision of their own heart, and what old Authours say, and at the best, but what the Saints of the Lord said before them, and this is no more, as done by them, then eling of the Prophets words, or the word from their Neighbour. Again, you may read how the false Prophets used their Tongues, and said, The Lord saith it, when t Lrd th never spoken to them, but only what they had stole from others, who were the Prophets of the Lord; and this is a fit example to the Teachers of this Age, and a tre prallel between them; for these dare not own that ever they heard the voice of the lord immediately, nor that they spoke from the mouth of the Lord imme∣dly, but use their Tongues, and say, The Lord said so by such a Prophet, when  themselves have not received the Word from the Lord; and the Lord was  ch who prophesied Lyes, as did the false Prophets of Israel, as the Teach∣ers of is Age do, as it is manifest, and the Lord is against them. And herein do they agree, and concur with the false Prophets in their Call, and are in concord wih the Deceivers of old. 2. Again, the false Prophets, and blind Watch-men of Israel, they were ignorant,  they were greedy dumb Dogs, that never could have enough, and they looked to their own , and every one sought for his gain from their Quarter, and they were drinkers of Wine,  strong Drink, and boasted that tomorrow should be as this day, Isa. 56. And this is  it parallel with the Teachers of this Age; for they are blind Watch-men, and do not discover to People the wickedness of their wayes, and no less can be said of tm, then that they are greedy dumb Dogs; for they all look to their own way, and every one of them hath a Quarter (a TOWN or a PARISH) from which they seek their Gain; and some of them are Lovers of Wine and strong Drink, as daily experiences witness. And herein the Teachers of this Generati∣n e proved to succeed the false Prophets in the same works, and shew they are  by the same spirit, because they so fitly agree and concur in their works, and   plain to all men that are but reasonable, much more to them that are spiri∣. 3. Again, the Deceivers, such as were false Prophets, Preached for Hire, and Mic. 3. Chap.  for Money, and yet leaned upon the Lord, and said, Is not the Lord among us? And te Techers of this Age they have Hire for preaching, and great sums of Money,  they say they lean upon the Lord; of these things there needs no proof, they
are so plain, in every Town, and Country, where the Priests preach for Hire, and the Prophets divine for Money. And herein they fitly agree, and concur with the Deceivers of old, and follow them as an example, shewing that they walk by the very same spirit. 4. Again, the false Shepherds of Israel were like Foxes in the desarts, for they followed their own spirits, and had seen nothing but lying Divinations, saying, the Lord said, when the Lord had not sent them; and they seduced the People, saying, Peace, and there was no peace to them from God; and one builded a Wall, and another daubed it with untempered Morter; and with Lyes the Heart of the Righteous they made sad, whom Ezek. 13. the Lord had not made sad, and strengthned the hands of the wicked (that he should not re∣turn from his wicked way) by promising him life. And this is a fit parallel to the Tea∣chers of this Age, for they follow their own spirits, because they do things con∣trary to the spirit of Jesus; and they have seen nothing but lying vanities, and di∣vinations, whereby they do seduce the People, by telling them they are Christians, and that they are Baptized into the FAITH of Christ, and that they have the Seal of the remission of sins, by being sprinkled with water when they were In∣fants; and these are lying Divinations by which they seduce people, and say they shall have peace while they still continue in sin; and thus they build a Wall, and daub it with untempered Morter; and make a Christian of their own, and  him with false hopes, and with such Lyes as these, and many other which they de∣clare for doctrine, the heart of the Righteous is made sad at this day, and the hands of the wicked is strengthned, that he cannot turn from his wicked way; for life is promised to him, though he be wicked, and ungodly, living in all unrigh∣teousness; for they tell him Christ is his righteousness to justifie him, and then he thinks he need not to turn from his sins; and so their hands are strengthned, that they cannot turn from their sins. And herein the Teachers of this Age, and false Prophets do fully agree, and are so like one to the other, as Children of one Fa∣ther, and their works are so alike, as crafts-men of one Science; and thus they are one in union, and follows the same spirit. 5. Again the Shepherds of Israel, and idle Pastors, and Deceivers, they eat the Ezek. 34. fat, and they clothed themselves with the wool, and they killed them that were fed, but thy feed not the Flock, the diseased they did not strengthen, neither healed they the SICI, neither bound they up the broken, neither brought they again that which was driven  neither did they seek again that which was lost; but with Force and Cruelty they ruled  Flock, and it was scattered, and become meat to all the Beasts of the Field, and the  wandred throughout all the Mountains; and the flock was scattered, and none of the  herds, did search or seek after them, and they eat and drank up the good of the P, and trod down the residue with their feet, and they thrust with side and with sh and they pushed all the Diseased with their horn, till they scattered them abroad; N this is a fit comparison with the practise of the Teachers of this Age; for  eat the fat, and lives in pleasures, and fulness most of any, and they clothe with the Wool; for they claim the tenth part of every mans Wool; And if any be fed by the true Shepherd, they seek to kill them, and to devour their Life,  causing them to be imprisoned, and cruelty done unto them; and they feed  the Flock, neither do they strengthen the diseased, nor heale the sick, neither  they up the broken; for if any be wounded, and cries out because of the b den of sin, and be sick, and broken, and trembles at the WORD of the Lord, such they cry out are deceived, and mock at them; and the Image of God, which hath been driven away & lost, they have not sought in People, but with cruelty  they ruled among People, by running to Magistrates, and causing such to be put  prison, that would not help to maintain them; and thus with cruelty do  rule among People, as it is witnessed by many Testimonies in England; and the peo∣ple are scattered, and wandred into many Sects, and false Judgments, and  Opinions, and they are not sought after by the Teachers of this Age, to re them to the Truth by sound Doctrine, but they persecute them; and the Sheph feed themselves, and not the Flock, and even eat up the good pasture, and tr down the residue; and drink of the deep Waters, and fouls the residue with t
feet, so that none that follow them can drink of the pure Waters, nor eat of the Bread of Life; and they thrust with side, and with shoulder and push all the disea∣sed which are wounded, because of their sin, who is ready to die for want of the Bread of life, which denies and are weary of their abominations; these they push at with their horns, and causeth to be persecuted; and thus they fitly agree with the false Shepherds of Israel, and is no whit wanting in any thing wherein they were guilty, but rather abounding; which sheweth that they follow the same spi∣rit, and are of the same stock, and seed, and the Lord is against these, as he was against them in old time; and no more are these Ministers of Christ that acts these things, then they were which acted the same things by the same spirit; and this is plain to all that shuts not their eye, and stops not their ear. 6. Again, the false Prophets and Deceivers, they made the people err, and did bite with their Teeth, and cried peace, but they that put not into their Mouths, they prepare War against them, as you may read Micah 3. now the Teachers of this Age brings forth the very same; for they cry peace unto all that puts into their mouths, though people be never so ungodly; if they will maintain them, they cry peace to them, but if people put not into their mouths, they prepare war against them, by suing them at the Law, and casting them into Prison, if any deny to pay them Tythes, or Money, though they have no due to it by the Law of Christ, such do pre∣pare open war against them, by distraining their Goods, and taking treble dama∣ges, and casting their bodies into bonds; and herein the Teachers of this Age agrees with the false Prophets of Israel; can any man be so blind that doth not see it? doth any man stop their ear, so as that they cannot hear this to be true? they shew themselves in all things to be one with the false Pro∣phets of Israel, when justly they are tried by their own Rule, as they say, and so let them bear this judgement, which their own professed Rule judg∣eth with. 7. Again, the Priests and false Prophets of Israel, this is said of them, That as Troops of Robbers waits for a man, so the company of Priests murders in the way, with consent; for they commit lewdness, Hos. 6. 9. And what less may be spoken of the Teachers of this Age, Spiritual men shall judge; for if any man doth but cease from their abominable worship, their deceitful worship, and Idolatry, and come to the knowledge of God, they even seek to murder in the way, and cry out against them for being deluded, and deceived, and such like; so that like as Troops of Robbers wait for a man, so it may be said of the Teachers of this Age, for they take away the Key of Knowledge, and will not enter in themselves to the know∣ledge of the Truth, nor suffer them that would, and indeed, whatsoever abomination the Teachers and Prophets of Israel were found guilty of, the Teachers of this Age do not come short, but rather abound, let search be made through the Scriptures, and see, whether there was any evil committed by them, I mean the false Prophets of Israel, that is not committed by the Teachers of this Age; what were they guil∣ty of, that these can free themselves from? If any man hath a word to say, let us hear it, and come out with your Arguments ye wise men, and let us hear your Plea; and they doing the same works which the false Prophets of Israel did, must needs e concluded to be Followers of the same spirit, and that they are no less then they were, whose examples they follow, which are followers or the false Prophets, and ot of the Ministers of Christ. 8. Again Christ in his warning, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, who gives he description what they were, and what their practises were, and he saith, they meaning the Pharisees) did bind heavy Burdens, grievous to be born, and they laid them n mens Shoulders, but themselves would not move them with one of their fingers; and their k they do to be seen of men, and loves the uppermost rooms at Feasts, and the chiefest Seats Matth. 23.  Synagogues, and greetings in the Markets, and to be called of men Masters. Now the eachers of this Generation are like unto these, they do succeed the Pharisees in inging forth the same fruits; for do not these bind heavy burdens, grievous to  born, and laying them on mens shoulders, making them suffer grievous ings through their cruelty, as imprisonment, and spoiling their goods,
these are grievous burdens which they lay upon men, but they will not touch them with one of their fingers; and their works are done to be seen of men, for they think to be heard for their much babling; and we know they love the uppermost Rooms at Feasts, and hath it often; and the chief place in the Synagogue, they love that, and have it; and to be called of men Master, which Christ forbids his Ministers to be, they love that, and they have it. And herein do they agree with the Pharisees, and in other things, if we should duely examine the Scriptures, shewing that they are of the same spirit, which the Pharisees were of, which crucified Christ. 9. Again, the Pharisees and Deceivers were Persecutors, such as complained to the Magistrates, as you may read through all the New Testament, and the Book of the Acts, and elsewhere; How the chief Priests caused the Saints to be persecuted by lying in∣formations, and grievous Complaints to the Elders and Rulers; they sought to take Christ by Act. 24. 1, 2, 4, 6. Mat. 26. 3, 4. subtilty, and kill him; and they persecuted the Apostles to prison, and some to death, and others to bonds, and cruel sufferings. And this was done chiefly by, or through,  complaint of the Priests. It was Amaziah the Kings Priest that complained to Jerobo∣am, and informed against the poor Prophet Amos; and it was Shimshia the Scribe, that com∣plained to the King against the building of the City of God; and it was the son of the Pri Amos 7. 10. that persecuted Jeremiah. And herein also the Teachers of this Generation  agree and concord with the chief Priests, with, and in persecuting the innocent, Ier. 20. 19. shewing that they are of the same spirit; for now they complain and inform against the People of God, and through their information evil is done against them;  it is they through their lying, and false accusations to the Magistrates by whom  Saints do suffer; and in all these things they do fully agree, and concur with t Deceivers of old. 10. Again, the false Apostles, they were such as went for filthy Lucre, and th covetousness, with feigned words, made merchandize of souls, and denied the Lord  bought them, and brought in damnable Heresies, and they walked after the flesh, in the  Tit. 1. 11. 2 Pet. 2. and uncleanness, and despised Government, and were presumptuous, and self-willed,  sported themselves with their own deceivings, and they could not cease from sin, but b unstable souls, and an heart they had exercised in covetous practises, and they went astr, ∣ving the way of Balaam, loving the Wages of unrighteousness; and they were Wells  Water, and were Clouds that are carried with a Tempest; they speak great swelling words of ∣nity, and allured through the lust of the flesh, through much wantonness, those who were es from them, who lived in Error, and they promised others liberty, and themselves way  Servants of corruption. Now the Teachers of this Age are found guilty of,  in all these things they agree, which the false Apostles were guilty of; for  through covetousness, with feigned words, do make merchandize of the people; any will give them more money at the next Town, they will sell the People  they are and go where there is more MONEY; and seeing they are out of  Doctrine of Christ, it is no less then denying the Lord that bought them. And that they hold damnable Errors, this I can pove; For At Reding. one of  said in my hearing, That the Scripture was the Foundation of Foundation And At Ware. another said, That the Scripture was both the Writings and the thing s∣nified. And these are as damnable Errors as ever the false Apostles brought  and these, they walk after the lust of the flesh, in Pride and fulness thereof,  despise the Government of Christ, and are presumptuous, self-willed, lofty,  spirited men; and as the false Apostles did, so do these speak evil of things  know not, of things they understand not; and no less can be said of these,  that they sport themselves with their own deceivings, and they cannot cease fr sin themselves; for it is a principal doctrine among them, That none must be  from sin while they be upon Earth; and they deceive unstable souls, who th them to be Ministers of Christ, when as they were never sent of Christ; and it  evident, that their hearts are exercised with covetous practises, who sue poor P∣ple at Law, some for Twelve Pence, which they are more able to give to,  they whom they sue to receive from; and they follow the Error of Bal and run after him greedily, who went for Gifts and Rewards, as do these,
have unrighteous Wages, cause people to pay them money, for whom they do not work, and this is unrighteous Wages; these are Wells without Water, and Clouds without Rain; they make a shew of Godliness and Righteousness, when as they are prophane and unrighteous, and they speak great swelling words of vani∣ty, professing themselves to be Orthodox, Divines, and such like, which are no more but words of vanity without Truth; and they seek to allure all people to follow them in their way of Idol Worships, and so they are deceived and decei∣ving; and while they promise liberty to others, by Christ, from sin, when they are dead, themselves are the Servants of corruption, and live in sin to this day, and in all things which the false Apostles were guilty of; these come not behind, but these do shew by their works, that they are guided by the same spirit, which was in the Deceivers of old, and so they agree and concur one with another in unrigh∣teousness. Again, the false Prophets and Deceivers, which were come, and coming in the dayes of Iohn, they were of the World, and the World heard them: And they were them which Christ prophesied of, should come into the World, which should de∣ceive many; and such were they which the Apostle saw coming in, 2 Tim. 3. and 1 Iohn 4. 5. Mat. 24. A &. 20. 29. 1 Tim. 4. 2 Tim. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8. he said, after his dayes greivous Wolves should come in, which should not spare the Flock, such as were departed from the FAITH, and spake Lyes in Hypocrisie, having their Con∣sciences sed with a hot Iron; and such were they, Covetous, Boasters, proud Blasphemers Unthankful, Unholy, without natural Affection, Truce-breakers, false Accusers, Inconti∣nent, fierce, Despisers of those things which were good; Traytors, Heady, High-minded, Lovers of Pleasure more then Lovers of God; they have the form of Godliness, but deny the Power therereof; and People by them were ever learning, but never able to come to the know∣ledge of the Truth; of this sort the Apostle saw was coming, and would come more fully, and such are the Teachers of this Age; for they are of the World, living in Pride, and the Wickedness of it; and the World hears them, such as them∣selves, proud and wicked People; for they that fear God, and walk in his Wayes, are departed from many of them; and they shew that they have no Faith, but are departed from it; for FAITH keeps from evil, from the wayes of sin and death, which they live in; and Lyes in aboundance they speak, in hypocrisie; and their Consciences are seared, that is plain, else they could not do as many of them do, who cause innoent People to be put in prison, and make havock of their Goods, who will not pay them Tythes, or maintain them; and they are the proudest of men, and as Covetous as any, and Unthankful, and Unholy they shew themselves to be, and they are false Accusers, and Truce-breakers, for they hardly make any Conscience of belying the People of God in the Pulpits, or to the Magistrates; and they are Heady, High-minded; and if some of them be not Treacherous, judge ye, who have turned divers wayes in their judgments, according to the times; and they have a Form of Godliness, but not the Power; pray and sing in a form, and preach in a form and method; and people are ever learning by them, sixty Years, or more, or less, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth, but dye in ignorance and blindness, without knowledge, under them. And herein do they agree also with the false Prophet and Antichrist, which Iohn saw to be come in, and such as the Apostle saw, which were then coming in; and they shew the very same spirit, by the same works, and the same fruits which appear from them; men of understanding may compare them in all these things. They do agree, and appear to be of that very Stock and Generation which the Apostle prophesied of, for they were grievous Wolves, which should not spare the Flock, which the Apo∣stle saw; and these do not spare the FLOCK, but even devour them, and no less then grivous Wolves can they be said to be; For if a poor Woman hath but ten EGGES in all the World, they will have one, in many parts of this Nation; or but ten Chickens, they will have one; or but a Fire in their House, they will have a Penny for the Smoak, and such like wolvish, devouring wayes; and if these be not grievous Wolves, let all the World judge. And here is their Treachery made manifest, while they say they preach the Gospel in love to souls, yet its mani∣fest they preach for love of Money, for few, or none of them preach where there
is no money; and People are absolute blind, that do not see them, for in all things they agree with the Deceivers and false Prophets of old, and shew that they be of the very same spirit; and thus you see their own Rule condemns them; and be∣cause they say the Scripture is their Rule, therefore I have thought good to lay them to it, and measure them by their own Line; and all People may see wherein they are quite contrary to the Ministers of Christ, and wherein they wholly agre with the Deceivers; Let them hide themselves from this blow if they can, and let them bring their Arguments against this sentence, and let all their Friends appear for them, and see if they can reverse this judgment, which their own line hath judged them by, let them bring in their Plea, and defend themselves from this, if it be possible; for in those things which I have▪ named, and many other, it is mani∣fest, that they fully agree with the Deceivers, and disagree with the Ministers of Christ, and by their fruits they are perfectly made manifest. Again, Christ spake in his dayes, and the Apostles in their dayes, that false Prophets and Deceivers should come into the world, and after them; and they gave descriptions what such they should be, and what fruits they should bring forth, as I have before mentioned in that 1 Iohn 2. and it is plain that these Deceivers and false Prophets did come in, according as was prophesied; for Iohn said, By this we know it is the last times, for now are they come, which was many hundred years ago: I say, the Deceivers and false Prophets which Christ prophesied of to come, Matth. 24. came into the World many hundred years ago, as you may read 1 Iohn 2. And with this I shall conclude this particular. The Teachers of this Age, by their ruits, are proved already to be of that stock, and succeed∣ers in the same works, by the same spirit of them which Christ said should come, and which the Apostle saw was then come, and so they did deceive ma∣ny, as these do deceive many in the same way, as them that went before them; And so let it not be a thing incredible to the people of these Nations, that ma∣ny of these Teachers, which are called Ministers, are Deceivers generally, b if there be any one that ears God among them, or loves Truth and Sincerity▪ it will be made manifest, and such I spare, and they shall be spared in the day  the Lord; but yet I say, generally, and the main part of them, even they  bring forth these fruits before mentioned, which the false Prophets brought forth▪ are not the Ministers of Christ, but Deceivers, the Scripture, their own pro∣fessed Rule, doth prove them so; for it must needs be that they must be the same men that they were, whose spirit they walk by, and whose fruits they bring forth▪ and this cannot be avoided, they are the same trees that brings forth the same fruits; and let no man blame me for saying such are Deceivers that preach for hire, and divine for money, and goes for gits and rewards; and that are called o men Master, and have the chief place in the Assemblies, and are covetous, and high-minded, and seeks for their gain from their Quarter, with those things which I have mentioned, which are the same things which the false Prophets acted in Ages past; I am not now to be blamed for saying, These are Deceivers, who are acting such things now in this Age, as they acted then that were Decei∣vers; but if you blame any, begin with Isaiah, and Micah, and Ezekiel, and Christ and his Apostles, and the rest of the holy men of God, for they are my exam∣ples in this, who did declare against them that brought forth such works, as these do that I have declared against: and I have done the Teachers of this Age no wrong for judging them by their own Line, and laying them to their own professed Rule; therefore do not rage at me, nor do not be offended a this; for I have but compared them with the Ministers of Christ, and with the Mi∣nisters of Antichrist, and shewed wherein they do agree to the one, and disagree to the other; and all People may see, and the Light in all Consciences may judge of what I have said; so that as I said at the first, I may again say, What think you? Was there ever such a Generation of Teachers? I now answer, Yea, There was in the dayes of the true Prophets, and in the dayes of the Apostles there were such as these are, which were Deceivers; and in the times of Christ there were such a Generation as these are, who acted the same things by the
same spirit, as these do at this day? Let them reply to this that will, my Question is sober, and my Answer is just and right, and I have dealt faithfully, and you may read the Scriptures, that I have quoted for your own satisfaction; for, though they falsly say, the Scripture is their Rule, and accuse us falsly, that we deny the Scripture, yet the Scripture shall be Judge between us in this matter; and what I have done is not in envy to any mans person, neither in upbraiding them in their wickedness, but I do it rather to shew them all their iniquities, that they may repent; and this I have done in perfect love to all people, for the Day is come that hath brought hidden things to Light, and Deceit and Hypocrisie which hath lain hid, is now fully made manifest, as at Noon-day. But again, secondly I answer, In some respects I do believe there was never such a Generation of Teachers as these are; for we do not read in all the Scrip∣tures concerning the false Prophets, that they were so extreamly covetous and greedy of gain as these are, or that ever they took such desperate, wicked, unlawful courses to get their maintenance, and compel people to pay them, as these Teachers do, a very shame to rehearse it, and to their shame I do rehearse it, many a poor man in this Nation hath been sued by them at the LAW, and put in PRISON by their means, and had their Goods spoiled in a woful manner, for to maintain them, and to uphold them; yea, some hundreds of poor people, in this Nation, have been dealt cruelly by, and unjustly with, because for Conscience sake they have denied to maintain them, to pay them Tythes, and such like; this may be proved, that for five Shillings, unjustly claim∣ed by them, they have taken Goods by Distraint to the value of five times so much, as Cumberland and Westmerland can witness; and many at this very day lie in Holes and Prisons by the means of the Priests, who tear the People as Wolves do the Sheep; its even woful to be considered what havock is made of some mens persons, and some mens GOODS, and all to maintain the Teachers? The like never was in any Generation, as it is brought forth in this Generation in this particular: And again, their exceeding covetousness and greediness of Lucre doth appear, in that they claim Wages of People, and do com∣pel People to pay them Wages, after this manner, as I have said, for which people they do no work; neither do these people receive any work done by them, with whom they thus deal; What thing can be more unjust under Heaven; that they should compel people by a Law to pay them, and thus punish them if they will not, who set them not on work, and for whom they do no work? neither do the people like their work, or love it, but know it to be deceitful, and yet are compelled by a Law to pay them; they have such a way to get money, that no Trades-man hath the like of it besides themselves, for they cause People, and compel people to buy their Wares; and they compel people to pay for their Commodity, which have none of it, nor love it, and this is more unjust then may be spoken: Are they like Ministers of Christ? Or do they follow their ex∣ample in these practises? What do you judge? All people bring in your Verdict; or are they not like Deceivers herein, even exceeding all that ever went be∣fore? It is true, They which preach the Gospel should live on the Gospel; this Argument we do own; but let these men be tryed, and see if by their preaching their Gos∣pel they have gained so much love in people, as to maintain them without the Law, and without compelling of Maintenance & Lively-hood from them by a Law; let but the Law cease to compel Tythes, and other things from people to maintain them, & see whether their Gospel will maintain them or not; let but the Magistrates hold up their hands from causing people to pay them Tythes by their orders & writs and I'le undertake, as I do believe they must either beg, or work, or a worse thing for a lively-hood, or else perish, so little love is there in their own People towards them, nor have they gained any in the hearts of people towards them, for many years that they have preached; and herein again I do believe that they do exceed all the false Prophets, and all the Deceivers that ever went before them in this respect, none ever had the Magistrates to act for them as these have, & as it appears the Rulers some of them, are at the wills of the Teachers, to do for them what they desire, either
to take Peoples goods, or to send them to Prison; shewing that these Teac have not a spiritual Weapon to defend themselves; but that the Magistrates wi their Law are their chiefest ARMOUR; for if they can but get favour of  Magistrate, they have allowance to preach at such a place, and if they can get the favour of a Magistrate they can do well enough to be maintained, by cau such to be sent to prison, or taxing treble damages upon their Goods, if they wi not help to maintain them; and if they have the favour of the Magistrates, if any do reprove them for these things, and for others of their wickedness, and if any do but tell them of it, they can have such sent to Prison, as in revenge, as for speaking and reproving them for their wickedness, hath some hun∣dreds of innocent People suffered imprisonments, and other cruel things in these Nations; so that iniquity is upheld, as it were, by Force and Power; so that it is not their Gospel that maintains them, nor gets them favour with the peo∣ple, nor doth it defend them, but it is the command and Warrant of a Magistrate which doth all this; so when the Magistrates cease to approve them, to maintai them, and efend them, they must utterly fall into misery, and can neither be ap∣proved▪ maintained, or defended any other way; for, because of this their wick∣edness, God hath left them, and all honest true hearted People have left them; and therefore, what a condition are the Teachers in, who deserve not the love of me because they are so cruel hearted towards them, and they deserve not the Love of God, because they are so wicked against him? And I might yet more fully de∣scribe and declare, wherein they do exceed the Deceivers and false Prophets of old; but of this, according as the Lord moveth and leadeth; and this may suffice to shew what they are by their works, and by the spirit that leads them, which ap∣pears not to be the Spirit of God, but the spirit of Antichrist. Furthermore, and besides all this, which I have said, herein they do exceed the Deceivers that are gone before; for upon account, the sum of their Mainte∣nance yearly in these Nations, being reckoned, may be about One Milli∣on and five hundred thousand∣pounds per∣annum. Fifteen Hundr Thousand POUNDS a Year: Oh wonderful! Is not this almost incredible, that the Teachers should put the Nations to such a charge as this, and yet people receive nothing answerable to it? But all this Money is spent for that which is  Bread, and their labour wasted, and they have no profit thereby: This money might be made better use of, then to give it for deceiving the people: And if any doubt of this account, and shall think this is not like to be true, upon an even r∣koning, it may be proved and made appear, considering how many Parishes th are, and reckon what belongs to every Priests Parish, with what is given to  Priests in Ireland, which is aboundance: These things are a shame to the Mini∣stry of Christ, though the impudent Teachers of these Nation are void of sha herein. A Reply to the Priests Plea, and an Answer to their Objections. WHereas many of the Priests of ENGLAND, to hide themselves fr the charge of being Hirelings, they alledge these Scriptures, The L∣bourer is worthy of his Hire, and the Workman is worthy of his Meat: but these Scrip∣tures will not serve to cover their shame in what is charged against them; for  Luke 10. 7, 8. Hire which Christ allows to the Labourers, is but to remain in the same house into  they enter, eating and drinking such things as they give them, with such who were  they were to remain, and to eat that which was set before them; and they labou truly, and travelled up and down, and were truly worthy of meat for their work, and of this Hire for their Labour: But this makes nothing for the lawful∣ness of so many pounds a year at a certain place; this is more then eating
house, which is worthy to bargain with people for so much the year, and compelling people to pay by a Law, that do deny; Christ never instituted such a practice, neither can it be truly said, that these called Ministers do labour as the Ministers of Christ did, and so this Scripture is but wrested by them, when they bring it for proof of their practice for their hundred pounds a year, compelling some of it from the peo∣ple, doth exceed eating and drinking to suffice nature, with such who are worthy; So this Scripture maketh not for their turns, nor doth it justifie their▪ Pra∣ctises. Again, they Object, against our charge, the words of Paul, who said, He that preacheth the Gospel shall live on the Gospel, and that it was a small matter to reap carnal things, from them unto whom they sowed Spiritual things; but this Scripture makes not for them; for as I said, its not the preaching of the Gospel that maintains them, but the Magistrates with their Law, that compelleth Maintenance from the people, and this is not to live on the Gospel; for we allow, as Paul did, that they which preach the GOSPEL should live on the Gospel; Therefore let the Magistrates cease, with their Power, to cause people to pay them, and let all the World see if their Gospel will maintain them; and let them reap their carnal things from them where they sow spiritual; but they must reap as a free Gift too, and not by compulsion, for so the Apostle signifies, it is a small matter for any to reap carnal things where they sow spiritual things; yet what is this to prove the lawfulness of bargaining with people for so much by the YEAR, as these Teachers of ENGLAND do, many of them, and will not preach ex∣cept they have so much promised them before? For it is right to reap after sowing, but it is a transgression to bargain to reap before they sow; and these Scriptures will not hide them, nor defend them in their practice; for if the Magistrates did not compel from people Maintenance by a Law, the Priests of this Age would reap but little from any thing that they sow; for there's little love in the hearts of the people towards them. Also they Object, He that plants a Vineyard may eat of the fruit thereof; and he that keeps a Flock, may eat of the Milk of the Flock, this Paul said, though he would not make use of his power herein, but wrought with his hands, that the Gospel might not be chargeable; but what Vineyards have the Teachers of England planted? or what Flocks do they keep? Their Vine∣yards prove not tender Grapes; but wild ower Grapes; wild Vines, and not Vines to bring forth acceptable fruits; and their Flocks prove not Flocks of sheep; but wilde rude people who are in the nature of Wolves and Lions; and if the Magistrates Law were not, their Vineyard no the flock would hardly yield them any maintenance; the Apostles planted first a Vineyard, and gathered the heep, before they reaped or eat any of the fruit, but the Teachers of England differ from them in this, for they know what they must have before they plant, or before they feed their flock, and differ from the Apostles practice, who first planted a Vineyard, and gathered a flock before they could receive any crop; and they would  then use their power, but kept the Gospel of Christ without charge, so that this Scripture will not prove the Priests actions lawful, in preaching for sums of money: nd some other Scriptures they bring to prove the lawfulness of their preaching for ire, which may all be answered as these are, and whatsoever they can object will ot justifie them, for their reaping carnal things, and their hire, and their eating f the milk of the flock, is quite of another nature, as is proved, then the Apostle ractices were; and were the people wie they would see and understand these hings, and not be deluded through perverting of Scriptures, and through wresting of them, to other ends then wherefore they were given forth; and this is written o answer some of their objections, whereby they would defend themselves, for hat though Paul took of other Churches to supply his necessities, as sometimes he did, yet his will not prove the lawfulness of their hundreds of pounds by the year, most of which they spend in pride and idleness; so that still this Judgment is true pon them which I have given, all objections being answered, and all defences eing made yoid; and hereof they are guilty, as I have charged them, and pro∣ed it out of the Scripture: They disagree to the Ministers of Christ, and agrees
with the Deceivers, and in some particulars exceeds them, for I believe all the fals Prophets in Israel did not destroy any whit near a Million and a half of Money in a year, considering all things, it must come to little less, their Funeral Ser∣mons, their great Tythes, and small Tythes, and Marriages, and Sprinkling of Infants, and Churching of Women, with other such Penuries claimed by the Church of England, with what is given to them out of the Nations treasure, which is many hundred pounds a year, also considering how much in a year is spent, and consumed at two or three Colledges in this Nation, in relation to the Ministry; as in bringing some up to the attainment of the Ministry; (is they call it) and upon the Educators of such, with a very great abundance of such like charges, consumed out of the Nations treasure, which is wasted, as in rela∣tion to this Ministry spoken of: I do not speake against good education and lear∣ning, which is in its place a vertue, (as for Travellers, and many others) neither do I account such money vainly wasted and spent; but onely as to the Ministry of Christ, natural learning is not there admitted to make Ministers, or to enable them thereunto; but that money which is thereupon spent, is wasted and consumed; and how much is spent in this way, and for such an end onely, I leave wise men to judge, which will make up a large sum in the whole; considering all things I say, their yearly maintenance may amount to fifteen hundred thousand pounds a year, which is a thousand thousand, and half a thousand thousand pounds: Men of wea understandings can hardly reach, to know how much it is, and that makes me thus plainly expound it. Kingston upon Thames, the eighth moneth, 1657. A description of the true Ministery of Christ, and its Maintenance. THe day hath appeared that makes all things manifest, and the light is aris that gives to discern between truth and error; between the true and eve false way, and between the true worship of God, which is spiritual, and every fal worship of the world, which is Idolatry; and the true Ministry of Christ is kno from the false Ministry, by their several fruits and signes, for hidden things are broug to light, and secret things are revealed: but now the people of the world, both t wise and the foolish, thus they object, and say, Seeing that you do so much co our Ministry and Ministers in their call, in their practices, in their conversation, d  their maintenance; what Ministry do you own, and what Ministers do you allow of,  whether would you have any Ministery at all, seeing you throw down and declare against s as the Law of the Land sets up, and such as we have looked upon to be able Ministers;  after this manner are the people of this Generation begun to reason among themselves, s what would this people do if they had power; what Ministers would they approve of; and  maintenance would they allow them? To all this I do answer and say, The true Ministers and Ministry of C we do allow of, and we would have set up and established, and we wait pati ly till it be brought to pass, even such as are ordained by power from on  and who have received the gift of the holy Ghost; who are called of God into the  of the Ministry, such we do approve of to be Ministers of Christ in whom he is reve and who have received him, and are changed by him from death to life and out  darkness into the Kingdom of the Son of God, and who are born of the Spirit, and  led and guided by it into all truth, and are called by it to follow the lamb whither s he goeth, and who are taught by it in all their practices of Religion, and in  whole worship of God, and such we own, as have felt the operation of the spi in themselves, and who have tasted, handled, seen, and felt of the Word of life; whi
abids for ever, and such who goeth in the name of the Lord, to Minister and declare freely, what they have freely received of God by his Spirit, and who preacheth Christ freely, as the onely way and means of life and salvation unto all people, even such as ministereth him the way, the truth, and the life, the onely justifier, and sanctifier, and deliverer of them that believe, and the condemner of them that believe not, and such as Ministereth Christ, onely the teacher and leader of his people, and nothing else besides him; and such we allow, as onely seeketh and laboureth in the wisdom of God, to bring people out of the wayes of sin and death, unto the knowledge of God, and to the things that belong unto their peace, such who have no respect to large places, or great benefits, to seek, after that, who will not have hire for preaching, nor be hired by great sums of money, from one Country to another, such as makes the Gospel of Christ free, and without charge, who will not be burdensome to any, but walks in all wisdom, as examples of righteousness to all people, whose conversations are in heaven, and holdeth forth in life and practice, unto all men, what they profess in words, and by doctrine and conversation holding forth the Light of the glo∣rious Gospel, which they have received from God, being Partners of all holiness, of Peace and Long-suffering, of Meekness, and Patience unto their Flocks; even such who walk in Christ, and shew forth good works, and the fruits of his spirit, causing his Light to shine forth among men, in humility, and soberness, and in all the fruits of peace, and Truth, and such are approved of God, and of the Saints, even they that preach Christ freely to all people, and hold forth the Light of the World, which lighteth every one in the World, the free gift of God to all mankind, that all may believe and come to the knowledge of the Truth and be saved; and such Ministers respect not the person of any man for advantage, neither respect dayes, nor places, nor things, but worships God in Spirit and in Truth, and teach that worship unto all people, and they gather people into the new Covenant, where Christ is the High Priest, and our Bodies the Temples of God, and the Circumcision in the Heart and in the Spirit, for such are Ministers of the Spirit, and not of the Letter, and they divide the Word of God aright; they feed the Hun∣gry, and the Rich are sent empty away; they cry not peace to the wicked, neither do justifie the Unconvered; neither do they condemn the Righteous, nor such as are of an upright Heart; but Christ they preach, to justifie all that do believe, and are obedient to him, and do condemn all that believe not, but are disobedient; and such Ministers have the Word of Reconciliation, and their Ministry is made effectual, to accomplish the work of God; Sinners are converted and brought to God there∣by, and to be taught of him alone; and the Saints through that Ministry, may obtain to the Holy Ghost, and to need no man to teach them, but as the Anointing within them, which they receive through the Ministry, whose labour is, and the end of it, to present every man perfect in Christ, and this Ministry, and such Ministers we approve of, and they are approved of Christ, and we would have them esta∣blished; and who are such will not take care for an outward maintenance, neither what to eat, or what to put on; neither will they petition to Magistrates for Tythes and Augmentations, but are without care, as for a Lively-hood in this World; they will not remove from one Town to another, for a better Parsonage r Place, for such as do so, are not the lawful called Ministers of Christ, but have run and were never sent; for Christ's Ministers take not though, for an out∣ward maintenance, but approve themselves in Patience in all Conditions, and omtimes are in Want, and in Cold, and Hunger, and Nakedness, and in Persecutions, and Tryals, and Afflictions, and suffered all things for the Name of Christ, and yet we do believe and know, That such have power to eat and to drink, and may receive carl things where they sow spiritual things, but as a free Gift, and not by compulsion or force; we do allow that the Ministers of Christ may eat of the Milk of the Flock, which they keep and feed, and they may eat of the fruit of the Vineyard, which they have planted, and which they labour in, and they may supply their necessities from them whom they have begotten of the Faith, and whom they labour among  Life and Doctrine, who are Sheep of the Fold, and Plants of the Vineyard of
Christ Jesus; but I say, as a free gift may they receive the fruits of their labours, and not as a debt, nor any title claimed thereto by the Law of the Nation; neither may they receive it by force or compulsion; but who are the truely called Ministers of Christ are so far from this, of forcing maintenance from any, that they will not make use of their power, in taking what may be freely given them, for they will not make the Gospel burdensome by any means, and this is the maintenance we do allow the Ministers of Christ, they may eat such things as are set before them, in any house which they enter into, which is worthy; and they may supply their necessities in food and rai∣ment, as a free gift from them who are gathered out of the world, who are the Church of Christ, over whom the Ministers are made Stewards, to watch over them, to exhort them, to instruct them, and to edifie them; but not from the world, who continues in unbe∣lief and disobedience to the Gospel may they receive any outward maintenance by compulsion, or by a free gift, neither may they receive great sums of money by the year, or tythes, or other offerings to maintain themselves and their families, in pride and idleness, and lust, and excess, and superfluity in meats and apparel; such a maintenance if by free gift, much less by force, is not allowed by Christ and his Saints, but is the maintenance of Antichristian Teachers, which never were sent of Christ, and such cannot be content with his allowance and wages, but lives in pride and pleasures of this world, and in vanity; and maintained, they say they must be, and if they be so, they care not from whence it comes, nor by what means; and that is the reason wherefore so many hundreds of honest people are so spoiled in their Persons and Estates, the Bodies of some being cast into prison, and many others having their Goods taken from them by force and di∣straint; and all this is to maintain Antichrists Ministers, who neither care how they have it, or from whom, or to what evil use they improve it; and this plain∣ly appears in this Nation, by many evidences; but the Ministers of Christ do de∣ny such a maintenance, and such practises; and are come to that Life which judg∣eth all these things. And as concerning COMPELLING of Maintenance, and forcing of i from people, this is utterly against the Law of Christ, and condemned by him, and denied by the Saints; for it is unreasonable and no equallity in it, that people should be compelled to maintain a Ministry, especially such a one as they know  not the Ministry of Christ, neither is profitable to them, and which they recei no fruit from; for the Ministers of Christ do not desire maintenance from the people of the World, neither can receive any from them, neither in justice and equity should the Ministers of the World receive or compel Maintenance from the Saints by force and cruelty; but this we would have, and this is reason and equity let all Ministers be maintained by such as approve of them, and hear them, and partake of their labour, and so the Saints will maintain their Ministers, and the World may maintain theirs, and every sort of people may maintain such Mini∣sters as labour for them, and none to be forced to maintain such as they do  approve of, nor none hindred from maintaining of such, as they do approve  be they true, or false Ministers; and this is reason and a good Conscience, Th every man be left free in such cases, to maintain whom he will, and to give as he will,  what he will, and this is reason and equity, that no man be compelled to give, or hi from giving to whom he pleaseth, and what he pleaseth; and so let people make choi of their Ministers, whom they will approve, and whom they will hear, and of who labours they will receive, and then let them maintain them, and if any be compelled let them be compelled to pay their own Servants, who minister to them, and not a∣thers, for whom they do no work; and this is just and right both for Ministers, a people, that every Minister be paid by them to whom he doth Minister, and who re∣ceive him as a Minister, and for whom he doth work, and this great injustice and op∣pression in England will cease, if this Law of Equity and Righteousness were establish∣ed, and all people left free to hear, & approve of whom they will, and then to pay the and maintain them, and this would try the Ministers; and who converted the most  God, and gained the love of most people, and if they wrought well they may recei a Maintenance accordingly, by the free gift of the People; and the Ministers that are no content with this Law, are out of pure Reason and Equity, and shew that the
dare not trust the Lord, nor the fruits of their labours, but would be maintained in idleness by unlawful means, by compelling maintenance from them to whom they do no work; and such shew great covetousness, who desire more then the Milk of their own Flock, and the fruit of their own Vine-yard; but in Equity and Justice et every, Minister be maintained, by the fruit of his own labour, from the people for whom he doth labour, and this will content most part of the People, and till this be established in the Earth, true Justice and Judgment will be wanting in this particular; and this is according to Truth, and to a righteous Law; and by this all people may understand what Ministers and Ministry we do allow and approve of, and how Ministers ought to be maintained; and if any go forth to a Place, and Country, among a people that are not converted, then the Church ought to take care to maintain such in their work, till they may reap of their own labour, and eat of the fruit of their own Vine-yard, but all this ought to be without com∣pelling or forcing by the Minister; for every Minister of Christ doth chiefly take care of the work unto which he is called; and is without care of his outward Mainte∣nance.

IN the Name and Power of the Eternal God that made Heaven & Earth, and all things therein; who is the Life of all things, and the Power by which they stand in his Counsell and Fear. I do hereby declare my self unto the whole world, and unto all people upon Earth, that ye may all know the very cer∣inty of those things, which is reported abroad through many Nations, and that e may be informed truly concerning us, from our own mouthes of many things hich cometh to you by false reports and lying informations, concerning a people ppear'd in these late years, and raised up, going under the name of QUAKERS. now ye assuredly that we are of God, and are raised up by him, and called by his Name, and his dreadfull presence goes before us, and his righteousness is our eward. We are such as do fear and worship the true God that made Heaven nd Earth in the Spirit, and in the Truth; he hath placed his Name amongst us, nd made his everlasting Covenant with us, and established it that it cannot be oved, he hath given us his Spirit, and poured it upon us, and we are taught of him according to his promise, and are established in his holy Mountain, where one can make us afraid, for he hath armed us with his power and strength to defend us from all our enemies, that we should bear witness of his Name in all the world, and declare unto all Nations, of his power and Dominion, of his Salva∣tion and Redemption, that is in Him, and in his Son; of which we are made artakers and witnesses, and by him have we received the heirship of the everlasting inheritance, and we are of God; and he that is of God heareth us, whom the Father hath chosen and redeemed out of kindreds tongues and peoples, to stand before the Throne of God and the Lamb, and we have sought, and do finde, a City whose builder and maker is God, and we are known to the Lord God Almighty, and approved in his sight: Our light is the light of the Lamb, and our government the government of Jesus, and our Law the Law of the most high, and our Way is the way of peace and truth, he that can receive it let him. This is the Testimony which the Spirit of the everlasting Father witnesseth in us and witnesseth of us unto the whole world. CHAP. I. Concerning the true God, this Testimony I give to all People upon the Earth. THe true God he is a Spirit, and is infinite, eternall, and everlasting, the Creator of all things, and the life and being of all things, and the power by which all things stand, all Creatures have a being in him, and by him, and with∣out him no creature is, or doth move upon the face of the earth; this is he whom we worship and fear, and doth obey, and he brings to pass by his counsel whatso∣ever he will, and nothing can prevent the purpose of his mind, but his counfel stands for ever, and he is the righteous Judge of all things, and before him must all mankinde come to Judgement, and the living and the dead by him must be judged, he is a rewarder of every one according to their deeds, whether they be good or whether they be evil: His Greatness, Power, Majesty and Dominion is over all and beyond all, ruling above all in the power of his own will, and who may say what doth he? his eye seeth all and his presence filleth all, and no creature can be hid from his sight; he is near at hand and afar off, he searcheth mans heart and and tryeth the reins, and shews unto man his own thoughts, he justifieth the righte∣ous and condemneth the wicked, he is light it self, and in him is no darkness at all: This is the true God whom we worship, and this Testimony I give of him unto all people upon the face of the whole Earth.
CHAP. II. Concerning the Son of God, this Testimony I give unto all the World. THE Son of God, who is called Christ the Prince of Peace and Righteous∣ness, he is one with the Father in power and dominion, and was with him be∣fore the world was, and by him the Father created all things, and without hi was not any thing made that was made, he is Heir of all things, and is the Pri of the Kingdom of Righteousness, of Peace and Truth, and he is the Word a Power by which all things doth consist, and is the Salvation of mankind, and th very life of the World, he inherits life and immortality, and is the Redeemer, Savi∣our, Deliverer and Restorer of the Children of men, he is the very Wisdom and Po∣er of the Creator, and the Father doth nothing without the Son, and by him, an through him the Father brings all things to pass, by him the Father will judge the whole Earth and all the Children of Adam therein; and this Christ Jesus the Son of God is the Life and Light of the world and hath enlightened all mankind, every  that cometh into the world is lighted by him with the true light of life or cond∣nation, and what the Son doth the Father doth also, and he is at his right  exalted, and is the very express Image of the Father, and is the Fathers gift i the world, and is given to all mankind that they may have life by him, and all  receives: him hath life and salvation, but many receives him not, and they  receive him not perish, even because they do not receive him whom the Father  given into the world, for he is the arm alone of Gods salvation and he is the ∣der of his people. CHAP. III. Concerning the Spirit of God, this Testimony I give unto the whole World. THe SPIRIT is with the Father, and with the Son, and its present eve where, and filleth all places, and is for ever and ever, and trieth all thin and revealeth the things of the Father, and of the Son, unto all that doth belie in the Son; and makes manifest, and searcheth into the deep things of God,  it witnesseth the Salvation of the Just, and the condemnation of the Unjust; it is not absent from any place, nor contained in any one place; the Father and the Son works all things through it, and brings all things in Heaven and Earth to pass by it, and it works in the Hearts of the Children of men, and in every one it witnesseth of the Father and of the Son, to the Justness, Greatness, Righte∣ousness, and to the power of the Eternal Creator, that made all things by the Son through his Eternal Spirit, which is one with the Father and with the Son, and is the Worker of their will and mind in all things; it worketh in the Wicked to reprove them, and to witness against them, and that God is angry with them  sheweth; and it worketh in the Righteous, and witnesseth, the Love, and Mercy, and Peace of the Father unto them; He that can receive it, let him, this is the Testimony of the Spirit of God, and it leadeth into all Truth, and out of all Evil all that are guided by it; and it is given to be the Guide and Rule of Life to the Children of God.
CHAP. IV. Concerning Man, and all Mankind, this Testimony I give unto all Nations and People. MAN was created and brought forth in the Image of God, and was with∣out sin or evil brought forth, to do the will of him that created him, and was Lord over all Creatures, to use them to the glory of the Creator, and all Crea∣tures were to serve him; but man transgresseth against his Maker, and offended him; and dishonoured him, and became degenerate, and grieved his Maker continually, and was drove out from the Presence of the Lord, and he is now a Child of Disobedience, and of Wrath, and an Enemy in his mind against the Lord that made him; and he is doing and fulfilling daily the will of the Devil, and grieveth the Spirit of God, and vexeth his righteous Soul, and is subject unto the Curse of Wo and Destruction, being ignorant of the Life, and Power, and Wisdom of the Creator, to lead him, to guide him, and to preserve him, but follows the counsel of hisown heart, which is evil altogether, though he was made up∣right, yet hath he sought out many inventions, which are continually abomina∣ble unto the Lord; the ground in which he stands is corrupted, and all his fruit is unpleasant, even bitter and evil unto the Lords Taste. Man is fallen into the Pit of Misery and Sorrow, compassed about with desolation, and is left without a Helper from himself, or from any other Creature, and this in short is the state of all mankind upon the face of the Earth, who was planted a noble Vine; wholly aright Seed, to bring forth good fruit unto his Maker; but he is turned into a dege∣nerate plant, bringing forth cursed fruits which the Creator hath not pleasure in, his best works are not accepted, and his evil deeds are condemned, because the ground in which he stands is accursed, because of disobedience. CHAP. V. Concerning the World in general, and the state of things as they have been, and as now they are, this Testimony I give to the whole World. DArkness hath been over the face of the Earth, and thick darkness hath cover∣ed the people for many ages, the Beast hath reigned upon the face of the whole Earth, and all Nations have been subject to his power and dominion, even the Kings and Princes of the Earth have given their power unto him, all the World hath wondred after him, as it is written; and the whole World hath worshipped the Beast and his Image, he hath power to kill all that would not worship him, both small and great, rich and poor, even all have been subject to his Government; and he hath had power to war against the Saints, and to make war with them, and to overcome them, even all that would not worship him he hath had pow∣er to kill. The Rule and Government of the SON of God hath not been witnessed among men for Ages, nor the true God known, nor manifestly worshipped in Spirit and Truth; but he hath been as a Stranger among men, and they have been ignorant of his Wayes and Judgments, and all People have been doing that which is right in the sight of their own eyes, and God hath been for∣gotten
dayes without number; the Living Fountain hath been forsaken, and ma∣ny broken Cestern have been hewen out, which have not holden pure Water: Great Evils and continual Abominations have been acted in the sight of God, and the measure of iniquity hath been fulfilling through many Generations, and it is grown nigh to the full: The Law of God hth been made void, and his Grace hath been turned into wantonness, and all things have been out of good order: Kings, Princes, Rulers, Governments, Laws, and Decrees have been corrupt, and not right in the sight of the Lord; Oppressions, Tyranny, and Vain-glory hath abounded in the Nations, and Justice and true Judgment have been neglect∣ed, and Mercy and Truth have been Strangers, and the World hath been filled with violence, and the whole Earth stained and polluted with Oppressi∣ons Injustice and Cruelties, and the cry of the poor hath not been heard, every one hath sought themselves, and not the Lord, nor the good one of another; the Kings and Princes of the Earth have not been perfect nor upright before the Lord, but Vain-glory hath abounded, and superstitions and Idolatries hath reign∣ed over them, and unrighteousness hath abounded, and Self-seeking; and they have risen up one against another, in quarrelling and destroying one another, and to gain one anothers Dominions by Craft, and Pollicy, and strong hand, and the poor have been oppressed and troden down, and thousands of thousands destroy∣ed to fulfil the wills, and lusts, and pride of their hearts, all this hath been evil in the sight of the Lord, and his soul hath been weary with it, by the destruction of his Creatures, one by another, even Rulers, Teachers, and people have all been out of the Way, and subverted from that wherein God hath pleasure; and the Prince of Darkness hath ruled in his dominion, swaying all under his Govern∣ment, and even all things, both of civil and spiritual concernment, hath been out of the Counsel of the Lord. Oh what cruel Injustice and Tyranny in civil Government! Oh what abominable Superstitions and Idolatries have been in (supposed) Church-governments! Its a vexation to the spirit of the Lord, to consider it, and the Righteous soul hath long cried out and mourned under it, and because of this is the Lord of Heaven and Earth now risen to overturn, to over∣turn Kings and Princes, Governments and Laws; and he will confound and break down all Tyranny and Oppression, under which the poor have groaned; and e will change Times, and Laws, and Governments; there shall be no King ruling but Jesus, nor no Government of force, but the Government of the Lamb, no no Law of effect, but the Law of God, all that which is otherwise shall be ground to powder; the Kingdom of the Most High shall rule amongst men, and the King∣doms of this World shall be changed, and shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ; and the Lord shall be known in the Earth, to be the God of Truth, of Righteousness; Justice, and Mercy, and Truth shall be exalted, and true Judgment shall be set up in the Nations, and the Worship in Spirit and in Truth shall he established; for the Lord is gathering his numberless number to stand before his Throne without Guile in their Mouthes, and without Fault before him.
CHAP. VI. Concerning mans Restauration, Redemption and Salvation, what they are, and by whom they are wrought, this Testi∣mony I give unto all People. MAns Restauration is a repairing and giving again that which he had lost by transgression; and Redemption is a recovering, and a winning again, and setting free from that wherein man hath been held (even all the sons of Adam) because of disobedience; and Salvation is a saving, keeping, and preserving from sin, and death, and disobedience, and all the ways thereof, and also a sa∣ving from wrath and misery and condemnation, which are the effects thereof; and by the Son of God Christ Jesus is all this wrought, manifested and witnes∣sed, and Restauration, Redemption and Salvation is onely in Christ Jesus, the second Adam, and not in any other, and it is wrought by him, and by no other, and they are the free gift of the Father unto the sons of men, no way purchased by the works of the Creature, or desert of him, but are freely given unto the Creature, through the Power and Wisdom of the Creator, and onely by Jesus Christ the Son of the eternal God, and by the eternal Spirit are they witnessed in all that believe, and through the word of Life are they handled, tasted, seen and felt, near at hand, in power, and not in words onely. Many professes them in words, and what others enjoyed of these things, but have not felt in themselves the working of the eternall Spirit, neither have the witness in themselves of being restored to God again, and of being redeemed by him from under the Devils power, neither are saved by Christ from sin and transgression and so are not, nor cannot be saved from condemnation and wrath, for who abide in their sins, and in the state unreconciled to God, hath not any part or portion in these things which belongs to their peace; and without the knowledge of which, by the working of the eternal Spirit, all mankind is everlastingly miserable. CHAP. VII. Concering true Religion and the true Worship of the true God, this Testimony I give unto the whole World. THis is true Religion, to be kept pure and clean from all evil, and from all that which would defile in the sight of the Lord, and to walk in his fear in all things; this is Religion, to do good and to do no evil, and to speak the truth, and to do the truth in all things, and to do unto all men as a man would be done unto, and to love God withall the heart, and the neighbour as self, and not to love the world, and ways and pleasures of it, nor to use deceit in words or acti∣ons; this is true Religion, and the true Worship of God, to be led with his Spirit in all things, and to be guided in the truth at all times, on all occasions; this is acceptable, and well pleasing unto God, above all words, and outward conformi∣ty, and set times, and days, and observances; for the Worship of God is not in these things, but is without respect of days places, or things; this Religion
and Worship stands in Christ Jesus the second Adam, who hath lighted every man that comes into the World, that all men through him might believe, and by him have their consciences purely exercised towards God and towards man in all things whatsoever; and this is our Religion, and Worship of the True God; he that can receive it, let him. CHAP. VIII. Concerning Justification and Sanctification, this testimony  give unto all People. JUstification is freely by Jesus Christ in the sight of the Father, and not by the works of mans own righteousness, and such as are taught by Christ and guided by him in all the ways of truth and righteousness, are justified by him and none else, not in any word or work whatsoever, but in what they are led to fulfil by him, and it is the new man that is justified, and not the old, he that is born of God; and none that are born of the flesh, such cannot please God, neither can such be justified by him, for they are not taught of him, nor saved, nor restored, nor redeemed, and therefore are not justified nor cleared from condemnation in the sight of the Lord; but who lives in iniquity, and sin, and the wayes and works of the World, which are evil, by Christ Jesus are condem∣ned, and not justified, though in words they profess him, yet of justification by him they have no part: and sanctification is by the working of the eternal Spiri in the heart of the Creature, which purgeth out and taketh away all unrighte∣ousness, and all the works and fruits of darkness it witnesseth against, and witnesseth unto Jesus, who takes away all sin and destroyes the works of the Devil, that man may be holy and pure in the sight of his Maker; and every one that hath the witness of his justification, hath the operation by the eternal Spirit of sanctification, and all that receives Christ Jesus who hath lighted every man that cometh into the World, receiveth sanctification and justification by him, and he unto us is made so of the Father; he that can receive it le him. CHAP. IX. Concerning the Kingdom of Christ, and how it is to be set up, this testimony I give unto all the World. THE Kingdom of God, and of his Son, is not of this World, but is fro above, and stands in righteousness and in truth, in mercy and in peace, i true judgement and justice, and this Dominion is from everlasting to everlast∣ing, and it reacheth beyond all the World, and its Government is love and unity and everlasting peace, and is perfect liberty to the Just, and bindeth and chaineth the Unjust; in it there is on oppression, but perfect freedom from all un∣righteousness, and it consists not in word, but in power, to the bringing down of the Kingdom of the Devil, and to the breaking off the bonds of all injustice, and all ungodliness, which is the Kingdom of Satan, which hath long ruled i the World, that Kingdom whereof Christ is King, which stands in Righteous∣ness, no unclean thing can have any part therein, and this we believe, it shall
be set up and advanced in the earth, but not by might of man, or arm of flesh, nor the multitude of an host, neither by policy nor craft, nor by revenge, but by the arm of the Lord alone, through the suffering and patience of his people, and by faithful witness bearing unto Jesus Christ by doing and by suffering, by doing his Will in all things in a pure Life and Conversation, and upright walk∣king in the sight of the Lord, and by patient suffering under the injustice and oppression of men, and of their unjust Government and Laws, till they be overturned and confounded: and further we give testimony, that suffring in patience under the cruelty and oppression of the Devils government and king∣dom; more reaches to overthrow them, than the rising to rebel in any way of outward offence toward them, or defence from them, and the Kingdom of Christ is near to come, and the Kingdoms of this World shall be changed, and none shall have any part therein, but they that are redeemed out of kindreds, tongues, and people: this we believe; he that can receive it let him. CHAP. X. Concerning Governours, and Governments, and Subjection to them, this testimony I give to the World. GOvernours, Rulers, and Magistrates we own, and do respect in the Lord; (and yet cannot respect any mans person whatsoever) such as be a terrour to all evil in their Government, and that fears God and hates covetousness, and delights in Equity, in Justice, and true Judgement, and gives diligent heed to try the cause of the poor, and will judge justly, without respect of men, who justifies the good, and gives praise to the Well-doer; such Government and Governours we reverence, where Sin and Iniquity is kept under, Drunkenness, Swearing, Murther, Quarrelling, and all the ways and works of the flesh are terrified, and a Wel-doer praised and justified; this Goverment of men, reaches to the witness of God in every man, and that answers to the justice and righte∣ousness of all such Governours and Government, and these witness that they are of God; but the witness of God in every man, beareth witness against all unjust men, and Laws, and Rulers, and Governments, which strengtheneth the hands of the wicked, and oppresseth the just, where the making and executi∣on of Laws are in the power of proud men, and covetous men, who fears not God, neither hates covetousness, neither doth respect the cause of the poor, but rules by their Wills and Tyranny, and not by just Laws in Righteousness; but makes unrighteous decrees to oppress the poor and innocent, letting the wicked go free; such who upholds unrighteous Worships and Teachers, by oppression, and causes the Innoccent to suffer, and makes them Offenders, because the exercise of a pure conscience towards God and men; such Rulers and Government we cannot be subject to for Conscience sake, but do rather fulfull the Law and Will of God, though we transgress their wills, and unrighteous laws, and yet doth not rebel against them, nor seek defence from them, but patiently suffers under them, and bears their injustice and cruelty, without seeking any revenge, but leaves vengeance to the Lord to whom it belongs; and this is our Judgement in full, the Government and Laws which we cannot obey nor fulfil for Consci∣sake, we chuse rather to suffer under them for disobedience to them, than to transgress the righteous Law of God, written in our hearts, by obeying them; so that what we cannot obey for Conscience sake, for Conscience sake we resist not, but suffers under that (the punishment of it) patiently, and herein are we subject to every ordinance of man, for conscience sake: in fulfilling of the
good, the just, and righteous, and in patience suffering under the cruelty and oppression of the unjust, and unrighteous, and this we do and teach every where, subjection to every Ordinance of man, and are not destroyers of true Go∣vernment, or rebellious against just Governours, but are exalters of true Justice and Judgement in the Earth. CHAP. XI. Concerning the true Ministry of Christ and the false Ministry, and the difference betwixt them, this testimony I give unto all the World. THE true Ministry is sent of God, and is the gift of the holy Ghost, and it stands in the Power of the Spirit of God, and not in the words of mans wisdom, of that wisdom which is from below, and it brings people to the know∣ledge of God, which is life eternal, and it turns people from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to the Power of God, it is freely received of God, and freely given forth of us, it proclaims Peace on Earth, unto such as are of a broken and upright heart, and it proclaims war against all the wicked upon Earth; it is a good savour unto God in setting the way of life, and the way of death, before all people; the Ministry of Christ is free, and cannot be bought nor sold for money, it is without hire, and gifts, and rewards from any man, which is given freely into the World, and it ever was and is persecuted by the Generation of the unjust, and by the powers of the Earth; he that comes in the Fathers Name cannot be received of the World, but the World is at enmity a∣gainst it, in this Generation, as ever was; it converts people unto the Knowledge of God, and many did, and many do receive the Knowledge of God thereby, though some thereby be hardened against God unto destruction, and the Word of the Lord, and the Ministry returns not in vain unto God, but all by it ar left without excuse, the Witness of Christ in every Creature being reached to, which gives Testimony to the Power, and to the Truth of the Ministry of Christ; but the false Ministers and Ministry are not such, for their Ministry is received by natural Learning and Arts, and is not the Gift of the holy Ghost, but stands in the wisdom of mans words, and not in the Power and Life of God, it profits not the people at all, neither do any come to the Knowledge of God thereby, neither is turned from Darkness to Light; but Teachers and people con∣tinues in the power of Satan, and in the unconverted estate, the Witness of God not reached to, to bring to the understanding of things which are eternal, but people are ever learning by it, and never coming to the Know∣ledge of the Truth; but the Blind leads the Blind, and like Teachers like Peo∣ple, all out of the Way, given to Iniquity and unrighteousness, and such are they who preaches for Hire, and divines for Money, and seeks for their gai from their Quarter, and through covetousness, by feigned words, make mer∣chandize of Souls, going for Gifts and Rewards, and teaching for filthy Lucre having settled places and so much a year, these are not the true Ministers of Christ, but false Ministers of Autichrist and Deceivers, and were never sent of God, and do never bring any to the Knowledge of Gods, and such we be witness against to be of the Devil, and that for many Generations the World hath been deceived by them, who hath had the form of godlines, but not the Pow∣er, and Christs words, and the Apostles, words without the Life; and they have served themselves, and not the Lord Jesus; but now they are made manifest with the true Light, which approveth the Ministry of God, and disapproveth such who are Ministers of Antichrist; and all that are in the Light, and walk
in the light can receive this testimony which is given by the Spirit of God, to that Ministry which is sent of him, which doth fulfill his will, and a∣gainst the false Ministry which is not of God, which runs and was never sent of him. CHAP. XII. Concerning the Gospel of Christ, this is my testimony unto all the VVorld. THE Gospel is the Power of God, and it is sent of him into the World to reconcile people unto him, that have been in the enmity agai him,  is Peace to the Poor in spirit, and judgement to the Fat, and to the high min; and it is to be preached to every creature (male and female) under Heaven with∣out respect of Peoples, Nations, or Generations, it is the manifestation of the Love of God to the whole World, to gather people out of all unrighteous, into the living Way of Life, Peace and Truth, to walk with God in Purity and Holiness, and to deny the World and all its ways, and works, and wor∣ships which are evil, and by it some are brought to God, and to salvation, and life eternal, and some through it are hardened against God, that they may be destroyed and condemned, who are Reprobates, and believes not in him from whom the Gospel comes, and it cannot be received by any other way or means than by the revelation of Jesus Christ in the hearts of his people, and many have the letter which knows not the Gospel, nor hath received it, and this Gos∣pel which is everlasting, have we received from God, and this is the sound of it which we give in the World unto the World: Fear God, and give Glory to him, for the hour of his Judgements is come, and this is the everlasting Gospel of Sal∣vation, he that can receive it let him. CHAP. XIII. Concerning the Word of God, and concerning the Scriptures, this testimony I give unto all the World. THE Word of God was in the beginning before any Creatures were made, and by it all things stand and remain unto this day, and the Word endures, for ever, and by it all things in Heaven and in Earth are brought to pass which God doth, and it is from everlasting to everlasting, without beginning and without end, and the Word is powerful, dividing and discerning all things, even the secret thoughts of every mans heart, it is as a two edged sword, and as a fire, and like a hammer to cut up, to burn, and to beat down; the Word of the Lord reconciles man again to him, and this Word is in the mouth and in the heart, and the Servants of the Lord handled, tasted, saw and felt the Word of Life, and from it spoke forth the Scriptures, as they were moved by the holy Ghost, through the eternal Spirit, and it is an Declaration of the Word of Life, which was in the beginning and endures for ever, and it declares what the Saints received, be∣lieved, and enjoyed, and none can understand it without the same Spirit that gave it forth, and to such who have the same Spirit the Scripture is profitable; the Word of God, which was in the beginning, and which endures for ever, is
not the Scripture which was not in the beginning, neither can it endure for ever, but the Scripture testifies of that Word, & that Word witnesses to the Scripture, and they are not contrary one to the other, but gives witness each of other, but many hath the Scripture that hath not the Word, neither knows it; but they that have the Word cannot but own the Scriptures, and this is the Truth as it is in Jesus, Testified to all the World by us, who doth deny them that hereof gives any other testimony. CHAP. XIV. Concerning the Devil and Damnation, this Testimony I give to all People. THere is a Devil which is out of the Truth, who abode not in the Truth, but is a Lyar from the beginning, and the father of all evil doing, and the au∣thor of all unrighteousness, and whatsoever is contrary to God in thought, word, and action; he is the enmity against God, and against all good, and by his power subverts creatures and things to another end, than wherefore they were created, even to the dishonour of the Creator; he is the god of this World, the prince of darkness, and he rules King in all the childern of the first Ad, who are in evil; he was the cause of the first transgression, and is the cause of disobedience to God to this day in all people, who are led by him, moving a them to Envy, Wrath, Pride, Whoredom, Drunkenness, Theft, and Murther, and all the works of darkness, sin, and death; he is the Fountain and Root of  these, and the Leader and Ruler in the exercise of them, and of every evil wo and work whatsoever which are contrary to God; he abode not in the Tr, and he hath led all mankind out of Truth, into all deceit and unrighteousness, and into every evil way, and he dwells in darkness, & inhabits in thick darkness, and is out of the Light, and is separate from the Presence of God for ever, bo in chains of darkness and ignorance, and unbelief, and he hath power in the earthly part of man, and a law in the members, and he possesses him that is born of the flesh, & his covenant is with him who is not born of the Seed of God, who can∣not sin, such are in covenant with God & renewed into his Image; but such as are not, hath the Divil power in, to captivate and lead their minds into vanity, and their affections and desires into all that which is evil, by which the Spirit of God, the Creator of all things is grieved, and his soul vexed, and all murther, and deceitful works of the World, and all whatsoever is contrary to God i words, thoughts, or actions is of the Devil, that wicked one, and from him, and all that follow his movings, and worketh evil thereby, they serve him, a obey him; he is their god, and their King, and they are his people, and hi subjects; he is their father, and they are his children; he is their root, and they are his off-spring, and brings forth fruit unto him, and serves  worships him, and not the true God that made all things; and all such  be cast into utter darkness with him, and shall have their portion with him in  bottomless pit of darkness for ever and ever, where there is no end of woe, an sorrow, and misery; for in the anger of God, there the worm di not,  the fire is not quenched, and out of that there is on redemption for the ∣clean; and all such who are led of him who is out of the Truth, and in evil, are judged, and condemned, and damned by him, who is the Truth, who judgeth righteously; and as he hath not ceased to work evil, and to draw the children of men into evil, for he continually tempteth to lead from God into Rebellion against him. And they that are led by him are destroyed, and
he shall not cease sorrow, wo, and misery for ever, as he hath not ceased to work evil, he liveth and moveth in the anger of God, his beginning was in it, and all his works are in it, and it shall be the reward of him, and all that obey him in the separation from Gods everlasting Presence, for ever and ever. CHAP. XV. Concerning all creatures that God made, this Testimony I give unto all the World. ALL creatures that God made in their creation and beginning was very good in his sight that made them, and unto man that was to use them, and no Creature was evil or defiled in its Creation, but mankind transgressing against his Maker, he become evil, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, and he being pos∣sessed with evil, and corrupted, he makes all Creatures evil in his exercise of them, corrups them, and perverts them to another end than wherefore they were creat∣ed, and by the Creatures, dishonours the Creator, o should have honoured him by them, and they are become a curse unto man, and not a blessing, though in themselves are neither cursed, nor evil, nor defiled, but is become so unto man, because of his transgression and disobedience; for he being in the curse and defiled, all things are so unto him, and in his exercise of them he is wicked, abusing them upon the lust to satisfie his devillish mind, and ruling over them in oppression and cruelty, and hard heartedness, and not in the Wisdom of God, as he ought, and he subverts them out from their pure vertue, feeding his lust in pride and voluptuousness, with that which should keep him from hunger and nakedness, and so pleasing the lust in all things more than satisfying pure na∣ture, and this ought not to be, for it is out of the Covenant of God, in which all Creatures were made, and in which they stand, except the Creature man, who is degenerated out of Gods Covenant, and subverts all things to his own end, and not unto the glory of God, while he continues in that state unrecon∣ciled to God, but man being restored, and redeemed, and renewed again into covenant with God, through the condemning of the evil, then all Creatures to him are restored, and made blessed, the curse being removed out of his own heart, the Creatures are no longer cursed to him, but good and decent, and enjoyed, and received in the Covenant, of God in the life and vertue by which they were created, and by the wisdom which they were made, man comes to order them, and exercise himself in them, and no more are they spent upon the lust, nor on the vain minde, nor ruled over in oppression, but all that is condemned, and all Creatures are seen to be the Lords, and the Whole Earth is his, and the fulness thereof, and the abuse of all Creatures is ceased, and they are enjoyed in their pure vertue to feed and to cloath the Creature, and not to be destroyed upon the lust, but for the healths-sake are they used to the glory of of the Creator, and unto the end wherefore he Created them, and are pure as they were in the beginning, and the blessing is felt which is more than all creatures.
CHAP. XVI. Concerning the new Covenant, and how man comes to the Knowledge of God, this Testimony I give. THE Covenant of God is Unity betwixt God and man, and a binding each to other, to serve each other, the one is bound to obey, and submit, and worship; and the other to blesse, and keep, and lead, and perserve; this Covenant is established with his own Seed for ever, and there is no Teacher but God, all is taught of him, from the least to the greatest who are in this Cove∣nant, his just Law is written in their heart to condemn all transgression, and his pure Spirit is put into the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of life in all things, and none need to say, know the Lord, but all knows him in the Spirit, and worships him, and obeys him: and follows him in Spirit, and in Truth, and such are come into Peace and Reconciliation with God, and the Covenant with Hell and Death is broken; and in this Covenant, there is no Priest, nor Offering, but Christ Jesus the high iest of God, the one Offering for sin, he takes away sin and makes intercession, and in it is no Temple, but our bodies are the Temple of God, and he dwells in us, and walks in us, and there is no circumcision, but the circumcision of the heart, which is the putting away of all the uncleanness of the flesh, nor in it there is no means of salvation, but Christ the onely way the Truth and Life, and none comes to the Father but by him; he Declares of the Father, and there is no Light but the Light of the Lamb; all that are Saved shall walk in the Light of the Lamb, and there shall be no need of any other light, no need of the Light of the Sun, nor of the Moon nor of Candle, but the Lord is unto them an everlasting Light, and God alone is their Glory, and this Covenant is for ever, and cannot alter nor change, but is sure unto the Seed of his own Inheritance; but he that is born of the Flesh hath no part in it, who is shut out from the Knowledge of God, who is not known to the wisdom of this World, which is Foolishness with God; and the Knowledge of God is received no other way but onely by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and by the Working of the Spirit of the Father in the heart, he opens the blinde Eye, and unstops the deaf Ear, and changeth the heart, and causeth it to understand, and he removes that which hath stood in the way betwixt God and the Creature, which hath caused ignorance in the Creature, that the Lord could not be seen nor perceived. Christ Jesus the second Adam Lighteth every man, and at Mankind that cometh into the World, with the true Light, but some hates the Light, and they will not come to the Light, least their Deeds should be reproved, and their Deeds are evil, and they are in a condemned State, and such cannot re∣ceive Christ, nor the Knowledge of God, but such who love the Light with which Christ hath enlightned them, they bring all their Deeds to the Light, and walk in the Light, and their Deeds are wrought in God, never to be condemned. And such as loves the Light receives Christ, and the Knowledge of God, which is eter∣nal Life, and none comes to the Knowledge of God, and of Christ, any other way, but through the Light of Christ, and by the Operation of the Spirit of God, and evil is condemned out of the Heart, and the Heart is made clean by the Word of God, and the Knowledge of God is received into the clean Heart, and not into the impure; for without Holiness none shall see God, nor ever come to the Knowledge of him, neither can the Knowledge of God be received by the Tra∣ditions of men, or any outward Observance in the will of man, but only by the Teachings of the eternal Spirit, is the living God known in the Creature.
CHAP. XVII. Concerning Faith, this Testimony I give unto the VVorld. FAith is the Gift of God, and by it Christ is received and enjoyed; it is the Substance of things hoped for, and the very Evidence of things not seen, gives the Creature to believe God in all what he hath promised; all that which is acted and spoken in it, is well pleasing unto God, and that which is done with∣out is sin; it is the strengh of the Creature to act for God, in all things; It is that whereby the World is overcome, and all the Powers of Hell and death; it is the Armour against the Devil, and the defence of all the Children of God, by it they overcome all their Enemies, and through it they reign over all the World, it carries through all Sufferings and Tribulations with Joy and Patience: Faith is an Act of God in the Creature, through it Peace and Righteousness, and the Crown of Life is received from God, by Faith all things are received, that are received of God by any of his Children: He that hath Faith sees and feels the Lords Presence at all times, and through Faith we do and suffer gladly for the name of Christ in all things; and this is thus far our Testimony given by the Spi∣rit of the Father, of those things of which we have received the knowledge from God, who hath given us his Treasure, and we have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels, even the knowledge of those things which are Eternal, which is not our own, but the Lords, to give forth according to his movings, and of those things have we Handled, Tasted and Felt. CHAP. XVIII. Concerning what VVorks are accepted of God, and what VVorks are not accepted, brought forth by the Creature WHatsoever work man is moved and led unto by the Spirit of God, and guided and ruled in the practice of, to speak or act whatsoever, by the same Spirit (which moveth and leadeth into all the works of righteousness, and not into any evil) this is acceptable in the sight of the Lord, and these works are well pleasing to him: where the Lord goes before, and is the leader in all things; and this man, and his works who is led with the Spirit of the Father, is justified and accepted of God, and not for the Creatures sake, who respects not the per∣son of any, but for his own Name sake, because they are wrought in him through faith, and is moved unto, and guided in by his own Spirit, and they arise from Gods Righteousness revealed in the Creature, and not from the righteousness of the Creature; for man being changed and replanted into the Living Vine, and the Root being good, every work which springeth forth from it, is good also, and accepted of God, because the Root is so: But whatsoever works are brought forth by any Creature, though the same, in appearance, which are accepted of God from another, yet not being moved unto, nor guided in by the Spirit of the Father, but brought forth in the will and wisdom of the Creature, which is from below, and acted in imitation from the Saints words; these works are not accepted and well pleasing
unto God, but is offence unto him, and sin against him, even the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto him, and if a man come before the Lord with thousands of Rams, and ten thousand of Rivers of Oyl, and if he give the fruit of his Body for the sin of the Soul, and cover the Alter with tears, and is not led with a measure of Gods Spirit, none of all these works are accepted; nor his Preaching, Praying, Baptism, nor Breaking of Bread, nor any other Observances towards God whatsoever, are not good in his sight, but evil, and to be contemned, and the Root from whence they spring; because man is in the Enmity against him, and not changed out of the old Root, nor in that state is not led with the holy Spirit of the Father; and the Root being Bad, the Branches are evil; and none are accepted of God in any thing which they per∣form towards him, but such as are in Christ Jesus, the second Adam, and such are new Creatures: so that it is not for the Creatures sake that any work is accep∣ted of, or offence against God, but only for his Name sake, and because of be∣ing guided, or not of being guided with the Measure of Gods Pure Spirit: Therefore is man, and his works good, and accepted; or evil, and not regarded, but condemned of God. CHAP. XIX. Concerning mans state in the first Adam, before Conversion, and his state after Conversion; and what Conversion is. MAns state in the first Adam, in transgression, is a state of perfect enmity a∣gainst God, and Death rigns in every man, and he is possessed with Blindness and Ignorance, and unbelief, and is wholly imperfect to receive the things of Gods Kingdom, or to act any thing for God, acceptable to him; man in that state is wholly Dead to God, and insensible of the Presence, and Power, and Life of his Creator, for he is drove from God, and is not led by him; he hath no power to perform any good in the sight of God, but is possessed with evil, and led into all evil continually; he is free from righteousness, and free to all evil, being the servant of the Devil, and subject to him, and overcome of him every moment, and is led by him to transgress against the Lord; his heart is unclean, and out of it proceeds continually uncleanness, in all manner of words, thoughts, and actions, which flow out of the corrupt Fountain, which grieve and vex the Lord, and his Spirit, who is dishonoured daily by man, through his abuse of Gods Creatures, who is a Devourer and Destroyer of them, and not a Preserver as he ought to be, who abuseth them upon his Lust, and not to the Glory of the Lord; he loves the Creature, and worships the Creature, and is gone a whoring after the Creature, and hath forgotten God, that made him, and all things, and hath lost his own dominion wherein he was set in his Creation; and his state in his Transgression is cursed of God, and without the Peace of God, it being in the enmity against him; and in all things he is wholly unprofitable to his Maker, and onely profitable to himself, and to the Devil; and this in short is the state of every man in Transgression before Con∣version; but his state after Conversion is a State, more blessed; for man is changed, and renewed, and translated by the Power of the Lord, through the working of the eternal Spirit: Through Conversion, his Mind is changed and his heart is renewed, the old is done away, and a new Heart is given, and all things are become new, even every Word and Works, and every Intent and Purpose of his Mind is converted into another end, and guided by another Spirit, than before his Conversion; and man is again returned to God, into the Sense and Feeling of his Maker, and into Covenant with him, where he is
blessed, and all things to him; for the Reconciliation is made with God, and the evil is judged and condemened, and Sin is taken away, and blotted out, and not remembred: For man is become Servant unto God, and onely serves him in all things, and not himself or any other Creature in any thing, for he hath re∣ceived Power to become Son to God, and hath received Power over the Devil and his Temptations, and Death is destroyed, and the effects of it are ceased, and the Sting of it is taken away, and Life and Immortallity is brought to Light, and man is made capable to act in all things, for the Glory of his Maker; and God hath made Christ Wisdom to him, to rule him and guide him in all things, and Righteousness, to cover him; & Justification to him, to clear him in his Sight; and the new Man is brought forth, and the creating in Christ Jesus unto good Works is known, and the Birth which is Heir of Gods Kingdom is witnessed; and unto this man is the Lord become an everlasting Light, and a sure hiding Place; for he is not the Servant of Sin, but of Righteousness, nor an offence to God in any of his Works, but for his Names sake is well pleased, with him; he is his Teacher in all the ways of Peace, he is his Helmet, and his Shield, and his hope of Salvation, and his Shepheard to feed him and perserve him at all times; though he may be tempted, yet he is not overcome, for God is his strength; though he may be tryed, yet he is not forsaken of the Lord; though he may be cast into the Fire, it is not to consume him, for the Lord is with him; all things he receives as from the Hand of God, and all Creatures he enjoyes in the Covenant with God, and Peace is in all his ways, for it is the Lord that works in him both to will and to do of his own Good Pleasure; and this is the state of the new man brought forth in Conversion, which is a turning of the Creature from the power of Satan (which rules in every man, before Conversion) to the Power of God which is the Ruler of every man that is truly converted; and this is the Truth as it is in Jesus, which I have received from God, he that can re∣ceive it let him, and if any have an Ear let him Hear what the Spirit saith; this Conversion of the Creature is wrought by the Spirit of God through the Mini∣stry sent of him, and even for this cause have we received the Ministry of God through the Holy Ghost, that we might publish these things abroad, that all people may come to the knowledge of them, and may taste, and handle, and feel of the same Word of Life in themselves, which will reveal the Knowledge of these things to them, that they may have fellowship with us, and truly our fel∣lowship is with the Father and with the Son. And now be it known to all the World, and to all people in it, that the Lord hath raised up a People, and brought forth a Seed, to bear witness of his Name, and of his Dominion, and Power in all the Earth, and of these Truths, with many more, which are but one in Christ Jesus, hath God given us the perfect Knowledge of, even wrought them in us, and revealed them to us by the eter∣nal Spirit, and as that same Spirit doth, and shall move in us, do we, and shall we bear witness of these Truths unto all People upon Earth whatsoever, both by Doctrine and Conversation, holding forth the Testimony unto others which we have received of God, that Christ may be exalted, and his Kingdom set up in the World: And in comparison of this, that we may serve God in our Generation, by bearing witness of these things, which we have heard and seen, nothing of this World, (our Liberty, our Life, not any other thing whatsoever) is dear unto us; yea, even for this cause that the Name of the Lord may be testified of, do we give up our selves continually to suffer all manner of evil in words or works; and we love not our lives unto death, that Truth and Righte∣ousness may be exalted, and this is the cause wherefore we pass through many Dangers on every hand, and are in perils often; and we are not, nor cannot be a∣fraid of the face of any man, even that the Lord alone may be exalted, whose name, and Honour, and Truth is more dear unto us than any other thing; and for it have we forsaken all, and counted it as nothing, in comparison of the Knowledge of Christ and his Truth, herein declared and witnessed to the whole World, to
whom it shall come, and the Light of Christ in every one shall give testimony to it, unto which I do onely commend my self and these truths to be witnessed. And know ye assuredly that God who is just and righteous in all his Ways, it is he that setteth the Way of Life and the way of Death before every man, and he hath appeared in this Generation, and he hath caused his voyce to be heard in the Earth, and he hath set the way of Death and the Way of Life before you, and all that perish it is through unbelief; and because they do despise the Way which God hath prepared, who hath prepared a Way for life and Salvation unto  People, that all may come to Life and Salvation, and may not perish; and he hath not shut out any Creature before he was brought forth into the World, but gi∣veth to every one that cometh into the World, a Day of Visitation and a time  Repentance, and Returning, that healing may be received from the Lord, w is the Restorer of lost man, and there is not another; so that if man perish  is of himself, and not of God, who hath so loved Mankind, that he hath give his Son, his own Wisdom and his Power, into the World, that all that doth re∣ceive him (Christ Jesus) may have everlasting Life, and they that receive him not, they perish because of unbelief, whereby they are hardened for de∣struction; and unto such our Gospel, the Gospel of God, is hid, whose Eye i blinded by the God of this World, that they cannot see the things which be eter∣nal, nor believe in him from whence Life comes, and such are stumbling at Chri the Foundation, and therefore shall be broken, and must not inherit the King∣dom of God; and unto such though they be wise in the Kingdom  this World, are we become Fools for Christs sake, and our Testimony can∣not be received by them, nor approved of them, even them that seek after a Sig and them that seek after Wisdom, to such we are not known, nor can our Testimo∣ny be acceptable to them, which is not with enticing words of mans wisdom,  in the demonstration of Gods Spirit, and in simplicity of Truth, which is of gr Price with the Lord, even above knowledg, and all wisdom which is of this Wor which comes to nothing; but the Lord will confound that, and bring it to no∣thing; for the World by its wisdom doth not know God, neither can it recei the things of God, but is Foolishness in the Sight of God, and the wisdom of t World Must be offended in him, and in the Testimony which is given of him,  the Princes of this World, and the Wise men must stumble and fall, the powe of the Earth must be offended at him, that they may be confounded and broug to nought; all the Heathen shall rage, and the People shall imagine a vain thing But what of all this? the Testimony of the Lord is true which he hath given us  bear of his Name, & of it we are not ashamed before the face of the whole World and we are armed to suffer for it, and not onely to subscribe to the truth of  with our hand, or to declare of it with our Tongue and Pen; but also, if we  called to it, may seal it with our blood: Wherefore this is sent among you all Rulers, Teachers, and People, in all the World, this is sent among you, as to gi you the certain knowledge of what we hold, and bear witness to, which is recei∣ved of us from God, and born witness of, to you, by his Spirit, even those thing with many others, which we have not received from man, but from God, are  purposed in the Lord to declare abroad, and he hath put it into our hearts to  his Will herein; for he hath spoken, who can but prophesie; and he hath given  word, and many are they that publish it in faithfulness against the kingdom  the Man of Sin, which hath long been exalted in the Earth over the Seed of , which the Lord is now a gathering, and establishing his Covenant with, and Ie∣rusalem that hath long lain waste, shall be made the praise of the whole Earth,  the Gentiles, which hath polluted her, shall be cast out, and the Saints shall Rejoy over all their Enemies. And know you assuredly from us, who know the Lord, that God is doing gre things in the Earth; he is begun to work, and his arm shall bring it to pass; he will overturn, and overturn, till he come to reign whose right it is, who
will change times and things, even that which cannot be believed, though a man declare it unto you, is the Lord bringing to pass; the Eye shall bless that sees it, and the Heart shall praise that can understand, and behold the Lord comes quickly, and they are blessed that wait for him, whose Reward is with him, and his glorious Work is before him to be wrought by his own hand without the help of any other; who needs not the help of man; and he that doth oppose him, shall be overthrown, confounded, and destroyed. And again, All ye Kings, Princes, Rulers, and People whatsoever, know ye assuredly that we are not Enemies against, but Friends unto all Civil Govern∣ment, and to all just and righteous Orders and Decrees, and wholsome Laws and Customs of any Common-wealth, and no way are we destructive to, or Destroy∣ers of the Peace, and Welfare, and wholsome Laws (which is according to God) of any Nation whatsoever. But are Preservers of the Peace of all people, and wait in patience for the establishment of Justice and true Judgement; and that Righteousness may spring forth, and the Government of all Nations may be according to the Law of God. Neither are we such who makes void the just Government of any Nation or City: Neither are we such who through evil purposes, plot, or conspire, or contrive Evil in our Hearts against any Gover∣nours or Government whatsoever; but wish Peace and Truth, and the Fear of the Lord unto all men and Nations, and desire not the overthrow or evil to any people, or their Government: but are subject to just Government everywhere by obedience to it; and subject to evil Government by suffering in patience un∣der it; so that righteousness alone we wait to see set up through the World, and for that cause suffer patiently under our Enemies, not seeking revenge against them, nor envying the persons of any; but pity our enemies, and desire their Repentance rather than their Destruction: Yet this we give all to know, that the Lord will be avenged on all them who hate the Way of Righteousness, and all that oppose the Lord and his Way, and despise his Truth which he hath re∣vealed; they shall be confounded and broken to pieces, and shall confess to the Lord, and his Way, and his Truth in the day of their Destruction. Again, let all the Earth know, that against all unrighteousness, injustice, oppression, whoredom, murder and drunkenness, and all sin whatsoever; we do declare and acknowledge our selves to be Enemies against all sin, and they that commit it, and we cannot hide Sin and Iniquity in any, but give our testimony against it, and against all, that live in it, whatsoever, without Respect to men or places, and cannot flatter any man in his Transgressions, but say, that Lying, Swearing, Drunkenness, Covetousness, Jniustice, Dissimulation, Hypocrisie, Murder, and Envy, Lust of the Flesh, Pride and Wantonness, and all the works of the Flesh whatsoever, are contrary to God, and of the Devil, and they that lives in them, and brings them forth, are the Servants of the Devil, and must not inherit the Kingdom of God, who brings forth those works, which grieves the Spirit of God, and vexes his righteous Soul; and this is that Government onely, which is the Government of Sin and Death, which we declare our selves Enemies to, which is of the Devil, and not of God; and this is that Government which we testifie against, and war against, by the Sword of the Spirit of God, and by his Power, and not by the carnal weapons, or subtil conspiracies, or violent Insurrections, for this way, and by this means, shall not the Govern∣ment of Satan be overthrown, or the Kingdom of Christ ever exalted. Again, let all the World know, that we are not such as disanul, or makes void the Covenant, and bond of Relations, or teach any so to do, or give any exam∣ple, by our practice, to any subjects to be rebellious to their Governors; or children, to be disobedient to their Parents; or that servants be undutiful to their Masters. But on the contrary, do say, and affirm it, that it is the duty of Sub∣jects, to be obedient, and subject in the Lord to their Rulers and Governours, whether Kings, Dukes, or others, who have rule over them; and also,
that Children should be obedient to their Parents; and Servants to be dutiful, and subject to their Master in the Lord, in all things; and that Husbands and Wives live in all unity and peace in the Lord: Provided onely, where Rulers Parents, or Masters, or Husbands require of their Subjects, Children, or Servants, or any other whatsoever, requiring of their Relations, that which is unjust, and contrary to God, and his righteous Law; in such a case we say, that Subjects, Children, Servants, and all other whatsoever are free, and we say, where man requires any thing contrary to God, and God requires another thing contrary to man, the obedience to God is rather to be chosen, and the obedience to all m is to be denyed; and this is our judgement, which is acording to truth, and i the mind of God concerning subjection and obedience, and the duty of Relati∣ons one to another. And lastly, Know ye assuredly, that we do not hold and maintain any thing, by conversation or doctrine, but the very same Truth in word and practice,  all our fore-Fathers did, but bears witness of the same Salvation, by the same Christ, as they did, and are not setters forth of strange gods; for no other God is worshipped by us than he, which Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, and all the rest of the servants of the Lord in every generation worshipped, served and obeyed; neither are we such as do maintain Heresie, Error, or Idolatry, or the worship of any strange god, though hereof we are accused falsely, yet against us cannot it be proved truly; and this we give the whole world to know, that no other end, or purpose, or design is in our hearts, but onely to fulfil the will of God in all things, as it is to us made manifest. Even this is the resolution of our hearts, and the full purpose of our minds, to give testimony through the World, as we are moved, both by writing and declaring of these Truths which to us is known from the Lord, that truth and righteousness may come to reign; and this may we do  the Lord provideth way for us, not fearing the face of any man, nor being afraid of the threatning of high looks; and that we may finish the testimony given  of God, our life, nor any other thing is dear unto us; and all ye people every where, for your sake is this written, to come abroad amongst you, to give yo warning, and true information of the work of the Lord, and what he is about to do, that you may hear, and understand, and may receive the knowledge  those things which belong to your peace, and may be saved with an eternal Sal∣vation; or otherwise, through this are you wholly left without excuse, if yo perish: And unto this was I pressed in spirit for many days, that all the World may be satisfied, what we are, and what we hold, and what the purpose of the Lord is; and I whom God hath warned, do warn all people upon the face of the Earth, that you prepare, prepare to meet the Lord, for his coming, and his day is nigh at hand, and his judgements shall be revealed in the Earth, & all flesh shall tremble before him, and all the Inhabitants of the World shall be confounded at his pre∣sence; The Proud shall be abased, and the Poor shall be exalted; the High and Lof∣ty shall be brought down, and the Meek and Upright shall be set up; Truth shall reign as King, and Deceit shall utterly be confounded; they that now suffer all manner of evil, for the Name of Jesus, shall possess everlasting Freedom, and the Dominion shall be in their hands, and they that now cause the Just to suffer, shall go into endless captivity; the Seed of God shall spring forth and flourish, but the seed of Evil-doers shall never be renowned: And betwixt these two Seeds is an e∣mity put, and they can never be reconciled, each seed hath his fruit, the one i cursed and the other is blessed, and each Seed is known by its fruit, and must re∣ceive from the Lord accordingly. And this is the Testimony of the Servants of the Lord, and the Witness which they give unto all the World, of those things which we have handled, tasted, heard, seen and felt; blessed are all they that can receive it. We are known to God in the Spirit, and one to another in his Life, and are known in the World by the name of Quakers, cast upon us through the derisio of the Heathen.
But Quaking and Trembling at the Word of the Lord, by the Servants of the Lord, we do own, when the power of God reacheth to the Witness of God in the Creature, which brings condemnation upon all high looks, and upon the lofty nature, which causeth the earthly part to tremble; we do own, and many of us do witness, the Quaking and Trembling which is by the operation of the Spirit of God, and the several operations by the one Spirit we own: which brings down proud flesh, whose honour God will lay in the dust, and bring it to ever∣lasting contempt, and when this comes to pass Quaking shall not be a strange thing, nor the Name reproached, as it is at this day by the proud spirits of men, who knows not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his Spirit. Moreover, and beside all this, let all the World know, that our Conversion, Life and Practice is one and the same with what we hold forth in words, and that we give as large a Testimony of God amongst us, by pure Conversation, as Do∣ctrine, and do deny them who gives Testimony in Words only, and answers not in their Conversation, for that is Hypocrisie, & our souls loath it; & it is abo∣mination in the sight of the Lord, where he is profest in words, and not walked to in purity and righteousness of life; for Righteousness being brought forth in the heart, works of righteousness will spring forth in the World, and where Righteousness springs not forth in the World, and the fruits of the Knowledge of God, it shews that righteousness is not in the heart, and that God is not known. Also concerning our Government, it is according to Christ, whom we own to be Head amongst us, and no other head we have, or do bow unto, and we are but Members of his Body, joyned to him, through the Spirit, as Head over us all, and the greatest of us, is but a Member of Christ, who is the Head alone; and we have not another, neither can we be subject to any other Government, but his, or to obey any Government, but what is justly according to his, whose Go∣vernment must be set up in the earth, and for it we wait, and labour, and tra∣vel, and counts nothing hard, but all things are easie to us, for this prise which is before us, even the Government of Christ to be set up, and all Governments of men establisht according to it; and this is our Testimony which we give forth in Words and Practice, and if it be required can Seal it with our Blood. And this is written for no other end, but that you may be certainly informed, what we are, and what we hold, and what the Lord hath done, and what he is about to do in all the Earth, who is risen and hath said, Ah! I will ease me of my Adversaries. Given forth by a Servant of the Lord, EDWARD BURROUGH.
THE VVofull Cry OF Unjust Persecutions, and grievous Oppressions of the People of God in England, through the Injustice of some of her Rulers, and the Wickedness of Teachers and People, who hasten to fulfil the Measure of their Fore-fathers Cruelty. With a Lamentation over them all who reward the Lord evil for good, and is a Warning to them all for Repentance; shewing that the coming of the Lord is nigh. And this may serve for an Answer in full, to all such who have Perse∣cuted by violence, by Word or Writing the innocent people in scorn called Quakers. With a Short Addition, which shewes unto all, the ground of Persecution, in its first cause, and the enmity which is betwixt the two Seeds is clearly discovered. Reader, THis is sent abroad into the World, that all People may see what is brought forth is this Generation against the Innocent; who suffer cruel things for well doing, and not for evil; and the words of Christ are fullfilled, who said, As they have done unto me, so will they do unto you: And the time comes, that whosoever kills you he will think that he doth God good service. And this is now come to pass, according as he hath said, to our rejoycing, and to the sorrow of all our Enemies. And as any is mo∣ved herein, this is to be given to the hands of the Persecuters, and of them who have done evil against the Lords People, as a gift unto them from a Friend. OF a truth the Lord is arisen, and he hath caused the Light of his coun∣tenance to shine forth upon his people, his day is dawned, and the brightness of his glory is shining forth as the Sun at noon day, h everlasting Arm is stretched forth to lead out of Captivity his o chosen, the days of perfect freedom is approaching, he that brings Health, Peace and Liberty to all Nations is come and coming, who will restore the breaches, and subdue all things under himself, that he may raign for ever and ever, who alone is worthy (for he hath all Power in his hand, and he bring to pass whatsoever he will, that all Men and Nations may fear before him, and tremble at his dreadfull Presence, who hath power in his hand) to change Tim and Laws, Orders, Decrees and Governments, the hearts of all men he c turn what way he listeth, and he pulleth down one, and setteth up another, and
whatsoever is in his heart to do, his power can bring it to pass: who would not fear before him and reverence his Name? Who would not be afraid to of∣fend him? who giveth unto man Breath and takes it away in a moment; all Nations are as the drop of a bucket before his eternal Eye, he dwells in the high and holy place, and his habitation is high above the World; be inhabits eter∣nity forevermore, and yet abideth, and walketh, and dwelleth with the children of men, that fear his Name and tremble at his Word; he hath been as a stranger, as one not known, for men have been seperated from him by transgression, and have been ignorant of his ways; he hath been as one hidden for many ages, and hath been worshipped ignorantly, and hath winked in the time of ignorance, but now he calleth all to repentance every where: Blessed are they that wait upon him, that they may know him, and their souls may live, and now the purpose of his heart, is to bring in his scattered people into the fold of peace, where Christ Jesus is the shepherd, and his people shall dwell in safety, and shall be a free people, to worship him, in the Spirit and in the Truth, and every yoke of bondage shall be broken, and the oppressed shall be set free, and Christ shall feign, and his Government, above shall be established over all the World, mans honour shall be laid in the dust, & the pride of all flesh shall be stained, and the Glory thereof shall wither as a flower, the loftiness of all flesh shall be laid low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted, and his people, which now are op∣pressed, shall replenish and fill the Earth: All corrupt men and Rulers their strength and might shall utterly fail them, and men that fear God and love righteousness shall take their place, and all things shall be changed, and the World shall be turned up-side down. But because of this is all the World troubled, and the Heathen is on a rage, and the people do imagine vain things, and men of high degree, and low degree, and of all sorts, have set themselves against the Lord, that they might stop the purpose of the most high, and their hearts within them burn because of envy, and the Devil hath stirred up all sorts of people to work for him, and to uphold his kingdom and his power, he is come down in great rage, knowing that his time is but short, and hath filled the hearts of all his servants with despite and ravening envy against the Seed of God. The heads of the people, they have conspired together against the Lord, and against his Truth; and have decreed unrighteous decrees, that they might pervent the purpose of the most High. Many of the Rulers and Judges, as mem∣bers of the beastly power, rather than of Jesus Christ, have unjustly judged and falsly imprisoned and trodden under foot the meek and upright, who fear the Lord, and walk in his way; even such who have come from under the subjection of the worship and power of the Beast, (which all the World had wondered after) ath the Beast raised his force against. How many hundreds in this Nation have been imprisoned falsly, and suffered grievous abuses unjustly for righteous∣ness sake, and not for evil doing, as a testimony against this Generation of Judges and people, and for a testimony that they are of God, who have in pa∣ience born the sufferings, and the cruelties of the wicked; many have suffered he loss of Liberty and riches, and some the loss of life, for the exercise of a ure conscience towards God, and for the Kingdom of Jesus; many have uffered under the power of wicked men, for declaring against sin and iniquity,  Townes, Steeple-houses, or high wayes, and for crying against pride, and anity, and idolatry, and coveteousness, and the wickedness of Rulers, Priests, nd People, whose deceits and transgressions hath abounded in this Generation; nd others have deeply suffered grievous cruelties, because they could not swear nd respect persons with hat or knee, and so were witnesses for the Lord and his Kingdom, which stands in righteousness; and against the power and kingdom f the Beast, which stands in iniquity, in fainedness and flattering titles, and isobedience to the Son of God, and many hundreds are woful unjust and op∣ressed sufferers at this day, by false imprisonment and spoiling of goods, be∣cause
they cannot pay Tythes, that abominable and crying oppression, by which the Beast chiefly maintains his false Prophets, and because the unchangable Priesthood is witnessed, and the changable denied, and Christ the Light of the World followed, therefore is this suffering laid upon the just, and many are sufferers under hard tasks, because they cannot maintain the Idol temples, and Idol worships, and Idol Priests, which the power of Antichrist upholds against the Power of the Son of God, and against the new Covenant of life, where God in Spirit and in Truth is worshipped without respect of places, days, or men, or things; and the True Worshippers, they Worship God in the Spirit and in the Truth, and cannot be subject to days, places, or things, appointed and or∣dained by the power of men and false prophets; and how many unjust fines and false indictments have been most illegally charged upon the Innocent, in many Courts and Judicatories through this Nation, and all in the defence of the kingdom of the man of sin; lest his authority should be abated, and the Autho∣rity of Christ Jesus exalted; many cruelties have been done, and injustice act∣ed both by Rulers and People, against such which no evil could justly be charg∣ed against, nor yet the transgression of any just law, by any one of them; O! horrid grievances and cruel oppressions hath been brought forth in this Nation, by such who should have eased the oppressed, and set at liberty the captives, such who should have judged justly the cause of the Poor, and heard the call o the oppressed, have turned judgment backward from the Poor, and equity ha found no place to enter, but Truth hath fallen in the streets, and justice a mercy have perished from among men, and the Poor hath been oppressed, a they that have departed from iniquity have been made a prey to the mouthes  devouring Lions, for some of the Judges have been as ravening Wolves, and  greedy devouring Foxes, the Lambs of Christ have been chased by the wicked, and his power, for their lives; O how have the oppressed groaned in this Natio under false judgment? to Ages and Generations for ever, may it be record for a witness against this Generation of cruel hearted men, whom the Beast a false prophet hath raised in his defence, and against the Kingdom of Christ Je and them that follow him, how full have the most part of the prisons in all th Land been with guiltless Sufferers under cruel bondage, with unjust dealings; a false judgments, have gone forth from some of your mouthes, you that h been set to judge over the people, who should have been a terror to the wicked, but have rather strengthened the hands of Evil-doers, and been a terror to righ∣teousness, so much as is possible, the great Whore which sits upon the Beast,  made your Rulers drunk and stagger with envy, and hatred, and persecution, a works of wickedness against the upright; Wo is me for you, what have yo brought sorth? even iniquity by Decrees, and Injustice by Ordinances, a false Judgment by Laws; alas, alas, your Destruction cometh as an arm man upon you, Was ever the like heard, or any persident in any Generati before you, for imprisoning Just men, for declaring against sin and the abo∣minations of the times, as you have done many; and for imprisoning men be∣cause they cannot put off their Hats to you, and Respect your Persons, and  transgress the Law of God, and because they cannot Swear, and so break Chr Command? For this you have imprisoned many, and caused them to su because of this; may not you fear and tremble before the Lord God, a your faces gather blackness at this, when you consider it? Did ever any t were set to judge in the Earth among men so abuse their power, and subvert  so quite to another End than wherefore it was committed to them? May  Shame cover you all, to commit men to Prison for the exercise of pure Consci∣ence towards God, because they cannot Swear, or respect mens Persons, or main∣tain Idol-Shepherds, and Idol-temples and Worships, which are Abominatio to the Lord; and for taking peaceable men out of peaceable Meetings, and out of their Travel on the High-ways, and first Whipping them, and sending them to Prison, the example of this which you have done, never went before in any
Age, and therefore have you exceeded in Oppression, in Injustice, in Cruelty and false Judgment; all your Fore-fathers the Pope nor Bishops, hardly ever brought forth such things; but the Lord will reckon with you, and plead the Cause of the Oppressed against all you Oppressors; yea, and will give unto you a Recompence of Reward according to your works; ye that have exalted your selves against the innocent, shall be brought down to the dust of misery, and the Saints shall reign and rejoyce over you, when the Kingdom of Christ Jesus the Lamb shall be set up over you all, and your Beastly power dashed to peeces as a Potters Vessel, when he whom you have persecuted, and his Followers, shall rule with a Rod of Iron, and break you asunder; and this shall surely come to pass, therefore consider it, ye that thus deal in your anger against the Lord and his chosen, for the Lamb shall get the victory over the Beast, and over you all that seek to defend him, and that strive under his power; for they that are with the Lamb are Called, and Faithful, and Chosen: O! therefore be awake∣ned, be awakened, ye Heads; and Judges, and Rulers of the People, remem∣ber and repent, the Lords Hand is stretched forth against all Oppressors, and his Wrath is kindled against the wicked One and his power, to overthrow his dominon which long hath reigned in the Nations, and now though he seeks to defend himself against the Lamb and his Followers by injust dealing, yet the out-stretched Arm of the Lord shall bring deliverance to his Chosen, who have been made Havock upon, in their Liberties, and in their estates, some cruelly suffering in Prison, and others by spoiling of their Goods, and none of these for Evil-doing, but upon false Suspitions, and envious Jealousies, and secret Surmisings, without any ground of occosion given; but by Wickedness have many of you sought occasion to make Offenders, by laying Snares for the Feet of the Harmless and Innocent; you have made men Offenders for a word, and perverted innocent words and actions, that you might make to your self a ground to persecute, and have sought a Cloak to cover your Cruelty in the sight of men, but naked and bare are your hearts made manifest in the Sight of the Lord, who hath looked down from Heaven, and considered these things, and hath regarded the unjust sufferings of his people whose Liberties, and estates, and good names have been spoiled through injustice, by grievous burthens laid upon some, because they could not pay Tythes (that hainous oppression) to satisfie the unmercifullness of cruel men; and many suffers at this day, unjustly in the sight of God, and illegally also in the sight of men; and some suffer the spoiling of their goods, rather by way of robbery and theft, than by just execu∣tion of judgment in proceeding of just Law; this can largely be witnessed, and this is brought forth by subservant Officers to you that are set to judge, and you to them are evil examples, and strengtheners of their malicious hands, some of them are not ashamed to take six times the value of what is unjustly claimed for the use of a false Teacher and deceitful Hireling who rides upon the Beast, and make you their servants to oppress the Poor, to uphold them and maintain them in their pride and vanities, but the Lord hath considered these things, and he hath numbred the oppressions against you, wherewith the just have been grieved and oppressed under you, he hath counted this cruelty and recorded all your unjust dealing, which you have (or suffered to be) brought forth, yea the day of account hastens and the tearm draws near upon you, where∣in the just and righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth will call you to account who will plead the cause of the Poor, and of the unjust sufferer, and oppressed, against all you Oppressors; for the cry of the Innocent against you, and the begging of the Poor is heard, which calls for vengeance upon you. In the Re∣cord of justice, what account will you give to the Highest-power, who rules over Heaven and Earth, for imprisoning just men for crying against sin, and declaring against the wickedness of this Age; this shall be proved against you in the day of the Lord; Is your answer ready, or will not your mouthes be stoped and you speechless, when righteousness it self pleads against you? And what
can you plead for fining men, and imprisoning them, for not respecting your persons, and bowing with hat and knee, and because they could not swear; this hath some of you done; will you have any thing to say in the cause of these things, when Christ Jesus comes to reign and his Saints with him, unto whom the government and the authority, and rule shall be given: though now they are persecuted, and as the refuse of men accounted by you, unto whom they are become a prey, to act your oppression and cruelty upon; and because they render nor evil for evil, therefore is the impudency of some men the more encreased, and their hardness of heart enlarged; and because judgment is not speedily executed, therefore are the hearts of some men set in them to do evil. O! what a sad reckoning in that day, and what large indictments and verdicts for your oppression, will be read against you, and proved to be just in the sight of God and men; a sad thing will it be upon you, when laid to your charge by the Lord, for causing men to suffer because they could not swear, nor respect persons, nor uphold the deceits of false Worships and Teachers, nor cease to cry against sin, in your Towns and Steeple-houses. O! be stirred up out of your security; you Heads, and Rulers, and Judges, and Officers, even all you be awakened who have turned your sword against the peaceable, and been a terror to righteousness as much as you could, which you ought not to have been, and so your power you have abused, and subverted it to another end than wherefore it was committed to you: instead of defending the upright you have offended him; and instead of being a terror to the wicked, his hand, hath been strengthen∣ed through your wicked presidents; this is the truth, as the Light in all your con∣sciences shall witness in the day of the Lord; O! how hath justice and true judgment been neglected, and oppression and cruelty abounded, the like in Generations past hath not been known, but the Lord is now arisen, and hath said, I will ease m of my Enemies, and take vengeance upon my Adversaries, who have done wickedly against him and his people, till the patience of the Lord is near an end, and his long suffering finished, and his judgments will he make known upon his Enemies in this Generation, that Ages to come forever may be warned not to oppress the Innocent, as these have done by false accusations, and unjust judgments, and wicked proceedings; and because of it, the wrath of the Lord is kindled, and his viols of indignation shall be poured upon the Beast, and upon the false Prophet; and all their power shall be smitten in one day. And O what wickedness hath abounded in the people also, to help up the measure of the Rulers sins, that they may receive their recompence together; how have the people of all sorts abused the innocent lambs of Christ, whom he hath called? What beatings, and stonings, and bruisings, and other abuses, in Towns, and High-ways, and Steeple-houses; its hard to be expressed, and large to be declared: some have been wounded nigh unto death, others bruised till blood have gushed out, and others cast down in the dirt, and punched with feet, and troden upon, and many have been in danger of their lives; some have been knocked down with staves, and their cloaths-rent, and their hair torn off their heads; and some have been pursued after, with throwing stones and dirt at them; and many haled, and tumbled, and lugged, and hurried up and down in cruel manner, to the danger of life, and oppression of the creature; and others have been whipped, and lashed, and put into cruel torment of their Bodies, by Engins framed of purpose to torment the Bodies of the harmless, as Chester and Carlile may witness; and others have been haled before Rulers, and falsly slan∣dered to the taking away of life, if the Lord had not prevented more than the mercy of men, and having been unmercifully and unjustly sent to prison, there have they suffered cruelties from the Goalers or their servants, by beatings, or punishings, or threatnings, or cruel words, and casting into Dungeons, and great abuses shamefully acted upon them; and other Prisoners have made a prey upon them, by taking away their cloaths and meat, and beating of them, and a∣busing
them divers ways, & Murtherers have had more priviledge of freedom in prisons, and in tryals, than these who are Innocent; and those things thus acted contrary to their own Law, have passed without reproof from many in Authority, though it hath been brought to their Door, and in this manner have the Children of God, the Lamb and his Followers been persecuted with∣out cause, or any evil works brought forth by them, and legally proved against them; but for well-doing, and not for evil, have the wicked vented their malice against them, that the more the Beast and his power hath fulfilled wickedness, the sooner may be his destruction. And O what scorning, and reviling, and lying, and slandering, and evil speeches with mockings, and cruel words of envy, and tearms of cruelty against the Innocent, hath this Generation brought forth in this day, where∣in the Dragon with his Angels hath joyned battel against the Prince of Righteousness, and they that follow him; and whole Gog and Magog is ga∣thered together, to compass the Camp of the Saints about, and to fight against the beloved City, the Judges and Rulers, with their train of subservant officers, as Bayliffs, Clarks, Goalers, Constables, with all that to those belonged, have with a high hand persecuted, and laid oppressions by hard-heartedness, upon the backs of the poor and distressed, and the Scorners, and iers, and prophane wretch∣es have bent their tongue against the Just, in uttering lies, slanders, reproaches, back-biting, nick-naming, and false-accusing, and all manner of evil speeches, and false reproaches, and the just have been burthened by all this; and thus they that have been departed from iniquity have been a prey to Rulers to act their injustice upon, and to the people to utter their slanders, and to do cruelty against; and the teeth of evil-doers have been set on edge, to bite and de∣vour, and to satisfie their maliciousness upon the sufferings of the upright people; and from the Judge upon his throne, to the begger upon the high-way, all have had their hand dipped in this cause of cruel and unjust persecution, and the Lord hath considered and harkened from his holy Habitation, and numbered up the sum of all your iniquities that he may repay and recompence upon your heads; wo unto you unjust Judges, and corrupt men, who have abused your power. And wo unto all that do oppress by hard dealing, who have offended the just, and defended the unjust: Wo unto all you scorners, lyers, back-biters, and repoachful tougues; the Lord is coming to take an account. Your sins cry for vengeance against you, and though your hands and tongues have been strengthened to speak and act ungodliness, by the evil example of your Rulers, yet your own iniquity shall you bear in the day of the Lord, and though your Rulers and Judges have been strengthened in their unjustness and mercilesness, by the false lying Teach∣ers and Diviners of false visions, which have seen vanity, yet their own iniquity shall they bear, and every man shall die for his own sin; Wo unto your Teachers, they have eaten up the sin of Rulers and people, and covered iniquity and trans∣gression, by flattering and lying words; they have daubed with untempered mor∣ter, and healed up the wound deceitfully, and cryed peace, peace, to the wicked, that have walked in the imaginations of their own hearts, when unto such the Lord never spake peace. And now whereas the Rulers and people have stretched forth their hands to vex the Lords people, & have through unjust judgment, and grievous oppressions, and unmercifull dealings, troden the Innocent under foot, and made them a prey to their mouth, and divers ways have persecuted in cruel manner the Followers of the Lamb; yet also have the wise men of this World, even the Priests and Teachers, who have led the people, and have caused them to err, and have set themselves as in battel array against the Lord and his way and peo∣ple; How have you hardened your hearts, and made your fore-head as brass, against the Word of the Lord, and you have been as the fountain of all this wickedness acted against the Just, and strengtheners of the hands of ungodly men; the Heads and Rulers you have strengthened in their
cruelty, of false judgments by your arguments of strife; in subtilty you have been as nursers of all this Persecution and Wickedness, and have interceded for oppression, to cause the Just to groan, whom the Lord hath raised to testifie against you; the Judges they have given regard unto you, and the people they have taken you for examples, who have been cursed presidents to the Rulers and people, who have followed your cruel steps of malice and envy; and from the head to the tail, they have drunk in your, poysonous Doctrines; and made themselves drunk therewith, and out of reason, in their furious zeal of madness, and all have taken council together to slay the harmless from off the face of the Earth; some by false judgment and oppression, and others by cruel abusings, as beatings, and stonings, unheard of, or unequalized in Generations of late. O ye Priests, and Teachers, and Wise-men, and Scribes! how many of you in this Nation joyned hand in hand to betray the Innocent, by your false Doctrines and lying Divina∣tions, and have filled, (and sought to do so) the mind of the people with slanders and false reproaches, & lying imaginations, and many conceptions, and jealousies against the people of God; many of you have made it your study-work, to bring forth evil by cunning Arguments, to suggest into the hearts of people, that they might not enter the Kingdom, and even so have you been shutters of the King∣dom of Heaven against men, and would not enter your selves, nor suffer others that would. Wo unto you, you have taken away the Key of Knowledge, and lost it, and multitudes of false Aspersions, and lying Assertions have you brought forth without fear, by wicked consequence and lying productions, that you might take away the key of knowledge thereby, and hide it from men, and lay stum∣bling-blocks of Iniquity before the people, to stop the way of the Upright, and you have travelled to seek occasions of evil against the Just, and watched for the halting of the Innocent, that you might glory and rejoyce in their fall, and without any occasion, by words or actious, you have taken offence, and made offences by evil surmisings, to blind the eyes of people, that your Idolatry might not be discovered, nor the Way of Righteousness shine forth. O be ashamed and repent, for to account must you Come, and the sin of Rulers and people, whom you have blindy led, will be charged against you, who have given them wicked examples, of cruelty in your Pulpits; you have spent time in Rail∣ing, and Slandering, and Lying, to infuse evil into the minds of men, against the Truth, and many books have you given forth, and sent abroad from your lying Pens, outof your vain studies, of false prophesie, and mens hearts have been filled with your damnable Doctrines of Devils, wherewith the Simple have been poy∣soned, and the Innocent betrayed; even great numbers of Books, and lying Scroules have gone through the Nation from some of you, filled with false Di∣vination, and intents of evil, against the Way of the Lord and his people, and worse than Balaam, and far exceeding him have you been: you have sought e∣chantments to curse the people whom God hath blessed altogether, and some of you have done it to your evil reward of your evil work: and you have not known that there is no divination against the holy Seed. O what will become of you when the Lord is arisen to plead with you  these things, the cruelty and oppression of the Rulers shall be added  your account, and the sin of the people which you have swallowed down, it shall be laid to your charge; for you have strengthened the hands of Evil-doers, so that none could turn from his evil way, but have by y been hardened therein, and from you prophaness have gone forth to the ends of the Earth. Woe, woe, is approaching, what account will yo render in the day of the Lord? you will all be speechless in that day, wh the swift Witness doth arise; therefore to all you I am moved to write, who have set your selves to gain-say the Truth, and to write against the people of the Lord, whom you call Quakers, who walk in the Truth, and have received the Truth from the Lord, whom you have reproached and slandered in secret, and al∣so
in open print, in the face of the World, and have laid many cruel and false Charges and Accusations against them, and to all that hath, or ever shall here∣after bend your tongues and pens, to utter wickedness and falshood by writing or otherwise. Repent, and cease your wickedness, for the wrath of the Lord is kindled against you, and take this for an answer in full to all your Books, and false reproaches; we are of God, and he that is of God heareth us, and the whole World lies in wickedness, and we have the Testimony that we please God; and he is our God, and we are his People, and he hath Chosen us, and we have Chosen him, and the Name of the Lord is our strength, and his Cove∣nant of Life is with us, and among us hath he fullfilled his promise, and his Spirit is poured forth, and sons and daughters do Prophesie, and one King reigns upon mount Sion, and the night to us is far spent, and the day is dawned, and the darkness of the night, which long hath overshadowed the World, in which no man could work is from us fled, and the marvellous Light is risen, and we are them whom God hath gathered according to his promise, Ezik. 34. from the mouthes of Idol-shepherds which once made a prey upon us, and the Glory of the Lord is revealed, and the time is come of Restoration, and of bringing back out of the captivity of darkness, where all have lain, with a vail of darkness spread over all their faces, and we are eye-witnesses of his glory, and it is given us to taste, and feel, and handle the Word of Life, which lives for ever; there∣fore I say unto you all, it is a little thing to us, and not respected, to be reproach∣ed by you; our life you cannot reach, nor our glory deface, and you we know to be them who God never sent, but must fulfill your measure of wickedness, till the time of your overthrow, which draws near upon you all, and despisable shall you be to all that fear the Lord, and love his ways, for your nakedness and shame shall be uncovered, and them that have loved you shall be filled with the indignation of the Lord against you, all your writings, and Books, and lyes, and slanders, and false reproaches uttered in publick and private, shall go into the pit from which they came, and shall return upon your own heads, and when your vail of slanders and false aspersions is taken off, then shall we (as we are) appear, and till then all your evill brought forth against us we bear in patience, and love your revilings rather than your praise; wherefore with shame put off your armour, and lay down your crownes, and stop your mouthes in the dust, and bow and Tremble before the Just God, and before the Lamb, who is risen to make war against the Beast, and against you his false Prophets, whose Generati∣on must grow feeble, and become weakness in this the day of the Lord; your time is at an end, wherein it was given you to reign, and to seduce and deceive the Nations; and now shall the Son of God be exalted, and the kingdoms of this World shall become the Kingdoms of Christ: hear and consider this, all ye that exalt your selves against the Lord and his way, and are established in the throne of unrigh∣teousnes, under the beastly power; if any man hath an ear to hear let him hear; the light is risen, and these things are made manifest, and with the light of the World, in all men shall they be witnessed to be truth, and the state of things as they are at this day; and if you can discern the times, and the signes of times, and the changing of times, here you may read and understand; blessed are all that have an ear to hear. TO all ye Heads and Rulers, Judges and Magistrates, Mayors, Bailiffs, Goalers and Constables, and all others whatsoever, Governors, Priests and People, who have, and do persecute the Children, and Servants of the Lord, the Saints of the most high God, who feareth the Name of the Lord, and walketh in his way, who are not of this World, but redeemed out of it, and are despised a∣mong men, as all the Generation of the just every where; to all you Persecuters and violent Doers, this is a Word from the Lord God: Repent, repent, for evil have you done in his sight, and vext his Soul, and grieved his Spirit, and
heaped up wrath against the day of wrath, and multiplyed your transgressions, and the measure of your Iniquities are well nigh filled up; ye have set your selves against the Lord, and your hands you have strengthened against his peo∣ple, you have rejected the day of your visitation, and you have not regarded the day of your Salvation, you have plainly made it manifest that you are of that Generation which killed the just, and that you are of the seed of evil-doers, the works you have brought forth do plainly declare that you will not have Christ to reign amongst you, nor his Government to rule over you, who have thus persecuted the Innocent without cause, by false imprisonments, and false judg∣ments, and hard dealings, and reproachings, and revilings; consider your ways, and what you have done, search your hearts, and let it take place in you all, how have you persecuted the just, how have you stretched forth your hands and dealt cruelly and violently with the meek of the Earth? how have you troden under-foot the poor and needy, and greatly oppressed the upright hearted, who have not rendred evil for evil, but forgiven you, & prayed for you, & wished well unto you, and born in patience (without complaining) ll your injustice and cruelty, and have not sought vengeance against you, even such hath God chosen more than many, and them you have despised and persecuted more than any, and laid heavy bonds of oppression upon them, and doubled their task through your hard-heartedness, least the Seed of God should grow; grieveous yoaks have you laid upon it by false imprisonments, and unjust fines, and illegal proceed∣ings, by beatings, halings, abusings, reproaches, and revilings, all manner of evil have been acted and spoken against the Generation of the just by you, and un∣der you in your Judicatories and Jurisdictions, in your Corporations, high∣ways, Towns, and Goals, and other places. O! consider what you have done? and suffered to be done under you; lay it to heart what havock of the people of the Lord in their persons and estates, and what cruelty exercised upon them through your rebellious hearts, with∣out any evil justly charged upon them, or breach of any Law justly proved a∣gainst them, for well-doing, and not for evil have you caused them to suffer:  crying against iniquity, and reproving sin in the Gate, & for bearing witness  the Truth, and against all unrighteousness which abounds in this Generation; such have you falsly judged to be offenders, and cryed a confederacy agai them, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, and caused the Innocent groan. O! what will you do in the day of your visitation, when the Lord aris to plead with you; to whom will you fly for refuge, and to whom will you cry  deliverance? Shall not the Lords soul be avenged upon you, yea from the least of you to the greatest? You shall feel his hand of judgment, even all you who ha had your fingers dipped in the unjust sufferings of the dear Servants of the Lord▪ whom he hath called to place his Name with for ever, who are his faithf Witnesses in this perverse Generation, and by your persecuting of them ha you proved them to be the people of God, in the sight of all Nations; and it  for a testimony unto them, that they are of God; and against you, that you  of the Devil; and Christs words are fullfilled upon them, to their rejoyci and to your sorrow, who said, The time comes, that they shall speak all  evil falsly, and persecute you, and think they do God service that kills you,  casts you from among them; and the Devil shall cast some of you into prison. And th things you have done, and fullfilled Christs words against your selves, for  witness against you, and to shew that you are Enemies to Christ, and to his King∣dom, and that you will not have him to reign (as I have said): Therefore wh he reigneth, he shall say, Bring hither those mine Enemies, and slay them before me. O! what will the just Judge of true Judgment, the God of Heaven and Earth render unto you, when he ariseth to plead the cause of the poor and needy, and to deliver his Inheritance from under your oppression into perfect freedom? What account will you give in that day, when he brings swift destruction upon
you? And wherewith will you answer him when the secrets of your hearts are made manifest, and when the true witness in you all is awakened, which will bring to your remembrance all your cruel and unjust dealing, and all your bit∣ter and hard speeches which in your envy you have brought forth against the Lord and against his people? What will be done to you his Enemies, when Christ Jesus, whom you have persecuted, comes to reign in his Kingdom, and subdues the kingdoms of this World, and changeth them into the Kingdoms of the Lord, and his Christ, and the Saints which you have oppressed, receives the Authority and Dominion? It shall be said, All that would not that Christ should reign, slay them before him; when it shall be given to the Saints to bind Kings in chains and Nobles in fetters of iron, and to execute upon the Heathen all the judgments written; for behold all ye stout hearted, the Lord cometh in ten thousand of his Saints to judge the World in righteousness, and you shall be con∣vinced of all your ungodly deeds; for the Scriptures must be fullfilled; and as you have done, even so will it be done unto you, when the suffering of the righteous is finished, and your wickedness come to an end; when the Lord shall reign, you shall lick the dust off his feet, and all the Persecuters of Christ shall be trodden down as mire, and the righteous shall rejoyce over them, and the Lord shall mock when your fear and calamnity comes, which come suddenly, in a day when you expect not; how shall the Lord pardon you for this? you have sinned against knowledge, and gone on after warning, and hardened your hearts after reproof, and the day of your visitation you have greatly slighted; ye Rulers have abused your power, and ye subjects have abused your subjection; and now consider what God did in Generations past unto the rebellious chil∣dren, what he did to Pharaoh and all his Hosts, when his long suffering was fi∣nished; how did Pharaoh harden his heart, and his cruel Task-masters oppress the righteous, even as you have done, and they would not let Israel go free to serve the Lord, but they kept them in bondage; and this way you walk, who exercise cruelty as they did, and laid heavy burthens upon the Innocent griev∣ous to be born; cruel task-masters have you been over the Heritage of the Lord, and in Pharaohs example of wickedness have you walked, fulfilling his measure of cruelty, and Pharaohs example shall you follow in a cursed end; remember how the loftiness of his heart was bowed down, and how his proud heart was abased in the day that God pleaded with him in his righteous judgments, he and all his task-makers were confounded in a day, and the bondage of the righ∣teous was broken in a moment, how was his whole strength of Tyranny over∣turned and turned into weakness, the righteous were delivered, and he and all his train overwhelmed in one day, and thus shall it come to pass upon you: Therefore consider this, all ye that fullfill the measure of iniquity, suddenly will the righteous God be awakened to take vengeance upon you, and the just shall not always groan under your bondage, for he that looketh from the Heaven hath pity upon the distressed, for whom now his arm is stretched out to bring deli∣verance unto them, and all their enemies will be confounded, who have this long time ploughed long furrows upon the back of the righteous, the oppression; and cruelty, and injustice, brought forth in this Nation, it calls for vengeance from Heaven. Alas, alas, woe is me for you, you Heads, and Rulers, and Judges of Eng∣land, what have you done and suffered to be done (under you) against the inno∣cent people of God, who is as dear to him as the apple of his eye? for they be writ∣ten on the palms of his hands, and because of the cry of the poor and the needy will the Lord arise and plead their cause. Oh consider, and let it enter into your hearts, the cruelty and injustice that hath been brought forth in this Land, and remember what God did unto all the Persecuters of old, how was their strength consumed, and they overturned and destroyed, what did he to Pharaoh and all his host, who persecuted the Seed of God? how was he de∣stroyed and the righteous set free; and what was done to Haman? How was
he justly rewarded, who persecuted the Innocent Seed of God? What did God to Herod and all his people who persecuted the Innocent? and remember what he did unto them that persecuted the Three Children, and them that persecuted Daniel, how did they fall into the pit which they had digged for another, and how were they destroyed, and the Innocent delivered, considered and remember these things, ye that suffer the Just to groan by you. Search through the Records of old, and search what God hath done unto all them that lifted up their hand against Him and his People, and is he not the same at this day, his Hand is not shortened that it cannot save his people, and de∣stroy his Enemies, his Ear is not dull of hearing that he should not understand this unjust suffering of his people, though you live carelessely in pleasure upon Earth, while the Innocent mourns, yet doth the Lord regard, though you spend your time in pleasure, and delight your selves in vanities all the day long, yet the Lord hath taken it to heart, and his Spirit is grieved that his Innocent Ser∣vants should lye in Holes and Dungeons to be trodden upon, and be accounted as the off-scouring of all things, hardly thought worthy to have a place on the Earth. Oh remember these things, ye that are high minded, and consider what God did to the Bishops and their crew of persecutors in this Nation, your selves are wit∣nesses how the Lord overthrew them, and delivered his people in a few years time; and as little as you, did they think, that they whom they persecuted should so soon come to have reigned over them, the Lords Hand was then against Op∣pressors as it is at this day, do you think the Lord hath forgotten or that he takes no notice of what is come to pass, how should he forget his People to save them, or his Enemies, that he should not recompence them; but know ye assu∣redly that the Lord is the same, and all those things are written in a Book, and remembred by him, and he will judge justly and righteously in his dreadful day; Ah, let it enter into your hearts, serve not your selves altogether in the pleasures of this World, but serve the Lord, and this he requires of you, let the oppressed go free, and break every bond, whereby the Innocent do suffer, and this the Lord requires at your hands; Oh but I feel great hardness of heart, and rather a strengthening of cruel bonds, than a breaking of them, and you appear rather to be given up to work wickedness, and to fullfill the largest measure of them that went before you, than otherwise, unrighteous Decrees are rather established than dis∣annulled. Oh, what will be the end of these things! and what will be your judg∣ment when the Lord awakens himself, as out of sleep, who hath left you to follow your own spirits, to try you, that it might be known unto all what is in your hearts; and behold perverseness lodges in them; and while the Lord hath looked for justice amongst you, even the cry of op∣pression hath been heard, even a grieveous cry of unjust persecution and violence against the Seed of God, and once you would have been ashamed of those things which now you act without shame; so that which is in your hearts is poured forth in the sight of the World. Oh ye Rulers of England, the Rulers of the Heathen shall rise up is judgment against you, even they that never professed so much as you have done; they shall be rather justified than you, whose wayes have been more equal than yours, and less cruelty brought forth by them than by you, unto their subjects; and this makes your sin more great, in that many of yo were raised from low estate, and you have exalted your selves more than is meet, and have caused your very equals to groan under you, by the heavy yoak which you have prepared for them; well, but the Lord hath listned and heard, and a Book of remembrance is written, and he will repay into your bosoms; the time is not long when the Lord may scatter you, and give you unto the will of your E∣nemies; therefore be awakened, and warned, the day of your visitation is upon you all.
OH England that thou hadst known in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace. Oh that thy Rulers and people had known how that the Lord hath called unto them. Oh that they had considered-how that his hand hath been stretched forth all the day long, and he would have gathered them, as a Shepherd doth his flock, but they have n known, neither have they considered, and therefore that which belongs to their peace will the Lord hide from their eyes, the day of their visitation is spending apace, and the night will come, and no man shall be able to work; and because the Lord hath called and you have not heard, therefore shall you cry and the Lord will give no an∣swer. Oh Nation, thou art filled with oppression, and griveous iniquities; and from the Head to the Foot thou bearest marks of great abominations; in thee is found lamentable oppression of the Poor; and great and grieveous Idola∣tries; and Gods Rightous Soul is vexed in thee day by day, the Just groans and mourns under the heavy hand of oppressors, many of thy Goales do witness it, where many Innocent and Upright People have suffered un∣justly the loss of their Freedom, without any ground, or charge of evil laid upon them. Oh what have thy Rulers done, Judgment and Justice have they turned back∣ward, the cry of the Poor hath not been regarded, and equity hath not found a place to enter. Who would have thought that you, who have been so high in Pro∣fession of the Scriptures, should thus have dealt with them who are in the Life of the Scriptures, this agravates your sin, in that none hath been like you in profession of Religion, and in pretences of Righteous∣ness; and yet you have exceeded others in persecuting (and suffer∣ing of it) the servants of the Lord, but it is now made Manifest what lodgeth in your hearts; under your fair covers of promises, words and shews, what deep Hypocrisie is this that you should profess Liberty of Conscience, and yet have persecuted hundreds for the exercise of their pure Consciences. Is not this to be taken notice of, that you should profess that which you do not perform? and will not the Lord plead with you because of it, in his dread∣ful day? which is hastening upon you, as a thief in the night, and the wicked shall not escape; do you not think that he whom you persecute in his Members, and his Members, shall surely reign over you? do not you know that he is sufficient to avenge himself of all his Enemies? and do not you believe that he could command thousands of thousands to fight for him, and to revenge his Cause? Hath the consideration of these things no room in your hearts; or are your hearts wholy shut up from all compassion towards the Lords people? Surely to Vengeance will the Lord be awakened, and he will tread you down as mire in the streets; and as you have done, and suffered to be done to the Lords people, even so shall it be done unto you. THere are only two Seeds in the World, and there are but two and no more; to wit, the Seed of God, and the Seed of the Serpent; and these two are contrary one to the other, in their bringing forth, in their time, and in their ends; they differ in their Nature, in their fruits and works, and in their reward; and these two are at continual enmity one against another, and never was, is, or shall be reconciled, the life of one is the
death of the other; and where the one doth live, the other doth dye; and where the one rejoyceth, the other is made sorrowful; and where the one is in Freedom, the other is in Bondage; and where the one is Ruler, the other is a Slave and in Captivity; and thus are they contrary: where the one brings forth fruit, the other is barren; and the one is rewarded with the overthrow of the other, and the one of these is ruling in every creature man and woman, and growing and bringing forth fruit from it self, through the Creature; and the fruits of the one is blessed for ever and the fruits of the other are cursed for ever; and betwixt these two there is no concurrence or agreement in any thing whatsoever, but they differ in likeness, and their fruits differ in appearance; the fruit of the one is love, and peace, and unity; the fruit of the other is hatred, and envy, and trouble, and enmity; the fruit of the Seed of God in the creature, is truth, and righteousness, and faith, and patience, long-suf∣fering, and temperance, and joy, and peace in the Lord, with all other things which are good, and just, and pure; but the fruits of the seed of the Serpent are of another nature, as Lying, Theft, Murther, Dissimulati∣on, Drunkenness, and Whordoms, Hypocrisie and all Unrighteousness, which is not according to God, but contrary to him; and by these seve∣ral Fruits proceeding through the Creature, do we know every Creature, and so judge of him to be the Child of God, or the Child of the Devil in the election, or in the reprobation; for through whom the Fruits of the Seed of God doth spring forth, we know such are not of the De∣vil; and through whom the Fruits of the seed of the Serpent do spring forth, we know such are not of God. And these two Seeds are now striv∣ing in the Earth, the one against the other, and they in whom the Seed of God rules are persecuted by them in whom the seed of the Serpent rules; for they in whom the Seed of God rules are born of God, and of his Spirit; and they in whom the seed of the Serpent rules are born of flesh, and minds the things of the flesh, which shall not endure for e∣ver; and so every one that is born of the flesh, is of the seed of the Ser∣pent, or the seed of the Serpent rules in him; and every one that is born of the Seed of God, the Seed of God rules in him; such are persecuted for righteousness sake, by the seed of the Serpent, which is at enmity a∣gainst the Seed of God, which cannot fulfill the will of the Serpents seed, nor be subject to his laws; for the Seed of God cannot be subject to the Serpents seed in any thing, but is subject to God, and not to any thing that is contrary to him; but rather suffers imprisonment, and cruelties, and bonds, under the Serpents seed, than in the least to bow to it. So this is the ground of all persecution and enmity, which is betwixt the two seeds, which seeks the overthrow each of other, but who are of the Seed of God, knows that they are of God, and that the whole World lyes in wickedness; under the government of the seed of the Serpent; and such where he Seed of God is brought forth, hath the testimony in them∣selves that they are of God, and have believed in the Son of God who is the Light of the World, and knowes him to be the Foundation and the Rock of Ages, and the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against him, nor the enmity of the Serpents seed overcome him, nor they that are Builded on him; and this is a Testimony for the Seed of God, and against the seed of the Serpent in all the World, that it is persecuted of the seed of the Serpent, and spoken all manner of evil of by the World, according to the words of Christ, which are fullfilled upon us to our rejoycing, who are of the Seed of God, and to the trouble of all our Enemies, who are of the seed of the Serpent. And otherwise it cannot be, but that they who are born of the flesh must persecute them who are born of the Spirit; for because of the enmity that is placed between the two feeds,
the one cannot love the other, nor have fellowship the one with the other, and which of our Fore-Fathers the Prophets and Disciples of Christ, which were of the Seed of God, were not persecuted, hated, and re∣viled, and reproached by your fore-fathers, who were of the seed of the Serpent; and they, no more then you, could receive the Knowledge of God and his wayes, but ever despised the path thereof, and counted the Wisdom of God foolishnesse, and stood in the enmity against God and his people, and all their ways; and they that were of the seed of the Ser∣pent ever called truth error, and the way thereof heresie and blalphe∣mie. Ieremiah, Amos, and the rest, were called deceivers and mad-men, and seducers of the people, and evil was done unto them; Ieremiah was put in the stocks, and in the dungeons, by the Rulers of that Generation, who were of the seed of the Serpent; even the Prophets of God who were sent of God, and were witnesses of his Name in truth and righteousness, were accounted and called deceivers, and were persecuted by imprison∣ments, and some unto death, as you may read in the Scripture, Ieremiah 20. Amos 7. These with others, who were sent of the Lord, to bear testimony of God, and against the Rulers; who executed not true Justice and Judgment, but were oppressors of the poor, who judged for gifts and rewards, and a∣gainst the false Prophets and Priests that ran and had not been sent, who used their tongue, and said the Lord said, and the Lord had not spoken to them, who prophesied falsly, and preached for hire, and bare rule by their means, and made a prey upon the people; these were of the seed of the Serpent, and did persecute them that bore witness against them, that were of the Seed of God. The Word of the Lord was even a reproach unto Ieremiah daily, and they smote him with the tongue, and the chief Governour of the Lords house smote him, and put him in the Dungeon: And Amos, who had been no Prophet, nor the son of a Prophet, but a herdsman, he was persecuted by the Priest of Bethel, and was commanded not to Prophesie in the Kings Chappel; And Amaziah the Priest complained to Ieroboam the King against Amos the Prophet: And Ezekiel the Prophet could not be received of the people; for saith the Lord, they will not hear thee, for they will not hear me; and they were a rebelious house, and impudent, and hard-hearted, and would not receive the Prophets words: And thus it was in the time of the Apostles and Christ Jesus, they were persecuted, and some of them put to death for bearing testimony unto the Father, whom they were wit∣nesses of, and against the World; what Reproaches, Slanders, Beatings, Buffetings Scornings, Tumults, Uproars, and all manner of evil did they suffer in their Generation by the seed of the Serpent, from the hands of the Rulers, and Priests, and People; Christ was accounted a Deceiver, nd called a Devil, and a Blasphemer; and the Apostles were called Here∣icks, Deceivers, and pestilent fellows, movers of sedition, destroyers of he Law, and turners of the World upside down, and such like: All hese were of the Seed of God that were persecuted, and the Persecu∣ors were of the seed of the Serpent, which brought forth violence, and ickedness, and false judgement against the Innocent; and some were ost cruely put to death upon the false account of being Deceivers and Blas∣hemers. If you search through the whole Scripture, you may read how the Just ere persecuted, even from Abel, who was of the Seed of God, and all at ever were persecuted for righteousness. sake, were persecuted upon
the account of being Evil-doers, and the Persecutors judged themselves to be Righteous. He was the chief Governor of the House of the Lord, that persecuted Ieremiah, and the people that smote him with the tongue, said, They knew the Law should not perish from the Priest, nor Counsel from the Ho∣norable: And it was Amaziah the Kings Priests that persecuted Amos; and it was they that seemed to be religious that persecuted the Prophets; and it was the wise Scribes and Pharisees, and the chief Priests, that hand∣led the Law, and that offered Sacrifice, that persecuted Christ and the Apostles. How zealous were the Jewes in their Traditions and Observations, in their Sabboth-keeping, and in the Dayes of their Humiliation, in their Temple-worship, and in all the Commandments of God? They were zealous according to their own thoughts: yet were they of the seed of the Serpent, and persecuted the Seed of God in Blind-zeal, upon false Judgment; and the Persecutors had a Name to be Righteous, and the Persecuted were accounted Unrighteous; and so Darkness was put for Light, and Light for Darkness; and them that were Well-doers were account∣ed for Evil-doers, and them that were Evil-doers, were accounted for Righte∣ous. And such was the blindness of Rulers and people, such as prophesied falsly, and came in their own names were received, for the people loved to have it so when the great abomination was committed; but they that came in the Fathers Name could not be received, but were Persecuted; the Prophets, Christ, nor his Apostles could not be received of the World, but were persecuted in it, and Laws and Decrees were made against them, whereby they suffered unjustly, upon false grounds suspitions and jealousies, for that Way was called Heresie, in which the true God was wor∣shipped. Christ was called a Deceiver; and the wisdom of the World could not receive the knowledge of the things of God; and as it was then, so i it now in every particular, if any man hath an ear to hear he may hear, and a heart to understand, and he may perceive; for now is the Seed of God and the seed of the Serpent at enmity, striving one against the other, and the one persecutes the other in his Generation, as ever it was: we are persecuted upon the false account, and false judgement of being Evil-doers, and Deceivers, and our Persecuters accounts themselves Righteous, and zealous for Gods Wayes; and such as are false Prophets and Decei∣vers are accounted true Ministers of Christ, even them that preach for hire, and seek for their gain from their Quarter, and through covetous∣ness, by feigned words makes merchandise of souls; such were, and such are Deceivers, and were never sent of God; and yet such in this Genera∣tion are accounted Ministers of Christ, and such as are Ministers of Christ, who walk in the Doctrine of Christ, as they have received freely, so do they freely give, and seek not advantage to themselves, but are pre cuted and reviled for righteousness sake, such are accounted and fal judged Deceivers, and so true Judgment is turned backward; Good  called Evil, and Evil Good; Deceivers are called Ministers of Christ, and Ministers of Christ are called Deceivers; and thus people in this Generati∣on errs in judgment, and persecutes the Righteous, who are of the Seed  God. And it was ever the Ministers of Christ that were presecuted, and never any  them persecuted any, nor ever any of the Deceivers were persecuted for righte∣ousness sake; but they ever persecuted the Just and sought to the Rulers, and to the Elders of the people for violence to be done unto them that feared the
Lord, and witnessed against their wickedness; it was the Chief Priests and them that handled the Law, which caused Christ and the Apostles to be perse∣cuted. Amaziah sought to Ieroboam to have Amos persecuted, and as it was then, so it is now. How doth the Teachers of this Nation seek to the Magistrates to have the Innocent persecuted? and yet these man are zealous for their Performances and Duties in the set-Days of Humiliation and Lectures, and even they think they do God good service in imprisoning the Innocent, they have great zeal without knowledge, as the Jewes had, and they are strict in their Sabboth-keeping, in their Singing and Praying, &c. But yet is Violence done to the Just, and true Judgment and Justice neg∣lected; and therefore all that which they perform to God is abomination in his sight. Oh, what complaining is there, from the Teachers of this Nation to the Magistrates? What crying out for defence, shewing that they want the spi∣ritual Armour, and dare not trust the Lord? What plotting and con∣triving is there against the Seed of God, by the Seed of the Serpent, who ever was a Persecutor, and never was persecuted? What Lawes and Decrees are there brought forth against the Lords people, as Traps to ensnare their Feet, like as it was in the dayes of old, even like unto Artaxerxes the King, who made a Decree, and gave commandment, that the City of God should not be builded; and this was from the information and complaining of Rhehum the Chancellor and Shimshai the Scribe, who brought certain Accusations to the King against the people of God; and called the holy City, a rebellious and bad City, and that it was hurtful unto Kings, and in danger to endamage the Revenue of Kings. Here was a Conspiracy by the Scribes and such as handled the Law, with the King against the people of God; and thus is it also now: he that hath but an eye to see may see; How many Petitions have they put to the Rulers against the people of God? What grieveous and false Accusati∣ons have they laid to the charge of the Innocent, saying they be Popish∣ly affected, and disobedient to Government: so that the seed of the Serpent ever doth hatch evil against the Seed of God, to destroy it from off the face of the Earth; and it was the Wise, and the Learned, and the Rulers, whom the Devil made use of to persecute the Righteous: it was such as Rhehum the Chancellor, and Shimshai the Scribe, and Pashur the chief Governor in the House of the Lord, and it was such as the chief Priests and Elders of the people, and the Wise-men of this World; such as these it was that persecuted the Righteous; and so it is now, Orthodox men (so called) and Justices of Peace, &c. whom the Devil makes use of, to persecute the Innocent, against whom no occasion can be found but concerning the Law of their God, as it was with Daniel, as you may read, in the sixth Chapter of Daniel, and the fifth and sixth Verses, against him they could find no occasion that they might presecute him, but concerning the Law of his God; and it was the President and Princes, and Counsellors, and the Governors which consulted together against Daniel, who was the Servant of God. And as it was then, so it is also now in this our Generation, they can find no occasion against us (the people of God) either by our Doctrine or Con∣versation, but onely concerning the Law and Worship of our God; for there is a Law made against the Law of Christ, and all that will not sware contrary to the Law of Christ, must be counted Evil-doers and Popish Recusants; and punished, and this is not for any Evil in us, but because we cannot transgress the righteous Law of our God; and also another Decree, which takes hold upon them that travell to worship God on the first day
of the week, whereby the Innocent doth suffer, and are like to suffer; and not for Evil-doing is any occasion against us, but because we will not stay from the Worship of our God, but are made to travel, that we may meet together to Worship him; with such other Decrees, which sheweth un∣to all men that they seek occasion against us concerning the Law of God, not having occasion by doctrine, or conversation, or any other thing; so for righteousness sake are we persecuted, and not for evil-doing; some are persecuted, because for Conscience-sake they cannot stay at their own houses, but are moved by the Lord to declare the Name of the Lord abroad in the Nation; many by a decree are taken and punished, as for vagabonds, and this is an occasion concerning the Law of our God; and Christ was persecuted, and put to death by an unrighteous Decree; for they had an (unrighteous) Law, as they said, and by it he ought to dye; and unrighteous laws and decrees were made against the Apostles, whereby they were commanded to depart out of their Towns, and to preach no more in the Name of Jesus, and by such decrees were the A∣postles persecuted. So that this may shew unto all, that our fore-fathers who were of the Seed of God, some were persecuted unto death by un∣righteous decrees and statutes, and as it was then, so it is now, he that hath an eye to see may see: the same as ever was is come to pass in the Earth, the seed of the Serpent striving against the Seed of God and perse∣cuting it where it is brought forth, by unrighteous decrees: how did the late Bishops of England persecute the harmless? What Laws and Ordinances were then brought forth, whereby violence was done against such as fear∣ed the Lord, and then was the seed of the Serpent striving against the Seed of God. And this is given forth to shew unto all the World the cause of per∣secution in its first ground, (to wit) the irrecoverable enmity which is betwixt the two Seeds, the one continually hating and persecuting the other, and seeking the overthrow each of other, and the enmity be∣twixt the two Seeds, is the cause of strife, the one being Innocent, and the other unrighteous; so it is not for the persons sake, or any other thing that the Just are persecuted; but it is because of the Seed of God, which cannot bow, nor worship the seed of the Serpent, that is the first cause of persecution. Again, all may see what unrighteous Laws and Decrees were and are brought forth to persecute the Innocent, whereby they have suffered in all Generations for Righteousness sake, and not for Evil-doing; also it may be seen, that it was the Wise, the Learned, the Presidents and Chancel∣lors, and chief Priests, and Scribes, who were and are the very active persons, by whom the Seed of God is persecuted, and even such as were and are zealous in their Observances, and Sabboth-keeping, and such like; it was not the Poor, nor the Foolish only which the Devil made use of to do his work; but it was the Wise, and the Learned, and the Chief in Authority, and such like; it was such in whom the seed of the Serpent ruled, who were the active men against the Servants of God. Also it was through the evil Counsel of such as were Teachers, and Scribes, and Handlers of the Law; and it was through the false Accu∣sations of the chief Priests unto the Governors and Elders of the People, and so it is now at this day, as I have proved; and also the Righteous were persecuted upon the false Judgment of others, and they were falsly adjudged to be Deceivers, and Blasphemers, and Evil-doers; and upon this account were they persecuted, and as being falsly reputed to be destru∣ctive to Government, and Revenue of Kings, and upon such like; and
that they made void the Law of God, and were Movers of Sedition; and upon such accounts as these, was the Seed of God persecuted, as it it at this day; and all men that read this with moderation may come to the good Un∣destanding, upon what account, and by what Instruments, and by what means the seed of the Serpent hath persecuted the Seed of God, even from Cain unto this day. And this is to go abroad into this Nation, and into the World; and it is given forth from the Suffering-Seed of God, to clear it self in the sight of all men, that not for Evil, but for Good are these Sufferings laid upon it. But behold the Lord heearth and regardeth the Cry of the Poor, and of the unjust Sufferer, and he will remember his Mercy, and his Covenant with his own Seed; and when it passes through the Fire, he is with it, and thought it be afflicted, it cannot be forsaken; though the Lord hide his Face from his people, and suffers most grievous things to be done against them, by the wicked; yet it is but to try them, and to prove them, that they may be found faithfull to him, and the Seed of God shall reign in the Earth; and the seed of the Serpent, and his head shall be bruised, and is bruised already; and it bruis∣eth its heel by following after with persecution and cruelty; but the Seed of God shall arise, and is arisen, and praiseth the Living God for evermore. It plainly appears that the Suffering of the people of God in this Age, is a greater Suffering and more Unjust, than in the dayes of Christ, or of the Apostles, or in any time since: Queen Maries dayes brought not forth a Suffering more cruel, and in many respects, as doth appear; First, What was done to Christ and the Apostles, was chiefly done by a Law; and in a great part by the due execution of a Law; and also the Martyrs in Queen Maries dayes, had more just Ex∣amination, and a more Just Prosecution in Law, than the people of God have now; for now it is a matter of Conscience among some of the Magistrates in England to cast men into Prison, and confine them, and to cause their Goods to be spoiled, without any Law, or the due execution of a Law; which is utterly contrary to the Charters of Eng∣land, and hereby it appearts the Suffering to be more Unjust, because what the Persecutors of old did to the People of God, they did by a Law, and by the due execution of a Law; but now many are caused to suffer deeply; whom the transgression of no Law, good or bad, can be charged against; and others suffer without the due execution of a Law. Again, herein it doth appear to exceed the Suffering of the Saints in former Age, in that many suffer now cruel things about trivial foolish matters; as for not putting off a Hat, or for Theeing men; and for deny∣ing the foolish circumstance of Swearing; and we do not read that the worst of Tyrants in the Apostles dayes, or before or since, ever cau∣sed any to suffer for such things as these, or ever questioned any upon any such small accounts; for hundreds have suffered upon suspition, when nothing at all can be charged against them; and this is contrary to Magna-Carta: And in many other respects which might be named, this suffering is greater than hath been in any Age; for many have suffered in this Common-wealth, which have been faithful, and hazarded all in time of war, for the good of the Common-wealth; and many of them suffer by them, who have been Enemies, and in Arms against the Common-wealth; and herein the suffering appears more intollerable. But doth the Magistrate think to come to account for these things? Yea, the Lord is Just, and his Way
is Righteous; What flesh could but be provoked hereby? But the Saints are changed in nature, and are to fullfill the Will of the Lord by Suf∣fering: the Cruelty of men is become exceeding great against the Lord, and his people. Again, hereby the Persecution in this Age appears more to exceed former Ages, because Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Religion, was never so much promised and professed, as in this Nation at this day; and yet for the exercise of a pure Conscience many are wofull Sufferers, even by such who in words profess Liberty of Conscience themselves; and yet perse∣cutes the exercise of it in others, even for not putting off a Hat, or the like, to them; these with many other things, may aggravate the hainousness of the sin of persecution to be great, and more unjust than in-former Ages. Alas, how is the Sword of Iustice turned backward, and the Innocent smitten and per∣secuted, and that for Righteousness sake, and not for Evil-doing. By a Friend to the Suffering Seed of God, EDWARD BURROUGH.
Truth (the Strongest of all) Witnessed forth in the Spirit of Truth, against all Deceit. And pleading in Righteousness its own Cause, to the under∣standing of the Simple, against a very great number of Lyes, Slanders, Perverting of the Scriptures, Contradicti∣ons, and false Damnable Doctrines, held forth by the INDEPENDANTS. And is a Reply to Iohn Bunion's second Book, called, A Vin∣dication, &c. Wherein what was wanting in his former of fulfilling wickedness is now appeared; by his adding sin unto sin, against God and against his own soul. Reader, THOU hast here a very great number of About a 100 or more as may be proved in∣particular need requie. Lyes and Slanders, and Unjust-deal∣ings and False-doctrines, &c. Laid open and reproved in plainness, and not in hy∣pocrisie; and of contention there is not suddenly an end, being begun; therefore seeing the unbelieving heart of Iohn Bunion cannot believe me, when I speak the truth in justness, nor may I believe his Lies and Slanders, uttered in hypocrisie; what is laid down is left to thee, soberly to judge of betwixt us, while we are both silent: And this know, the one is a De∣ceiver; and the other is as a Deceiver, yet true; and thus mayst thou weight things equally. First, considering of many Lyes and Slanders truly charged upon him in my first, of which he is guilty from his first, and he hath not at all cleared himself of them in his second, which an honest man ought to have done, before he had gone further; for I soberly desired witness of what he said: But be hath added to the number of his wickedness, and not pro∣ved justly what he hath said against us: And it is not for his sake, for little thoughts I have of his conversion, but th ther that he will be hardned; nor for may own sake, as if I were unsatisfied concernim, that this is written; but to undeceive the simple of what his wickedness may falsly suggest into the mind, as if all were truth that he spoke, if his wick∣edness were not reproved. Again, Consider that I have cleared the Truth of my words which he hath wrested, and thereby taken occasion against the Truth, by answering his own conceptions, and not my plain words; so my words (which are words of Truth) being defended, all his Reply is made void: So I have not so much desired to answer every particular of his words, as to vindicate my own words, and the Truth from his false Slanders and Accusations. O HOW hath Satan filled the hearts of men, in this Generation (as well as in former Ages) with Envy against the Truth, and with Wrath against the Way thereof; and how hath he filled them with Craft, and deceitfull Subtilty, to offend the Way of the Lord, in all manner
of Persecuting, and Evil-speaking against it openly, and also in secret Gain-saying, in Hypocrisie; and how are men armed to defend themselves in their naughtiness, lying hid under the Vail of fair Speeches, and fine Arguments, using the Scripture in the words of mans wisdom, to oppose the Power and Life of Righteousness; even as the Scribes and Pharisees of old, how zealous were they in their Observances, and in fullfilling the Commands and Traditions of their Fathers, having set themselves in Moses Seat, professing Moses, and the Prophets words, and yet persecuted Christ the Life and Substance of Moses, and the Prophets? And as it was then, so is it now; how are Christs words, and the Apostles professed and preached by such who are Enemies to the Life of Christ made manifest in mortall flesh, and secretly opposing the doctrine of the Apostles? who said, Know ye not, that Christ is within you, except you be Reprobates. But the mighty Day of the Lord is come, and coming, wherein all hearts are made manifest, and the secrets thereof discovered; and the light is springing out of darkness, and the Sun is breaking thorow the Clouds to give light to all men and Nations, and the great Whore which hath decked her self in divers colours to deceive, shall be made naked and bare; and the day of great striving is come, and now every man stands up for his Interest, to defend his Possession, for the just Judge standeth at the Door, to enquire by what Law every man holds his Inheritance; and he findeth many holding their Religion; and Pro∣fession, by the Traditions of men only, and not by the Revelation of Christ Jesus in them; and such he will dispossess, though they strive against him, yet all is in vain, and though they plead Antiquity, yet that will not prevail; and in that the day of great striving is come, betwixt the Lamb and his Followers, the Draggon and his Followers; every one of that Party appearing with such weapons as the Devil hath armed them withal; and with such Armour as the wicked hath, they come, appearing under divers colours to fight against Zio, yet under one Head, and Prince of Darkness, and unto one Purpose, ev that the Seed of Iacob may be rooted out, and that the Way of Truth may  prosper, that then the Wicked may go on in their wickedness, without reproof, and ungodliness may be hid under hypocrisie; and above all other means, that is used at this day, to keep up the Kingdom of the Devil, and to offend the Kingdom of Christ; this is Cheif, striving against the Light of the World, opposing it, and denying it, and by crafty Arguments, and cunning Speeches, seeking sutable Scriptures, (as they suppose) to ground their false Argument upon, against this very thing, that the Light of Christ is given to every man that comes into the World, or that the Light which convinceth and reproveth every man of sin within him, is not the Light of Christ, nor worthy to be ta∣ken notice of, but natural and such like, and no way sufficient to Life and Sal∣vation; if the Unjust men persecute, it is such as walk in the Light of Christ Jesus, that cannot fulfill the wills and customs of mn, and so are not of th World, but contrary to it in all its wayes and work ich are evil; and if t wise men of the World make any Arguments, it is against the Light, wi which Christ lightneth every man that comes into the World; so that all  envy of the Devil, whether under this or that colour and appearance, is again the Light of Christ Jesus, and them that walk therein; and if the light be  denyed, and not believed in, nor regarded, then may the Devil have wh Possession of the heart of man; and if the Light of Christ Jesus within,  owned and loved, and walked in, then Christ is received, and there the D is dispossessed; and therefore it stands him upon, above all other things,  possess people against the Light within, which Christ hath given, that then  may not be discovered in the heart; but may keep all his goods in peace, a have quiet possession in his Habitation? Well, be it so, though all men of th Kingdom doth gainsay the Light of Christ, by this or that way of wickedness, yet it is precious unto us, and I cannot but earnestly contend for it, against  Gainsayers, and yet strives not for mastery to our selves, nor to exalt any thing
of our selves, but only the Lord and his truth, which he hath made more dear to us, then either life, or name, or liberty; and though so it be, that this Way be spoken evil against every-where, yet the Lord owneth it, and us who are faithful therein in the presence of our Enemies; to the confounding of the wis∣dom of this World. And whereas Iohn Bunion hath formerly set himself divers wayes to oppose the Truth under the account of his great zeal against Error; but especially in a Book sometime since put forth by him, thinking thereby to of∣fend the Way of Righteousness; and now a second time hath appeared, with a de∣fence upon his former, called A Vindication, &c. Of the former and his Defence, is more to the laying open his folly, and to the uncovering of his blindness and wickedness, then his first offence given by him, which caused me to write in short four sheets of paper, to clear the Truth from what he had spoken against it. And now having again a second time appeared in many word, without know∣ledge, yet in great zeal, hath brought forth many things reprovable, even Lyes and Slanders, and evil Speeches in abundance, yet with great pretence of holiness, and soberness; and he hath not only belyed me, but the Truth which is my chief, and moving cause, (that the Truth may be clear) of this my second Reply unto him; and not for my own sake in any thing; for I more prize to be accounted a fool, and dispraised in the World, then to be honoured thereby; and when iniquity shall come to an end, and transgression shall be finished, his shall be the Kingdom and the Inheritance of Rest Eternal, that hath kept him∣self clean and pure, from a lying and slanderous tongue, and who hath done righteously and fullfilled the Will of God, For it is not every one that saith Lord, Lord, that enter into the Kingdom, but he that doth the will of the Father which is in Heaven; and in that day when the Book of all Consciences shall be opened, and every thing brought to Judgement, then shall the Light in every ones Consci∣ence answer the Lord in the justness of his dealings; and even then (if not be∣fore) shall this Iohn Bunion know the Light in all mens Consciences is of force, when he shall be judged and then shall he see, he hath wronged the Lord, and dealt evil against his own soul, in speaking evil of what he hath not known, and in giving false judgement of what he hath not understood; and till that day I leave him (without praying for fire to devour him) only may reprove his Lyes Errors, Contradictions and False-dealing, and clear the Truth from his false Charges, and only to the most chiefest things whereof he accuses us, in short I may Reply. And whereas thou sayst, There is one that hath ventured to stand up against the Truth, and hath published a Book in which there is a great number of Heresies cunningly vented by him, and also many things there falsly Reported of thee, To which I answer, that same Book published, called, The true faith of the Gospel contended for, &c. Shall clear it self from this reproach, that I have not stood against any one truth, or uttered any Heresie or lye against thee; Several Lies and Slanders were proved against him in that Book, which he cannot clear himself of; mark that. but in that Book did witness forth the Truth against many things falsly laid down by thee against the Quakers, and that same Book with soberness read (without partiality and prejudice) doth clear it self from these false Aspersions, and prove thee a Lyer herein, and I leave it to the honest hearted to judge, who reads that Book, while I with pati∣ence, and not seeking any revenge, do bear thy reproaches, counting them great∣er riches then thy praise. And Farther thou saist, Only by the way thou thinkest good to mind me of my cloathing my self with the words of the Prophets and Apostles, &c. Answ. True enough, by the Way, out of the Truth, and out of Christ, who is the Way, hast thou spoken this, and so hast uttered in falsehood, and by, or out of the Way; neither have I cloathed my self, and yet am I clothed with the Life of the Prophets and Apostles, and not only with their words; nor do I fight against them (though thou falsly sayst it) but bears witness unto them, in Doctrine and Conversation, and before all the seed of Evil-doers; and take
back thy own words to thy self, who art in that Generation, which hath the words, but are without the Lying per∣verting Scripture is an evil life; Life, in the evil life. Farther thou sayst, I have broken out with a false Testimony of Iohn Burton, and thee, at which thou seemest to be much offended, that I should say thou art joyned with the broken Army of Magog, and hath shewed your selves in the defence of the Drag∣on, against the Lamb, &c. Reply, what needest thou be troubied at this, have I not spoken the truth, and have I not said well herein? for you are joyned with all the wicked in the Na∣tion, and as Lyars and Swearers and Drunkards, persecutes with violence; and as the proud and wanton are filled with scorning and singing wicked rimes in the streets, even so also are you come in Print, and all of you against them cal∣led Quakers; the Drunkards and Swearers they beat them, and abuse them, and cast them as for dead into Ditches, with stoning in the high wayes, and in the streets beating down with Staves; and the wanton they sing there rimes in scorn in Ale-houses, and Taverns against them; and thou and thy Fellowes and Gene∣ration appears in open Print, slandering and reviling them (yet in pretence of zeal for God) and all this you do against us, who have the witness that we are of God, and that the whole World Lyes in wickedness, and now are not you all joyned as an Army, and do you not shew your selves in the defence of the Drag∣gon; Lyers and Slanderers is of the Dra∣gons party; what wrong I have done you, let the upright in heart judge, whether I have given false testimony against you or no; and though you have noted it for a Lye in the Margent, yet the Lye is thy own, who hath gain-said the Truth herein, and called it a Lye; and I have dealt justly with thee, in the sight of God, and all that know him, and when the Book of thy Conscience is opened, thou shalt also confess to this thing, when thou standest condemned with them, with whom thou art now joyned against us; who have the testimony that we are of God, and worshippers of the Father in the Spirit and Truth, and my words were spoken by the Spirit of the Lord, and that in thy Conscience shall witness them, in the day of the Lord, though now thou opprobriously sayst, I said that desolate Zion is com∣passed about with enemies to make her a destructi∣on, &c. These are some of the words which he sayes flung into the wind. they are flung into the wind. And whereas thou seemest to be greatly offend∣ed, that I should say part of the first Book is a Corrupted grain of Babylons treasure, &c. But have not I spoken the Truth herein also, when I say, I have numbered  part of your work, and this is the sum thereof, that part which I have numbered, viz. your Lyes and false Reproaches against the Quakers, is a corrupted grain; yea, and of Babylons treasure too. I am not ashamed of my words, though thou wouldst defend your work by saying, Your discourse was of the Birth, Righteousness, Death, Blood, &c. And of the second coming of the Son of Mary, &c. To which I say, these things, and the knowledge of them, by the Spirit of God, is not counted by me Corrupted, nor of Babylon, though now I answer, as in my last; the words I own, but thy voice I deny, and knows it to be the voice of the stranger; and for this saying, have I not, nor never shall have any burthen upon my Conscience, (though thou wouldst say it) but 'tis cleared in the sight of God, even though I say all that thou speakest I deny, or thy speaking of any thing of the Kingdom of God, with thy lying spirit. And whereas thou art offended, that I should say you are described to be the Flock of Ishmael, and of the seed of Cain, whose line reacheth to the murdering Priests, &c. And thou sayst, I am very sensorious, and utterest many word without know∣ledge, &c. Reply, Yea, your words doth describe your nature, for by your voice I know you, to be none of Christs sheep, and accordingly I judge, in just judge∣ment, and in true knowledge, and doth not falsly sensure, nor utter words voi of knowledge, and my words shall be witnessed by you in the day of the Lord:
Envy is of Cains nature and seed, and in that you are; and Lyars are of Ishmaels stock, and you are guilty of that, let the sober Reader try; and you are among the murdering Priests party, and close joyned to them, in Doctrine and practise, especially in writing against us. Now no wrong have I done you, that thou needest to be troubled, and seek to cover your selves by thy fair words in thy answer, as if you were righteous; but all will not hide you, your works make you manifest to be no less then what I have said of you. Then farther thou art hot against me, in that I say, you are found Enemies to Christ, revealed in his Saints, and this thou hast noted it in the Margent for false, but thou dost not well to be angry; it is true, what I have spoken, thy own words do prove it, in saying there was nothing in thee, to be taken no∣tice of; this was a denying of Christ within, and such as deny him are found Enemies to him within; So the Lye is thy own, who hast denyed Truth, let the wise Reader judge, and thy many words in a pretending Answer will not cover you from the guilt of what I have charged upon you, and not falsly; and what I have said hitherto is true, and not false, though thou feigningly say, Thou marvels I should be so overseen, as to utter so many false things in so little a space; nay, my understanding was open, when I wrot forth that Book, at which thou art so tormented, that it hath caused thee some Moneths travel in anguish to clear thy self, and yet cannot be at rest; and thou art over-seen who resists the reproof of thy Wickedness. Then thou goest about to justifie thy Brother Burtons words, who wickedly laid it down, as thou impudently goest to justifie it, who joyned in his Accu∣sation, and slanders Quakers with Ranters; and this wouldst thou justifie we are one, against my just Answer, which denied them in the fourth page of my first; where I said, Between Quakers and Ranters there is no more union, &c. then betwixt Light and Darkness, Good and Evil; and that Answer stands un∣touched by thee, and is true; and in justifying Iohn Burtons wicked Slander, thou art more wicked in comparing the Principles, and sayst, it will appear they agree in one, &c. Viz. That the Quakers deny Christ to be a real Man: Secondly, that they fancy him to be God, manifest in their flesh: Thirdly, that they make his humane nature with the fulness of the Godhead, to be but a type of God: these thing were charged upon us. But what a wicked course hast thou taken to clear him, by adding thy own wickedness; let all consider that reads: for doe not I desire in plainness in my first, in these words; if thou darest lay the Charge only upon the Quakers, write in plainness, and bring testimony of thy Accusation, and thou mayst receive a farther answer, but not a word in plain answer to this is returned, though soberly desired, neither time, nor place, nor witnesses evidenced to clear your selves of your first Slanders, which had been more honest, then to have slandered afresh, passing over your first; but it seems you cannot clear your selves in honesty, and so fulfill your wickedness by adding to your Lyes and Slanders, as thou impudently dost in thy comparing the principles of the Ranters with the Quakers. And to save thy brother from shame and guilt, thou art fallen thy self into the Snare, and justly may be judged, to exceed him in Wickedness; and thou sayst, (with shame to thy self, I repeat it) that the This is a lye; Quakers will not own Christ without them, but thou brings not testimony of this Assertion; till then art thou reckoned, and shall be plauged for a Lyer, which will be forever, for we own him as he is ascended far above all Heavens, who fills all things; yea, and with∣out us too: So that instead of proving the first false Accusation, thou adds ano∣ther Slander, and the That the Ranters and Quak∣ers deny all teaching but the teaching within; and yet con∣demnes principle by practice. second thing wherein thou comparest them, is unsound; for though we witness, (yea thousands) that we need no man to teach us, as the Saints did 1 Iohn, yet we cry not down the Ministry of God, but owns,
it, and cryes down such by whom people cannot come to the Knowledge of the Truth, though they be ever learning; who Preach for Hire, and goes for Gifts, and Rewards & loves the Wages of Unrightousness; & this was the Apostles Doctrine as it was ours, and is no Heresie (though thou mayst so judge it) for we say by the same Spirit as the Apostles did, they that are of God heareth us who are in the Truth, which is but one, and there is not another; and the Apostles which witnessed, Saints needed no man to teach them, did exhort them; and yet did not condemn principles by practice. Then thou goest on, and sayst, The Ranters are not for Baptism, and Breaking if Bread; and are not the Quakers the same? But what doth this prove; and thou sayst, the Ranters are they that would profess themselves without sin; and how far short of  Opinion are the Quakers? and the Ranters would not own the Resurrection, &c. And how say you, Do you believe the very Bodies shall rise, &c. Reply, Friend, this is far short of proving these things upon us, by querying them to us, let the Reader consider: But it may be impudency hath not so wholy eaten out honesty in thee, as that thou darest charge us wholy with these things, but would intrude into us be thy Questions, as though the thing were so indeed, but thou mayst by ashamed of thy work: Is this sufficient proof of evil against us, to ask us whether it be so? what hast thou proved in all this against us (if we were guilty) thinkest thou we will accuse our selves? this is absurdity, and wickedness in thee, falsly to charge us, and to bring no better evidence, but thy bare words; and as we deny the Ranters, so do we thee, and sees you both to be Enemies to the Life of God: But thy last and chie proof (as thou thinkest) that we are one, is, that the Ranters are Sinners, and the Quakers are Lyers; the first I wil not vindicate, but this last) is disputable, and thy proof of it is first, tho sayst, from what thou hast said already, to some pages of my first Book, to which I  Replyed, and leaves it to the Reader; only doth say, thou hast not yet proved one Lye against me in the sight of God nor men; thou art the Lyer if thou say th hast, and honest men shall be judge betwixt us: And thy second proof is mo to the discovering thy ignorance then yet hath been: And to clear thy self from my In my first Book. charge against thee (viz) to be a wrester of the Scripture, which yet I stand to, thou art fain into grievous error: my first charge is true upon thee,  thou perverted or wrested that Scripture; Rev. 13. 18. in saying the Lamb was  before the Foundation of the World; for that Scripture saith since, or from  Foundation of the World; hast thou no more sence? art thou and all thy compa so ignorant that you know not betwixt before and since a time? how are you blinded? and yet persists in your wickedness, and will not be reproved; therefore this is a double iniquity in thee, to thy shame remember it; for I have said true, though thou understand it not, in my first Book I said, there is as much difference, betwixt before, and since, in that thing, as betwixt a Lye and Truth; for to say the blood was shed before the Foundation of the World, as thou didst, is a very Lye; but to say i was shed since, or from, is truth, and that Scripture is truth, Rev. 13. And thou art the Lyar, and Wrester of it, and I have not wronged thee in my first, though thou impudently and ignorantly wouldst clear thy self, and lay iniquity upon me: But further to clear thy self, thou sayst, thou said, in Gods ac∣count it was shed, before the World was: and this is little less then Blasphemy, what, is God a Hypocrite, like thy self? to account that for Truth, which is a Lye, as I have proved; O horrid error and perfect blindness! but this will not cover thee, nor thy shame, from the eye of men; where is thy Proof for such a Doct∣rine, that God accounts that which is a Lye, for Truth? largely is manifest thy Read the Scriptutes and mark the sence; be∣txist be∣fore, and from. folly; Repent, if thy heart be not void of shame, for what thou hast spoken he in; and let the Reader understand this difference; thou sayst the Blood of Christ, was shed before the Foundation of the World, according to that Scripture, Rev. 13. I say thou perverts the Scripture, and lyest grosly in the main thing it self; and saith it is* since, or from the Foundation of the World; let the honest judge; and now it is seen the Lye rests upon thy own Head, who wrests the
Scripture; and belyes the Lord, and me, and goes on in thy wickedness after re∣proof, and take thou the Ranters, they are thy Companinons, in lying, and sinning, and not ours. And further thou art offended that I should say, and would fain reckon it for a Lye, that all thy work is a secret smiteing, and an obscure shooting against the manifestation of Christ within, which words I own to be truth concerning thee, and am not ashamed of them, though thou say, I say falsly, and when the Book of thy Conscience is opened, thou shalt confess it; only I leave viz. that which you said; there was nothing in any men to be taken notice of; this is a deny∣ing of him within. this to be con∣sidered seriously, and judged by them who are spiritual, and they shall be my Witnesses; and the Lye is of thee and thy Father, whose wickedness is sufficiently seen by what is said, if I should say no more: Again thou sayst it is an untruth of thee, to say thou art one of those that do preach for Hire, through Covetousness making merchandize of Souls; my words are not so laid down, thou hast wrested them for thy purpose, though it availes nothing: but I said, thou art in their steps, that through covetousness, with fained words, makes merchandize of Souls, and thou art found among them that preaches for Hire; and I have spoken the truth herein, let the Light in all Consciences judge, who are not feared in many things; I might instance that thou art in their steps, and among them that act such things, as further may be proved, and the wisdom of God so fore-saw, to keep me clear, and my words to be defended; though I expected no less from thee, as to this thing, then is come to pass, but the Lye is of thy self, who would deny the the truth is he is in their steps, and among them. Truth: The next thing that thou wilt charge upon to be a Lye, I pass here, the Reader may expect it in its place; and though thou sayst, the Rantors and I, and my Fellows are of the same mind in many things, &c. To which I Reply, Their practices I deny, and the ground in which they stand, and their false doctrines; yet dare we not deny any truth as it is in Christ; though they, as thou mayst, profess it in words, which is seldom they do, for we have respect unto the Truth, for the truths sake only; but how uncharitable art thou in thy measure and judgement, consider, as if he should say, Iohn Bunion is of the same mind with the Pope in many things; the Pope holds Christ was born of Mary, and was crucified, and raised again, and ascended, &c. And this holds I. Bunion, and is of the same minde with the Pope in many things; and therefore must partake of the same plagues with the Pope, as thou said of us; though thou hast by unequal measure thus judged us, yet I render not evil for evil, but in love to thy soul, shews thee thy folly and weakness. Then thou goest on having viz. that the Quakers undervalues the Lord Ie∣sus, and doth not lay him for their foundation. passed by the two slanders cast upon us, by I. Burton, in your first Book, which I charged you withall in mine, to which not one word as to evidence your slanders, but hath slippen it over, as a foul guilty man, which charge stands upon you both; that you are Slanderers herein, and my first answer I am not ashamed of, though you snarle much about it, and would taint it, or under∣mine it: but thy subtilty is to weak, Truth confounds thee and thy simple policy, which is, that we prize the Lord Jesus Christ, God man, to be precious unto us, and hath owned him alone to be the Foundation whom God hath laid, and in his Light we are saved, &c. As I said in Page 7. against which words thou canst not justly except, nor yet prove the contrary; and yet as a man that loves to hear thy own tongue, thou lays down many things impertinent as to the cause in hand. But it had been more honest to have helped thy brother Burton, from under my true Charge, and cleared the Truth, if thou hadst been able; but thou hast left im in the dirt under the Charge of a Slanderer; and are unfaithfull to him, nd goes about to inquire what it is (as thou sayst) to lay Christ for a Foundati∣on; thou confesses what I have said is fairly spoken, and yet thy envious minde, nd unbelieving heart seems to be offended at my words; and to them that
can believe I speak plainly, and doth not beg thy belief, nor any mans, but com∣mends my self to every mans Conscience in the sight of God, and knows no other Jesus the Saviour, nor Foundation, then he that Iohn was sent to prepare the Way before, who was, and is, and is to come; who said, I am the light of the World, and now my words are defended to be truth in the sight of them that are spiritual; and thou, and such may hear, but must not understand, who have hardened your hearts, least you should believe, and therefore is given up to Gainsayings, till the Wrath of God break out against you; and let Iohn Burton remember my words, where I said he is fallen into the pit which he digged for another, and he undervalues the Lord Jesus, whose Doctrine is to speak Truth, but he hath lyed and slandered, and so is out of Christ the Foundation, and undervalues him, who keeps not his sayings, but is a Worker in Darkness, and not in the Light: And as to that where I say, thus much is the mind of the Penmans spirit, (of the first Epistle, of the first Book) secretly smiting at the Doctrine of true Faith and Salvation (to wit) Christ within, I have said the truth in righte∣ousness, and do own my words, though thou sayst I have done him a great deal of wrong, &c. But I leave it to be judged by them that are spiritual, and not unto thee, to give false meaning of my words; and doth not he say in that Epistle of some that have been depending too much upon some thing they call Christ, and the Righteousness of Christ within them, &c. Let the wise in heart judge, whether this be not as I said, even a secret smiting against Christ within, without which as I have said, there can be no Salvati∣on, for he that hath not Christ in him, is a Reprobate; and this I speak, not in opposition, but as a testimony of Christ Jesus, that dyed, and rose again, and ascended, who is within, and without also; and if any preach another Jesus, let him be accursed; and repent thou, who art in the wrong doing thy self, falsly charging me; noting in the Margent, with speaking falsly, when I spa the truth; and the false speaking rests at thy door, and is driven thither with the power of truth. Then whereas thou wouldst justifie thy former wickedness, in charging the Quakers to be Deceivers, against my just Answer The chil∣dren of God were ever counted De cenvers by this Genera∣tion, but the way which he called delusi∣on do we wor∣ship, the true God, &c. in page 8. of mine; whic stands free from any of thy vain Argument, and uncontroled; though resisted; but it appears my words sticks close unto thee, and torments thee; and thou sayd, with much confidence, it will easily be proved that we are Deceivers; but thy Ar∣guments we shall try. And (sayst thou) First, the Quakers deny the man Christ Jesus without them, and own Christ no otherways but as he is within, &c. Reply, How impudent art thou in forging Lye after Lye, and building them up in thy Work one upon another, and a wicked course thou takes to clear thy former Slanders, truly charged upon thee in my first, even by laying another upon it. Friend, By this thy deceitful Slander, while thou hast thought to prove us Deceivers hath proved thy self one, even a false Accuser; mayst thou not blush to say we own Christ no otherwayes, then as he is within? we own him which was, is, and is to come, who is within us, and without us, as I have said in my first, we own him as the Scripture speaks of him; and it is known  the Lord, and in his sight we are approved, whether thou believe it or not; f I beg not beleif of thee, but leaves thy double Slanders to be read, and judged of, by all honest people, and in the interim, know it is a bad way to prove us Decei∣vers by thy Lyes, this the rather is a Witness to us that we are of God, and against thee, and thou to be of the Devil, who was a Lyer from the beginning, and  his Child succeeds him; in lying. Thy second proof is, That we are Deceivers, because (sayst thou)  do perswade souls that Christ is crucified in them, dead within them, kept
with something within them, which was never taught by them that spoke the Scrip∣tures, &c. Reply, These words are falsly laid down, but what thinkest thou of such who might crucifie to themselves Or in them∣selves. afresh the Son of God, and put him to open shame, as it is written; this they could not do, above Stars, they being men upon the Earth; and Christ was sent to preach to the Spirits in Pri∣son, he that can read let him understand, this Doctrine was preached by them that spoke forth the Scriptures, who had the Spirit of God; but in blindness I find thee, and I think so I must leave thee: and though I do not feed the Serpent, yet my words are plain to him that hath an understanding, and an ear open; and Deceiver belongs to thee, and at thy door it lyes, and thou canst not remove it. Farther (thou sayst) We perswade souls that that man, that was born of the Virgin Ma∣ry, is not above the Clouds, and the Stars, when as the Scripture saith a Cloud received him out of their fight. Reply, This is another Lye, uttered without fear or knowledge, or honesty, we do not perswade souls to believe any such thing; but bears witness to the truth of that Scripture, that a Cloud received him out of their sight, and we say he is out of their sight and must appear again in sight; and this is a wicked way of thee, to prove us Deceivers, by slandering us, adding more to thy own sin, and the more will be thy burthen, in the day of the Lord, when Plagues and Tor∣ment are thy portion, from which thou shalt not flye, though now thou be above shame. Farther, (sayst thou) We perswade souls not to believe that that man that was crucified, and rose again, &c. Shall so come again to Iudgment, as he went away; and shall raise up men and women out of their Graves, and cause them to come into the Valley of Jehoshaphat; thou sayst we strive to beat souls off from believing this, &c. Reply, O how swiftly thy lying Tongue runs without fear, as though neither God nor man took notice of thee, or that ever thou shouldst be called to question for them; many Lyes together thou hast here foulded up in one; thy Lyes I deny, and this to be one; hast thou set thy self to tell Lyes! O abominable wick∣edness, mayst thou not tremble? when thou considers what thou falsly sayst of us, contrary to my words, who said in the truth of my heart, we own him to be what the Scripture speaks of him, and not otherwise? it seems thou cannot be∣lieve when I speak truth; I number up thy Lyes, and returns them back to thee to read; and by all this is it not true, that thou art of the same spirit with thy fellow, and abound more in Lyes? as I said in my first; his was but about three, thine manifold more; but thy Lyes are no testimony against us, that we are De∣ceivers, but they shall lie heavy upon thee at one day, when we shall be clear: For in the affirmive. I further say, that, that Christ Jesus that was crucified, and rose again, shall come (as he went away) to Judgement, and the dead shall be raised, and every man shall receive according to their deeds; and he shal set to judge the Heathen round about, according to Ioel 3. and thy portion in that day shall be Howling and Gnashing of Teeth; for the Lyars Portion is the Lake. Thou sayst again, the Quakers make no difference between that Light, where∣with Christ, as he is God hath enlightned all, and the Spirit of Christ he gives not to all. Reply, I put thee to prove that they are contrary or divided one against the other; for thus Christ saith, I will send you the Comforter even the Spirit of Truth, which must needs be the Spirit of Christ, and he shall reprove or con∣vince the World of sin, and of righteousness; now mark that same Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, who is the Comforter of the Saints is the same, and not another, that doth reprove the World; he that can read, let him understand,
the World cannot receive the Comforter, yet have they given to them, that which doth reprove them; which is with the Light of Christ Jesus, of the same, and not contrary, nor divided; if thou hast an ear, thou mayst hear; the Error is in thy self, who art without understanding. Further, thou sayst, That every one hath that which is like the Spirit of Christ, even as God, as the Spirit of Christ; which thou sayst is desperate blas∣sphemy, and cryes out with an out-cry, O wonderfull deceit! &c. Reply, I would have all to take notice, that thou hast wronged my words, in wresting of them for thy wicked purpose, to have a ground of slander; there is no such words in the tenth Page of my Book, which thou quotest, but in one place; I say, till thou prove the Light of Christ, Iohn 1. 9. (which thou confesses every man hath) to be contrary to the Spirit of Christ, (Mark) I shall say every man hath that which is one in union, and like the Spirit of Christ, even as good as the Spirit of Christ, according to its measure; these words I must own. But let the sober Reader take notice, how fouly thou hast wronged my words, Till he could prove the light, John 1. 9. to be contra∣ry to the Spi∣rit of Christ, when he proves this, I may shut my mouth. leaving out the strength of them, to take occasion of slander; whe thou hadst proved the Light of Christ (which in Iohn 1. 9. is spoken of) to be con∣trary to the Spirit of Christ, then had been a better season, for this charge against me. O thou impudent and shameless man! so uniustly to deal against the upright, who envies thee not, but pitties thee; therefore when thou, or any man can prove the Light of Christ spoken of Iohn 1. 9. and Iohn 8. 12. to be contrary to the Spirit of Christ, then I may own the Judgement and charge upon me; but till then thou art proved a Lyar; for the Light of Christ spoken of Iohn 1. 9. that Light is one in union, and not contrary, and is of the likeness of the Spirit of Christ, and as The Wit∣ness is as good as the Iudge; in measure. good in its measure; and these words I stand to, to vindicate against all thy Lyes, and wresting of words, and out-cryes, who is an unfit fellow to judge what Blasphemy is, who art so blind, that thou knowest not the difference of words, betwixt before, and from, as I have shewed: Repent, If so be thou may find mercy. Then further thou sayst, to cover my self, and deceit, I do apply, that which should be to the children of God, &c. And yet cannot reprehend my answer, which is just and faithful, that the Children of God were always counted Deceivers, and this is true, as thy self confesses, but wickedly saith in thy answer, and most lyingly too, and blasphemy is falen out of thy mouth; The Devil knowes how to take Childrens bread, and cast it to Doggs. Reply, Now let all consider what thou hast said, Christ Jesus is the Bread of Life that came down from Heaven, the Childrens Bread, and they have no other; Now the Devil cannot take Christ Jesus, who only is the Childrens Bread, and give him to Doggs; O horrid! canst thou behold this, and not be smitten to the heart, what wickedness and ignorance lodges in that heart that can utter these things; Though thou thinkst, thou hast done bravely i thus saying, yet the Wisedom of God turns thy words upon thy own head into confusion and grievous error, I deny it though thou affirm it; that the Devil can take, or knows how to take Christ Jesus, and give him to Doggs. Further thou sayst, I am grieved, that thou shouldest say none but a Company of Notionist and Ranters, &c. are carried with the Quakers, &c. and sayst thou, this appears in  mens sight, &c. Reply, Thou art a Lyar, I am not greived at thy Slanders and wicked Re∣proaches; but rather rejoyces therein, that I am one worthy to bear them; and all men that can see, sees thee a false Accuser herein: For such who have feared the Lord, and served him, and are, and have been honest and upright to God and man, have owned us, and have been neither Ranters, nor such like;
and we rejoyce, if any that hath been so, be turned from it unto God, to live in Righteousness, though thou note it for a false thing in the margent. (But to make it appear false thou hast corrupted my words) which are, Though some of all sorts of people be brought to God, yet thou The words seems to be are left out, by him, which cause the strength of my words. seems to be offended herewith; and these my words are true upon thy head, for I ask, notwithstanding some were such, are they such who are in wickedness since they owned us? then why dost thou wickedly (as though thou wert offended at it) up∣braid us, that such, or such are carried away with us, as though none else; which is thy Lye uttered in thy hastiness. And whereas thou art offended, (thou sayst) that I should say, thou are like the Pharisees; whether I spake so or no, however, I own that thou art like them (at least) even one among them. As further I shall manifest; then thou hast over-leapt (with a false excuse of passing by many railings as thou sayst) which it seems troubles thee that I should truly In my first Book. charge thee to bring sorth Lyes without fear; and that the Ranters and light Notionists, and thee we deny, till you turn to the Lord by repentance; and if you turn from your iniquity we dare not deny you. And further I truly charge thee, that thou art puft up in thy Lyes and Slanders, and advanceth thy self above the Innocent, who exceeds thee in Faith towards God, and in good works towards man, and whose conversation is in heaven, but thine is among the Hirelings, &c. And this thou hast skipped over, as a deceitful Child, with a poor excuse, which thou mayst be ashamed to call these railings; but that thy heart is void of shame, let the sober Reader judge else; then thou saist I stumble at that, wherein in thy first thou sayst, The Devil perswades these men to believe. First, That salvation was not compleatly wrought out for Sinners by the man Christ Iesus, &c. Reply, Here thou art a Lyar again; I stumble not, for I walk in the Light, and doth not stumble; but I reproved thy Lye, and Slander, and said, this Accusation is clearly false, wickedly cast upon us; for there is no Salvation in any other, neither is it wrought by any other, but by Jesus Christ, &c. As page the ninth of my first may be read; but thou hast not at all removed, the true charge against thee, that I charged upon thee, upon these words (viz) a Believer of Lyes, a Slanderer, a false Accuser, which stands true upon thee still, and will for ever, till thou remove it by repentance; for thou canst never clear thy self any otherways; and thou sayst, I have left some words out, but this is but a poor catch; for do I not make an Et caettera at the end of thy words? and if thou wert not too ignorant, thou mightest understand that which follows is in∣cluded and conjoyned. Then thou goest on, and sayst, I am offended that thou shouldst say the De∣vil deceives souls, by bidding them follow the Light that they brought into the World with them, telling them, that will lead into the Kingdom &c. Now my answer to this is sober, and just, Page 10. of my first. as will appear, though thou sayst vainly, I seem to be gravelled, because I informed thy mistake; who said, per∣vertingly, either in subtilty, or for want of wit, the light which they brought into the World with them; when as the Scripture saith, Christ is the Light which lighteth every man that comes into the World, Ioh. 1. 9. which Light, as I did, I do affirm, will lead into the Kingdom of peace and rest; and deny it if thou canst; for the Light of Christ, doth reveal Christ, and the Light lighteth every man that cometh into the World; then thou heaps up many words, though thou falsly sayst, I corrupt that Scripture Ioh. 8. yet I lay it down in its own words, and say, that is, or was the true Light, that lights every man that comes into the World, and that Light (which hath so done) will lead all that believes into the Kingdom, for Christ said I am the Light of the World; and though thou ignorantly wouldst seem to say this is error; yet I affirm it,
that the same which saith, I am the Light of the World, is he, and no other, which lighteth every man that comes into the World, and this I suppose thou wilt call a filthy error; but the filthiness is in thy own heart, and error too, through ignorance of the knowledge of the things of God, who wouldst fain (if thou could) make it appear, that that Christ which lighteth every man that comes into the World, Iohn 1. 9. is not the same that saith I am the Light of the World, Iohn 8. 12. Thy confused words seems to carry this meaning; let the Reader judge, whether that be not the same Christ Jesus, which Iohn speaks of; Iohn 1. 9. as it is written of Iohn 8. 12. and though thou ignorantly sayst I would have room to broach my folly, yet thou lets out of thy vessel in sides of leaves, of Lyes and Slanders and Folly; and thou sayst, when he said, I am the Light of the World, he was without, he did not mean any light within, and thou presumptuously bids me deny this if I can; to which I say, the same Christ, which said, I am the Light of the World, was he which was before Abraham, who was Light to the Gen∣tiles, and lighteth every man in the World; yea, he was and is given to be a Light, where his person (which was supposed the son of Ioseph) never came, and do thou deny this if thou canst, that all men may see thy Folly; for there is not many Christs, but one Christ, which is not only within, but without, not only without, but within, but is all and in all; let him that read understand. Then thou sayst, the Light wherewith Christ, as he is God, lighted every one, is the Soul of man, which is the Life of the Body, and is a Creature, and hath one faculty of its own Nature called Conscience. Reply, Now lets try this Doctrine, and consider what thou hast said, it amoun to thus much, that Conscience is of the nature of the Soul of man, and the soul is the Light of Christ, as God. Therefore thou hast said the Conscience is the Light of God which must needs be without sin; this is more then I have or dare say, I might here fitly ask thee, if thou knowst what the word Conscience signifies in true understand∣ing; and yet though thou hast uttered this, that Conscience is a Faculty of the soul, which thou sayst is the Light of Christ, as God, which Light of God must needs be of the nature of God pure, and not impure; yet in the next page thou sayst, Conscience is a poor Dunghill Creature in comparis of the Spirit, &c. and in another page calls Conscience poor, so empty beggerly things, &c. What now Iohn Bunion; is that which thou hast concluded to be the Light of God, but a dunghill-Creature, and low, and empty, and beggerly in compari∣son &c. For shame cease such Divinity, lest all thy Fellows reprove thee; O how doth thy ignorant zeal lead thee into Snares, and trape thy own feet. And to confound thy self, thou sayst, Conscience, which is the Light of God, is Nature it self; then it must needs be that every mans nature (which is sinful say I) it the Light of God; O what horrible Doctrine this proves in its explanation! Blush, and be ashamed when thou considers; then thou cries out in reproof▪ O wonderful, sayst thou, That men should make a God, and Christ of their Consci∣ences! I know none that doth it, nor that ever spoke so highly of Conscience,  thou hast here done; yet we say our Conscience bears us witness in the holy Ghost; and this is our rejoycing, the testimony of our Consciences;  if our Consciences condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God; and yet makes not God and Christ of our Conscience, as thou secretly wouldst charge us with∣all: Then thou goest on, and wouldst seem to prove, but canst not, that somthing besides the Light of Christ convinceth of sin; but thy reach is too short, tho thou wind abroad, and lets thy thoughts into the pit of thy own reason, to bring up a thing to confound Truth, but cannot; for this is thy proof, where they were all convinced by their own Consciences Iohn 8. Now all these I say we men come into the World, and therefore according to Iohn 1. 9. were lighted
with the Light of Christ, and thou hast confessed that Conscience is the Light of Christ, as God; which is no less then I have affirmed, then wherefore hast thou waded so farr, when at the end thou art forced to confess my position, thy words being explained, that it is the Light of Christ that doth convince of sin, and can find no other thing besides that; then thou sayst, here is somthing be∣sides the Spirit of Christ that doth convince of sin &c. But yet I say, nothing besides the Light of Christ, as thou hast confessed, and that was that only which I affirmed in the tenth page of mine, about which thou hast made all this stir, and to no purpose, (as to prove any thing convinceth of sin but the Light of Christ) and in that I said, he that convinceth of sin a∣gainst the Law, leads up into the fulfiling of the Law, which still I own, though thou wouldst contradict it, but canst not; and I clearly see thou hast not reach∣ed the understanding of my words, but answered thy own conceiving, and not my words; for I do not say, or think that righteousness comes by the Law, yet that is righteousness, which condemneth that which breaks the Law; if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear; and as I said it is the Word of Truth, the Righteousness of the Law must needs be fulfilled in Judgment, upon you all, and by Christ Jesus in you, if ever you receive the Salvation to your Souls; and thou hast not yet learned what I mean, and though thou sayst, that for justifica∣tion, thou lookst beyond the Law, to the Son of Mary; but I say thou must not look beyond it for condemnation, who art in transgression, and not recon∣ciled to God, through condemnation in the flesh, for it will reach you to con∣demnation; and thou sayst Thou understandst that I do, in all my discourse disown Christ without, by pretending to a Christ within; To which I say, thy understand∣ing deceives thee, who, it may be feared, blinds thy own eyes; that thy Conscience may not condemn thee for slandering, but while I am approved in the sight of God, of those things whereof thou accusest me falsly, and wickedly; I matter nothing what a Lyers Judgements is of me, my Answer to thy Query shall prove me clear, and thee a Lyer herein, that we own Gods Christ as the Scripture declares of him, as I have said, and the darkness of my words is to blind the eye of subtilty, and not to deceive the hearts of the simple (though thou wouldst say it) see if thou now canst tell what I say. And whereas thou art offended, that I say, many more things in thy Book I pass by, as being not pertinent to the thing in hand; my words are true, for the thing in hand was proving us Deceivers, and that was the most of which I medled withal, or purposed to oppose; and to other things that thou speakest of in short, my answer was, and is the words (or of some of them) I own, and thy voice I deny, without any blaspheming or error, in the view of all the World (though thou wouldst say it) for whatsoever a lying spirit speaks, I deny it to be the voice of Christ, though it may be some of his words; and thy spirit is a lying spirit: And though thou art offended that I should say Fools loves to be medling, yet its true enough, is not he a Fool who is a Lyer and a Slanderer, that understands not betwixt before a time, and since a time, judge in thy own Conscience; and thy fair words, as that it must needs be (sayst thou) That the Saints of God must be called Fool; I say, never presume the name of Saint, but clear thy self of thy Lyes and Slanders, and perverting Scrip∣tures, and learn the First principle of Religion; Even that which Condemns thee. And as to that which I say  true, that the Pope can speak as much of Christ without as thou, I own it, and may add; I believe he can speak more then thou of Christ without, and with as good, or better understanding; though both a like far from the Kingdom of God; yet in thy Answer, thou askest me, if I put  difference betwixt the speaking of; and beleeving in Christ without; Yea, I do a great deal, for he that believes in him, hath the Witness in himself of him, and his heart is purifyed, and he is a new Creature, which thou art not, but thou I suppose wouldst be reckoned a Believer; nay, for I think the Pope hath
both more words, and more good works, and makes as much Conscience of lying and false accusing as thou, for ought as may be understood, of a tree by the fruits, which is our way to judge, as Christ hath given us example; then is that I said thou hast answered thy self a question deceitful, thou art offended, and boasts thy self against me, Charging me to be an Enemy to the truth, and the li, in that I did not manifest thy deceit; but now I shall therefore, to stop thy pro boasts in that answer, thou calls it a sad doctrine which saith, follow the Light which Christ hath enlightned every man withall, and other such like things following that question, which are deceitful, and wicked, and thou thereby art proved the Enemy to truth thy self, and thou and thy words are both deceitful; and there∣fore boast not thy self: Then thou answers my Question, which was, doth not the Scripture witness that all who have not Christ are Reprobates? the Question is sound, and of worth to be noted, and in thy answer thou sayst, yet it is true, to which I soberly Reply, then what a condition are all in, that hath  Christ within, nor no knowledge of him, but what they have of him as he is without, by the letter without, do thou consider this; and whether it be not of the chiefest prize to Life and Salvation, to wait for him, and seek for him within, seeing all that have not him within are Re∣probates. But farther thou wouldst seem to manifest a great deal of folly in me, when as the folly lies in thy own bosome, and by thy confused words, I understand th groundst thy Answer upon alye, and false understanding, and therefrom bring the false reproof, as if I should hold forth that every man hath received Chri or the Spirit of Christ in him. This I have never said, but that every man hath the Light of Christ gi him which I say is one in union, with the Spirit of Christ; and I say Christ  given to all, but all receives him not; and I see thou understands not my for words that I write in answer to one of thy Queries, thou canst not disting betwixt a thing being given of God, and a thing being received by man, so  the folly is fallen back on thee, take it, who understands not my words,  opposes thy own conceivings, and false understanding; and though I might  truly apply this word folly in that extent, then thou applyed the like word  thy self in this same page, yet I leave it to the judgement of the serious Rea∣der, and say, thy folly is want of wit in the World, and not for Ch sake: Then thou wouldst defend thy first wickedness, in that thou saidst the Devil deceives Souls, by perswading them to follow the Light within, which all men have; but my answer to it thou hast not reached, in that I said,  that comes to Life eternal must follow the Light within which Christ ha given, which stands over thy head for ever to be truth; but yet how bli art thou in confessing the Light within, even Conscience to be the Light  Christ as God, and yet sayst, the Devil deceives souls by bidding follow the Light within. O abominable doctrine! what doth the Devil deceive souls by bidding fo the Light of Christ as God? so Iohn Bunion's doctrine is; let it be noted:  see thou thy folly how it is manifest, and thy pittiful evasions are weighed,  stead of contradicting my former sufficient answer, which thou could no  reach to wrest, or otherwise to answer it, askes a question, which I may ans assoon as thou hast sufficiently replyed to my former answer, and this is in  an answer to it; it is heresie to say, that the Light of God (or any Light of  or Christ) can or doth deceive the Soul; and though thou stumble at it, I said  in saying, that thy whole purpose is a secret smiting against the Light within,  the Reader judge. And now to manifest thy ignorance fully; thou hast confessed the Light wit even Conscience is the Light of God; hast not thou cause to repent of  absurdities and blindness, who holds forth, that the Devil deceives Souls by the
Light of God, seeing thou canst find no Light within man, but that which thou confessest is the Light of God. Then thou sayes, Thy whole design was first to shew Souls where Salvation is to be bad, namely in Christ without, and yet hath confessed, all that hath him not within are Reprobates, and such have not salvation, by him without; Consider there∣fore, without Christ within no Salvation, as I have said, and thou hast confessed it, (Mark it) then to clear thy self from contradiction, which I charged thee with, thou wouldst cast a confusion upon me, in that thou says, I would make a defiled Conscience, the Law and Spirit of Christ to be all one; This is falsly spoken, I have never said, nor thought, that a defiled Conscience is the Law and Spirit of Christ, a Lyer thou art to be noted, and this Lye adds to the number; and yet consider thou hast said (several time) that Consciences is the Light of Christ, as God; and now calls Conscience de∣filed; Is the Light of God defiled? Iohn Bunnion, saith so; O horrid! read thou thy confusion, and grievous Error, which is brought to thy Door, and there I leave it; thou mayst Blush, and all thy Witnesses at this; and in that thou callst my Answer Scoulding, against thy Epistle, and persumptuously sayst, The truth of which thou couldst be willing to seal with thy Blood. Reply, Scoulding I deny, but I have reproved thy Lyes in the Authority of the Lord, and be not so proudly pust up in boasting: what sayst thou? shall thy Blood go for this, that the Quakers are Deceivers, and that the Devil deceives Souls, by bidding them follow the Light within, which thou sayst is Conscience, which thou confesses is the Light of God, and that the Blood of Christ was shed before the World was, and that the Scripture say so, and that we deny that Sal∣vation was compleatly wrought by the man Christ Jesus, with several other things noted for Lyes; what sayst thou Iohn Bunnion? art thou so desparte as that thou wilt hazard thy Blood upon this account? if it be so, sure the Devil hath great power over thee; cease thy boasting lest the Lord make thee an Example, and though thou wouldst exhort me, thy spirit I deny, and so thy words I judge, and cannot receive good from an evil Spirit: Then thou comes on, falling on thy own foul ignorance again, and wouldst fain clear thy self, but by thy stir∣ring thy own wickedness herein, thou makes it cast an odious sight to all that pass by, (we may follow thee a little, seeing thou art not yet weary) and fain wouldst thou make it appear that the Blood of Christ was shed before the World was, and sayst it was, in Gods account; but to this I have spoken, and large∣ly shewed thy blindness to all men, and adds this upon thy head; thou art a Lyar and Perverter of Scripture to say, That the Blood of Christ was shed before the World was. And further thou art a Lyer, to say, That God accounts a thing for Truth which is a Lye; a sad error, and wicked. And further thou art a Lyar, to say, that I corrupt thy woods: for I had not laid open thy nakedness so fully, if thou hadst not persisted in thy blindness, as now I am forced to do, but enough of this, and more then ever thou canst clear thy self of honestly; and yet to cover thy own shame charges me falsly with folly, to speak evil of things I know not, or else with madness, &c. Reply, Friend, be not so confident, I know the difference betwixt, before, and since, or from, and know that God accounts not a Lye for Truth (as thou holds out) thy own folly and madness; behold, who commits iniquity in lying on the Scripture, and on God, and on me, and yet persists after a sober reproof, and resists the Reprover, with opprobrious words, let confusion of face cover thy impudent forehead, while I forgive thee, and seeks not vengeance against thee; then through thy mistake of my words, thou hast falsly gathered a subject to oppose, and fights with thy own understanding mightily, and thinkst thou confoundst me, and its thy self; for however thou understands my words, either for want of wit, or otherwise, it never entred into my thoughts,
with charging thee to believe that Christ is a tipe; only I charge thee that thou saidst so of others; So that I think this is a mistake in thee for want of knowledge to understand my rehersal of thy words, being transcribed as the shortest, not to fill volumes, and through thy own misunderstanding of my laying down the words, thou heavily, yet vainly charges me with corrupting thy words, which God is my witness I have not done, though thou be guilty herein. But further, I deal plainly, and slanders not in secret, as thou dost, we do not look on Christ to be but a shadow and tipe, if thou affirm I shall answer further, and as to that (thou sayst) I say Jesus is the sub∣stance; to that answer I stand, though thou sayst, Thou doubts I do not sp plainly, &c. Reply, As I have said I seek not a proof of my faith of thee, nor any man, not do I beg thy belief while I am approved in the sight of God, herein I matter not what a lying spirit doubts of me, so that what vain Arguments, or Queries thou raises from thy own false doubt I pass by, being by the present thing, branching out in things on the by, if I should examine every particular, I might fill a vollume. And whereas thou hast answered my question, which is; did Christ put an end to the Law for them, who yet live in the transgression of the Law? or doth he justifie that which the Law condemns, before the work of the Law be finished? In thy Answer thou sayst, Christ did put an end to the Law for Righteousness, for all that the Father hath given him, This is little to the Question: I say that Transgressors of the Law, are not Christs, but Children of Diso∣bedience, and Children of Wrath, and such God hath not given to Christ, who are his Enemies, nor Christ to them is not given, but to condemn them is that estate, and thou sayst there are many given to Christ, who yet lives is their sins; the Apostle Iohn saith, he that sins is of the Devil, and hath  known God, and such as are of the Devil are not Christs; and in that I sa, doth Christ justifie that which the Law condemns before the work of the Law  finished, and not one tittle of the Law shall fail, till all be fulfilled? thou hast  reached the understanding of my words, for while disobedience stands and the Transgressor lives, the work of the Law is not finished, nor fulfilled, but to that is Condemnation, and not Justification; if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear, for he that transgresseth the Law is an Enemy to Christ, and Christ fulfills not the Law for his Enemies, they must bear their own burthen; and though this thou cannot understand now, yet in the day of Judgement shalt thou feel it, and when the bur∣then of thy own Inquity is upon thee, then shalt thou confess to what I have said, and read me in what now thou canst not understand; and in the mean time, I deny that Christ hath put an end to the Law for thee, who art a Lyar, and breaks one, and so is guilty of all. Many of thy words might be weighed and searched, but I am no pic of quarrels; but to my last Query, thou sayst little to the purpose, which is; what assurance have any, that the Law is fulfilled for them, who  yet Transgressors of it, in themselves? but sayst, Assurance comes th believing and obedience to the Law is a fruit of believing, &c. Saying  one that hath the hope of the Son of God purifies himself as he (Christ)  pure. Reply, Then he that hath not the fruit, (viz.) obedience to the Law,  may judge by the fruit, or for want of fruit is no Believer; and he that is  purifyed as he is pure (Christ) hath not the hope of being the Son of God but is without hope, now see where thou art, who yet breaks the Law, and  without (thy own noted) fruit of believing, neither is purifyed as he is pure, and so is without hope, this is according to thy own affirmation; if th canst not bear it, blame thy self for laying down such a position, as hath pro
thy self to bean Unbeliever, and without hope; and so without God in the World; one that is for condemnation, and to be judged in the state where now thou standst. And whereas thou sayst, I would lay assurance on obedience to the Law; thou lyest in this also, my words are, the Law must be fulfilled in you by Christ, in Judgement and in Righteousness, if ever you receive Salvation, and these words are true against all thy opposition, neither do I affirm that by the deeds of the Law any flesh living shall be justified (but the contrary) though thou wouldst falsly (yet secretly) cast it upon me, and wickedly callst this my forthy argument, where I said the Law convinceth, and is a School-master to bring to Christ, &c. But the froth proceeds out of thy mouth, for this Argument comprehends thee, and stands out of thy reach, for all thy detestable speeches against me, and the truth; and the rest of my following words thou hast passed by, where I say, who owns not that which convinceth of sin, how can they own him that takes it away by his Blood? and this is truth; and tell me in ustess according to my first Query in that page, how is sin taken away om thee, more then from the Pope? seeing neither of you hath the fruit of ceasing to commit sin: And art not thou in the froth, who opposes me, as though (I should say yet never did nor thought) that justification must be sought by the deeds of the Law, and so gathers a false conception, and fights with it, and keeps thy self doing in nine sheets against four, and yet hast passed over many speciall things, almost the chiefest; and though no flesh shall be justified by the deeds of the Law, yet must all flesh living be condemned for the trans∣gression of the Law by Christ, who freely gives Life to all that believes; if thou hast an ear thou mayst hear; in the next thou seemst (or wouldst at least) to defend thy self from my charge which shall (if it doth not) lie heavy upon thee, which is that I call thee Slanderer, and truly too, from thy words, where thou falsly accus∣ed the Qunkers with boasting, and Hypocrisie, and in thy answer thou sayst, I need not be offended, for thou dost not know our fellow, for boasting, in that (thou sayst) we ryp our selves, and condemn all others, &c. But this is no proof of the former Accusation, but an addition to thy former wickedness, let honest men consider I asked thee when thou didst▪ hear any of them boast, or see them live in Hypocrisie; but not a word to this sober desire, but adds sin to sin, a bad way to clear thy self, and thy God, Be ashamed; for crying up self, we deny, but yet must say, or else say falsly, That we are of God, and the whole World lies in wickedness, and he that is of God heareth us, and is one with us; and this is as the Saints testified, and is neither boasting nor Hypocri∣fie; then to my question, which was; Will that Faith which is without works justifie? and thou sayst no, &c. Then I Reply, what is thy condition and theirs, who are not only without works of faith; but in thy very work of darkness, as Lying and false Accusing, &c. And seeing thou sayst no, Consider, whether thou hast faith, and whe∣ther thy works which are like good workes proceed not from the unbeleiving ground, and this I add to my next I asked which thou hast passed by; must not every one receive according to their deeds, in the day of Judgement; and then thou runs out in high words against me, in that I said, if to talk of him (Christ) his Birth, Blood, &c. Were Faith in him, and living by faith, then few would want it; and further I add the Pope himself would have it, and my words are just and honest, without exception or contradiction, but only that something thou must needs say; though thou say many can talk of Christ, that will fall short of Heaven, &c. And asks me a question, and fayst, Is there not enough in them, () Birth Blood, &c. to justifie, &c. I answer the knowledge of all things whatsoever without, will not justifie, except Christ be within, and if he be within, the power of his Life, Blood, Birth, &c. is known and received and felt, and in this I preach, not any
other Gospel then the Apostles, who said, Say not who shall ascend or descend to fetch him, (Mark) but what saith it; the Word of Faith (or of the Gospel) which are not divided, is nigh thee in thy mouth, and in thy heart. Rom. 10. And thou falsly again charges the Quakers with corrupting, (and beguiling my) by those Scriptures. Reply. Beguiling is thy own, and corrupting of Scriptures too, as is proved, and whilst thou accuses us falsly in these things, thy self art proved truly guilty, in the sight of all that are spiritual; and as to thy charging me, That the man Christ Iesus is not very pleasant to me, And with Scoulding, &c. Thy slanders I bear with patience, and thy reproaches which is not for evil, but for Christs sake, who dyed at Ierusalem, and is revaeled in me; and for sh cease to say, Thou art ruled by Scripture a Lyar, and Slanderer, and Preverter of Scriptures, is not led with the Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, but is ruled by the Devil, and is out of Scripture rule: then thou goes on, and wouldst justifie thy ignorant saying, How are they deceived who own Christ; no otherwise then as he was be∣fore the World began, &c. And my Page the 14 of my first. answer to it thou hast not touched, nor truly contradicted, which stands over thee, and is sufficient to all honest people, and Christ we own the same yesterday to day & for ever; and doth believe the Father granted that request, and he is glorified with the same glory that he had before the World was, and though thou tell me of a double meaning, yet in plainness I speak without doubleness, the fault is in thy weakness, and sottishness, and blindness of heart, who kno not that which is infinite and immortal, and eternal, the flesh of Christs body is so. Then thou falsly charges me again (in that I said) if every spirit be of God which doth in words confess thus (viz.) that Christ was with the Father before the World was (was born and suffered in the flesh and was buried and raised, &c. then is not the Pope himself Antichrist, &c. As (in my fourteenth page) whi putting on a vail and ventering upon thy words. But I have spoken the truth herein, let that in thy Conscience answer in na∣kedness without a vail, the vail is on thy heart, & thou canst not understand me; and so this is thy simple policy to say the vail is on me; and what of that, if  ventred on it, it is but in the fear of God, though I should say I deny all th thou sayst, or the speaking of any thing, for I do not own thy voice, though some of thy words be true, and though thou speak words of truth, yet therefore I reprove thee, and sometimes may not let it pass for truth; for Christ is my ex∣ample herein, who reproved the Devils, though they confessed him, (Mark that) but the chief part of my words are passed over, and read over again, and see if it is not truth it self, where I said, It is not much better, nor more accep∣ted, to confess Christ in words to be come, and yet in works to deny him, the it is both in words and works to deny him, the one is wicked in prophane the other in Hypocrisie, the one is a Lyar, and the other a false Witness, and let the honest Judge; then whereas I said Christ is a mystery; and unto hi he is Light, and shall be Salvation, where his person, supposed son of Io∣seph, never came; which words are true, not gain-sayed by thee, though thou ask, Did he obtain salvation for any without that body which he took of  Virgin? Answ. That body which was begotten by the holy Ghost is not so carnal  thou supposest, and that spiritual Rock which followed them, saved them, a the same Son of God the Saviour, who was born a Child to them, was the Pri of peace, yea, the everlasting Father, but thy eye sees not this, and therefore th sayst. Here's the place where he is not, and the place where he hath not been, (Now th sayst) Thou passes by many things which thou mightst justly examine, and also many unseemly expressions. O thou deceitful heart and tongue! is this thy excuse when my words are
Consider of this, when thou hast a better understanding for its yet hidden from thee; then when thou hast thus cried out against my just Answer, thou tells me what I should have said; Alas, poor man! thou reaches not what the knowledge of things eternal is, by that wisdom in which thou art, I need no man to teach me, but the Lord. Then thou sayst, Iesus Christ hath obeyed the Law, and justified thee, &c. Reply, Nay hold, repent first, and be turned from thy iniquities, and be∣lieve in him, and boast not thy self so proudly; thou art in the transgressions of the Law in disobedience to it, a Lyar, Slanderer, and Scorner, one that the Prince of the power of the Air rules in, a Child of Wrath, and every one shall dye for his own iniquity, and the soul that sins shall dye, and wrath to every one that doth evil, and the revelation of the Judgements of God; Learn what this meanes, or ask them that are of a better understanding then thy self. Then thou seemst to minde me of some weakness, and cries out, Wonderful foolish∣ness, &c. Because I said, the Light of Christ, given to every man, Ioh. 1. 9. as thou con∣fessest, is not contrary to the Spirit of Christ, and to the Grace of God, but is one in their nature (Mark) and a man cannot possibly love one of them, and hate another; therefore one they are, in the union, leading in the same way, unto the same End; and where doth the Spirit of Christ give light, or the Grace of God work or lead, if not in the Conscience? &c. These are my words, Now let honest men consider, and Iohn Bunnion be silent, what foolishness or wonderful weakness, is in these words, but only to the wisdom which is devillish, which despiseth truth? or what cause was there to blush, when I wrote them? as he impudently saith, who cannot contradict them, nor reprove them, and yet railes upon them: no marvel that thou wouldst pass them, as thou sayst with such a poor shift to evade with a Lye, that thou hast spoken to it already, when as thou hast not medled of these things. O let not thy impudency so sottishly carry thee, (for thy shame is seen and laid open, its good (in thy light) to pass that which confounds thee, which is past an∣swering) so to save thy credit among thy fellows; the cause to blush is in thy self, and its brought to thy own door. Then thou pleads for the Scripture to be the Rule in opposition to my Question, which is not answered; which was, can there be any surer thing for the Creature to look to, to walk to Life, or to come to God by, then the Light of Christ which every man hath given him, &c. But thou mayst for shame cease pleading for Scripture rule, being thy self art so far contrary to it; for he that walks in the Life of the Scripture, I have union with him, and the Light of Christ is a more surer Testimony, either to witness Justification or Condemnation, then any mans words without, whatsoever; then my other Question was, whether the Turks, Iewes, and thee, and others, do serve sin and lust, because Christ hath not given you Light to discover your sins, or because you hate that Light, that is given? and much to this thou speakest not pertinent, nor answerest in plainness; I leave it to the Reader to judge, and to read my answer Page 17. of my first, which clears truth from all what thou hast said against it in this particular. Now I come to the next thing, where thou Foolishly chargest me, That my Doctrine is not according to Truth, but a Lye, Charging me to affirm that which the Apostle doth deny; Because I said the Spirit is given to every man, though eve∣ry man receives it not; and it strives with the wicked, though he follow it not, &c. My words herein are Truth, and no Lye, neither contrary to the Scripture, nd let the Reader be judge betwixt us; the Apostle saith the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal; and some of these to whom he
writes thus, were wicked, given to incest and idolatry, and other sins; here I prove, it was given to the wicked, and thou confesses the Righteous had it, and there is but these two on the face of the Earth; Now if thou canst find a man that is neither wicked, nor righteous, then thou hast advantage, then some hath not the manifestation of the Spirit; the Saints had the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, and he (the Spirit of Truth) convinced or reproved the World of sin; they that were not Saints, but wicked had it, reproving them; Mark these things, and let honest men judge, while both thou and I am silent, whether thy Doctrine, which denyes that which the Scripture affirms, or mi which bears witness to the same thing which the Scriptures speaks, be to be disowned, let an equal Line measure; the shame, and false Doctrine is fal∣len upon thee, and thou art offended (that I should say thou bringst other vain Arguments) with a vapour, saying, Neither I, nor my fellows are able to an∣swer, &c. But I say true, the Arguments are vain, one is, The Devils are convinced, but have not the Spirit, or such like, Now what is this to the purpose, that thou contendst in that wherein no body strives with thee, nor none affirms against thee; and it is a vain Argument to parallel the Devil in such a case, as having the Spirit; but thou art so blind, its hardly possible to let thee see thy igno∣rance herein; I may not much strive with thee, onely Ile tell thee of those thing and the sober Reader shall judge; to instance a thing impossible, to pro things possible, are vain Arguments, so that I have herein done thee no wro Then thou cries out of my weakness, and that I Blaspheme, and of a great  of ignorance discovered in me, and bidst me be silent, and falsly charges me with Pre∣sumption, and such like, &c. Because I said, thus much I leave with thee,  thou prove the Light of Christ, (which thou confesseth every man hath) to  contrary to the Spirit of Christ; I shall say every man hath that which is one  union, and like the Spirit of Christ, even as good as the Spirit of Christ, accord∣ing to its measure; these are my words, Page 18. and I own them, and thy an∣swer to them is no contradiction, nor just confutation of them; but lyest,  saying, I call Conscience, and Nature it self the Spirit of Christ; this is fals never spoken by me, so that thou hast uttered a pack of railing words, with any knowledge or fear of God, instead of a sober Answer; the blasphemy a great deal of ignorance and presumption appears not in my words, they a truth, and thou hast not proved that the Light of Christ is contrary to the Spirit of Christ; Nay, thy simple policy is too short, when thou hadst done so, then had been a time to have cast these opprobrious speeches at me, like venome from a Viper; but the weakness (or strength of error) and blasphemy, and the great deal of ignorance and presumption &c. is fallen at thy door, and there I lea it, clear thy self from it as thou art able, who without any confutation of th words, falls impudently to charge me thus highly and falsly from the words,  thou silent, while the Reader judges: Then thou goes about to defend thy first wick∣edness, in that thou said, the Devil doth deceive poor Souls, by bidding them listen wi and turn the minde within, and see if there be not that which doth convince sin, &c. And my Answer to this is sound, and stands over thee, and unreproved by th though many words thou speakest; yet from the Scripture doth not prove, or  honest Arguments, that the Devil doth deceive any, by bidding them to tur the Light within, which convinceth of sin; if thou wouldst have cleared thy  thou shouldst have proved thy assertion, according to my desire, I asked th was ever such a thing spoken, that the Devil can deceive any by the Light  Christ? but to this not a word in proof, but saith, Every man hath not the Spirit  Christ, &c. But further then I Query, Doth the Devil deceive any by bidding the  turn in, and listen to that Light spoken of Iohn 1. 9. for that Light am I con∣tending for, and not any other contrary to it; then thou sayst, thou denyst.
beyond thy reach either to understand or contradict? thou wants that Spirit which can examine of truth, be it known unto thee; and what are those unseemly expressions? wilt thou slander always in secret, without evidence? and if these be they, in that I said, our innocency will appear when thy black vaile of Lyes is taken away; and this is truth, and is no way but seemly to be spoken to thee, who art an Enemy of God; then thou wouldst justifie thy former slander, who said, we wrest that Scripture, Iohn 1. 9. And my answer is, we take it without adding or diminishing, which is true, and no Lye, nor wresting of it; neither in thy Reply can I find that thou provest it, though many words uttered, little to the purpose, with adding to thy former slanders, in saying, We would hold that that Light is the Spirit of Christ; this is not spoken in all my Book, but that it is one in union I say, and not contrary to the Spirit of Christ, but witnesseth of it, and to it. And thou further saith, We say many things, which thou knowest to be Blasphemy; This is another Lye, prove one Blasphemy. And further thou sayst, Christ, as he is Mediator, doth not enlighten every one that comes into the World, &c. Reply, Well, thy ignorance and wickedness vents it self forth apace, let any man read that first Chapter of Iohn, and see whether he doth not speak of Christ as Mediator; he saith, He was in the beginning with the Father, and was made flesh and dwelt with the Disciples; and his Life was the Light of men, and the Light shined in Darkness; and that was he which lighteth every man that comes into the World; and he came to his own, but they received him not, but as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, &c. What sayst thou? Was not this spoken of Christ as Mediator? Consider, and be instructed, rather then let thy Blood go for it; however I leave thy Doctrine and Errors herein to be judged by them that are spiritual, and for shame cease such Doctrine, the more I rake among the filth, the more vilely and odious it ap∣pears; and for thy proof of this Doctrine, thou bringst Mat. 11. 25. and sayst, here the Father and the Son are speaking one to another; but what doth this prove, though it be so? doth it any way follow that Iohn did not speak of Christ as Mediator? Iohn 1. what vain productions thou bringst from thy impertinent proofs, let them be weighed, and taken notice of honestly; and thou bidst me understand thus much, That nature which is Conscience, is the Light of God. I understand thy blindness; if this be so as thou sayst, then mans nature is pure without sin, as the Light of God is; and this is error abominable, contrary to the Scripture, which saith, All by nature are the Children of Wrath; are all by the Light of God (as thou sayst nature is) Children of Wrath? see thy Divinity, and take it as it is truly interpreted, I desire not to wrong thy words; thou givest me to understand the greatest ignorance from those things that lately I have heard, no not the like in England; and it is very true, as I said thy folly ap∣pears by thy much medling. Then thou askst me, What I will have the Light called, wherewith every man in the World is lightned, and because I do not call it the Spirit of Christ, thou (as it were) murmurs; because I have cut of thy occasion, and thou canst not bend thy tongue with any seeming advantage against the Truth; but in that I say the Light of Christ convinceth of sin, which is true, thou on a sudden produces thy bad consequences, and askes, if I call nature the Light of Christ, and such like. &c. But they all do not prove the contrary, so that which convinceth of sin, is worth minding and taking notice of, by all that ever are saved; and as to that where I say, that which may be known of God was manifest in them, even in them that were given up to work unrighteousness, &c. I said the truth, which thou are not able to contradict in equity, though
thou very ignorantly bendst thy answer (as if I had said) the Knowledge of God was made manifest in them, when I say plainly in my Book; that they  turned from the Knowledge of God, and yet that which might be k of him was manifest in them; and this thou canst not deny: And though  words, as layed down, are not in the Scripture words, in terms, yet I have  said falsly herein, and do not thou be a reprover of that which thou cannnot  self deny; then thou sayst, How feeble an argument is this to prove, that every one  Spirit, &c. Reply, Thou blind man, did I go about to prove any such thing or  any Argument thereupon; we are about the Light which Christ hath gi or lighted every man in the World withal, which Light convinceth of  and is not contrary to the Spirit of Christ; unto this was I speaking,  this I stand by, and thou conceives another thing from my words, and  against thy own consequences, like a man too irrational to understand co English, &c. Then thou sayst, Thou passed by other lame Arguments, which I tumble ev  blind man in a thicket of bushes. O be ashamed for ever! thus to evade and shuffle, with such scornful  I said, that which reproves of sin is the gift of the Spirit of God, Iohn 1.  that which makes manifest sin, is Light, and whatsoever is reproved is made  fest by the Light, Ephes. 5. how darest thou call these lame Arguments, tumb over? what impudence is in thy heart, so to say? when thou art put to  fusion, then such excuses thou bringst; Well, some may see thy folly:  to my Question which was, whether that Light which every man is li withal, is sufficient in it self for Life and Salvation to every one  believes? if thou say, not; wherein is the blame, in God, in his Li  in the Creature; thou sayst, No it is not sufficient; I take it. for an  and leaves it to be weighed by the sober Reader, and though there be ve honour, and of dishonour made of the same lump, as thou sayst, yet I  Query; is not every mans blood that perisheth of his own head?  not the Lord clear from the blood of all men, even though they go to d ction? and if the Reader try thy Book over, he may judge whose Arguments  lame. Then whereas thou sayst, Christ, as God, hath lighted every man that com  the World, To which I said, then, why dost thou say we wrest that Scri Iohn 1. 9. seeing thou thy self hast confessed no less then what thou callest well∣ing in us; and this is truth, let all men consider else; that when tho cn∣fesses Christ as God hath lighted every man in the World, it is no less then w we say, and that Scripture sayes, which is, That Christ is the true Light,  that is he which lighteth every man that comes into the World; and may  thou be ashamed to call this so scornfully a glavering Answer, not being  clear thy self from my just charge, in that herein I charged thee with co to oppose us, in that which thy self confesseth to be true; consider well o and let not thy blood go for the truth of all what thou sayst, for I de not. Further thou cries out, Is this all the wit I have, and wonderful ig  Because I said it is not good to neglect following the Light, but that  one minde the Light of Christ Jesus in them; in answer to thy words,  having said, the Light which convinceth of sin is the Light of Christ as  which the neglect of, will be sure to damn, as thou sayst; and now let wise judge of my answer; but thou falls heavily on it, proving that obed to the Law will not justifie, and the like, which I do not at all affirm;  to that I say, the Law having its opperation upon the disobedient, the  comes to be seen, which is he that is the end of the Law, and the Law m him be obeyed or fulfilled in thee, if ever thou be saved from being damned  it.
ul bid listen ithin, telling me of making sher for my err, &c. T o  say, that Paul bids listen within, let the Reader judge from that Sc∣ture . 10. 6. The righteousness of faith sks on ths se, rs. . (which is the  of the Gospel) and vers. 9. what saith it, the Word i nigh t,   M, and in thy Heart; was not that the end of these words, to lis  the Word is in the Heart; what saith it there? now the error i thine,  e truth; and the Lye is returned to the Founder, who denyes tht Pl en within; when its plain he saith, The Wd  i  Ht; what  it ere? O that a man professing knowledge and enterprzing such things, should e so  and so unable to finish what he hath in; then thou cryest ot sly, and notes it in the margent, for wresting of thy words, in that I d, ou sayst, They are ignorant of the Gospel who clos in with thes s of th  in (or Conscience) which doth command to abstain from the ll, and   ; and thy own words are; How the poor souls through ignorance of the Gospel   these motions of its own Conscience (viz.) the motions which convinceth of sin in, which doth comm abstain from this evil, and practice th gdd; so et we men consider whether I have wronged that intent of thy words; and e not so soon angry; or thou canst not vindicate, that they that closes n with these motions of the science, or the Light of Christ within, which oceth of sin with∣in, which doth command to abstain from-this evil, and o practice thi , is ignce of the Gospel; and do not evade it by words without kndge, in picking of quarrels, and seeking offences (by different tearms of wor e o occasion justly is given thee. Then my Question thou see est to aswer, which was, what, and how doth the Light of the Gospel work, of not in the ce, and to command from evil, and to practice good this  nds over thy head, not confuted, nor fully answered; for the true  ∣ang of it thou hast not comprehended, but to thy own conception, thou   ed as if I should say, that every man hath the Light of the Gospel g n thm to Salvation, which I never said nor thought; so thy answer   te purpose. Then thou hast passed by full slig (as disable to clear thy God and his Spir that guides thee, which is the Godd of this World) of that great  of  justly charged upon thee, Page 19. of my last, which a ∣ing to e collection is; by turning the mind within to the Light which doth  of sin, and listning thereunto and clasping in with the motions of  Conscience, which doth command to abstain from evil, ad to   and closing with somthing within, which thou confessess  the  f ; these things preceding, then thou, sayst, Hereby,  ths    ried headlong, and at the end of its life doth fall into the lly  ;   a sum of wickedness set forth by thee, which when thou el  t in  shall receive the interest upon it, of indignation and vengeance;   thou hast slipped it now, it shall their be reckoned on Iohn  e. Remember thou owest to prove this before tho be ru any. . again thou criest out, That I have ghtily belyed thee, and the like,  of misplacing a word, and saying, The Light of the World, instead  Light brought into the World; thou art an unjust Judge, who   ers for a word misplaceing; but it is plain, thou meanst by   into the World, that Light bu 1. 9. which every man in the  ed withall; and if thou do then thou art a Lyar, in saying    ook, and in this, The Devil  or s the  irth by   at   that Light, and if thou mean not that Light, In 1. 9.  that  rit, Iohn 16. (which I say is ot divided) then tho are a yar  d now while thou charge me to be gded by S, and o be a
Lyer, in the very time hast snared thy self in a Lye, and cannot get o,  it. Then thou sayst Thou passes by many rageing expressions, which thou migh  with unrighteousness &c. Reply, I asked thee, by what is the new birth wrought? and how, if  following the Light of Christ in the Conscience? is there any other way to  but Christ Jesus, who hath lighted every man that comes into the Worl i, part of that thou  passed by, with thy lying excuse of  expressions, of which tho mayst be ashamed to equivocate thus po save thy own credit; the charge of unrighteousness justly falls upon th head. Thou further sayst, And eates up thy own wickedness, who said then, a it now but most ignorantly, That Satan makes the Soul believe, if it will b  by what shall be made known to it, from the Light (or Conscience) within, it  ll, &c. My last Answer to this, is sufficient, onely I ask thee a proof ou  Scripture for this Doctrine, that the Devil do deceive any by the Light of C the Conscience within; and till then, minde my words in my last A ever thou knowst God, it must be by following, and by being led with  within, which God hath made known unto thee, else that Light is thy co tion eternally. Then again thou chargest me with corruping thy words, for writi for their; Now a scorner I charged thee to be, from thy words, and  yet say of th, taking thy words in thy own snce, as Page 77. of th doth manifest thee, unto the single eye; and thou secretly chargest  following our own spiri, and speaking by our own spirit; but our own Spirit  denyed, and have received the Spirit of the Father, through the Light of  whereby every man in the World is lighted to Life, or to Condemnation  thou seemst to be highly offended, that I should say, thou dost not pro ple at all, noting it for false in the margent; but thou needst not be  gry, though thou say, The people in the Countrey where thou dwellst will  contrary &c. To which I say, thou hast no cause to boast of the fruit of thy Minis they of much profit received by thee, witness a meeting in Bedford,  Company of thy cheifest Members, I suppose, uttered much wickedness  and Slanders, as many can witness; and witness three of thy Brethre tors of this Book, who say they know that to be truth, which thou has ed, and thou rt proved a Lyer in many things; let them read themsel Witnesses and Lyars, like thy self; and these things being considered,  with other things at the end of this, thou hast no cause to boast of thy  nor they of their profit, by it in that Country, who art unconver from lying and false accusing, and so art not turned from Satans powe power of God: And as for a carnal Ministry, of which thou speaks are very bad that exceeds thy self in carnality, in thy understanding  things that are spiritual: Then further thou goest on seeming to bring  of thy former Slanders, having in thy last, falsly accused us with sad B mies and horrible Doctrines, and thou sayst, My speech bewrayeth   ns of them, because sayst thou, I say that every man hath the Sp Christ. O thou lying tongue, when wilt thou cease thy wickednesse! I never sa thought so. And further thou sayst, I say, there is that in every man which is as  the Spirit of Christ, my words are, The Light of Christ, lighteth or is  every man that ome into the World, which Light is not contrary to th of Christ, but one in the union, and a good in its nature, according to
and till thou prove that that Light Iohn . 9. is contrary to the Spirit,   hast not done, stop thy mouth, and take shame to thy self, for be  lty thy self of corrupting my words, which thou falsly things thou sayst, that our society suld , bt I may   ge thou art, so slanderous a tongue  me, that he  ou   of whereas I said, thou art confounded i , I said , ; thou sayst, That Conscience my be se, , and another ,  is the Light of God; can the Light of  ed; or i   it forth. , i not this confusion; other thing  might collect, but is  ficient to prove thee in confusion; and thou th   with the Ranters, and sometimes with he ,    of bitterness and envy, yet we bear thy reproaches, and when they  taken off, then shall we appear, and thou appear, and be jd, a we , by im that is above all. Then thou falsly chargest me with ing at Scr, in Iohn 3. 19. Whereas, I neither added  , ut sp i  be seen in my Book. Further chargi e, that I do not under  drence between the Light of the La, and the Light of the Gosp ,  rejoyce in that I am hidden from thee, ad that my     to thee; for in that state thou standest the trance to the  o God, thou shalt not know, whose wisdom is   ,  gh thou sayst the Light of Christ is a saving coing Li  will it   a condemning Light, and of all Lyars and Slandere, and is  , though thou art busied up and down, in thy nde,    me, from my words, not clearing thy felt from wha I   on thee, but accusing me falsly, and this is cme to p,   ight openly appear, as to that difference of the Law, and Gospel, thy  th my knowledge of it, I shall not feed, yet I leave the  to  Deut. 30. from vers. 11. to 16. And Rom. 10. 7, 8. And   id  upon thee undone to prove by the Scripture, something  conce , and besides, or contrary to the Spirit of God, wh ou    do; for though thou sayst (as none aff) the Light in every  ience is not the Spirit of God, yet ho do thou proye;    ontrary to the Spirit of God, which in my last a put ,  leave it with thee; and then thou wouldst exse ty  ds  on called the Quakers fond Hypocrites, but hast ot yet proed  live in Hypocrisie, and so art a Lyar still, and y     a perverter of the right Way of God thou a, and in   f  it shall be proved by thy recompence. Then tho est    That a natural man may have power over sin, ad      in the Law; and for thy proof thou inst in pl,     , Phil. 3. Now this was before the Commandment ca  God  which let him see the Law was spiritual; and this doth  pve that  power over sin; for he was an Envy, and so a , and had  over sin, according as I asked thee, if thou yst he had power over . st to do before he was convicted, while he was a al   no si to persecute Jesus; and this would e blasphemy, the p ; t this thou hast cingly slipped, e I ed th get  sin, and to abstain from those things idden in the Law,  not  thou ever came? and because thou wilt not answer, I do, and say  concludes, that Iohn  sta i not so good  Ple, while he was er according to his own Doctrine; and thou sayst the Gentiles did by
nature the things containted in the Law; true, but that state was not co  stined, before the Circumcision; and I ask thee, Is any condem  who are exsed in his light? or is any justified who is accused?    d, which thou ignorantly comments upon, where I   chose to be of that profession which abstains from those things  in the Law, and to have power over sin, then to live in the transg the  and under the power over sin, yet talking of belief in the Son o . Let the Reader  whether of these Religions is more accep shn of God, thy Religion is proved to be talking of belief, in th  and  in the trasg ession of the Law, a Lyar, a false Witnese,  , and Backbiting, and such like; thy false belief will not save thee in   the Lord. Then further thou still confessest, that as he is God, Christ lighteth ever  come into the Wo then, wherefore dost thou make all this ado, in  us, in this particular? yet let's try thy Doctrine, whether it be sound  sayst, This Light, wherewith Christ, as God, hath lighted every man, is C and yet sometimes saith, This Conscience is seared, and hardned, and evil  is the Light of Christ as God, seared, heardened, and evil? Iohn B it forth; this is thy great Ignorance and Blasphemy; and sometimes  This Light is Nature▪ and Nature is corrupted, and sinfull, and in it,   dren of th. What is the Light of Christ as God corrupted, and sinful  are a by i Children of Wrath? Iohn Bunions Doctrine holds it forth,  blindness possessed thee, when thou writst this, yet mayst thou blush at the  hereof. Then thou goest to give a meaning upon my words: in that I said, t is Light, and Light is the Law, which is truth; but I spoke them not  to Interpret, with thy lying spirit, but let spirituall men judge of them,  much ado thou makes in answering my question to thee, but hits not my  at all; I asked thee, and bid thee shew, (if thou canst) any sin which  against the Law,; but this thou canst not do, though thou wouldst pro thou couldst, that imbelief is not a sin against the Law of God; then thou  of the obedience of the Son, of Mary, imputed to us, &c. But I say,  obedience of him without, doth not justifie any, who are in the Na cty against him, who is not a new creature, nor condemned in t  and whereas thou secretly chargest us, with mingling Law and Gospel to  I tell thee we know the operation of each, and doth witnes the Minist each, and they are not divided nor oppsite one against the other; but  the ing of the other; and though thou saidst, you leap over the  Iustification, yet it is too high for thee to leap over for Condemnation  member this, and all thy feign'd saith, while in that Nature thou st condemned, is but as the stubble for the fire: Then whereas I charged t preaching another Gospel, then the Apostle preached, and my charge upon thy head, and my proof is found against thee; he directed to the  withing in the heart, Rom. 10. what saith it, the Word is in the heart  he turned to the Light from Darkness; but thou sayst; who shall ascend  hi, en st follow him to the Cross without, and to Heaven without, &c.  art one that faith, o here, and lo there; but these things thou hast pa with thy lying excuse of quarreling, a many p shirts thou art ain to  and in that I said, thou wast a Lyar, in saying, the Light (vit) of Chr God, doth not shew the soul a Saviour, or Deliv; my charge  is true, and stands unremoved; and I asked thee, if the Light of Ch not shew Christ, to  will in the Light, then what c but thi hast passed also most fully, which stands upon thee to answer, or  thy mouth, then thou wouldst excuse thy contradictions charged upon  that thou saydst they are wickedly deled, who own Christ no otherwise  as he was before the World; and yet saying God onely is the Saviour, and
is none besides him; and all thou sayst clears not thy self, from contradiction herein let honest men be judge betwixt us both, for thou judgest falsely me to be aught, and I am sure thou art naught; and thou wilt not take my judgement. I may not take thine, (let impartiallity judge betwixt us) then thou wouldst ex∣cuse thy slanders charged justly upon thee, in saying, that Quakers make light of the Resurrection; and to prove thy wickedness, thou askest us, whether so it be?  e enough for us to answer; when thou hast brought evidence of the first asation; what poor proof is this for to cover thy self, though to add to thy wickedness. Thou sayst, thou knowst we deny it; I ask thee, when it was? or where it was? O thou Enemy of Righteousness, yea, thou shalt arise in the day of Judgement to shame and contempt, and this I affirm, except thou repent of this thy wickedness. Then whereas thou urgest me, that I should have answered, the Query raised from Eph. 4. 10. better, or confuted thine, &c. Do not boast, but hear what I say, thou sayst in that answer, that Christ ascended to the right hand of the Father in your Nature. Mark now, thy Nature, and your Nature, who are one with thee, is sinfull and wicked, and of the Devil, for so all Lyars are; and it is Blasphemy to say sinfull wicked divillish Nature, such as Iohn Bunions is, and his Fellows, is at the right hand of God in Heaven; O horrible! consider of this, and see what thy begging an answer hath brought upon thee; I deny, though thou affirm it, that thy, and your Nature, which is wicked, or a man in that Nature is ascended into Heaven; and therefore boast not thy self another time. This nakedness of thine might have been covered, but for thy own boasting; and thou sayst, Asts 1. proves it; let the Reader search, If he can find that Christ ascended in sinful wicked Nature, such as theirs is, who are one with Iohn Bunion; and this is another Lye of the Scripture; and though thou with much impudent confidence affirm the Quakers to be Deluders &c. I say from that we rather love dispraise, then praise, and are, as our fore-Fathers were, counted Deceivers, and yet are true; and thou art deceived in thy own heart, in that thou understandst my words, that I should say, as though there were no false Prophets now, because I said they were in the Apostles dayes, which is true, and yet are they now too; even its witnessed by thee, and thy Fellows, who are in their steps, who through coveteousness making merchandize of Souls, and your people are ever learning, and not able to come to the knowledge of the truth, and goes for gifts and rewards, and are false Accusers, and such like. Nay, but understand me better, for I say thou art a false Prophet, and thou art now, though thy root sprang forth in the time of the Apostles of which thou are a Beanch, and thy Fellows; And though I said that Antichrist was in the dayes of Iohn, and this was before a Quakers was heard of; my words I own, prs that, that the Christians were called Quakers at that day, if thou canst, . I allow not thee to be my Interperter, except I found thee more honest,  doth condemn thy meaning upon my words; and though thou sayst, instead of moving our selves no false Prophets, we prove our selves no Christians, be∣cause I said (that word) Quaker was not heard of in those dayes. Now con∣sider, are they no Christians now, whose title or name without, was not gi∣ves or heard of, in the Apostles dayes, then Protestants are no Christians, nor Independants are no Christians, nor Anabaptists are no Christians, be∣cause they were not called so in the Apostles dayes; and whilest thou hast thought to prove us no Christians, hast cast out thy self also; then thou art no better then we, and what poor Arguments and vain consequence these are,  the wise consider; I did not say, there were no Quakers then, but not a Quakers heard of (viz.) by that name; for there were thousands of Quakers, who trembled and quaked at the Word of the Lord, Moses, and David, Iere∣, Isaack Paul with many more Quakers, and Tremblers, though not then  called; but as I said, such as thou hast, such thou bringst, and thy Master will accept thee.
Then thou sayst I fling durt in thy face, because I said, if we should diligently search thee, we should find thee in their steps, through feigned words, through coveteousness, making merchandize of Souls, loving the wages of unrighteous∣ness. And further I said, among them thou art found, who art preaching  hire, and loves the error of Balaam, who went after Gifts and Rewards, o. Now thou seemest to be grieved, and calls this a false Accusation, But lets try the cause admits dispute, Art not thou in their steps, and among them that do  things? ask Iohn Burion, with whom thou art joyned close, to vindicate , and call him Brother; hath he not so much yearly, 150. l. or more (except t hast some of it.) which is unrighteous Wages, and Hire, and Gifts, and Rewards. What sayst thou, Art thou not in his steps, and among, and with him and then that do these things? if he be thy Brother, and thou so own him, what is  in him whom thou vindicates, I lay upon thee; but tell me, who have  thee deny him, and the rest of the Independants, in these things, which  knowst he doth act? and in thy answer I cannot find thee fully clearing thy  by denyal, but sayst, That spirit that lead me out of this Way is a lying spirit;  or what Way; I say, out of the way of preaching for Hire dost thou mean? y its a lying spirit in thee, that goes in their steps, and among them that goes in  way; and though thou bid me, have a care of receiving by hear say, what I b (said) and received in this, is truth, though thou evade it never so much. As to that, of some bidding thee throw away the Scriptures, &c, Indeed upon such terms, it might be spoken so as to be owned; a Lyar and a Slandere is an unfit Fellow to meddle with the Scriptures, or to take the Name of the Lord, or of the man Christ Jesus, in his mouth; and I may say truly, what hast  (unrighteous person) to do, to take his Name, and truth in thy mouth, hate to be reformed? And in that I say of thy crying against Christ within, this is true; who said, there was nothing in thee, nor any man (without exception) to be taken not in of, as we may prove by witness, though thou deny it; then, was not Chr within? and what less is this, then to cry against him, when as thou deayd him within, or else concludes he is not worth taking notice of. And tho thou say I falsely speak of thee in saying, thou callst the Doctrine of Christ wa in, false opinions, and take in hand to discover it; but the falseness is in the who hath uttered that which is untruth, and contrary to the Gospel, and  denyes it, or would hide thy wickedness; for thou having framed an objecti and speaks of some that are for a Christ within, &c. and then thou sayst, the wilt discover the falsity of such opinions, Now thou dost here reckon the Do∣ctrine of Christ within a false opinion, (or among them at lest) let the Rea judge, and be thou silent for shame; but all thou sayst clears thee not, fro what I said of thee, God shall judge thee, thou lying tongue, and dece heart. Then thou chargest me with folly, and to eat my first words, and to be  ble in judgement, and to fight against the Truth, &c. From my question ae doth not the Scripture say, Christ is within, except you be Reprobates? a not this thus much, all are Reprobates, but they in whom Christ is within; a yet because I said the measure or manifestation of the Spirit, is given, to eve man, this thou hast catched at, and wouldst prove it unsound; but truth is o thee, and both these are true; and further, I say that Christ is given unto  World, yea to all, but all receives him not, and they that do not receive him  Reprobates, though he be given, but not received; and the folly and fig against truth is in thy self, who says it is contrary to the Scriptures to say  Spirit is given to every one, thou here lyest of the Scripture as its proved,  I do not befool my self in saying the words (or some of them) I own in  Book, though I have written against the Book; for though thou speak Ch words and the Apostles words, yet thy voice is the strangers, and thy  I deny, what ever words thou speakst, and is not bafooling my self, and
I could justly end my discourse, and what is said is sufficient, to manifest thee and me to the honest Reader. And thus far thy weapons of Slanders are broken, and thy refuge of Lyes are layd waste, and this also is cast by, as our spoyled prey of Babyls treasure, and trampled upon, and know that we are of God, and be that is of God heareth us; and to our God, shall all bow; and before him tremble. And whereas thou seemest to be greatly offended, and stumbling very much at my answers to thy Queries, because thy carnall conceptions is not satisfied, nor thy vain minde gratified, having as thou thinkst great occasion against me thereby, which causes thy mouth to be opened in va∣pouring words aloft, against the simplicity of the Gospel, not under∣standing my words; for the things of the Kingdom of God is a parable to thee, and sealed from thee, never to be known in the reason in which thou judgest. But in short thus I Reply, I did not purpose to answer fully to them, to feed any mans wisdom with my knowledge of the things of Gods Kingdom; for the Queries were not fully directed to the Quakers; so that quench thy an∣ger, and according to my answer, go seek a further answer (or else be thou still unsatisfied) from them who are led with a spirit of delusion, for such a direction requires, no full answer from me, nor any of us, who are in the truth, and not in the delusion, neither did I purpose, nor do I at any time, to answer fully to such things as are directed in a great part to others; I am not a servant especially to them that are led with a spirit of delusion, to fufil thy will: But yet the short answers that I gave, (which was not in the behalf of delusi∣on) but for the truths sake, I still own though thou cannot understand them, but products many bad lying wicked consequences from them, and my pur∣pose was not to feed thy foolish wisdom in answering; nor to satisfie thy reason to receive praise from thee, or any man; for so I know it must be in hearing and seeing, thou must not perceive nor understand, who art of the Generation hardened, and in parable is the Kingdom of Heaven unto thee, and I rejoyce the rather in being a stumbling to thee, in that state wherein thou standed, then that I should have gratified thee; for I seek not, nor receives honour from man, in what I do; but is covered from the Worlds knowledge and know this, if thou cannot receive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little leaven, thou shalt never know it; But yet how wicked art thou in this also, though not understanding me, in what I said, yet so fouly wronging me with above 30. false charges and slanders from my words, which thou reaches not the knowledge of, so it will be enough. Reply, to sum up thy Lyes, and send them back to thee to seek them out, and an evidence for them, and the Querys, and my Answers shall stand, as they are to be judged of by honest men, while we are both silent in our own cause, they are to be seen at large in my first Book, The true faith of the Gospel contended for, &c. in the 26, 27, 28, pages. And whereas further I speak at the end of my Answers of Christ within the hope of glory and said it is that mystery which long hath been hid from Ages, but now is made manifest and declared, and though the wise of this World cannot receive it, but speaks evil against it, yet it is dear unto us, and so much more precious because despised by such as him, and such things are a testimony to us, and against you, (viz.) our Enemies, &c. As in my 29. Page of my first may be sen; and most wickedly this, or part of it, he calls babling, and says he passes by it. O horrible impudency! What marvel that he should so belye me, when as he hath called the very Scripture truth, spoken forth in righteousness, bablings? and these things I leave the Reader to Judge of, and all his Lyes thrown upon  pudently; and consider, what ground this man hath from my answers to be seen in my first Book to broach out and belch out such a number of Lyes
and Slanders, in five sides of paper, not any one of them (charged against me falsly) were spoken by me, or ever in my thoughts to speak, or ground gi∣ven by any of my words for such productions, as it is seen what lodges in the heart of such a Fellow, even desperate wickedness, who is without any  or honesty, who dare utter such things against the upright, who hates not his Enemies; but while I am clear in the sight of God, from all his false Slanders, I matter not what Iohn Bunion says of me, who is as a man given up to wicked∣ness who in less then a sheet of paper hath uttered thirty Lyes, or more, which I may particularly manifest before he can find evidence; a great wickedness?  this mans Converts be good, while himself is unconverted? is he a Minister of Christ? for shame let it not be told so; well, I beg not vengeance against him, he leaves my answers to be read, who will clear me from his lying consequences,  wickedly conceived, and as wickedly uttered (By one of Gogs Army) against a Mem∣ber of Jesus. Now I come to reckon up his damnable Doctrines, and errors, which are con∣trary to the truth; as will manifestly appear to him that is spiritual; some of th damnable without comparison. Iohn Bunion said, That Christs second coming, is not his coming in Spirit, for  coming in Spirit, is no coming. He saith, this (or part of it) is a lye made of hi To this is two witnes∣ses. by me; when as several Witnesses, doth testifie in righteousness, that those very words were spoken by him, in Pauls steeple-house in Bedford Town, M 23. 1656. as is witnessed; and yet this man is so impudent, that he de what he spake, (or is ashamed of his words) and so would cast the Lye up me, who is clear, and the wickedness lies at his door; and whereas he would prove that the second coming of Christ, is not his coming in Spirit, I say I will not beg him to believe it, but as he believes, so be it unto him; and all that he saith doth not prove, but that Christ promised, and fullfilled to his Disciples, that he would come again to them, (mark) again is a second time; If any man Iohn 14. hath an ear let him hear. And then he saith, he will not trouble himself to lay this to my charge, in that it was said of him, Christs coming in Spirit is no coming, it may be he repents of what he hath said, being better considered, since he hath al∣ready falsly charged me with it, as some in the County of Bedford knows very , that he hath falsly charged me, and denyed his own words, spoken by his own mouth. Also he said, Take notice, that I affirm, that there is nothing in me, nor is any man to be taken notice of, These are his own words spoken by him April 12, 1656. at Patnam, witnessed by three men, who heard it from his mouth, and this charge he doth not fully deny, but in a great measure he assents to it, yet would cover his shame a little with a Lye, in saying, Directly in this f of words he did not lay them down; but this will not serve to hide his Repro∣bate state, for to his face it may be testified he spoke the words, as I have laid them down; and therefore consider against whom I am yoaked, against one that is a Reprobate, and without Christ in him, one that hath denyed Christ in him, or else thinks Christ not worth taking notice of. O abominable igno∣rance, why should such a fellow take the things of God in his mouth, who hath denyed Christ in him, and the Spirit of Christ? indeed it appears that he doth take notice of nothing in him, else he would have been wounded with the Light in his own Conscience, before he had brought forth thus many Lyes; it seems he takes notice of nothing in him, but is past feeling; damnable do∣ctrine indeed, without comparison, that ever one professing to be Minister of Christ, should be so stark blind and wicked; yea, we have taken notice of what thou hast said, and it shall be recorded for ignorance of the greatest sort; but he would evade the thing and give a sence upon his words, and in such a s he owns, and in such a sence he denyes it, but what is this to the purpose, ex∣cept he confess it, (at it is) that he is unregenerate, and if so, he confess the
Light of God is in him, and then to be taken notice of, if it be but to condemn him. O blindness to be marked! well, this mans folly hath appeared sufficiently, who confesses this Light in every man is the Light of Christ, as God, and yet saith, he affirms there is nothing in him, nor any man, (regenerate or unrege∣nerate) without exception are his words here spoken) worth the taking notice of. The rest of the particulars charged upon his Fellows is passed by with the excuse of wanting the names expressed, may be he is glad to be ignorant in this thing, but let search; Iohn Burton said, That Christ had two bodies, one out of the fight of the Saints; in Bedford, May 23. 1656. And to this Iob. Bunion confesses, but would excuse it if he could, and would manifest that Christ hath two bodies, clean contrary to the Scripture, which affirms, Ephes. 4. 4. Now no marvel that he gain-sayes me, when as he hath gain-said the Apostle, who said expresly, There is one body, but they say two bodies; let them be ashamed for ever, thus to contradict Scripture. Iohn Spencly (one of the Testators of this lying Scrole, a Member of the same supposed Church) said, that Christ, and the Word of Life were two things, and so would divide Christ contrary to Ioh. 6. 48. where Christ saith, he is the bread of Life; and contrary to 1 Ioh. 1. 2. The 23d. of the 8th. Month, 1656. Iohn Bunion and one Fer, and Ioh. Child laid down; 1. That God dyed, And that very God, and the everlasting Father dyed, contrary to many Scriptures, as Dan. 4. 34. and 12. 7. 2. They affirmed, That the Word that was in the beginning was crucified upon the Cross, contrary to 1 Peter 1. 23. 3. They affirmed, That Iustification is without obedience, yet say I, None is Justi∣fied in disobedience, but all condemned in it, let them mark that; and there is but either in obedience, or in disobedience, and he that is a Believer and justified, is not without obedience. 4. That There is a light which convinceth of sin, besides the Light of Christ, and Iohn Bunion in all his Book cannot prove any is convinced of sin, that hath not the Light of Christ, or that any thing besides the Light of Christ doth convince of sin; so that his confusion doth appear. 5. That There is no saving knowledge, but what comes without from Heaven, contrary to 2 Cor. 4. 6, 7. where it is said the light shone in their hearts out of darkness, I. Child deny'd that the man Christ Jesus had given a Light to every man that comes in∣to the World, contrary to Ioh 1. 9. Also he denyed. That every man was lighted, that they might believe, contrary to Ioh. 12. 36. 35. Ioh. Burton said, That a man might be upon the foundation, and yet y Christ, Now the Scripture saith, Matth. 10. 33. He that denys Christ, shall be denyed of the Father, and the Father denys not any that are on the foundation, as they affirm. Another of them said, That the Word that was hid in Davids heart was the outward Scriptures. Another of them affirmed, That he was justified from all his sins, past, present and to ; and said, there was Scripture in the Acts to prove it. Iohn Burton said, That a man is not justified by the Spirit; Iohn Bunion said the 30. of the 11. month, That the Spirit of Christ doth nothing (Mark) with∣in , as to justification; he affirmed, That the Flesh of Christ is not within any man; then there is no man that hath life in him, if Christs words be true, Ioh. 6. 53. and Christs words is true, and therefore Iohn Bunions doctrine is damnable. He said, That by the Kingdom of Heaven, within the Pharisees, Luke 17. Christ speaks of himself there, as a personal man to be that Kingdom of Heaven; Mark here what the substance of this is; doth he mean that the person of Christ was in the Pharisees? O horrid blindness! not to be parrelelled.
He said, The best thing in a natural man is Impure, and yet in this Book confesses that the Light of God is in all men, so that must be impure, else Ioh. Bunions doct∣rine is a Lye; but the Light of God is pure, and therefore Ioh. Bunions doctrine is a Lye. He said, that the Scripture, In every place doth not mean as it speaks, and in∣stanced that in Peter, not to mean as it speaks, where it is said, yea, a lively stones are built up a spiritual house; and where it is said,  Salt in your selves; He asked if a mans belly must be filled with salt, Mark this Expositor, and his blindness and ignorance, and the cause why  is silent, And forbears to aggravate sin is, least hard thoughts should be enter∣tained against him; Let men judge, whether this be not an unfaithful man to His own Book holds this forth. the Lord, who rather then harsh thoughts should be against him in the wick∣ed, he will be silent, and hide and cover sin in sinners. O wickedness in∣deed! He saith, that Christ Ascended into Heaven in our nature, (viz) in his nature, and they that are one with him; and he and they are proved to be in corrupt na∣ture, as they will confess it. O what wickedness to hold forth that Christ is at the right hand of God in sinfull nature, as his words holds forth from his own mouth. Iohn Burton said, That men may depend too much upon something called Christ, and  righteousness of Christ within. He saith, that the Devil Knows how to take the Childrens bread (viz.) Christ Jesus who only is the Childrens bread, and give him to dogs. O sd error and damnable. He said, That the Devil deceives souls by bidding them follow the Light which they brought into the World with them. And he confesses that Light is the Light of Christ (as God) O unutteri∣ble ignorance! can a sober man read this, and not be ashamed, to hold forth, that the Devil deceives souls by bidding them follow the Light of Christ (as God)? He saith, they that follow Christ aright, must follow him without, to the cross, wi for Iustification, or monut Calvery without; they must seek for Iustification without,  the Spirit of Christ it leads to Christ without. Reader, see if this be not near unto Popery, or enquire else what he means, as if he would have people to go a Pilgrimage, and this is contratry to Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. He said, That the soul of man is the Light wherewith every man is lighted by Christ as God, and this is the Light that every man brought into the World with him, and the Devil deceives souls by this Light (viz.) by the soul, this is true from his own words, let it be marked by sober men, what damnable doctrines these are, hardly fit to be raked in. He saith further, That the Devil deceives souls by perswading them to follow the Light within, which he confesses is the Light of Christ, and that all man hath it. He saith Conscience is the Light of God, and yet in another place saith, Conscie defiled, what concurrence is here, let the Reader judge, to hold forth that the Light of God is defiled, his words plainly shews, to say, that the Law is the Schoolmaster to bring to Christ. He saith, This is a frothy Argument. And to make up his wickedness he said, He is ruled by Scripture; con whether those doctrines and lyes be not quite contrary to Scripture; what is pudency is in this mans heart, to say he is ruled by Scripture; he saith, Thy that look upon Compare this dostrine with Heb. 13. 8. and his doct∣rine is prov∣ed to be dam∣nable. Christ no otherwayes then as he was before the World was, be dare  bold to say they, are no Christians, but Antichristians, he said. That Contrary to John 1. 9. Christ as he is ∣diator, so he hoth not lighten every man that comes into the World, though as he is God,  doth, Mark here, he would divide Christ, not to be the same, the Son, as he is
the Father; yet he confesses in his Book, What the Father doth, the Son doth also; see what contradiction here is, not worth the raking in? O blindness that may be felt in the grossest darkness he inhabits. He saith, That the Devil hath more experience of the knowledge of the eternal power, and Godhead, then unregenerate men; Mark, the word more signifies something. He saith, The Light of Christ,  God, is Conscience, and Nature it self; Mark, nature is sinful, and wicked, and all are children of Wrath, in it so are all by the Light of Christ as God wicked and children of wrath if Ioh. Bunions doctrine be true, let him make it good as he can: O wonderful trash, and muddy stuff, unheard of before. He saith, The Devil deceives souls, by bidding them listen within, and see if there be not that which doth convince of sin, Mark his doctrine well. He denyes, That Pauls bids listen within, contrary to that Scripture, Rom. 10. 8, 9. He said, Conscience may be hardned and seared, and is naturally evill; and yet saith, Conscience is the Light of Christ, as God; see what an agreement is here, the Light of Christ, as God, is hardened, and seared, and evil, else Iohn Bunion must revoke his doct∣rine, or else prove this; Consider what stuff this is, which is held forth by him. He saith, he preaches not for hire; indeed, he had no need to receive money for such doctrines as these. He saith, Christ is some four or five foot long, This is more then he can, tell. He reckons the doctrine of Christ within a false, (or among false opinions. He saith, It is contrary to Scripture to say the measure or manifestation) of the Spirit is given to every man, though Paul saith so plainly to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 12. 7. Mark, here he hath spoken quite contrary to Scripture, denyed that which Paul affirmed, or else counted Pauls words no Scripture. He saith, They that are born of God do daily sin, absolute contrary to 1 Ioh. 3. 9. And therefore he would give the Apostle the lye. Now Reader consider, whether thou wilt believe Iohn Bunion, or the Apostle Iohn, for they are at odds, and speaks quite contrary one to the other. He saith, That the Light that shews thee there is a God, and that this God is eternal, would lead to life, then might Devils be delivered from damnation, and the Devils knows God as a Creator, &c. He saith, That the Light spoken of John 3. is the man Christ Iesus, and yet saith, that the man Christ Iesus is not a condemning Light. Mark, that Scripture saith, that Light was condemnation to them that did evil; he saith, not; who must you believe? He saith, That the Lyar and Slanderer is an Unbeliver, and his condition is sad. Consider here, how out of his own mouth he is condemned, who is at large proved a Lyar and Slander; out of his own mouth will the Lord condemn him. He saith, That a man cannot give a more right description of a false Prophet, then the Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles did give, Reply, In this thou hast truly said. Now lets consider, how thou hast; confessed to thy own shame, and laid open thy own nakedness, the Prophets said such were false Prophets as Preached for Hire, and divined for Mony, and fed themselves, and clothed themselves with the wool, and that used their Tongues, and said the Lord saith it, when God had not spoken to them, and that cryed peace to the wicked; and Christ said, such were Deceivers, who had the chiefest place in the Assembly, and stood praying in the Synagogues, and loved the uppermost rooms at Feasts, and that were called of men Master, and such like; and the Apostle said such were Deceivers, to take gifts and rewards, and lucre, and that loved unrigh∣teous wages, and that were Back-biters, and false Accusers, and Covetous, and having a form of Godliness, but denying the Power, who ever taught, and
the people were not able to come to the knowledge of the truth, with many other such like. Now this is my appeal to all mens Consciences, in the sight of God, whether thou art not found under some of these Charracters (at least) or whether thou art not one in union and fellowship, with such who act, these things, yea, thou are among them, and not crying against them, and so art guilty of their sin, though not as fully in the act as are some, may be; so that I doubt not, but they who have not hardened their hearts, and blinded their eyes will see, how thou hast condemned thy self in confessing the truth; and the time is coming, that further it will be made manifest concerning thee, only at present thou art sufficiently discovered, to be out of the truth in the way of perdition; and however, though thou hast covered thy self, as much as is possible, from the stroke of thy own hand, and from the guilt of thy own confession; yet Ioh. Burton, thou hast condemned an hundred, I think of Independant Ministers, (so called) thy brethren, who are known to be found guilty of those things, all or most of them, which thou confessest are marks of a false Prophet, and while thou bidst us examine our selves, thou art the man (or among them) that are proved truly guilty. He saith, He is not come to one of the dayes of the thousand years, of Satans being chain∣ed; and this is truly confessed, and so he is in the Reign and Government of the Devil, and Satan is not bound, but at liberty in him, (as it well appears) and Christs reign is not known; and so it must needs be true, that he is of the Army of the Dragon against the Lamb. Some of the same Members with him said, in Bedford, That they scorned that Light which convinceth of sin, (which the Quakers speak of.) Further, most falsly I am charged by him with railing against the Lord Jesus, which is absolute false; my words are spoken in fear and reverence of the Lord Jesus. Reader, these things I leave to thee, to be judged of, his false Slander; and his Damnable Doctrines, and wicked lying Accusations, and Contradicti∣ons which his nine sheets of paper is filled with, as if he had set himself to lye, and slanders, and speak wickedly against the truth, which is over him, and is a testi∣mony against him, and though opposed by him, yet not confounded; but him it confounds, and by it he shall be judged and condemned; and the time comes when further he may be made manifest if this be not sufficient; out of the abund∣ance of his heart, hath his wicked Tongue uttered these things, which are but a little of what lodges in him, but let him prove these things first, and then utter more. AND now Iohn Bunion, thou and thy false Witnesses, and all thy Compa∣ny, and brethren in iniquity, Remember and repent for the day of your visitation is upon you, blessed were you, if you could receive it, before it be spent, not to be recalled, and before the long suffering of God come to an end, and you be shut up in utter darkness: And indeed friends the day hastens where∣in every man shall receive according to his deeds; he that hath done evil shal not be cloaked, and he that hath done good shall not be uncovered, in that day when the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open, and searched with the eternal Eye; the end of my work is to clear the Truth, and the Way thereof, (God is witness) from thy slanderous and lying and perverting Tongue; and only I reprove thee, by the Spirit of the Lord, and so leaves thee to receive thy re∣ward from the Just God of righteous Judgement; who upon thy head wil render vengeance in flames of Fire, in his dreadfull day, which upon thee comes suddenly, even when thou and you cries peace, peace, then shall de∣struction come as an armed man, from which thou shalt not fly to escape, though now you all be hardened against the Lord, and his Way and Truth, and hath even bent thy Tongue for Lyes, and hath reproached the Innocent, to the pi∣cing of thy own soul, and one day shalt thou know it; therefore bow and
tremble before the Lord God, thou and all thy Companions; a Lyar and Slanderer thou art, a Perverter and Wrester of the right Way of God, and of the Scriptures, a Hypocrite and Dissembler, a holder forth of damnable Doctrines, an envious man, and false Accuser, condemning another falsly in what thy self is fully guilty of; these things I lay to thy charge justly in the pre∣sence of the Lord God, and upon thy account are they reckoned by him, and pro∣ved by testimony in the sight of man (and may be more fully hereafter, if any thing be wanting) and one day shalt thou feel the burthen of them, though now thou be above shame; and all thy Lyes, Slanders, Deceits, Confusions, Hypocrisies, Contradictions, and damnable Doctrines of Devils, with impudency held forth by thee, shall be consumed in the Pit of Vengeance, and then shall the Witness in thy Conscience justifie the Lord (in condemning thee,) and me, to be true in reproving thee; and this I say to thee, and you all, the Living God you know not, nor his Son Jesus Christ; but are Enemies to God, and * per∣secuters of the Lord of Life, and shall perish among the Uncircumcised: Ye false Witnesses, and wicked Helpers, you may be ashamed of your testimony subscribed at the beginning of his lying scribble; will you yet say through Grace, those things are true; the rather stop your mouthes in the dust, who hath offended the Lord, more then defended him, or your selves; and be ashamed in the presence of God and man; much more may be said hereafter, to lay you further open, if you yet harden your hearts in your wickedness, but I do rather reprove you, then strive with you, and rather desires your return to God, then your Condemnation by him, and with this I shall end; and by what is said in short is sufficient to manifest you, and Iohn Bunion to all honest people, what Generation you are of, and that you are guided by, a lying and unclean spirit, and that you are doing the Devils works in gain-saying the Way of Truth and Righteousness, by your multitude of Lyes and Slanders, and dam∣nable Doctrines; and what ever you account, or falsly judge of me, yet am I true, (though as a Deceiver) and the Lords Servants, and a Witness for him, and against all your Lyes and Slanders, and Wickedness hatched amongst you, and brought forth by a lying Orator, whom you have made your mouth, into the view of the World, even a cursed Birth, and the Father of it, and the Womb that conceived it, and it shall rot, and perish as the dung, and not accomplish any part of the end, of your desire; for so loathsome it is, being truly search∣ed, and laid open, that it hath not obtained neither the praise of God nor man, but is defamed by men, and condemned of God: Alas, alas, for thee Iohn Bunion thy several months travel in grief and pain, is a fruitless Birth, and perishes as an untimely Fig, and its praise is blotted out among men, and its passed away as smoak; Truth, is atop of thee, and out-reaches thee, and thy formed weapons cannot prosper, and it shall stand for ever to confound thee, and all its Enemies: and though thou wilt not subject thy mind to serve it willingly, yet a Slave to it must thou be, and what thou dost in thy wickedness against it, the end thereof brings forth the glory of it, and thy own confounding and shame; and now be wise and learned, and put off thy Armour, for thou mayst understand the more thou strives, the more thou art entangled, and the higher thou arises in Envy, the deeper is thy fall into Confusion, and the more thy Arguments are, the more in∣creased is thy folly, let experience teach thee, and thy own wickedness correct thee, and thus I leave thee; and if thou wilt not own the Light of Christ in thy own Conscience, now to reprove thee, and convince thee, yet in the day of Judge∣ment thou shalt own it, and it shall witness the justness of the Judgements of the Lord, when for thy Iniquities he pleads with thee; and behold as a Thief in the night, when thou art not aware, he will come; and then, woe unto thee that art poluted. By a Friend to Truth, EDWARD BURROUGH.
Many Strong Reasons CONFOUNDED, VVhich would hinder any reasonable man from being a Quaker; And Offences taken out of the way. But particularly, Four and twenty Arguments Overturned and Confuted; put forth, and sent into the World by Richard Baxter, a professed Minister; but a fre∣quent Contender against the Wayes of God. And this is an Answer to a Sheet of his, cried up and down the Streets in London, as some excellent piece; but is proved to be full of Lyes, Slanders, and false Reproaches against an Innocent People. And this is sent forth in the pursuit thereof, that people may not be de∣ceived with every lying Monster which is brought forth to publick view; but first let all things be tryed, and onely that which is good held fast. HOW long shall it be, ere the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, and the measure of this Generations iniquity be fulfilled, who rush into iniquity as a Horse into the battel, and who hastens to fill up the largest measure of iniquity of any Generation that ever went before? Is it not plain and manifest to all people that have but an eye to see? How doth the wicked run on greedily, drinking up iniquity as an Oxe drinks water? How doth the Archers of Babylon shoot at the Innocent, and makes the harmless their prey? But this is but for a moment, the end thereof is nigh; and because the De∣vils time is but short, therefore he is come down in rage, and hath filled the hearts of many people with raving envy and despite against the Lord and his people, whom the Lord is a gathering out of the mouths of all their Enemies; and the Serpents seed, it bruiseth the heel, but its head is deadly wounded by the Seed of God. And whereas many hath set themselves in oppsition against the Lord, and their work is become a stink, and a proverb to be laughed at in Generations to come, yet must not the wicked cease their wickedness, till their measure be per∣fectly accomplished. And whereas Richard Baxter, a professed Minister in Worcestershire, known to many by his fruits to be a corrupt Tree which brings
not forth good fruit, who sends out of his study Lyes and false Reports, and vain Arguments to blind the Eyes of People, that they may not see the Truth, and hath written once and again against the people of God, which he in scorn calls Quakers, some of which writings have been sufficiently answered, and his shame and folly seen openly by all people; yet he (as a man not weary of wickedness) hath sent forth a Paper, which he calls, A Sheet against the Quakers; wherein what was wanting of wickedness in his former, is now fully brought forth out of his Vessel, (a malicious heart) which cannot contain within it self its rage, and fury, and madness against the Innocent; but need must his folly break forth openly, that all men may see it: And in thi his foolish Paper he hath twen∣ty four reasons, which he saith, Moves him to conceive that no Christian or reasonable man should be a Quaker, or approve of, or excuse their way; now his Reasons we shall try. But first of all I say, It had been more honest for him to have made a sufficient Reply to have defended his former works, and cleared himself of his former Lyes and Slanders truly charged against him, then to have past that slight∣ly, and begin anew to revile; for that Book which he often mentions, and boasts of, called, The Quakers Catechism, was sufficiently answered, and his folly laid open, by a Friend to the Truth, in a Book called, An Answer to the Quakers Catechism, to which Book he never equally replyed to this day, which had been more honest to have cleared himself from what is truly charged against him in that answer, then to have begun afresh to reproach and speak wickedness; and this all people may consider of. 1. His first Reason which he brings forth against the Quakers, is, That they deny, and revile the Churches and Ministers of Christ; and yet said he cannot tell indeed of any Church or Ministry which is to be preferred before those that they do despise. Answ. To this I answer, This is utterly false; for we do not deny the Church and Ministers of Christ, nor do revile them, or any others whatso∣ever, but speaks the truth in nakedness to all people: The Church of Christ we own, and are of it, which are gathered out of the World through the preaching of the Gospel, and seperated from the World, and all its works and wayes, which are evil, and are joyned to Christ the Head, in the Spirit, and one to another, as Members of Christ; and these are born again, and are Redeemed out of the World, and are of the Kingdom of Christ, and of his Church, and Members of his body; and this we own to be a Church, and are of it, who hath no fellowship with darkness, nor no part with the practice of the works of dark∣ness. And the Ministers of Christ we own, who have received the Gift of the Mi∣nistry by the Holy Ghost, and exerciseth that Gifs by the Holy Ghost, whose call is from God, and their work of God, and their end alone his glory; such we own to be Ministers of Christ, and doth not revile or deny (as he falsly saith) such a Church, and such Ministers of Christ; but this we do, and without of∣fence to God too, we do deny and bear our witness against such a people who professeth themselves to a Church, and yet are in the pride, in the wickedness, and in the evil of this World, and not redeemed, clensed, and seperated from the works and iniquities thereof, such we do reprove for their Hypocrisie, even ll them that owns a title to a Church, because they were sprinkled when they were Infants, and hath not another ground; and such who professeth them∣selves Ministers of Christ, who hath not received their Ministry by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, neither are led by the Spirit of Christ, but are such as Christ nd the Apostles declared against, such we cannot own to be Ministers of Jesus Christ, but doth reprove them, and deny them; even such who Preacheth for Hire, and hath Gifts and Rewards for Preaching, and set-places for so much a ear, these we disown, and yet doth not offend God herein: And this in honesty  do shew to all people, what that professed Church and professed Ministry is which we do deny, and what that Church and Ministry is which we do set up to e preferred, which is a right Ministry, and a right Church: And thus his reason∣less
reason is overturned, and confounded, and is found to be no sufficient rea∣son wherefore a man should not be a Quaker. 2. His second reason is, No wise man can be a Quaker (saith he) because their Religion is an uncertain thing, and so is not the Religion that must save us, &c. I answer, This again is utterly false, and no man that hath Gods wisdom would speak it; for our Religion which we profess is a certain thing, and we have openly declared it once and again, and this is it, To believe in Christ, and to receive Christ, and to be lead by the Spirit of Christ, and taught in all things to love God with all the Heart, and a mans neighbour as himself; and through the Power of Christ dwelling in man, to do all good, and to be kept from all evil: This in very short is our Religion, and it is a very certain and established Religion, and this Religi∣on we all agree in: And this in short is the substance, of our faith, Even Christ in us, believed on, and received by us, This is the Truth, and his lyes is judged; and if he say this is an uncertain Religion, let him give it under his hand, and sub∣scribe to it, and he shall have a further Reply. 3. His third Reason is, No man of Reason should be a Quaker, considering that a∣mongst those scraps of their Religion which is made known, there is so much notorious falsd and ungodliness, saith he. Ans. Let all Christian people mark this his Reason, they are even lyes heaped one upon another: What secret Slanders are these behind our Backs, who ne∣ver would clear himself of what is truly charged against him in answer to his Catechism? his words are turned by as utter lyes: for that which we profess and practice for Religion, which we have made known by word and writing, is, up∣rightness, godliness, sincerity and truth, and neither notorious falshood, not ungodliness, as he wickedly saith: And why did not he make it appear what this notorious falshood and ungodliness had been? that had been more honest, then to cast his charges, and prove nothing. And whereas he saith, The very pers of Christ Iesus many of them do blaspheme, &c. this is utterly false, for Jesus Christ have we owned and believed in onely, and for his sake we do, and suffer ha things. 4. His fourth Reason is, saith he, Because their false pernicious Doctrines, t practical Religion doth much consist in most notorious wicked injustice and uncharitable∣ness, &c. Ans. Here is lye upon lye uttered, and wickedness joyned to wickedness, and drunk up as an Oxe drinks up water, and no conscience made thereof by Richard Baxter; it had been just to have mentioned these pernicious Doctrines, their practical Religion, injustice, and uncharitableness, and not to have slander∣ed in the dark: but we are delivered by the Lord from all pernicious Doctrines and notorious wickedness whatsoever, and we find this false Reproacher guilty himself and his people, of what he accuseth the Innocent: And so his words are true unto himself, and upon his own head I turn them. 5. His fifth Reason is, The worst of all, saith he, is, That they behave themselves like malignant Enemies to the very Church, and Gospel, and Servants of Iesus Christ, &c. Ans. This man speaks as if he had sold himself wholly to lye: but my answer to his first Reason is sufficient to answer this also, and doth say, That the Cse and the Church, and the Gospel and Servants of Iesus Christ we do fully and freely , and are daily exercised therein as the very Servants of Iesus, and are Friends thereof i our hearts, and doth not behave our selves in any way as Enemies thereunto: God will judge every lying tongue, and shall condemn our false Accusers guilty of that which they charge the guiltless, to reprove and bear witness against the wil, wicked, and rude conversations, and against such as have gotten the Saints words, and by art frame an hours discourse thereupon for so much a Sermon, or so much a year, to deny such to be a Church of Christ, and Ministers of Christ, this we do, and doth not behave our selves like Enemies to the Church,
or Gospel, or Ministers and Servants of Christ, as our Adversary wickedly saith. 6. His sixth Reason, saith he, That part of the Quakers peculiar Religion which con∣sists not in error and malignant impudency, is made up very much of it of childish and unrea∣sonable foppery, &c. Ans. As I have said, No part of our Religion consists in error and malignant impudency, and as for that which he calls childish and unreasonable foppery, we stand not to mans judgement, for it is a small thing with us for to be judged of any man; for we do acknowledge that we are become fools for Christs sake, and herein we have cause to glory, though he upbraid us with it; and it was such as he who called Paul a Babler, and that his Doctrine was madness, as he saith ours is foppery; and let him know, that which is foolishness with man, is wisdom with God; and we know God will confound the wisest of men by that which they may judge to be foolish, and unreasonable, and foppery; for to such who are lost our Gospel is hid, where the god of this World hath blinded their Eye, as it is plain he hath done this our Adversaries, and that is the reason wherefore he hath sent forth such lying Scribbles from his study of wicked in∣ventions; and let him make the best use of his wisdom he can, he can but serve the Devil with it, while his wisdom is sensual and divillish: And let him leave us to our childishness and folly, and let the issue prove whether is the safer guide. 7. His seventh Reason is, saith he, Their malignancy doth blinde them to make that the principal cause of their rage, and reviling the Ministry, which is plainly agreeable to the will of God, and necessary to the Churches good. Ans. This is false also; we are not blinded, but doth see Richard Baxter and all such, to be out of the Way of Truth and Peace: And as for rage, and reviling against the Ministers, that is false also, though indeed we do openly re∣prove deceivers; and we know it is not agreeable to the will of God, and ne∣cessary to the Churches good, though he saith it is, for Ministers of Christ to take tythes, or to have a set-maintenance; for never none of the Ministers of Christ that we read of in Scripture, either took tythes to maintain them, or had a set-maintenance; but all that Christ allows to his Ministers, is to eat such things as were set before them. And in that he saith, We liken them to covetous Priests among the Iews, that is true; to whom should we liken them but to them that practised the same things as they do? And I am sure there never was Priests in any Generation that were more covetous then these of England are, as in many particulars might be shewed; for as the false prophets in Israel did, so do these in many things; and what the Ministers of Christ did, these do not: And whereas he pleads for Tythes, never Minister of Christ did in the Gospel-administration claim the tenth of peoples labours, nor none of the Ministers of Christ were Maintained by Tythes, but lived of the Gospel which they preached, which livelyhood was not great sums of money, and compelling some of it too from the people by a Law; but the Churches ministered to the Apostles ne∣cessities, whom the Apostles had begotten to the faith, and planted them as a Vinyard, and kept them as a Flock: But the manintenance of the Priests of England is another case, they must have so much a year, and people is bound to pay them, and sometimes so much a Sermon; and they maintain themselves in idleness, and fulness, and pride, and spend the Creation more then upon their necessities: but he saith Concerning Tythes, That Tythes are the Churches, and not the peoples, and by the Law of the Land too. What the Law of the Land re∣quires, which is just, we do own, and do not resist it; but what the Law of the Land commands, which is contrary to the Law of God, as the Law is which commands to pay Tythes; we cannot be obedient to it; for we read in the He∣brews, that Law which commanded to pay Tythes, and take Tythes in the old Co∣venant, is put to an end, and Christ the second Priesthood established, and the Priesthood being changed, there was a necessity of the change of the Law also
which upheld the priesthood: Then whence is that Law of the Land which com∣mands ythes of God or otherwise? judge ye, seeing the Scripture saith, The Commandment going before (viz. that gave Tythes, is disannulled. 8. His eighth Reason, The Quakers way is too cruel and uncharitable to be the way of God; they damn (saith he) the most humble, holy, faithful Servants of God, to whom God hath promised life, &c. Answ. This is not the least of his Lyes, our Way is Christ, and is neither cruel nor uncharitable, but pure, and holy, and zealous against all sin, and cannot bear and suffer iniquity, but reproves it; neither do we damn any, but warns all to repent, to be humble and lowly, that they may have the promise of life; and we sharply reprove sin, and Deceivers, and Deceit, and this makes the men of this Generation mad, and calls it cruel and unchari∣table, when as we do but warn them of their sins, shewing them if they live in sin they perish, and if they repent and turn to God, they shall be saved; and God hath given us the spirit of discerning, and by their fruits we do know a child of God from a child of the Devil, and herein do establish the Gospel, and not repeal it, though he falsly saith so; neither do we condemn any who fear the Lord, in any thing they do or speak in his fear, but with such we have unity, who walks in uprightness in the midst of a malicious World, and perverse Generati∣on, as this is. 9. His nineth Reason, saith he, After all their sins they most impudently pretend to  sinless perfection, &c. Ans. What such as are in darkness doth conceive of us, and so utters, i matters not; but many of us do witness that Christ hath done away our sins and in him we are compleat through saith, in which we are perfect without sin, and it is not of our selves; and that perfection we exhort all to press after, that they may be perfect in Christ Iesus without sin: And he saith, They themselves desire a sinless perfection, and confesseth it is their command and duty, and yet saith it is an impudent prete in us to profess that which himself confesseth they desire, and is their comman: and duty; and this is great confusion, and comes out of Babylons store; And though he would falsly suppose that the Quakers sup∣pose to have no need of Christ, and saith he, They dare (it seems) say they will not  beholding to God, or to the Blood of Christ for the pardon of sin; but these are his foolis imaginations, for we are beholding to Christ, and to his Blood onely, which hath clensed us from all sin, and by it our sins and trespasses are blotted out, and forgiven: And we do not think highly of our selves, though he impudently chargeth it upon us, and hath bent his tongue for Lyes, and made them his refuge and strong Reasons. 10. His tenth Reason, That we do in many Doctrines so openly comply with the Papis, that people may see plainly that the Iesuits and Fryars are our Leaders; and he saith, this hath been proved by many Confessions, &c. Ans. The Papist we utterly deny, their Doctrines, their wayes, and what∣soever favours of Popery, and are not lead by any other, but by Jesus Christ, a our lives and Doctrines doth make appear to all that have an eye to see; i true we may be falsly slandered and accused by Richard Baxter, and by t Priests and the wicked people of the World, for it is enough for us to be as o Master Christ, who was called a Devil; and as was he, so are we slandered an accused in this and many other things: But that ever it was proved that we a led by Jesuits and Fryars, this is one of our Adversaries slanders he hath on and again accused us; but he never proved it, though now he saith, the Papi make the Scriptures a dead Letter, and no Rule of faith, and so do we: The Papist cry down our Church and Ministers, (saith he) The Iesuits cryes up free-will and sufficie Grace to all, and a common sufficient Light to all, and so do we (saith he:) The Papi extenuate imputed righteousness in setting up inherent righteousness: and the Papist ple most in external abstenances and observances, and so do we, saith he, &c. To all this I answer, what is truth we hold and maintain in the power of God, and may
not deny it, though the Papists may hold the same in words, which seldom they do; for we hold the truth, for the truths sake, and dare not deny the truth, though the Devil confess it in words; but he hath falsly compared us with the Papists and Jesuites; for we do not hold free-will in the creature, neither do we extenuate imputed righteousness, neither do we place most in external bste∣nances and observances, herein Richard Baxter hath belyed us: But wh I should measure him by his own rule, and should say that the Jesuites and yars are his Leaders? Why, because the Papists say Christ was born of Mary; and did many Miracles, and dyed, being Crucified of the Iew, and was buryed, and rose again, and so doth Richard Baxter say, and all the Prest ians in England, and therefore may we conjecture, they do busts, or open Infidels, as he saith concerning us. But fur sprinkling Infants is baptizing into the faith of Ch be free from sin while they are upon Earth, and   aga error, and thus doth Richard Baxter and his ny, and therefore by his own Arguments he may be judged that the Jesuits and yars are  Leaders, and that he prepares people to be Papists; but I will not   unchar  judge him so by this rule, as he hath falsly done us, though  do know in the Light of God there is a greater concurrence in Doctrine, and cticesation, between many of our Accusers and the Papists, then there is between Papists and us, and the Light of Christ in all Consciences shall answer me in the day of Gods righteous Judgements, and the Papists and him we do deny, and see them to be of one spirit, though differing in appearances; and what we are it is by Grace, and not of our selves; and what we do it is through Christ, and not by our selves, and to God we appeal for judgement, and tramples upon all mens vain conceiving, false judgements, Lyes and Slanders, and turns them back to them again where they were hatched. 11. His eleventh Reason: He saith, Our Doctrine are self-contradictory, and there∣fore they cannot be of God, &c. Ans. To this I answer, This is false, our Doctrines do agree in one, and are not self-contradictory, though falsly he may judge of this, as he may judge of other things; if he had been in Christs time, likely he would have judged his words self-contradictory, who said, Except you eat my Flesh, and drink my Blood, you have no Life in you; and yet at the same instant of time said, The Flesh profiteth nothing; with many other such instances as might be brought. Why, but Ric. Baxter tells you, We say all men have a sufficient light within them, and goes up & down, preaching it with great zeal. This is no more then the Apostle Iohn did, who told the Saints they needed no man to teach them, but as the Anointing in them, and yet preach∣ed unto them, and wrote Epistles to them, but bid Iohn contradict himself? let wise men judge. And Iohn said, Christ lighteth every man that comes into the World with the true Light; and no more then he did, do we contradict our seves herein, for we follow the same example, and we say the Saints have the Anointing in them, and needs no man to teach them, and yet do we exhort them as the Apostle Iohn did. And he asks, what do we peach, If darkness, who would have such Teachers? if light, what needless labour is this, when all men have sufficient light already, &c. To all this I answer, We preach light that all should believe in it, and thereby should be lead out of darkness, and the light is sufficient, being believed in by the Crea∣ture, but all are not lead by it sufficiently. neither doth receive Christ: And we may ask him now, and say, If he preach darkness (as it is likely he doth, rather then the light, because he smites at preaching the light that hath lighted every man that cometh into the World, and so in effect denies the Lord that brought him) then who would have such a Preacher; but if he preach the light, and not that Light which doth enlighten every one that cometh into the World, which is Christ, and is suffici∣ent, (as it seems by his own words he doth not, because he condemns us for it) then is he a Minister of Antichrist, according to his own confession. But whatever he judges, we are sent to turn people from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to
the power of God, and herein we do as the Ministers of Christ did; but that we revile the Ministers of Christ as blind Guides, as saith he, this false is again; but such we bear witness against who preacheth for Hire, and oppresseth the Com∣mon-wealth, and are in the steps of the proud Pharisees, and all people that fol∣lows them are in darkness as the Pharisees were, and in the way of Damnation, because they are not in the truth who follows not Christ, and yet such people are lightened with the light of Christ, and that is their Condemnation, because they believe not in it, and it is sufficient to the Condmnation of all such. 12. His twelfth Reason: Saith he, Consider also how sutable their Doctrine is  the interest and pleasure both of the Papist and the Devil, why, saith he, they damn all the Ministers and Churches of CHRIST, &c. To this I answer, A lying Tongue is but for a moment; though he makes Lyes his refuge, yet they shall be sweept away. Of the Ministers and Churches of Christ are we, and such as are so, they we own, and are one with them, though this man saith otherwise; and it doth little appear that our Doctrine is sutable to the interest and pleasure of the Papists, for we find them our Enemies, and Gods Enemies, and bears our witness against them, as against the Devil, and do say that they are his off-spring, and that the Priests of England are their off-spring, such as are open Lyars especially: But if we should reckon, we should find their Doctrine more agreeable to the Papists in many things, then ours are, as I have instanced concerning sprinkling of Infants, and other things; but doth it follow that the Papists and we agree, because the Papists declare against them out of cruelty and wickednesse, and out of a murderous mind to divert people into Idolatry and wicked superstition; and we declare against them out of love to peoples souls, that they should not always be deceived, and alwayes learning, and never able to come to the knowledg of the Truth; and hath no other end to our selves, God is our witnesse, but that people may be converted to the knowledg of God; and as I said before, though the Papists may hold some truth in words, and cry against some sort of people out of a wicked end, yet may not we therefore deny the truth as it is in Jesus, neither must be silent is declaring against sin and wickednesse; and let him say what he will concert∣ing any advantage the Devil reaps by us, it will but be the overthrow of his very kingdom: Why, but saith he, If we do but unchurch all the reformed Churches, the Papists will give us a fee: I say it is a hard thing to unchurch them that never were truly churched; and that we seek to unchurch such as are the Churches of Christ, this is utterly false, and the Papists fee, and his reproach, we tram∣ple upon them both together; and let him take the Papists fee, as he pleads for it, for it was they first that took tythes for a fee, and it is he now that strongly pleads for them, to be maintained in his Ministry by them. 13. His thirteenth Reason: Saith he, the Doctrine and practice of the Quakers is contrary to the experience and holy nature of the Saints; why, saith he, they have sound a renewed light and life by the Scriptures and Ministry which the Quakers make so light of, &c. To this I answer, this is as false as the rest, for with all the Saints that ever were upon earth, both in Doctrine and Practice we agree with them; and as  the peoples sakes of England, I wish his words were true, and that they ha indeed found a renewing light and life by this Ministry; but though he may boast of it now, in the day of Gods righteous judgments it shall be found other∣wise, when it shall be tryed, that the renewing hath been but in form and ap∣pearance, from one likenesse to another, and not a renewing from death to life; and though there hath been sometimes appearing, a zeal and a desire after him in the Ministry of England in times past, yet from this day hath the Lord for∣saken them, and such as were sober and sincere in what was made manifest, are now become Revilers and Reproachers, Slanderers and Persecutors of the People of God, and from hence-forth shall they not boast of many being Conver∣ted
by them from sin unto the way of Righteousness. But further he saith, We tell the people that their Ministry doth the people no good, and none are the better for it: If we do, we tell them true: And though he saith, The experiences of many thou∣sands doth confute this, yet say I, the experiences of ten thousand times so many more shall confirm it: It is true, there may be thousands like himself which will not stumble to belye their own souls, as he hath done of us; yet betwixt him and I in this matter God shall be our Judg, who hath not sent this Ministry, and yet it hath run, therefore it doth not, nor shall not profit the people at all: He saith, It is quite contrary to the nature of Saints to damn and reproach the Saints, and call them the children of the Devil: This is true; but it is not contrary to the nature of the Saints to reprove Hypocrites, such as profess that which they do not enjoy, and speak that which they have not received from the Lord, but steal from other mens words, such are many of the Teachers of England; and it was the way of Christ and his Apostles soundly to reprove such: And this is our way, and we do not reproach the Saints, nor damn them, and yet to the wicked, which are not Saints, we dare not cry peace, but do say, The wicked, and such who forget God, shall be turned into Hell: And for this, David is our example. 14. His fourteenth Reason: He saith, The Quakers are unlikely to be better then other men seeing they are so notoriously proud; and thus this pride doth appear: Saith he, It is the supposed Spirit of God, and the extraordinary holiness, and inspiration, and abilities, that they are proud of, and saith he, They proclaim themselves perfect without sin. And this is the pride he chargeth us with, &c. To which I answer, We say that in Christ we are compleat, as the Apostles said to the Churches, and do not boast of it, neither are proud of it more then the Churches were, but in the Lord we will glory, and in him rejoyce again and again; and it is that which we press after, and exhort all to press after, to be perfect in him who takes away our sins, and gives power over the temptations of the Devil. And he saith, We pretend to know mens hearts: Yea, we do know that the heart of man is desperately wicked and deceitful above all things; and by mens words and works, we do know their hearts to be evil that acts and speaks wickedness; For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh: And if we should say we do not know mens hearts that acts and speaks wickedness, we should be Lyars: but as I said, What we are it is by grace in Christ, and we boast not of it in the flesh, but our glorying is onely in the Lord in Spirit, that our names are written in the Book of life. And as for our crying against Deceivers, which he so much stumbles at, it is but the practice of Christ and his Apostles, as may be read through the Scriptures, and yet we do it not, no more then they did in self-exaltation, though he would charge us with it. 15. His fifteenth Reason: Saith he, They plainly discover a persecuting spirit: Why (saith he) what man can in reason think but that they run up and down the World to bring Ministry into hatred, &c. To this I answer, Little of this doth appear that our spirits are persecuting spirits, for we pray for our Enemies, and do forgive them that do evil intreat us, and renders to no man evil for evil; for if we had sought vengeance, or pro∣secuted the good Laws of England against those that had wronged and robbed us, and unjustly caused us to be put in Prison, many might have deeply suffered by true Justice before this day, if we had not forgiven our Enemies, and blessed them that hated us: Such hath been the cruelty acted upon us, that many might have been arraigned for felony, if we had sought the prosecution of the good Laws, and not forgiven our Enemies. Why, but the main thing is, because we are moved to go up and down the World and declare against the false Ministers, and holding forth that Ministry, and truly applying it to many of the Teachers of England: But let all the World know, this is not from a persecuting spirit, not more then Isaiah did it, and Micah, and the rest of the Pro∣phets and Apostles, who did zealously give their testimony against such as went for gifts and rewards, as the Teachers of England do; but this is that which he is offended at, and calls it a persecuting spirit, which is not so, but in love to peoples
souls, that they may deny the evil, and follow the good: And that our Ancesters have persecuted to death, as he saith, This is also a lye, and of the Devil, for our An∣cestors were the Saints, who were called of God, and were not of the World, even as we are not of the World, and we are persecuted, but seeks not to perse∣cute any, and gives our witness faithfully against this Generation, and against the sins both of Teachers and people; and this I suppose is it, even our zeal for the Name of the Lord against unrighteousness, which he falsly calls a persecuting spirit. 16. His sixteenth Reason is, Some Interrogatories, (saith he) What reasona∣ble man should turn Quaker that sees the common fruit of their Doctrine? wh good do they do where-ever they come, but (saith he) hate both godly Teacher and peo∣ple, &c. Ans. To this I answer, The fruit of our Doctrine is begetting people to the Knowledge of God, and a converting them from sin and death, and from the wayes and works of unrighteousness, to be the Servants of the Lord; and every spiritual man doth see this to be the fruit of our doctrine: It doth condemn unrighteousness, and bring war and a sword upon Earth, as Christs Doctrine did. And this is the good, where we come, many are changed from wicked∣ness, rudeness, and ungodliness, to live soberly, righteously, and purely in this present World, without offence towards God and men. For to say, We make people both to hate godly Teachers and people, this is utterly false, for we endea∣vour to bring people to the true Teacher, Christ Jesus, and to have fellowship with the Saints: It's true, in the World our Doctrine doth make division, and doth set a man at variance, and doth set Father against Son, and Son against Father, even as Christ did, and his Doctrine, so he saith we do. But again he belyes us, in saying, We bring people into confusion and abominable error, or that we cast people into a malicious mood, or tincture of bitterness, this is also false, and this is my Answer, He that doth the will of our Father, knows of our Doctrine, whether we we of God, or of our selves, and to all the World besides we are unknown, and desires to be manifest to every mans conscience in the Sight of God, and not to that wisdom which is of this World: And though he scorn at such who are made to cast off their Points and Lace, yet is not this more then any fruit that his Doctrine hath brought forth? for as  do, so did the Apostle exhort against all superflui of naughtiness, as Points and L are; and it seems that such as depart from iniquity become a prey to such wicked men slandering and scornful Tongues, and a matter to makes Books of, to send into the World. 17. His seventeenth Reason: Saith he, It is no great encouragement to us to turn Quakers, when we consider who are their followers, very few experienced sober Christians turn to them, (saith he) but such who are ignorant, and ungrounded, and raw professors, &c. Answ. To this I answer, Let no man take encourgement from without, to turn Quakers, or to own the Way of Gods Salvation, But let every one feel a Measure of God in his own heart, converting him from sin unto righteousness, and drawing his mind from the vanity and hypocrisie of this World, to the truth and singleness of heart: And he appears to be of the spirit of the Pharisees, who said, None but a company of poor people which were accursed, fol∣lowed Christ; and so saith he, in effect, None but such as are ignorant, and such like: But what if there were not any other, but such who owned the Way of the Lord? this is a confirmation of it, rather then a cause of objecting against it, when such who are ignorant are brought to the Knowledge of God: But yet his words are false, for it is known, that very many honest, humble, sober  and people, who have all their dayes been sincere towards God in what they have known of him, have and do own us; and indeed, all that ever ow God and Salvation, shall own us, for we are of God, and he that is of God hea us, and the whole World Lyes in wickedness: And such as are self-conceited and in pride, and wise in their own eyes, and in the wickedness of the
World, such are his followers, and not ours, though be falsely say it; for such as follow Christ have we fellowship with, and not with such as walk in darkness. 18. His eighteenth Reason: Saith he, It is an evident Iudgment of God upon these people that turn Quakers, and a punishment for their former sins, &c. Ans. To this I answer, The Lord God, his Angels, and all his Saints and Servants I call to record against thee, and they all shall witness that it is Mercy, and not Judgement, upon them that owns the way of the Lord: And them that owned the Quakers in truth and sincerity, have and do witness a remission of their former sins and forgiveness of them by Jesus Christ, and not a punish∣ment for them: And Rich. Baxter may please himself and some others with his reasonless Reasons, as these are; yet they are not worthy of the name of Reason, they be so senceless and utterly false. And though he rails against the Anabaptists as well as against us, yet any man whose eye is open, sees his folly, and turns it upon his own head: and he may conceit himself in these things for a moment. but the day of the Lord will declare it otherwise, and that upon us Mercy and Peace shall be, and not Judgement nor Wrath. 19. His ninteenth Reason: Saith he, They are already in division among themselves, as the contention between, Nayler, and Fox, and their followers do shew. To this I answer, Though an occasion may come and be taken against the truth, yet wo unto him by whom it comes, and to them who do receive it, for the Testimony of Truth abids for ever. But as about that division he speaks of, it hath been answered by writings several times, and now I say, It hap∣pened but as a Tryal to the Lords People, and not to destroy them; though the Enemy boasts himself because of it, yet the Lord knows how to preserve his in the midst of Temptation: But these things are now at an end, though a Temptation presented it self yet it overcame not, and truth is the same, and the Testimony thereof doth never change: and all these Refuges which the Wicked flyes unto shall not cover them when the Lord appears. 20. His twentieth Reason: And saith he, To make all their delusions more odious wickednesse, they father it upon the Holy Ghost. Ans. His words are utterly false: yet we say we have received the Holy Ghost which teacheth us, and leadeth us into all truth, and by it are we lead out of all Wickedness and Delusion, and all wicked speeches, which he brands us withall, and these things are his own, for he is seen to be in delusion, and odious wick∣edness, and wicked speeches. And saith he, They speak against the DOCTRINE of the SPIRIT, and cryes down the love of the Saints, and against the Ordinances of the Ministers of Christ. To this I have answered, In the love and union with all the Saints we are, and Ministers of Christ, but against Hypocrisie we declare, such who profess what they are not, and use their tougues, and saith the Lord saith, when the Lord hath not spoken to them; and sprinkle Infants, and saith it is an Ordinance of Christ; and singing Davids experiences in Rime and Meeter, with many other things which the Priests hath in their practice; such things we deny to be Ordinances of Christ, and them to be Ministers of Christ, which do practice them; and this we do say by the Spirit of Truth: But that we pronounce damnation against Gods Church and holy Servants, this is false again, and is but the fulfilling the number of his lyes; and though he charge us secretly with preaching another Gospel, then that which Paul preached, is false, and if we duely examine, it will be he that will be found preaching another Gospel, whose practice is found in many things contrary to them who were Ministers of the true Gospel, and so the curse pronounced by the Apostle will fall upon him, and not upon us in the day of Judgement. 21. His one and twentieth Reason: Saith he, The Quakers themselves renounce  words the Ranters and Papists, as a deluded sort. Answer. To which I answer and say, Yea, not only in words, but in lives
lives also we utterly abhor the Ranters and Papists both in profession and pra∣ctice, and do know that Rich. Baxter is of the same spirit, though differing in words. But saith he, The Ranters and Drunkards cryes out against the same Ministers, same exercise, and godly people, as the Quakers do. To which I answer, What the Ranters and Drunkards may do in their wickedness and unclean spirits, is one thing, and what we do in the fear of God, and tender love to peoples Souls, is another thing; but how uncharitable is this man in his judgment? Let us try him, as if I should say, The Ranters, and Drunkards, and Prophane, and all ungodly People, they are our Enemies, and do oppose and gainsay the Way of God, and the people called Quakers, and they Beat them, and Reproach them, and Slander them, and doth much cruelty unto them; and thus doth Richard Baxter of Kidderminster, he reviles them, and reproaches them, and belyes them, and therefore he is one with the Ranters, and Drunkards, and pro∣phane people, and he holds part of the Papists Ranters, and Drunkards do∣ctrine and practice: And thus he is judged with his own Rule, according as  hath judged us, by the same Rule, and now say I, as well as he of us, Let any man judge that hath not forsworn all wit and reasons whether it is likely the Holy Ghost will inspire Richard Baxter and a company of Priests of Engl, to acquaint them with the same Points, Doctrines, and Practices, which the Papists, Ranters Drunkards, and all prophane people exercise themselves in; for as all they are Enemies to the Quakers, so is he and his company. A farther I ask him, Whether the same things be heavenly in Rich. Ba and his company, which be hellish in the Ranters and Drunkards? And whether Richard Baxter hath not condemned himself and the Priests of Eng∣land, in condemning the Papists, and Ranters, and Drunkards, and prophane people, in acting the very same things, to wit, speaking against, reproaching, reviling, and slandering, and backbiting an innocent people of God, called Quakers? 22. His two and twentieth Reason: And saith he, If I have any Reason to  weary of the Christian Catholick Reformed Religion, what reason have I to turn Qua more then to any other Sect? Why (saith he) how do they prove they are more in the ri then any other, &c. Ans. To all this I answer, this is according to his knowledge, who sees  difference between good and evil, between such as serveth God, and such as serves him not; and how can this man be a Teacher of others that is so blind himself; The true Christian Religion he is out of, and in a Sect, whose frui are as bad as the Papists or Familists, or any others; for I believe not the wor of Sects could have brought forth more lyes and slanders, and scoffing wor in one sheet of paper, then he hath done in this which now I deal withal. And as for our proof that we are in the right way, to every man that hath an eye to see, and an ear to hear, and an heart to conceive, it's easie to be proved, and such are satisfied; but as for Unbelievers and Persecutors, such as himself, they must hear and see, and not perceive and understand. 23. His three and twentieth Reason: Saith he, The way by which they pr is not producing any evidence, for they renounce that, and offers all from the Aut of the spirit within them, &c. Ans. The way by which we prevail is by the the Spirit of the Lord which  within us, and that was the way whereby all the Ministers of Christ ev prevailed, by the authority of that. But yet this is false, we do not deny  produce Evidence, but is sufficiently able, and hath done it, to produce Evi out of the Scriptures, to prove all things which we profess or practice for Reli∣gion. But saith he, They must prove their Commission by Divine miracles before  reasonable man can believe it, &c. many that fear God, and are in the  Reason, hath Believed us already, and do see the Mighty Wonders of Go brought to passe, and it cannot be believed by Richard Baxter, no more  Christ was believed of the Pharisees, in whom the mighty Power of God
made manifest, for though he did miracles, yet this Generation could not believe them. And he tells of some that said he was ; so might they well do, and not lye, his blindness is made manifest at larg And saith he, But can I see the Witness in them that saith they have the Witness in themselves. Nay, because thou art an Unbeliever thou canst not; but it thou wert a Believer in Christ, thou wouldst feel the same Testimony in the Brethren; but by thee we are not known, and therefore by thee are falsly Judged; for no other Testimony do we give or hold forth, but the same which the Apostles did, which we have received from Christ as the Apostles did, and not by any authority of our own, though he falsly says it, but by the Authority of the Power of God; and we shall not much seek or beg our Adversaries belief, for to God are we known, and one to another in the Spirit, and not to the wisdom of the World, which is devilish, and knows not, nor receives not the things which be eternal. His last Reason: They teach but such like Dostrine, and takes the like course as many of the Hereticks did, and saith he, Shall we run our selves into the fire which hath consumed such Heresie through former Ages, &c. Answer. To this I answer, The Doctrines of the Gospel we hold forth and teach to all people, and in that way that is called Heresie, worship we indeed the God of our fathers; but it is but such as this man with whom I deal, who is a false witness-bearer, and a reproacher, and the Company of Hireling-Teachers, and such like, that doth call the Way of God Heresie. And though he say, presently after the Apostles dayes, such Hereticks arose and troubled the Church. To which I answer, Nay it is just such like as himself, who appeared in the Apostles dayes, who taught for filthy lucre, and for gain made merchandize of souls; and it was such lying Prophets which Iohn saw the whole world run after in his days, and they were them that troubled the Church, even such as were heady, and high minded, and covetous men, and such as are false Accusers, and fierce men; and his shame and folly is made manifest, and so his lyes and slanders are turned upon his own head. And in his conclusion he doth beseech Professors to consider impartially of these 24. Reasons; to which I say, The most of them are so reasonlesse, that they will rather turn to his own confusion, then to his praise, to any man of understanding: And he bids all bethink themselves, first, What a doleful thing it is that Professors should be so loose and unstable, &c. Answ. Doleful it is indeed that after so much preaching of Priests of England, people should be so ignorant, loose, and unstable as indeed they are, and this is, a very shame to Teachers, and shews that they were not sent of God, because that the people are not profited at all, but continues ignorant, loose, and unstable and wicked, according to their own confession, and indeed, people are to be pittied that are under their Ministry, who by it can never come to the Know∣ledge of God, but must be ever learning fifty or sixty years, and ignorant loose, and unstable at their very end, and yet these are members of this Church of England, so called, which the very Pastors thereof confesseth to be loose, and unstable, andwicked, and brands us to be denyers of this Church, as in∣deed we have good reason, to see the Members thereof so wicked, loose, and unstable, as is confessed by their own Teachers, therefore we cannot be con∣demned for denying such a Church. Secondly, He bids consider what a hea∣vy judgement it is to Professors themselves, to be self-condemned, and self-divided from the Church, &c. To which I answer, A heavy judgement indeed, that such as are of the Church should be self-condemned, and self-divided from it; but yet it is a blessed thing that any that have been deceived with false likeness, now should come to see the error thereof, and be turned to the true Church which is in God, and to be drawn away from all windy Doctrines of Englands Teachers, and this many doth witness.
Then he exhorts Christians to be serious, and be true to the Light which they have received: To which I say, All that are true to the light which they have recei∣ved from Christ Iesus, will deny this man I now deal withall, and all his Lyes and Slanders. Then he bid-stick close to the Word of God; and I say, All that do so will find it as a Fire and a Hammer, and will be gathered from under the dead Doctrines of men in this Age. And he exhorts them to stick close to a faith∣ful Ministry: To which I say, Then must they deny all Hirelings, and such as preacheth for hire, for such are not of the faithfull Ministry, but Deceivers of people. And thus in few words return is sent in the pursute of a Sheet of Lyes and Slanders put forth into the World, and all sober-minded people by this may come to a good understanding between Truth and error. And though he hath taken a course to spread his Books  Ballads and Fables, by having them cryed up and down the streets, which is not for his advantage altogether, but doth shew his Work ridiculous to all wise men. And so hereby it may be seen that all his Strong Reasons are confounded and overturned, that would hinder a man from being a QUAKER. THe main and chief things I have spoken of, and by what is written in short men of understanding may understand what his whole matter can be: But in the beginning of his Book he falls a complaining of the la∣mentable ignorance and ungodliness of common People; and of the pride, and se∣conceitedness of Professors of godliness, and of the weakness, and giddiness, and un∣stableness of others: To this I Answer; It is true, abundance are ignorant, and abundance are proud and self-conceited, and abundance unstable and giddy in their minds; and substract these from the whole Company of the Hearers of the Teachers of England, and there is but a few left (if any at all) that are truly righteous in the Sight of God; and so to the shame of all the Teachers of England, hath he confessed the truth in this particular; and sheweth that indeed the People is not profited by them: and this is a strong Argument that they were never sent of God, but hath ran and were never sent: But presently after that he cryes out of Hereticks and Deceivers, even like as the Pope doth; but What is he afraid of, That they that are ignorant, and ungodly, and proud, and self-conceited, un∣stable, and giddy, should be deceived, they that are in those iniquities are deceived already, and cannot possibly fall into greater deceit, or delusion. But it appears, That many of the Priests of England cares not how little their Hearers profits by them, so if they can get their wages, their Hire, their great sums of money; for one of them said, I mean a supposed Minister of England) in Cambridge-shire, That he mattered not if all his Hearers went to the Devil, so they would but give him his dues; to wit, Tythes and Maintenance. So that by this instance, you may judge what stock they are of, and what their en∣deavours are; and we desire that people may be undeceived of that wherein they are deceived, and that they may turn from such a Generation of covetous Teachers, who care so little for their souls. And whereas he saith, The Quakers are but of a few years standing, and that they arose from among the Papists but a few year ago, &c. To this I Answer, the people of God received that name but a few years ago, but the Saints were Quakers, I am able to prove, long before; for Abrah and Isaac, and Moses, and Habakkuk, Daniel, and Paul, and all the rest were Quakers, though they were not called so; and though our name is new, yet our Religion is old; for it is the good old way, even the way the Apostles walked in, though it hath been over-clouded for many years in the dark night of Apostacy, which hath been over the whole World; and the Beast hath Reigned and made War against the Saints and killed them, and this hath been for
many ages as you may read: Yet there was a Seed which God preserved for himself in the midst of darkness, but now is the Way of the Lord made manifest again, and the same Power and Life of God which was in the Apostles dayes, and Truth shall spring forth, and Idolatry shall be rooted out by little and little, and Antichrist and his kingdom shall fall, and even Christ the Son of God the same as ever was, for no other do we own, but him who was and is, and is to come; he shall rule, and his People shall follow him. And though he saith, The Quakers be an upstart Sect: using such scornful words, not beseem∣ing a Minister of Jesus Christ; but we are willing to bear all his reproaches for Christs sake. And he speaks most foolishly, and saith as if we knew not the contents of our Religion; yea, we know the contents and foundation of it, which is Christ that good old foundation, and him we are zealous for, and him we Preach, and no other. And though he saith, The Chri∣stians Faith hath been known for sixteen hundred years ago: I say it was so, but the night hath been over all, wherein no man can work, since it hath been first revealed; and Traditions, and Superstitions hath the World been exercised in, and led into; and the true Faith of the Gospel hath been departed from, and many knows it not at this day. And he saith, He abhors any Gospel, or Religion, that was not made sixteen hundred yeares ago, &c. To this I Answer, Then must he abhor his own practice; for sprinkling of Infants, telling people it is a Baptizing into the Faith of Christ, was not so long since nor singing Davids experiences in Rime and Meeter for a part of Gods Worship; and many other things which the Priests of England practise for Religion and Gospel Ordinances, but are not so; but an invention came in many years since the Faith was revealed to the Apostles; and thus he hath abhored his own practise, and is condemned out of his own mouth. And whereas he speaks of one that lately spoke to another in these words, He de∣nied the God that he Worshipped. That might be true: for thousands in Eng∣land Worships the god of this World; and that god the Saints deny: And he counts it a thing very abominable to trust to that Which is with∣in the Saints; though it be according to the Scriptures, for Christ is in the Saints, and God dwels in the Saints; and God and Christ is only to to be trusted to. There is also another piece put forth by him, called, A Sheet for the Ministry: in which also (according to his usual manner) he Rails and Lyes against the Quakers in many things; also I might in∣stance in many more things wherein he hath belyed us, as a man without fear or honesty: and much ado he maks about Tythes: And he commends his Reader to the Quakers Catechisme, for better satifaction. And I do commend all sober people to the Answer of the same, wherein his folly and weakness is laid open, as in them particulars. But he saith, The Tenths are theirs as fully as the rest are ours, but this is denyed; for the Tythes are not paid out of the Lands, but out of mens labours and industrious exercises upon the Land: for if any man let his Land lye untilled, there is no Tythes claimed; so that it is manifest it's paid out of mens labours, and not out of the Land: and many other things we have against Tythes, and against the unjustness of them, and the oppression growing thereby. And we do know, That ne∣ver any Minister of Christ was maintained in such a way: nay, they were so far off being maintained by a Law, that they would not make use of their power which they had in Christ in those things as of outward mainte∣nance. But much need not be said, for thousands begins to see the grie∣vous burden and unlawfulness of Tythes, and that in the Gospel administra∣tion, these things are no way commanded by the Law of God, but as they came in by tradition, and were established by the Pope, and are now the chief maintenance of Englands Teachers. Indeed grievous and sad to be considered it is, how many hundreds in England of honest men are made ha∣vock
on in their Persons and Estates in relation to Tythes, because for Consci∣ence sake they cannot pay to the upholding of an Antichristian Ministry, which denies Christ come in the flesh, by upholding Tythes, which only belonged to the first Priesthood under the Law, and was never practised (either paid or received by any) of them that were Witnesses of Christ come, or after his death, who did thereby fulfil that part of the old Covenant, and put an end to that Covenant, and the Priesthood was changed that took Tythes, and a necessity there was also of the change of the Law as it is writ∣ten. So this is an Answer in part to Richard Baxters many Lyes and Reproa∣ches, and his whole Work is turned by as our spoyled prey of Babylons treasure; and no more to be recokned in the Records of Truth, but shall stand upon an ac∣count, among the corrupted and poluted commodity, of the growth of Egypt and Babylon. And this is for the satisfaction of honest people by a Friend, EDWARD BURROUGH.
THE TRUE Christian Religion Again DISCOVERED, After the long and dark Night of Apostacy, which hath overshaddow'd the whole World for many Ages; and the profession and practise thereof witnessed unto by the Scriptures. And here all may see, who it is of all these Sects, and divers Forms of Religion in these Nations, that are agreeable to the Scrip∣tures, in what they profess and Practice, and who it is that are not according thereunto; for the Line of true Judgment it stretched upon all Profession, and a true search into, and tryal thereof is made, and hereby it is manifest who it is, and what sort of people, that may justly claim the benefit of the Protectors Oath, to be protected there∣by in their Practices of Religion, who hath bound himself to maintain and uphold that Christian Religion which is according to the Scriptures, &c. FOrasmuch as Oliver Cromwel, called Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland, (chief Ruler according to man) hath bound himself by an Oath, and Sworn, that he will uphold and maintain the true reformed Protestant Christian Religion in the purity thereof, as it is contain∣ed in the Old and New Testament of the Scriptures; which Oath he is bound to perform before the Lord, and unto all men. Now it remains to be tried and proved, what the Christian Religion is; and who they are in these Nations that are of the true reformed Protestant Christian Religion in the purity thereof, as it is contained in the Scriptures, seeing there are abundance of Sects and diversity of Judge∣ments, and many Assemblies and Gatherings of people, who are di∣vers in their Wayes, in their Practices, and in their Form of Religion in these Nations, which do all profess the Scriptures, and that their Form of Religion is according to the Scriptures; but this cannot be, but it will be manifest otherwise; for the Scriptures, which were given forth by the one Spirit of God, bears not witness of many true Ways, or unto many true Religions, but unto one Truth, and unto one true Religion, and is the Declaration of one way of Life, and Salvation,
by one Jesus Christ; and there is no other Name under Heaven given for Salvation: And they that believe in him, and receive him, those are they onely that are of the true Religion, who are guided by the Spi∣rit, and changed thereby from Death to Life; and such have unity with the Father, and with the Son, and one with another, and are not of this World, but Heirs of the Kingdom of God; and these may own and claim a Title to be defended and preserved in their exercise and Pra∣ctice of Religion. Therefore come all sorts of People, and let us try and prove who it is that is of the true Religion, and who it is that he is bound to maintain and uphold by his Oath: Come I say, all Sects and sorts of people, and appear to Trial: Dare you joyn issue with me in this matter, to try your Profession and Practise o Religion, whether it be according to the Scriptures in the purity thereof, yea or nay? for the Lord hath put it into my Heart, to lay you all to the Line of true Judgement, and to prove you whether you must be upholden and maintained in your Reli∣gion, yea, or nay: Come claim your Priviledge; if your Profession and Practice in Religion be according to the Scriptures, then you may own your right, and the benefit of the Protectors Oath; but if your Profession and Practice in Religion be otherwise, and not according to the Scriptures, then you must stand back, and defend your selves if you can, for the Protector is not bound to maintain and uphold you in your Practice of Religion. And with this Argument I shall try you all, Whatsoever is professed and practised for Religion, for which there is neither com∣mand nor president in Scripture, is not aecording to the Scripture; let this fall where it may, this is Truth; and therefore all people come to tryal, and receive your judgement by this rule. And first, the true Religion is a walking with God in purity and ho∣liness, a performing of good to him, and not doing any evil; a belief in Christ, and receiving of him, and a living in him, and through the operation of his Spirit to be changed into his Image, and the Body of Sin and Death put off, and a living to God in all things, and not a li∣ving to this vain World in any thing, but in all things to be guided by the Spirit of Christ: This, in short, is a description of the true Religion, and they that are of this Religion shall be saved in the Day of the Lord, and in Equity and Righteousness should be protected according to the Oath before-mentioned, or else the Oath is not performed in justice, but rather broken through transgression. And first of all, as concern∣ing that profession and practice in Religion, which is most general in these Nations, I mean such as sprinkle Infants, and are sprinkled being In∣fants; professing it to be the Baptism into the Faith of Christ; and that it is a seal of the new Covenant, and of remission of sins, and that thereby people are made capable of union with Christ, and that it is a sign of regeneration, &c. This is practised and professed by many for Religion; but this Practice and Doctrine is not according to the Scripture; therefore all ye through all these Nations that are made Christians, and own your Title in Christianity, and a right to fellowship with Christ; and that ye are
joyned to the Church, and become Members of Christ, because you were sprinkled when you were Infants (and all ye that preach this for Doctrine, and practise it for Religion) you are not of the true Christi∣an Religion, in the Purity thereof, as it is contain'd in the Scriptures: this I do affirm. Therefore stand you by; for what you practise and profess, there is neither Command nor President in Scripture; if you could shew any, you are now called, and a Necessity is put upon you, to make use of your Knowledge, if you would be protected in this Common-Wealth, in your Practice of Religion. Likewise you sing, and give to sing, David's Psalms in Rhyme and Meeter, professing it is to the Glory and Honour of God; ye practise this as an Ordinance of God, as a part of his Worship, and as a part of your Religion; but this Practice and Profession also is manifest not to be ac∣cording to Scriptures; because it was never commanded; neither is there any President for this Practice in the Scriptures, in Gospel Times: therefore in this part of your Religion you cannot justly own to be pro tected and maintained; because the Protector's Oath reacheth not to uphold and maintain any such Practices in Religion, which are not ac∣cording to the Scriptures. Likewise, all ye that meet together, to exercise your Religion, and to worship God in Temples made with hands, set a part by you for that Practice, professing them to be Churches of Christ; this is not according, but con∣trary to the Scriptures, which say, God dwells not in Temples made with hands; neither did the Saints of old constantly practice any such thing: But they were the Persecutors that met in Temples made with hands, who cast out, and haled▪ the Apostles out of such Temples: so that in this Practice you cannot justly own to be protected, as not being a Practice in Religion according to Scriptures. Likewise, All ye, whose Ministers preach for Hire, and have Hire for preaching, so much a Year, and so much a Sermon at a Town or a Parish in a settled Place; and who take Tythes, and compel People to pay Tythes by a Law; such are not the Ministers of Christ; and ye that uphold such for Ministers of Christ, are false in Judgment, and blind in Understanding; and are not of that Christian Religion, which is accor∣ding to Scriptures in the Purity thereof, neither Ministers, nor People; for the Ministers of Christ never acted any such thing: they were the false Prophets, and false Apostles, that preached for Hire, and for Gifts, and Rewards: neither did the Saints and Churches of Christ look upon them that acted those things to be Ministers of Christ; but on the contrary, declared against them to be Deceivers: So that all you People, and you professed Ministers, that act those things that the false Prophets acted; and all you People that love to have it so, and give Hire to your Ministers for Preaching, and consent unto it; none of you are of the Christian Religion, as it is held forth in the Scriptures; because this part of your Practice in Religion is not according, but contrary to Scrip∣tures.
Now substracting all these in these Nations from the whole, which practiseth and professeth these things mentioned for Ordinances of God, and for his Worship, none of you are of the true Christian Religion, as it is held forth in the Scriptures; because these things which you Pra∣ctice for Religion, is not held forth in all the Scriptures by any example or command, likewise you are of the greatest number of people in all these Nations; and that Practice and Profession of Religion, which the greatest number follow, and exercise themselves in, cannot be the true Christian Religion, because the Scripture saith, Few are in the straight way that leads to Life, to wit, in the pure and true Religion; but many are in the Broad way that leads to destruction; and such that are the greatest number, who are in the broad way, are not in the Religion in the purity thereof, as it is held forth in the Scriptures: likewise many of you who Practice those things mentioned for Religion, are yet unconverted to God, but live in wickedness, in the Pride and Vanities, and in all the evil of this World, in Double-dealing, in Drunkenness, in Whore∣dom, and in the Works of Darkness; therefore you are not of the true Christian Religion, neither do your walk with God in Purity and Holiness, neither are you changed by Christ into his Image, nor are guided by his Spirit; neither do you live to God in any thing, but to this World in all things; and your Religion is manifest not to be accor∣ding to the Scriptures, but contrary. And so let all people consider, whether or no you must be maintained in your Religion? Come forth and plead your cause all ye that are called Presbyterians and Independants, and all others, stand up, and prove if you can, your Practice in Re∣ligion to be according to Scriptures; but seeing no man is able to prove these things mentioned, which is practiced by you for Religion, to wit, Sprinkling of Infants, and singing David's experiences in Rhime and Meeter, and Worshipping God in set-places, as Idol-Temples, and preaching for, and giving great sums of Money for preaching, with other things practiced by you for Religion; neither were these things ever commanded in Scriptures; neither is there any example for the practise of these things in Scripture by any of the Lords people; and therefore you cannot justly own a Title in the Protectors Oath, to be maintained and upheld by vertue thereof in these your practises of Religion; for it appears he is but bound onely to uphold and maintain that Religion, which is according to Scriptures, and not them who practiceth those things for Religion, which are not according, but contrary to the Scriptures. Likewise all ye, that are called gathered Churches; who holds sorth for Doctrine, that the Scrip∣tures are the Word, (by which the World was made) and that the Scriptures are the Foundation; and that the Scriptures are the Way to Salva∣tion; and that the Letter and the Spirit are unseparable; and that the Scrip∣tures are both the Writings, and the thing fignified; and that except a man be
Baptized with Water; he cannot be saved: with such like Doctrines, which have been held forth by some professing themselves to be of the Church of Christ; all you are manifest not to be of the Christian Religion, because those Doctrines are not according, but rather contrary to the Scriptures. Likewise, All ye, whose Practice in the Exercise of Religion is but by Imitation from the Scriptures, and you are not led by the Spirit of of the Father in what you speak and practice; you are not of the true Christian Religion, which the Scripture speaks of: for the Sons of God, and who are of the true Religion, are led by the Spirit of God, and not by their own Thoughts, and Imaginations, and the Traditions of men: And all that are not led by the Spirit of the Father, are not of the true Christian Religion, as it is held forth in the Scrip∣tures; and not any, that are such, can justly own to be protected in their Religion; because it is not according to the Scriptures. Likewise, All ye that do profess the things of God and Christ, and that you are Members of the Church of Christ, and profess Righteousness and Truth in words, and yet live in Pride, and the Va∣nities of this World, and in Unrighteousness, and the Customs of the Heathen, which are vain; and are not cleansed from Unrighteous∣ness, nor freed from the Body of sin and death; neither do answer your Profession with a Conversation, shewing that you are not guided with that Spirit whose words you do profess: All you are Hypocrites, and live in Hypocrisie; none of you are of the true Christian Religion, as it is held forth in the Scriptures: For the Exercise in true Religion sheweth forth in Life what is prosessed in words. Come, try your selves, and prove your selves all sorts of people; for now your Religion is to be try'd, what Name soever you go under: And all you that practice and profess those things for Religion, for which there is neither Command nor President in Scripture, your Re∣ligion is concluded not to be according to Scriptures; and so no Title or Priviledge can any of you justly own, of being upheld or maintain'd by the Protector's Oath. But, as I have said, For sprinkling of Infants, and singing of David's Experiences in Rhyme and Meeter, &c. there is neither Command, nor President in Scriptures; and therefore, you that pra∣ctice those things, which I have mention'd, for Religion, are not of the true Christian Religion, which is according to the Scriptures, which is to be protected. Likewise all ye that persecute by Reproaches, or Revilings and Cruelty, or that cause the People of God to be persecuted; many of you there are in these Nations, which profess Religion; yet are Envious Persons, and Persecutors of the Innocent: Hereby it is manifest, that you are not of that Religion which is according to Scriptures; for the Saints never persecuted any, but were themselves persecuted for Righteousness sake; so you are not to be protected in such Exercise, because it is not according, but contrary to the Scriptures: for you have no Example from the Saints for professing and practizing Religion, and yet persecuting such as are of
the true Religion, whose Consciences are truly exercised towards God, and towards all men. Now seeing that it is discovered in part, who it is that are not of the true Christian Religion, according to the Scriptures; it remains to be pro∣ved (if there be any) who they be that are of the true Christian Reli∣gion, as it is held forth in the Scriptures; and who they be that are to be protected in their Practice and Exercise of Religion: And as concer∣ning the dispised and rejected People, called Quakers; herein I shall speak for them, as a Friend to them, and a Lover of their Wayes, who is nor ashamed of their Practices in Religion; and shall measure and try their Practices in Religion, whether they be according to Scrip∣ture; and if it prove so to be, that what they practice for Religion, and hold forth for Doctrine, be according to the Scriptures; then why should not they own their Right and Priviledge, to be upholden and maintained by the Protector's Oath, who hath sworn to uphold and main∣tain them and their Religion, whose Exercise in Religion is according to Scriptures; being that same People are, and have been faithful Subjects of this Common-Wealth? And first of all, They dare not own themselves to be Christians, nor to be Members of Christ, nor to have any Right or Title to the Kingdom of God, but as they witness converting by the Spirit of the Lord, and are changed from Death to Life, and from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's power unto the Power of God, through the Operation of the same Spirit; and as in all their Works, and Wayes, and Exercises in Religion, they are guided by the same Spirit, who leadeth them out of the World, and out of the Vanities and Evil-Works thereof; and this is according to the Scriptures: And their Religion herein is justify'd by the Scriptures, who witness, That Christ is in them, and that they have re∣ceiv'd him through Faith, and thereby are cleansed from all Unrighteous∣ness, and have put off, and are putting off the Body of sin and death, and walk with God in Purity and Holiness, being led by the Spirit of God therein; and with God they have Peace, being reconciled by Jesus Christ, who is their Salvation, and they have no other: And this is according to the Scriptures. And again, As concerning their Meetings, and the manner there∣of; They are not contrary, but according to the Scriptures; for, though they meet in many Parts of these Nations by great Num∣bers, some in the open Fields, and some on the Mountains in some Places, and sometimes without Doors, and sometimes in Houses; all this Practice is according to Scriptures: For, we read, Mat. 5. 1. in the dayes of Christ; That there were great Multitudes of People that follow'd him; and he went up into a Mountain, and preached, and taught them upon the Mountain: And in Mat. 14. 14. we read, That there were great Multitudes, that came out of the Cities unto Iesus, into the Deserts; and he had com∣passion towards them, and did good unto them: And at that time there were many Thousands met together, as you may read; and it seems, stay'd
many whole dayes together; for they sate down on the Grass, and eat together; and then Iesus sent the Multitudes away: And in Mark 6. you may read, how that Multitudes came to Iesus out of the Cities into a desert Place; and Iesus began to teach them many things in that desert Place; for, he had compas∣sion on the Multitude: And in Luke 9. how the people again follow'd Jesus into a desert Place, and he preached unto them the Kingdom of God. Such Meetings then were counted strange, as such Meetings are now, when the People of God meet together by great Numbers, to preach, and to hear the Kingdom of God preached: But their Meetings are accor∣ding to the Scriptures; for the People of God, in Generations past, met in the same manner as the People of God, called Quakers, meet now: For sometimes Christ preached out of a Mark 41, 2. Luke 5. 3, Ship unto the People that stood on the Sea Shore: And Act. 20. Paul kneeled down and prayed among the Saints near the Sea Shore, at his passing into the Ship: And we read, Acts 2. that there was Three Thousand converted at one Sermon; then there must needs be a great Meeting, and a great deal of People met together: Such Meetings now are wondred at; but such Meetings are but according to Scripture; so that this part of their Practice in Religion is agreeable to the Scriptures, and the same as the Saints Practice was in Ages past. And as for the People of God meeting together, sometimes in the Night-season to wait upon the Lord, and sometimes sitting in Silence, and waiting upon the Lord, and no words utter'd amongst them; but every one sitting silent before the Lord, having receiv'd nothing from the Lord to speak one to another; at which the people of the World do wonder, and falsly judge it not to be a Christian Exercise: But we read in the Scripture, Iob 2. that Iob (who was a Christian; for he was a just and perfect man) he and his Friends sate upon the Ground seven dayes and seven nights, and spake not a word one to another; this would be a strange thing at this day to see practised: And in Ier. 8. 14. you may read, where the Prophet Ieremiah exhorted the people to assemble them∣selves, and said, Let us enter into defenced Cities, and let us be silent there; for the Lord our God hath put us to Silence: But such a Practice now is thought strange by the people of the World, who are not acquainted with the Wayes of God; who are wise in their own Eyes, and know not what it is to wait upon the Lord in silence, who never yet were put to silence in themselves by the Lord. And you may read Ezek. 3. where the Prophet sate down among the People of the Captivity, and they were astonish'd seven dayes; and at the end of seven dayes (and not before) the Word of the Lord came to the Prophet: So that you see it was the Pra∣ctice of the Servants of the Lord oft-times to sit and wait upon the Lord in Silence; though people wonder at such Meetings now. And we do not read, That there was alwayes speaking among the Saints in the Churches, when they were met together: But, Acts 2. we read, That the Church was met together in a Place, and the Holy Ghost fell upon them, and then they began to speak as the Spirit gave them utterance; then it seems they had not spoken before, though they had met together in a House;
and then they spoke the wonderful things of God; and some that heard, mocked, and others said, they were full of New Wine, even as the people of the World do at this day, when any of the People of the Lord are moved to speak as the Spirit gives utterance: So that some∣times to sit in Silence, being met together to wait upon the Lord, as many of the Servants of the Lord do in this Nation, is a Practice of Religion, and not contrary, but according to the Scriptures; for many of the Servants, and Assemblies of the Lord's People practiz'd the same thing in Ages past, as the Servants of the Lord do at this day; & so this Practice is to be uphold∣en and maintained, because it is proved to be according to the Scriptures; for the same thing was practiz'd heretofore. And we read, (Acts 20. 7.) That the Church met in the Night; for Paul continued his Sermon till Mid∣night. And as for their Practice in Speaking, either man or Woman, as the Spirit gives utterance, this is according to the Scriptures, though it be much wondred at, and cry'd against by the Wise-men and Peo∣ple of this Age; for we read, Acts 2. that they spoke in their Mee∣ting as the Spirit gave them utterance, without studying before-hand what to say: And the Lord promised, That Sons and Daughters should Prophesie: And in Acts 21. 9. we read of one that had four Daughters that did Pro∣phesie: And divers other places in Scripture do shew, That Women Phil. 4. 3. la∣bour'd in the Gospel; which doth prove that a Woman speaking and de∣claring the things of God, is not contrary, but according to the Scrip∣tures; and that any who are moved of the Lord, may declare the things of God, Man or Woman: And the Apostle saith, 1 Pet. 4. 10. As eve∣ry man hath received the Gift, even so minister the same one to another: So that this Practise in Religion is proved to be according to the Scrip∣tures. And as concerning their call to the Ministry, some are called from their ordinary callings, as from the Plough, or from handicraft work or tradings, or such like; this is according to the Scriptures also, for we read Matt. 4. 18, 19. where the Disciples were called from their Nets, and some were called from the receipt of Custom; and we read Amos 7. that he was a Herdsman, and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit; and 1 Kings 19. 19. Elisha was called from the Plough; and some others were called from keeping of Sheep: So that their call to the Ministry, and Practice in the Ministry, is according to the Scriptures; for the Servants of the Lord in former Ages were called to the Ministry after the same manner; so in that they do agree to the Scripture both in Ministry and ministring, and so may own protection herein by the Protectors Oath. And as concerning their going up and down through the Countries, and from City to City, and from one Town to another, and from one Nation to another, this is according to the Scriptures, though some seek occasion thereby against them, and unjustly take them as for Va∣gabonds, and executes their envy upon them, yet it was the Apostles Practice, as you may read in the Book of Acts, where the Apostles travelled from Country to Country, and from one City to another.
And though some of the Servants of the Lord are moved now to speak and dispute in the Markets, and reprove Sin in the Gates, and in the Streets, and in the High-wayes; and threatning God's Judgments against the Wicked; all these things are according to Scripture, and their Practice herein is justified by the Scriptures: for we read, Acts 17. 17. That Paul disputed in the Synagogues with the Jews, and with the de∣vout Persons, and in the Market daily, with them that met with him: And we read, Ier. 7. That he was commanded to stand in the Gate of the Lord's House, and to speak to all that passed into it: And Ier. 26. we read, That he was commanded to stand in the Court of the Lord's House, without doors, and to speak to all the Cities of Judah: And we read in the Book of Io∣nas, How he was commanded to go through the Streets, and to reprove Sin, and to threaten God's Iudgments against the Wicked; and these Practices were strange in that Generation, as they are at this day unto the World, who are not acquainted with the Wayes of God: But all people may see, though the Servants of the Lord do practice these things now as they are moved, their Practice herein is according to the Scriptures; for the Servants of the Lord in former Ages acted the same things; so that in this Practice the Servants of the Lord ought not to be persecuted, but protected and maintained in it, and that by the Protector's Oath, because it is proved to be according to the Scriptures, which he is sworn to maintain. And as concerning their crying against such, and declaring against them by word and writing, That Preach for Hire, and Divine for Money; and seek for their Gain from their Quarter, and such who go for Gifts and Rewards, and have Sums of Money by the Year for Preaching; and though they deny such that act those things to be Ministers of Christ, this Practice also is accor∣ding to the Scriptures; for we read in Mic. 3. that he declar'd against such as Preached for Hire, and Divined for Money; and such were no Mi∣nisters of Christ: And we read, Isa. 6. that he declared against them that sought for their Gain from their Quarter, which were Greedy Covetous men, such as are many of the Teachers of England: Again, we read Mat. 23. where Christ declar'd against such, and did not own such to be any of his Ministers, Who were called of men Master, who stood praying in the Syna∣gogues, and had the chief Places in the Assemblies: And we read in 2 Pet. 2. and in many other places, where the Apostles declared against such, and deny'd such to be Ministers of Christ, that preached for filthy Lucre, and took Gifts and Rewards for Preaching, and by feigned words made Merchandize of Souls, who were Heady and High-minded-men, as you may read, 2 Tim. 3. chap. and such men were deny'd to be Mini∣sters of Christ by the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles: so that all peo∣ple may see this Practice of the Servants of the Lord at this day, who are moved to declare against such men, that act these things mention∣ed, is perfectly according to the Scriptures; for the Servants of the Lord, spoken of in Scripture, did the very same things in this particu∣lar, as are done at this day: Therefore for this Practice they ought not to be persecuted, as they have been, but ought to be protected
and maintained in it, and that by the Protector's Oath, who hath sworn, to maintain that practice which is according to the Scripture, and to declare against them that preach for Hire, and have great sums of Money for Preaching, and that are called of men Master, and that take Gifts and Rewards of people for Preaching: I say, to do thus is a practice which the Scripture gives a large Example for; and so it must needs be according to Scripture, and ought to be protected in this Go∣vernment. Again, as concerning their denying to respect Persons, or to b with the Hat or Knee, in respect of worshipping any Creature, this also is according to the Scriptures, though the people of the World, who live in pride, and vain customs, are offended with them in this Practice; for we read, that God commanded, not to bow to any Likeness, Exod. 20. And we read Iames 2. the Apostle exhorts, not to have the Faith of  Lord Iesus with respect of Persons, but condemns that practice of respe∣ing such as are in goodly Apparel, and gay Cloathing, and have gold Rings, above a poor man in vile Raiment; and he saith plainly, They that have respect to Persons, commits sin; and we read that the Phari∣sees said of Christ, he respected no mans person; and he is our Example. And we read that the three Children were cast into the fiery Furnace with indignation before the King, being bound before him, and cast into the Furnace, Daniel 3. And we read that Paul, and all the Servants of God, did Thou Kings, and Princes, and Rules; and they spoke plainly to all men, and durst not give flattering Title to any, as you may read in Iob 33. so that all people may see their Practice in denying to respect Persons, and in speaking plainly, without flattering Titles to any man, or denying to pull off the Hat, or bowing to men i gay Clothing, or giving place to such that wear gold Rings, and have goodly Apparel, before such as have vile Raiment, is justly accor∣ding to the Scriptures, though people stumble at such Practices; and the People of God may claim to be maintained in this Practice of their Religion, seeing it is proved to be commanded in Scriptures, not to re∣spect the Person of any man; and also it was the Saints practice, and therefore herein they ought not to be condemned, but justified, as be∣ing a practice in Religion agreeing with the Scriptures. And as concerning their denying Obedience to Magistrates in some Cases, this is according to Scripture also; for we read, that the Rulers commanded the Apostles, and straitly charged them to speak no more i the Name of Iesus; yet the Apostles did not obey Magistrates herein, neither did they cease to Preach in the Name of Jesus: and though Christ was commanded, or besought to depart out of their Coasts; y he did not obey their request: and we read that the three Children wer commanded to worship the great Image, yet they did not obey this Command of the King: so that all people may see it is lawfull for the Saints to disobey Commands of Kings and Rulers, where they com∣mand that to be done or spoken which God doth not, but the con∣trary.
And I say again, Where Kings or Rulers, Parents or Masters, doth command or require any thing of them that are under them, which is not according to God, in such causes Subjects, or People, and Children and Servants are free, and not required of the Lord to subject to any thing which is not justly according to him; but yet we say, That Subjects, and People, and Children, and Servants ought to subject to them that have rule over them, in all things which is according to God in Truth and Righteousness; and by the Law of God all People are bound to obey those that have Rule over them, not to disobey them in any thing which may stand with the Exercise of a good Consci∣ence to God; so that though the People of the Lord now do de∣ny to depart out of a Town or Place, and though they will not cease to declare against sin and wickedness in Teachers and People, though a Magistrate command it, this is but according to the Scripture; for the Apostles went on boldly, declaring the Name of the Lord after they were forbidden: And thus the Servants of the Lord do now, they freely declare the Way of Salvation, and call People to repent, and reprove Iniquity in all sorts of people, though wicked men com∣mand them to the contrary, and falsely charges them, that they are disobedient to Government, and Authority, though they are not, no more then the Servants of God, and Apostles of Christ, who in the same causes did the same things; and the Lord hath commanded to cr ud, and not to spare, but to tell people of their Transgressions; and therefore many of the Lords Servants do deny to be silent, or to cease from declaring against sin, though a Magistrate command it: And Christ hath commanded not to swear at all; and therefore many do deny to swear upon any account, in any place, though the Magistrates do com∣mand it; for the Servants of the Lord do deny to put off a Hat, or to Bow, in respect of any mans person, though a Magisttate com∣mand it; for the Scripture doth say, He that respects Persons commits sin; so that all people may see that what the Servant of the Lord doth in these things, are not contrary, but according to the Scriptures; for all these things were commanded and practised by the Saints in for∣mer Ages, and they said, It was better to obey God then man; and we ought to do it in all things, and that according to the Scriptures too. So that in all these practises in Religion the Scriptures justifies them, and are as Witnesses to them, and they might claim protection in the exercise of them by the Protectors Oath; but if they be not main∣tained, but persecuted for the practice of these things, then will the Light in every mans Conscience witness the Oath is broken, and not kept; for it extends to uphold and maintain the practice of Religion which is according to the Scriptures, as these are proved to be. And as concerning their Doctrines which the World stumbles at, yet their Doctrines are according to the Scripture; though they say, Christ is the Light of the World, and lighteth every man, or hath given light to every man that cometh into the World, this is according to the Scripture; as you may read, Iohn 8. 12. and 1. 9. and though they
turn people from Darkness to the Light of Christ within them, and exhort people to hearken to that within them, and not to seek a Christ without them, to ascend or descend to fetch him; these Doctrines are per∣fectly according to the Scripture; for you may read, Acts 26. 18. P saith, He was sent to turn People from Darkness to the Light, and from the power of Satan to the Power of God: and Rom. 10. you may read the Apostle saith, What saith it? The Word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, that is the Word of Faith which we preach; and they were not to say, Who shall ascend, or desc to fetch Christ. And though they tell people, They must witness Christ in them,  else they cannot be saved: This also is according to the Scriptures, as you may read, 2 Cor. 13. the Apostle saith, Iesus Christ is in you, except ye  Reprobates. And though they say, Christ is the Word of God, and do deny the Scrip∣tures to be the Word, by which the World was made: This Doctrine also is ac∣cording to the Scriptures; for we read, Rev. 19. 13. That the Name of Iesus is called the Word of God: And Luke 1. of the Scriptures it is sa, They are a Declaration by those which were Eye-witnesses, and Ministers of the Word. And though they press people to Perfection, and do say, Men  be pect upon Earth, and compleat in Christ Iesus: This Doctrine also is according to the Scriptures; for you may read, 1 Cor. chap. 2, & 6. of  that were perfect, who were men upon Earth; and the Minist of Christ spoke Wisdom among them that were already perfect: And Col. 2. 10. the Apostle saith unto the Church, who were men in this Life up∣on Earth, he saith to them, Ye are Compleat in him. And though they press the people to live without sin, and do say, They that are born of God do not commit sin: This also is according to the Scripture; for it is Christ's Command, Mat. 5. Be perfect, as yr Fa∣er in Heaven is perfect: And 1 Iohn 3. there it is spoken of some that were the Sons of God already, and he saith, Whosoever is born of God, oth not commit sin; for he cannot sin, because he is born of God: and saith . As he is, [Christ] so are we in this present World. And now all people may understand, that in all these Doctrines which they do hold forth, they do fully agree with the Scriptures; and they be ness to the Truth of their Doctrines, that the Servants of God, and the Apostles of Christ, did preach the very same things for Doctrine, adone at this day; and so these Doctrines are not to be wondred at, not so much as they are by the wicked, to be cryed against for  and error; and these few particulars onely I have mentioned, at which the people of this Age the most stumble at; and all other things whatsoever, which is held forth for Doctrines unto people I am able to prove them by the Scriptures, that in all things they are accor∣ding to the Scripture, and not different or contrary to the Scriptures; so  all people may take notice and see, that whatsoever they do pra∣ctice for Religion, or hold forth for Doctrine, they do herein justly ac∣cording to the Scriptures, and they justifie their Practices and Doctrines
in these things mention'd, and in whatsoever else can be objected by any man. And this I shall take in hand to prove before all the World, That the People of God, called. Quakers, do practice nothing for Religion, or preach for Doctrine, but what is perfectly according to the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and in the fulfilling of them; and so they are proved to be of that True Christian Religion, which is ac∣cording to the Scriptures; and so may fully claim Protection and Pre∣servation in their Practice of Religion; And this is to be consider'd by the Protector, and all Magistrates and People in these Nations, that they may know what the true Christian Religion is, and who is in it, and who is not in it; and for this purpose is this written, for the satisfaction of all people, that they may see who it is that hath a Right and Priviledge to be protected and upholden by vertue of the Oath. Likewise, all may understand, That what such practice and profess for Religion, is not without good Ground; but that the very same things were practized by them that were of the true Christian Religion, and preached for Doctrine by them that were Saints, which is now practiz'd and held forth by the People of God; and the Scriptures do fully bear witness in all things, shewing that such are guided by the same Spirit, which the Saints were guided by in Ages past; and as they had, so have these the Testimony, That they are of God, and that the whole World lies in Wickedness. And as concerning their being persecuted by many of the Rulers, Priests and People, though they be sent to Prison, and banished out of Towns, and whipped, and beaten, and scorned, and reviled; this is also according to the Scriptures, and the Scripture is fulfilled upon them; for the same things were done to the Apostles, and to the Ser∣vants of the Lord, as you may read through the Acts, the people mock∣ed the Apostles, and slandered them, and said they were full of new Wine; and the chief Priests conspired against Christ, and the Apo∣stles, and incensed the Magistrates against them, and the Magistrates put Christ, and many of the Apostles in Prison, and caused them to be whip∣ped and beaten, and to be banished, and many other cruelties done unto them; the Scripture is full to prove this, from the beginning to the end of it; and Christ said, They shall persecute you, and speak all manner of evil of you for my Name sake, and as they have done unto me, so shall they do  you; ye shall be hated of Nations: And the Apostle said, All that will give godly in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution. So that all peo∣ple may see, though the people of the Lord be persecuted, and reviled, and imprisoned, and cruelty done unto them; and though it be done by the chief Magistrates, and chief Rulers, and the wise men of this Age, all this is according to the Scriptures, and that the Scriptures might be fulfilled; and the same things which are now done unto the people of God, were done unto the people of God in Ages past, by the same Instruments, to wit, the Rulers and Magistrates; and by the same means, to wit, by the information, and false accusations of the chief
Priests and Teachers; in Ieremiah you may read how the Priests sought to take away his Life; and you may read how the chief Priests consulted against Christ, and how they complain'd to the Magistrates against him and the Apostles; and the same things are now come to pass, and we do not strange at it; for they are the chief Priests of England that do most seek the Persecution, and cause the People of God to be persecuted, by their complaining and petitioning to the Magistrates; so that in all these things, not only what is practised and preached for Doctrine, but also in what is suffered, is perfectly according to the Scriptures; and all people that are not blind, may see that this Religion is in all things agreeable with the Scriptures, both in what they do, and in what they suffer: so that this is given forth for the good Information of the Protector, and all Magistrates, that they may hear the Tryal of all things, and may not falsly conjecture or suppose, and thereupon give Judgement without any true Knowledge, let them search the Scriptures, and try: I hope the worst of men have so much Conscience, that they will stand in owe of the Breach of their own Oaths; and that they will perform unto the Lord, and unto all men, what they have firmly (and not compell'd) sworn to do: and thus it may be hoped the w Persecution will cease, which is lamentable to be declar'd, how the People of the Lord have suffer'd in many things, even them whose Re∣ligion is proved to be according to the Scriptures; who practice nothing for Religion, neither hold forth any thing for Doctrine, but that which is perfectly agreeable to the Scriptures, as all people hereby may un∣derstand; which Religion the Protector hath sworn to maintain and up∣hold: Then who shall presume to persecute the People whose Practice in Religion is prov'd to be the very same which his Oath extends to maintain? Surely no man will be so impudent, or shew such Rebellion to Government, as to endeavour to break down and destroy that Peo∣ple, whose Religion is prov'd to be justly that which he is by Oath bound to maintain: Some heretofore, before this Oath was taken, might pl Ignorance, and say, They knew not the mind of the Protector; but now his mind is fully discover'd; and he doth not only allow, but also hath solemnly sworn, To maintain and uphold that Christian Religion which is ac∣cording to Scriptures: And it is prov'd what People it is, whose Religi is so. And I say again, That same People mention'd, do practice nothing, neither hold forth any thing for Doctrine, but it is either commanded, or there is President for it in Scripture, or agreeable thereto; and there∣fore that same People is of the true Christian Religion, which the Pro∣tector hath bound himself to maintain by Oath, in the Face of the whole Nations; so that none of the Magistrates now can plead Igno∣rance: For, as he is sworn to uphold the People of God in their Religion; so are they bound to be true to him and the Government, and to fulfil the good Laws, and his Oaths and Enterprizes: so that I say again, It may be hoped, for the time to come, for Protection, and to be maintain'd, and no longer to be persecuted and destroy'd in their Persons and Estates, as
formerly they have been, if men regard their own Oaths, or there be any Truth or Sincerity in the Heart of man. And I say, by this very Oath mention'd, might the People of God own and claim Protection and Defence in their Way and Practice of Religion, which is so plainly prov'd to be according to the Scriptures, though none of them desir'd such an Oath for their Protection, or sought after it; yet it being voluntarily instituted and taken, why may not they own the extent of it, which reacheth to them more then to any besides, as is clearly described? And not for their own sakes altogether do they own the benefit of it, but that he, who hath taken it, may be clear in the sight of the Lord, in performing of his Oath; for, his Felici∣ty, and the Encrease and Continuance of good Government they de∣sire, as much as their own Protection: And they would not have any man so wicked, or the cause of perpetual Infamy to be given to this Nation, so much as that any thing should be destroyed or broken down, which is sworn to be upheld and maintain'd in the Nation, lest the Heathen Rulers rise up in Condemnation against the Doers thereof. These, with many other Arguments, which might be produc'd, press many to endeavour the fulfilling of the said Oath, for his own sake, who hath taken it. And that first of all, By that Oath the People of God may own Protection in this Common-wealth, because their Religion is according to the Scriptures, &c. Secondly, That some People might also own Protection in this Common-wealth, in that the most of them, if not all, have been true and faithful Sub∣jects of this Common-wealth, and hazarded Lives and Estates for the Esta∣blishing of such a Government, wherein the People of God might have full Li∣berty for the Exercise of their pure Consciences. Again, They may own Protection in this Common-wealth,  being at this day a Harmless and Innocent People, not being offensive to any man's Person or Estate, or in any other thing (except to sin and wickedness, and the Workers thereof) And I say again, That they do not desire any thing but the Well∣fare, and the Encrease, and the Establishment of this present Government, where∣in it is according to God. And this is written for the Information of all sorts of People, that they may know unto what sort of people the Protector's Oath extends to uphold and maintain; and concerning all those whose practice in Religion and Doctrines are not according to Scripture, but contrary to it, as is manifest, and so not to be maintained and upholden in their Profession and Practice of Religion by the Protectors Oath; yet it is not desired, that such should be destroyed, or overthrown, or bound, or imprisoned, or any cruelty done to them, though their practice be not according to Scripture; but its desired, that such may live in peace in the Common-wealth, enjoying their Religion to themselves, with∣out any molestation from any outward Law, or outward Power; for many would not that any should be compelled to, or from any Ex∣ercise in Religion by an outward Law, but let them defend themselves
in their Religion, from those who may be moved of the Lord to reprove them, or declare against them, or convince them; so that many would have Religion to defend it self, and that the Magistrates, with their Laws, may preserve the Peace in the Common-wealth, and men's Per∣sons and Estates, and not their Opinions and Judgements: And we would they may not limit or stint tender Consciences; for many may be of a tender Conscience in those things wherein their Consciences are not truly inform'd; and such should not be condemned to Death, but to be won by sound Doctrine, and instructed by those who are called of God. And so this is written that the whole Nation may un∣derstand the Mind of the Lord's Servants in all these things. And let no man blame me; for I have but with an equal Hand, brought all sorts of people to the Line of true Judgment, that they may know who is to be maintain'd (and who is not) in their Religion, and Practices thereof. But if, after all this, the People of God be persecuted, and Vio∣lence be done unto them, and Injustice and Unrighteousness acted up∣on them in this Common-Wealth, as of late Years hath been, and yet it be suffer'd to be, and none take any Notice to preserve and de∣fend them, whose Religion is according to Scripture, which he is sworn to maintain; then I leave it to the Light in all men's Consciences to judge what a condition such are in, whose Oath is not kept, but broken; for these things are of no less value, then either breaking or keeping a man's own Oath, which solemnly hath been taken: And this is not a light thing, but to be seriously consider'd of, both by Magistrates, Teachers and People in this Common-wealth. Yet notwithstanding all this, the People of God do not boast in, or trust unto the Arm of Flesh, neither are any whit the more confident in their Way, though it be proved, That they ought in Iustice to be uphol∣den and maintained in what they profess and practice, as aforesaid; for their Hope and Confidence is only in God, who only is sufficient to protect and uphold his People in all their Wayes and Exercises; and though all men do forget their own Promises and Oaths, yet will not the Lord for∣get his chosen People, to defend them from all their Enemies, who hath again appear'd to gather his People, after the long and dark Night of Apostacy; and his House and Tabernacle shall be exalted over all the Earth. An Objection, Now many may say, Seeing I challenge, claim and affirm, That this Religion is the true Religion, which is according to Scripture (then they ask, and say) Hath there been no true Religion before this? or have all these Religions been false before? And seeing this hath but newly appear'd in the World, was there no true Religion before? And if there were any, where was it? And what was that Religion, seeing there hath not been for many Ages such a Religion as this is? And after this manner do many reason and ob∣ject to themselves, and raise to themselves Stumblings; and conceit themselves, That our Fore-fathers were of a Good Way, and many of them
sure were saved, which were not of this Religion, which did not profess and pra∣ctice these things which is professed and practised by this people. Answ. Now unto all these I do answer and say, That this Religion is the true Religion which is according to Scripture, as is proved alrea∣dy, seeing they profess and practice nothing for Religion, but what the Scriptures do justifie, and shew the very Example of the same things; but that God had a People in all Ages, and a Seed that never bowed to Baal its believed, and such as did sincerely seek after God, according to what they knew, and they were accepted of God according to what was made manifest in that Age and Generation; yet the Testimony of Truth it self, and the Way of the Lord it self, for many Genera∣tions hath not so clearly and purely been held forth, as it is now in this Age and Generation; for now the true Light hath shined, and the Way of Salvation is evidently made manifest, as by many Witnesses, and evident Tokens which may be given, and was not so clearly for ma∣ny Ages past, held forth and known: and such who have been sincere∣ly seeking after God, though they knew not perfectly the way unto him, neither had they such a pure Testimony revealed to guide them, as now is manifest, yet such do now rejoyce, and own the Way of the Lord, and the Seed of God is refreshed in them, and all causes of stumbling removed, and the pure Light of the Gospel is sprung forth more clear in this Age, then in any Age, for many Generations; for the Scripture shew∣eth, that a dark night of Apostacy hath been over the whole World, and the Beast hath reigned, and the false Prophet hath deceived many Na∣tions; and the whole World hath wondered after the Beast for many Ages; and the Beast hath made war with the Saints, and hath had power to kill them, and hath put a stop many times to the Appearances of God, till now at length he doth appear, and the power of Hell and Death shall not stop it, and they do say, that they are come out of the Apostacy, to the dawning of the Day again, and the same Power of God, and the same Truth that was in the Apostles days, and the same Mi∣nistry by the Gift of the same holy Ghost, as was in the Apostles dayes, is now witnessed; and at the time of ignorance God winked, but now the eye is opened, and all is called to repentance; so it will not ex∣cuse any man to plead how it was with our Fore-fathers, or to say, Where was this Religion before these few years, and such like? for now the Power of God it self is made manifest, which brings into the true Religion, and all that are of God hear it, and shall own it, and shall receive the Testimony which is given: Its known that there are many thousands which have not yet owned it, in which there are true thirstings after God, and a zeal for him; and such are not condemned to be alto∣gether out of Religion, for such seek his Face, and the Day is neither clear nor dark to them, in which they are; and such shall own and sub∣mit to the Government of Christ; and they that are not under the Government, are not of the true Religion, as I said; This is the time of Restauration, and the Lord is bringing back again, and a
thorow Reformation will the Lord work in the Earth, such as hath not been known in Ages past. There hath been a Seed sown, which the De∣vil hath catched away; but now the Seed shall grow, and become the greatest of all Herbs, and the Fowls of Heaven shall lodge in the Branches. And this is a plain Answer to all sober people; for according to the Scriptures in the times of the Apostles, the Day of glorious Light is sprung forth, and mighty was the Power of God at that Day; but since hath Darkness overshadowed all, and Antichrist hath reigned, and the whole World hath been made drunk with the Wine of Fornication, which hath been in the hand of the Whore, who hath sat upon the Beast, and upon Nations and Peoples; and the Gentiles have trodden under foot the holy City of God for forty and two Moneths; but now is the time of Restauration, as hath been promised, That the Lord is bringing back his People again; and the Tabernacle of God shall be with men; and Christ alone must reign and rule, and his Kingdom set up ever the whole World. And let no man be offended at what I have done; for I have not re∣flected upon any mans person, but on what he practiseth for Religion. London the 10th Moneth, 1657. E. B.
A MESSAGE FOR INSTRUCTION, TO All the Rulers, Judges and Magistrates, to whom the Law is Committed: Shewing what Just Government is, and how far the Magi∣strate's Power reacheth, and what the Sword of Justice is to cut down, and what it is to defend. Whereby they may learn, and be directed to discern betwixt the Guiltless, and the Guilty; and betwixt a Matter of Wilful Wrong by Evil-Doers, which they are to Punish, and a Matter of Conscience, by men that fear God, which they are to be a Praise unto, and not a Terror; and in particular, divers Causes are disco∣ver'd, which are prov'd to be Matters of Conscience, and not of Wilful Wrong; though many therefore are unjustly persecuted and afflicted as Evil-Doers. With an Exposition of some parts of the Law; for the Edification of such, as desire to judge Righteously between Man and Man, who would discern of different Causes; and Iustifie the Righteous, and Condemn the Evil-Doer. Concerning Government and Magistracy, this I have to say: IT is an Ordinance of God, ordain'd of him for the preserving of Peace among men; for the punishing and suppressing of Evil-doers, and for the Praise of them that do Well; that men's Persons and Estates may be preserv'd from the Violence and Wrong-dealing of evil men: And for this End Government was ordain'd of God, to be set up in the Earth, by the Institution of the Lord; that Righteousness should go free, and the Wicked be bound and limited. Now such as handle the Law, and are Executors thereof, who are ordain'd of God to judge and govern the People, ought to be Just Men, fearing God, and walking in his Law, and hating and denying every false way; that people may receive Examples of Righteousness, and holy and lawful walking from their Conversations. And they that are
set to govern the people, ought to have the Spirit of true and sound Judg∣ment, to try into the Root of all Causes, whereby they may be able to discern of different Causes, and to give just Judgment in all things; and such will judge by equal Measure for God, and not for man, but without respect of Persons; and such will be a Terror to Transgressors, and will strengthen and encourage them that do well; and then the Ex∣ecution of the Law will answer the End wherefore it was added; for, because of Transgression was the Law added to slay the Transgression, and to bind under the Trangressor, and to make him stand in awe, and be afraid; for the just Law reacheth to the just Witness of God, and answereth it in every man; and he that walks in the Law of God, and hath his Heart therein exercis'd, the Law of Man hath no power over him, to condemn him; but it justifies him, and defends and preserves him from all Wrong: but who doth not walk in the Law of God, but is ex∣ercis'd in Evil, and transgresseth the Light and pure Law of God in his Conscience, by doing Evil, and by wrong and unjust Dealing; then the Law of man takes hold upon him, and binds him, and judges him, and condemns him for the Evil done by him, contrary to the Light in his own Conscience, which answereth to the just execution of the Law in condemning of him: And this is the Work of the Law in the hand of faithful Executors, who justly executeth the just Law, in defending and preserving the Iust and Innocent Men from Wrong-doing, and in condemning and judging the Ungodly and Evil Men for Wrong-doing; whereby the Witness of God in them both may answer to the just Go∣vernment, in defending the one, and in condemning the other: and this is a good savour to God, where the Iust Laws are justly executed by just men: But where Unrighteous Men are in power, and the Execution of the Law in their hands, that are themselves Transgressors, such will not judge for God, but the good Laws will be subverted unto wrong ends, from their proper vertue, and the hands of the Wicked will be strengthen'd, and the Evil-doers will escape unpunish'd, and the Innocent will suffer, and Justice and true Judgment will be turn'd backward; for when the Wicked bear rule the People cannot rejoyce, nor Justice and true Judgment cannot be receiv'd from men, who are themselves unjust and unrighteous; for, though the Laws may be good and just, yet the Exe∣cutioners thereof being Evil, and themselves Transgressors, worthy of Condemnation by the Law: The Transgression of the Law in others cannot justly be judged by such, who are themselves guilty of Judgment; and therefore the Laws will be subverted, and Justice and true Judgment neglected; because such as handle the Law know not God, but are in the Transgression of the Righteous Law, and of the Judgment thereof are themselves guilty. So therefore they that handle the Law should be men justified by the Law, and free from the Transgression; that they may the more justly punish, reprove and condemn it in others; and may minister Justice and true Judgment through the Law to all people under them. And no man ought to be respected in Judgment, but every man's Cause ought to be heard, the Poor as well as the Rich, and their Matters diligently sought into: And all ought to receive just Judgment
from Just men by the just Law; for the Law is a defence about all the Righteous, to defend and preserve them; in Peace and Freedom, from all their Enemies, who are to be limitted by the Law, as I have said: And they that are reconciled to God, whose consciences are ex∣ercised towards God in all things, they are not under the Law, nor the Law hath no power over them; for the Law is fulfilled in them by Christ, who teacheth them in all things to walk without offence to∣wards God and all Men, in Truth and in Righteousness to God, and all Men; and such the Law of Man is to defend, and not to judge them; to justifie them, and not to condemn them; and to be a praise to them, and not a terror; and such set to seal, that the Law is just, and good and holy; who walk in Justness, in Goodness and Holiness, and doth not transgress the good Laws of any Nation, but walk void of offence towards all; for they walk not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit, and are Doers of the Law, and not Breakers of it; and so come not under the guilt of condemnation, in any thing, but are justified in all things; for the Light of Christ leadeth them into all Truth; and so out of all Condemnation; their Wayes are righteous and pure, and their Works are just and equal towards God and all Men; and they seek not the wrong of any mans Person or Estate, but seeks the Good of all, forgiving their Enemies, and praying for them, and seek not Vengeance upon their Adversaries, but they bear all things patiently; and such are the Servants of God, and not Transgressors of his Law, nor the just Laws of Man; and if such do suffer by a Law, that Law is unjust, and so is that Magistrate that executes that Law; and that suffering is not for evil-doing, but for a good Conscience sake; and the Innocent can rejoyce in such suffering, but the Executioners there∣of shall howl and weep: So that in all Ages there was such suffer∣ing, which was not for evil-doing, but for the exercise of a pure Con∣science; and such Sufferings there are at this day: and this is because the Unrighteous and the Unjust bear rule, which subverts the Law, and turns true Judgment backward, and oppresseth the Seed of God, and rules over it in Tyrany; and this is where Darkness rules in the Heart, and Ignorance in the Mind; and true Judgement is wanting, for Light is called Darkness, and Darkness Light, and Good is put for Evil, and Evil for Good; and Truth is called Heresie, and Error is called Truth; and because of this the Righteous are judged unjustly, and falsly con∣demned, and the Guilty are set free; and thus is Judgment turned quite backward; where the Seed of Enmity ruleth above the Seed of God; and such a Government is not blessed, but made a Curse unto that Dominion, where it is seated, and this is because such are set to rule and govern, who are not ruled and governed by the Lord, but are in the transgression of the Just and Righteous Law; and are Unjust Men, and not reconciled to God, upon whose shoulders the Govern∣ment lies, and the execution of the Law in their power, who can∣not minister true Judgment, nor discern of different Causes amongst Men.
And therefore all Magistrates are to weigh, and be considerate in all these things, and so to act and judge among men, as they may give a good Account unto God, and all men; and when a Cause is brought before them to give Judgment of, or any accus'd unto them, that they should exe∣cute the Law upon, they should by the Spirit of the Lord first try into the Ground and Nature of such matters, to know whether it be a wilful and supposed Wrong or Injury done between man and man, or it be of Ignorance, or want of better Knowledge, or such like; or whether it be a Matter of Conscience, or about Religion, or the Worship of God, whereupon the Controversie dependeth: and if it be a matter of wil∣ful and purposed Wrong, or of Ignorance, then good Reason and Iustice will teach a Magistrate to defend the Innocent from Wrong, or to restore his Wrong by true Judgment, that his Person and Estate be freed and preserv'd from all Wrong; and that the Wrong-dealer be restrain'd, and punish'd, and judg'd justly according to his Offences: but if it be a matter of Conscience about Religion, or the Worship of God, then the Magistrates, with their Law, ought not to meddle there∣in, or to judge of such Matters; for these things, concerning the things that are Spiritual, are out of their Jurisdiction, and not in their power to judge of: And if the Controversie between man and man depend about such Causes, not having reflection upon Persons or Estates, but only about Spiritual Matters, then Magistrates with their Laws ought not to judge in these Causes; but Spiritual Men ought only to give their Judg∣ments hereof, as they have receiv'd from God: And though men be in controversie about Religion and the Worship of God, yet if they be men of Peace, not wronging one another in their Persons and Estates, they ought to be both protected in a good Government by the just and righteous Laws. And here the Sword of Justice is laid only upon the Evil-doer, to be a Terror and a Punishment to him, and to limit and re∣strain him from Wrong-dealing; and this is the End wherefore it was ordain'd of God to be among men, and not to be laid upon the Con∣science, to oppress and afflict the tender Consciences of the Upright, whose Minds are exercis'd in the Law of God; for such should have Praise, that do well, by the Sword of Justice, while it is a Terror to all Evil-doers whatsoever: and this is the perfect End wherefore the Law was added; and the practice of it herein by faithful and just Executors, is Well-pleasing and Acceptable to the Lord. And now as concerning this one thing, which is, Oppression in the Na∣tion, brought forth through the unjust and false Execution of the Laws, where∣by many tender Consciences are afflicted, and not for any Wrong or Evil-doing, but for the Exercise of a pure Conscience. Whereas many for a pure Conscience sake do deny and cannot pay any thing to maintain a Steeple-House, or Place of Worship, which the people of the World do worship in, and where they commit Idolatry; neither can they, for Conscience sake, pay any thing to uphold such Worship, and such a Ministry and Ministers, which are not of Christ, nor ever were sent of him, but of Antichrist, and such by which the people are led in Blindness and
Error, as manifestly doth appear through the whole Land: And yet the Magistrates, some of them being as blind and ignorant as the people, do compel many people by their Writs, and Orders and Judgments, to maintain a Priest and Steeple-house, which for Conscience sake they deny to maintain; and yet by Authority from the Magistrates are the in∣nocent Men's Goods spoyl'd by Distress, and great Oppression Exercis'd upon many poor People, to maintain and uphold the Ministry and Wor∣ship of this Generation, which is not of God, but against him; and many hereupon are cast into Prison, and others have their Goods taken from them by Violence, and great Havock is made in the Countries about this matter. Now first it may be consider'd, That to deny to uphold and maintain a Steeple-house, and Place where ignorant people in Tradition do meet to Worship, is not a matter of wilful and purpos'd Wrong-dealing, or the breach of any Bargan or Contract between man and man; but it is a matter of Conscience to the People of God: and for a good Conscience sake they cannot do such a thing, as to maintain a place of Worship, which Abomination is committed in by ignorant and rude people, who are without the Fear of God, as daily is manifest; and it is not mani∣fest, that by denying of this they injure any man's Person or Estate in any thing which belongs unto him by lawful Bargan and Contract, or otherwise: Neither is there any Reason or Equity in this matter, That any should be forc'd and compell'd by Injustice and Oppression, to uphold a house of wor∣ship, which others worship in, and not they; and they knowing that worship to be Abomination to the Lord also, and not the True Worship of the True God; and there is no Justice nor Religion in it, that any should be caused by force to uphold a House, for other people to commit and practice Idolatry in; if the house were for any good purpose, or honest practice, as for poor or impotent people to dwell in, or such like, who had not Houses of their own, because of their poverty; then that were a deed of charity to uphold it, and the people of God would not deny it, but could freely give their money to such a use or end; but because it is not to such a use, but only a place to commit Idolatry in, and to wor∣ship God ignorantly in superstitions; therefore it is a matter of Con∣science unto many; and for a good Conscience sake, they rather suffer the spoiling of their Goods, and affliction upon their Bodies, then to pay their Money for such a use or end; and herein the Magistrates do great injustice in the sight of God, and his Saints, and contrary to Reason, and a good Conscience, in causing innocent mens Goods to be spoiled by cruelty, to uphold a place of idolatrous worship, contrary to mens tender Consciences: for as I have said, they do no wrong to any man, but only peoples wills are offended, and their blind zeal turned into rage and fury against the Just, who worship God in Spi∣rit and in the Truth, and cannot uphold the Houses of false worship; and it is a shame unto the people, and Ministers themselves, who can∣not uphold their own worshipping Houses; and it is a reproach upon their God, and their Religion, who cause others to maintain their
worshipping Houses, by injustice and great oppression, and will not themselves maintain their Houses where they worship their God; but people who fear God are greatly oppressed divers wayes to uphold worshipping Places for others to worship in, as in many parts of this Nation, is wofull testimony, which is a shame to the Magistrates, by whose Authority these things are done, and a great reproach to the very name of Christianity, that people, against a pure Conscience, and contrary to good Reason, should be compelled to uphold and maintain a Worship and Ministry which they do not partake of, but their very Enemies that persecute them, whose Consciences are defiled, and not exercised: And their Worship and Ministry, which stands not in the Exercise of a pure Conscience, but in vain Traditions, and superstitious Idolatry, are the People of God forc'd to maintain with Maintenance, by Oppression, contrary to their Consciences: And the unjustness of these things cries for Vengeance upon the Ungodly Rulers and People, who cause the Just and Upright to groan by Oppres∣sion; and thus the Law is subverted, contrary to that End wherefore it was added; and the Government is abused, contrary to that purpose wherefore it was ordain'd of God: For the Guiltless are condemned and judged, and the Guilty are set free; the Exercise of pure Consci∣ences are oppressed, and the false Abominations and Idol Worships are strengthned and defended: and because of these thing is the Wrath of God kindled, and shall not be quench'd, till it hath consumed the Wicked from off the Face of the Earth; that the just God may be fear∣ed, and his People enjoy their Freedom and liberty in the Practice of the the pure Religion, and the Exercise of their pure Consciences; and this will the Lord bring forth in his appointed Time, according to his Promise, that his People may rejoyce in him over all their Op∣pressors and Cruel Task-Masters, which do unjustly oppress the Seed of God. And as concerning the maintaining of Ministers, it is the same in nature, and as Unjust and Unequal, as upholding of Worshipping-houses; for though many, out of a good Conscience, do deny to maintain a pro∣fessed Minister, by paying to him so much, or such a Sum; yet they do not hereby wrong him wilfully, contrary to Right, in breaking any Contract or Covenant, formerly made with him by themselves, or Predecessors; nor they do not with-hold from him any thing, which properly belongs to him as Debt, or due for his Labour, by any Cove∣nant binding thereunto: Only the most that can be said is, That such a Sum or Gift was formerly given out of that Estate to a man belonging to such a Parish, and therefore now is claim'd as due by Custom of ma∣ny Generations practice, and so ought to be done, as the Maintenance to that man because of his Labour in his Ministry. Now to this I an∣swer, What though it was formerly done, such a Sum paid, and such a Gift freely given by our Ancestors, in the time of Ignorance and Darkness; that Practice of theirs then doth not bind any now to do the same, seeing no Record can appear, That they bound themselves
and their Heirs for ever so to do; and now hath the clear Light of the Gospel sprung forth, and the light of the day hath discovered all the works of Ignorance; and though the man that claims such a Gift, or Hire, as debt to him, because of his labour, let them pay him for whom he doth labour, and who do partake of his Ministry and La∣bour; and let others be free, who for Conscience sake cannot do it, who know his labour not deserving of wages, but to be Deceit and Abomination, and deceiving of Souls; and sees him to be a proud, covetous man, and an idle person, who maintains himself by the fruit of other mens labours, in the vanity of life, and without the Fear of the Lord, and this makes the thing a matter of Conscience to ma∣ny, that for no better use, nor to no other end they should pay their Money (which cannot be justly claimed, as a just debt, but as a gift at most) to the upholding of such men, and such practises, which are not according, but contrary to God, in labour, life, and practice; and to uphold and maintain a man as a Minister of Christ, which is not so, but the contrary, as by his fruits is made manifest, and that in Ministry and Worship, which is not the Worship and Ministry of the true God, but the contrary, as doth appear; this many of the people of God cannot do, for a good Conscience sake, except they should transgress the Light of Christ, and the Law of God in their own Hearts and Consciences, and so bring themselves into con∣demnation by the Lord. So let all men take notice hereof, that though the People of God do deny to pay any thing, to uphold and maintain such a Worship, and such Ministers, which are not the Ministers of Christ, nor the Worship of the true God; but rather gives their Goods to the Spoiler, and their Bodies to the Prison; yet this is onely for the Exercise of a good and pure Conscience, and not out of wilfull wrong or injury; and their Sufferings are not as they are Evil-Doers, but as they are Saints, for a good Conscence sake, because they cannot be subject to the wills of unjust men, in upholding and main∣taining such things against their Consciences; but are willing ra∣ther to suffer, then offend the Lord, and their own Consciences; neither is there good Reason nor Equity in it, nor any part of a good Conscience, that people by injustice should be compelled to maintain a Minister, whom they know is not the Minister of Christ, by his fruits, and effects, and practises; and so are forced against their own Conscience to uphold a man in Pride, in Idleness, in co∣vetousness, and in a vain and Evil life, by unrighteous Wages: Now if their Money was to maintain a man that's poor, or if that man had not of his own sufficiently to preserve his Wife and Chil∣dren from want, then it were a work of Charity to give something, if it were every year, or oftner, to maintain him and his Family; and the People of God would not refuse to give something for this end; no man should compel them, nor have cause to spoil their Goods for it; but as he professeth himself a Minister of Christ, and a
Labourer in the Gospel, but is not so, but lives in pride, and the vanities of this World; upon such an account they cannot main∣tain him, nor give him any thing at all, with a safe Conscience; neither is there any reason in it, that they should; for they receive not his Ministry, neither do hear him, neither do own him as a Minister of Christ, nor do not partake of his Labours, nor do not set him on labouring; and this is greatly unjust, that any man should pay, or be compelled to pay (by force and oppression) Wages to a man, as his Labourer, and as his Servant, who doth not at all La∣bour for him, or do him any Service, neither doth the man partake of his Works or Labours, neither hath any benefit thereby, but ra∣ther loss and disadvantage because of his labours, which he doth for others, and not for him, nor by any order from him; for he knows his Labour to be nothing but Vanity, and a Cheat, and decei∣ving of People; and for him to be compelled to maintain such a man, in such ill imployment against his Conscience, this is unjust and unreasonable: and what man in the World would do it, or be compelled thereunto, without crying out of great Oppres∣sion; as to maintain a Man with great Wages, as his Labourer, and Servant who doth not Labour for him, nor serve him, but labours against him as much as is possible; and this is the very cause, between the Priests of England in their Maintenance, in claim∣ing of it, and receiving of it, and the people of the Lord, who do de∣ny to maintain them, or confess any lawfull due they have to chal∣lenge any of them. And also it is a very shame to the people of this Nation for whom such Ministers do labour, who cannot maintain their own Ministers themselves, who labours for them, and of whose labours they do partake, but others are compelled by injustice, to maintain them, who do not partake of any of their labours, nor set them to la∣bour, but denies them and their labour on that account, and yet are forced to pay them Wages; and this is unjust and unreasona∣ble, that men should be constrained by force to pay, other mens Servants, which works and labours for other, and not for them; and what man in the World having reason in him, would do it or be forced to do it, without complaining of heavy injustice, as to main∣tain another mans Servant with Wages, who works for others, and not for him, neither was hired by him, nor set on work, nor receives any benefit by him, but another hires him, and partakes of his la∣bours, and yet he is compelled against all reason, and equity to give him his Wages; all will conclude this were unjust and not according to God, but against him; and this is the very cause between the peo∣ple of God, who cannot pay to maintain false Teachers and the people of the Nation, who hires such Teachers and receives of their labours and teaching and yet compells others to give them Wages, contrary to good reason and Justice, and against the excercise of a pure Conscience; And above all the Magistrates blindness and Igno∣rance,
and the unjustness and wickedness of some of them doth appear, to their shame, by whose authority these things are done, reaching out their power in those things, further than they have received power from God, and abusing the Law and just government, and subverting it to another end then wherefore God hath ordained it; for the Magi∣strates power and authority, is not to be laid on mens Consciences to Oppress and Imbondage the tender Consciences of the Lords people; in forcing things to be done contrary to good reason, and against a good Conscience; and by these things is the Land filled with violence and oppression, and the Innocent and Just do deeply groan; till the Lord arise to plead their cause, and to bring deliverance unto them, through the destruction of all their Enemies; and he will break down all the bonds of Cruelty and Oppression, and will take away every yoak that doth burden and oppress the upright, that his people may be a free people, from all unjust men; and the people of the Lord do claim this as their Priviledge, belonging to them by the just Laws of God and men, to Worship God in Spirit and in Truth, and to uphold and maintain that Worship onely, without being compelled by force to maintain any other whatsoever, and they claim as right unto them to maintain what Ministers, and uphold what ministry, as they know is sent of God, by which people are profited, and which they have received the knowledge of God through, by his Spirit, and to be free to maintain how, and as the Lord leads them unto, without being forced by any Law, or unequall authority, to maintain the false Pro∣phets and Hirelings, and Deceivers, who live in pride and excess, through the Oppression of the poor and Innocent, and such (as Mini∣sters of the Gospel of Christ,) the people of the Lord cannot main∣tain, but rather give themselves to suffer heavy and cruel things by unjust and wicked men, who violates the just Laws of God and man; and the suffering is for a good Conscience sake, and for righteousness sake, and not for any wrong or Evil-doing, and for a Testimony that they are of God, and for a witness against their Enemies, that they are of the Devil; who do his works, and these make war against the Saints, and the Lamb, and the Beast seeks to kill all that will not worship him; for he hath been great in the Earth, and his seat upon Nations, and who have been able to make war against him, for many Generations? again there is another suffering great and grievous which is unjustly laid upon the people of God, which suf∣fering is not for Evil-doing, but for a good Conscience sakes as is manifest; as because many are moved of the Lord by his Spirit, to go into the Steeple-houses, and Meeting-places, or other places to reprove sin, and among people, or to exhort them unto good, and to follow Christ, and to deny the wickedness of this World, or such like, as they are moved, some are moved to reprove a Hireling Teacher, who deceives the people, and walks in the steps of the false Pro∣phets, and lives in Pride and Vainty and evil, contrary to the Doctrine and Practise of Christ and the Apostles; and this Practise of the
Servants of the Lord in reproving evil, and exhorting to good, is called a disturbance of the Peace, and an unlawfull Practice, and such like, it is falsly judged by unjust men, who know not the Spirit of the Lord, nor the moving thereof; and because of this, many innocent men are caused deeply to suffer, contrary to a good Conscience; and some are sent to the House of Correction, there suffering cruel things from hard-hearted men; and some are put in the Stocks, and Whip∣ped, and others Fined, and cast into Prison; and such like Sufferings are unjustly imposed upon them, and not for Evil-doing, as I have said; for though they reprove sin in Teachers, or in People, or exhort them to good, whether in Steeple-houses, Markets, or other Places; yet they do not hereby wrong any mans Person or Estate; neither is this any matter of wilfull wrong, or to such an intent, neither doth it disturb the Peace, nor is any unlawfull Practice; but onely out of a good Conscience to God and man is it done; and it is a mat∣ter of Conscience to the Servants of the Lord to do so, and they cannot leave it undone, lest they would transgress the Law of God in their own Consciences; because they are commanded of God so to do, that people may be instructed in the right way to God, and be converted out of every false Way; and this is the very end of their work, and their intent in doing it; and they ought not in justice to suffer for it, for it is according to the Law of God, and in Rea∣son and a good Conscience, and the Lord justifies them in it; then that Law and Judgment must needs be corrupt and unjust, which condemns the People and Servants of the Lord, as for Evil-Doers, for obeying the Commands of God, and for the Exercise of their pure Consciences, and no mans Person or Estate being wronged, or injured, but onely Sin and Wickedness reproved, and exhorted from: and hereby thus is the Law perverted, and true Judgment turned backward, and the guiltless is condemned guilty, and the guilty is set free; and the obeying the Commands of God, and the Exer∣cise of a good Conscience is unjustly judged a Transgression; and this is a shame, and will be great condemnation to such, in the Day of the Lord, by whose Authority this is done; even that the Exercise of a good Conscience, even reproving of sin and exhorting unto that which is good, to follow that, and to forsake all evil, should be judg∣ed and punished as a hainous Transgression in a Nation and Com∣mon-wealth professing Christianity and pure Religion; and this makes the sin much more great and unpardonable, because the practise and faithfull excercise in Chistianity, and in the pure and true Religion is adjudged Transgression, and condemned by such who profess the same thing in words, and yet persecute, and punish the Exercise of it in others; and this shews them unjust Judges, and Hypocrites, who cause the Servants of the Lord to suffer, for the practice of that which themselves profess in words, to wit, Religion and Chri∣stianity; for I affirm, against all Opposers whatsoever, that it is a Pra∣ctice in Religion, according to the Scriptures, to go into the Steeple-Houses,
Meeting-places, Markets, High-wayes, or other places, and reprove sin and wickedness, and cry against evil in Priests and peo∣ple, and exhort to good, and to forsake evil, and therefore it ought not to be prosecuted and punished, but defended and maintained, by the Just Government of a Common-Wealth, and by Just Laws and Magistrates; for this the Lord requireth, that Justice and Truth, and true Judgement be exalted, and the Innocent and Unright de∣fended, in all their wayes of a good Conscience, and that Evil∣doers, and Sinners, and Transgressors, be condemned, and righteously judged. Also many of the Servants of the Lord do deeply suffer, and is deeply afflicted by injustice, for the exercise of a good Conscience in other things, as because they cannot put off their Hats and bow in re∣spect to mens persons, according to the vain customs of the Heathen; and because they cannot Swear upon a Book, by kissing it, and laying the hand upon it, according to the idolatrous form, and for such like causes, because many cannot fulfil the lusts and wills of men, that live in pride and evil wayes, in these and other things, therefore are the people of God put to great sufferings, though they deny not the honour due to all men in the Lord, without bowing the Hat, nor to affirm the truth in every cause, in faithfulness without an Oath; now to keep on the Hat, which is a cover for the head, to keep from cold or heat, for healths sake, before any man whatsoever, though never so great or noble, is not any wrong or injury to the mans per∣son or estate before whom it is done, but onely the high minde and the proud nature, and that which is exalted above the fear of God, which would be Lord over his fellow creatures, that same is offend∣ed and troubled, which bears not the Image of God, but of the Devil, as Hamman was, and would be bowed to, and had in honour, and re∣spected, because of knowledge or parts, and proud gestures or ap∣parel; and the Children of the Lord cannot do it, nor give honour to him, nor be subject, and pleasing to that man, who is of that spirit and of that nature which is not of God, but exalted in pride, and vain-glory above the fear of God, and against him, and would be worshipped, and had in honour and reverenced of his Fellow-creatures, who hath not so much riches in this World as he, nor is so proud in apparel as he; and because of that he looks to be bowed unto with Hat or Knee, and is offended if he be not, and then in his pride he rages and is vexed, and seeks revenge against such as cannot honour him, and respect him in his pride and vain-glory; but as I said this is not done as a matter of wrong unto any, though the Hat be not bowed or put off, but it is a matter of Conscience unto the people of God, and for a good Conscience sake they do deny, and may not give obedience, and honour, and respect, out of the fear of God, to proud flesh, and to men which is not in the fear of God, which expects reverence out of the Lord, and they know it is nothing else that is of∣fended but proud flesh, and an exalted mind, and a man that fears not
God, neither walks in his ways; I say, it is nothing else, nor any besides, that is offended or troubled, because the Hat is not put off and bowed, and the people of God are not careful to please or offend that in men, and men as such, for they know nothing of God; nor any man that truly Fears God will be offended at the want of a Hat bowed to him, and thus it is a matter of Conscience unto many, and for a good Conscience sake they do deny to honour and subject themselves by obedience to any man, as he is a man out of the fear of God, and in the glory of the vain World, expecting re∣verence out of the Fear of God, and contrary to his Law, which forbids the respect to persons, and all honour which is not according to God; for who doth fear to offend a man, as a man without the Fear of God, and doth obey and honour any man, by putting off the Hat before him, or otherwise, and not onely in the Lord; such are Servants to the wicked one, and not unto God; who fears the wrath of the wicked, and subjects in honour to please the wicked by putting off, and bowing the Hat and such like; and such knows not the excercise of a pure Conscience to God; so this is a matter of Conscience to deny to honour, and to please wicked men, as such, by bowing the Hat, and no man in justice ought to be made to suffer because o it, for the Law of God justifies it, and that Law and Judgement is corrupt, and perverted, which condemns it. And likewise though many deny to swear at all, though not to testifie the Truth; yet they do not wilfully wrong hereby to any mans Person or Estate, but it is a matter of conscience unto them, and with a good Conscience they cannot swear, but do deny it upon all Conditions, because Christ hath commanded not to swear at all, and the Apostle doth exhort, above all things, not to swear; and therefore it is a matter of conscience unto many, and not a matter of purposed wrong towards any man, and though here it may be objected; But for want of an Oath, a just man may loose his just Cause; because Judgment depends upon witness by oath: to that I answer, that is be∣cause, the Law is not according to Christ, by which the Judgment comes, but is unjustly grounded upon the breach of Christs Command, viz. swearing; and whether ought the man to be blamed or condemn∣ed as a Transgressor, who keeps Christ's Command, and cannot swear at all upon any Tearms, or whether that Law ought not to be corrected and regulated to be according to the Law of Christ, and all that which is contrary in the execution thereof to be condemned and removed, that a just man's witness may be given and taken upon occasion, with∣out an Oath; and his just cause may go on against his Enemies, by just judgment, grounded upon the naked truth, in plainness testi∣fied without swearing, this is to be considered; and though it be again obiected, but many, say some, makes more Conscience and are more afraid to testify falsly upon Oath, then upon bare words without an Oath; so to have the truth known wholly, that is the
end of the Oath; to this I answer, a man that truly and uprightly fears God, will be as much afraid and make as much Conscience of speaking falsly, as of swearing falsly; and out of a good Conscience will testifie as truly, as if he swore: and for others, who fears to swear falsly, and doth not so much fear to speak falsly without Oath, this is because there is a greater punishment to such, and it is accounted a greater offence among men, to swear falsly, then to speak falsly, and for the correcting of that, the punishment and offence should be changed, and such as testify falsly without Oath, may be accounted Offenders and punished, as such who swears falsly, and this will bind the wicked in a sufficient fear, and cause them to be afraid, of testifying falsly, even as much as of swearing falsly, if the testimony in causes among men, of such evil persons who cannot make Conscience of lying, nor speak the truth without swearing, it ought the rather to be had, and to be done, by binding by a Law, and punishing, if he testifie a Lye, then by causing him to continue in the breach of Christs command; but however, still I say, such who out of a good and tender Conscience, do deny to swear, ought not to be persecuted and punished as great Of∣fenders; for while this is done, the Law and good Government is perverted, and authority is greatly abused, to another end then wherefore it was ordained of God, and that Law and authority must needs be unjust which oppresseth, or punisheth the excercise of a good Conscience, as for evill doing; and this shews the blindness and ig∣norance of men in authority to whom the Law is committed who discerns not, neither makes a difference betwixt things done in the Fear of God, and in the excercise of a good Conscience towards him, and things done out of an evil minde to evil intets, purposely and wilfully to do wrong and injury to mens persons and estates; for all Magistrates ought to learn this, and to distinguish, that their pow∣er and authority may justifie the one, and condemn the other, that true justice and sound judgement, may spring forth in the Earth, and in the Nations, that all the Upright and Well-doers may rejoyce, and live in rest and peace, and all the Workers of Iniquity, and such as do Evil may be afraid, and fear to offend just men, and just Laws; and thus would the Name of the Lord be great in the Earth among men; and such a Government renowned for ever, and such Magi∣strates would be a praise to Generations after them, and a blessed ex∣ample to Ages to come; But now some may say, and object; how shall this be known? and who can tell and discern of such Causes, and who it is that do their Works, out of the exercise of a good Con∣science, and who do their Deeds out of an evil Minde, and to an evil intent, and so is wrong dealing, and worthy of punishment? this is a doubtful Cause may some say, and difficult to be known and under∣stood: But to this I answer, and say, To all such as have the Spirit of the Father, and are led thereby, and in their Judgement guided therewith, this is an easie thing to discern, and an easie matter to know and find out; and such as cannot discern and distingush in such
Matters have not the Spirit of God, nor the spirit of true and sound Judgment; neither is indeed ordained of God, nor fit to judge the People, nor the honour of a Ruler and Judge belongs not to such a one who cannot find out a matter, nor know and judge between the preci∣ous and the vile, how to justifie the one, and how to condemn the other; and indeed, this is the reason and cause of so much Injustice and Oppression brought forth at this day; because the spirit of sound Judgment is wanting, and such as are set to judge hath it not, to try, and discern, and give Judgment by it; and therefore Light is put for Darkness, and Darkness for Light; and good is called Evil, and Evil Good, and true Justice and Judgment is perverted and turned backward, and the guiltless is condemned guilty. But, I say, if the work be done by a man, out of a good Conscience, and as a mat∣ter of Conscience, then he doth it in the Fear of God, and in the cross to his own will, and in meekness and tenderness of heart, not seeking himself in what he doth, but is willing to suffer for the Truth sake, and for what he doth, and will not resist Evil, or the false Judgments of men; but patiently, and quietly bears all things, for the Lords sake; and in all what. he doth or suffers, he gives the glory to the Lord, who works his works in him, and gives him strength and pati∣ence willing to suffer for them: But again, I do answer, by men that have the spirit of sound Judgment to rule and guide them, this cause is easie to be discerned, and the difference may be known, be∣twixt a thing done out of a good Conscience, and for a good Con∣science sake, and a thing done out of an evil mind and purpose, and to an evil end, to the wrong and injury of another; for the ground from whence the works do proceed, are contrary, and the spirit by which the works are wrought are contrary, and the purpose and end to which they are wrought are contrary, and the spirit of God, and of sound Judgment may, and doth put a difference betwixt the ground, acting, and end of all works; for it is the ground from whence all works do spring, and the end unto which they are brought forth, that makes all mens works good or evil, to be justified, or to be condemned; and where the Measure of the Spi∣rit and Power of God is the Ground of, and Leader in a work, that work, as I have said, is done in the Fear of the Lord, and in up∣rightness of heart, and in love and tenderness, and meekness and patience, without seeking or exalting self; but the Glory of the Lord is only sought by that man in all such his works. But on the contrary, where an evil heart and mind brings forth works to an evil end, and to the wrong of others, such works are maliciously and wil∣fully, and enviously, and peevishly done, in forwardness, and headi∣ness, and not in the Fear of God, nor in uprightness of heart; but with a double mind, and in secret, or without the Counsel of God, seeking himself in his works, and not the Lord, and such works are wicked, and wrought by wicked men, who transgresseth both the Law of God and of men, and must receive according to their deeds; and
the Law that is equal must pass upon them, which the Light of Christ in their own Consciences may answer to, when they are condemned for their ungodly works; against which Light they act, and that is the reason and cause, wherefore their works are evil, and to be con∣demned by the Law; for who acteth according to the Light of Christ, and is led thereby, fulfilleth the Law, or it is fulfilled in him; and his works are wrought in God, and are the testimony unto men, that he is of a good conscience, and for a good Conscience sake his works are done, and such men and works are not to be condemned, but justifi∣ed: And this is for Instruction to all them that bear Rule, who are Ma∣gistrates, and Governours, and Judges of the people, that they may now be wife, and learn wisdom, how to judge righteously and justly among people, that they may fulfil the Will of God in what he hath cal∣led them unto, even that they may cherish, and defend, and strengthen such as do well, and all whose pure Consciences are purely exer∣cised, may live in peace and rest under such a Government; and all Evil-Doers may be bound, limitted, and judged, and may stand in awe, and be afraid; and thus Justice and true Judgment would be ad∣vanced, and Equity would run down as a mighty Stream, and the Na∣tion would be blessed, and yeild content and satisfaction to her Inha∣bitants; and hereby might the Rulers and Judges gain unto themselves a good report, and an honour and renown would the Lord crown them withal in Generations to come. Wherefore, all ye Rulers, and ye that are set to judge the people, be now awakened to just Judgment, and to a sound discerning, and put on the spirit of true Judgment, even the Spirit of the Lord, that you may receive it, to be taught in all things, how to walk with God, that you may answer his call, and the End of your Authority, in judg∣ing justly all sorts of men, rendring to every man according to his Deeds; even Condemnation and Judgment to Evil-Doers, and a Praise and Defence to all that do well. And this is written in love to you all, shewing you how to put a difference betwixt the Precious and the Vile; between the Just and Unjust, that you may be the more happy, if this you observe; not leaving your names a Reproach, and a Scorn to after Ages, which is the effect which doth follow all such as pervert Justice, and turns true Judgment backward, with Misery and Destruction upon themselves and Posterity for evermore.
A True and Faithful Exposition of some part of the Laws of ENGLAND. ALL ye Magistrates, Justices of the Peace, Mayors, and all other Ministers of the Law, and all ye to whomsoever the Law is committed, I warn you all to take heed to your selves, that ye fulfil the Will of the Lord, in judging Righteously and executing true Justice and Judgment: and let not Envy, nor false Suspitions, nor Jealousies have any place in you; but with a single Eye try all things, and with an upright Heart judge for God, and not for man: and beware of causing the Innocent to suffer, whose Consciences are exercised towards God, though they be contrary to the World in their Wayes and Judgments; for if you cause such to suffer, you do not execute true Judgment, but subvert the Law; and the Lord will re∣quire that Suffering of his People at your hands. Now consider, The Law was not made for a Righteous Man, but for Transgressors, such whose Consciences are not exercisd towards God; and such your Sword is to be laid upon; to be a Terror to them, and not to the Innocent; for they should have Praise that do well: And you must take heed lest you abuse your Power to another End then wherefore God hath ordained it; for the Law was added because of Transgression, to slay the Trans∣gressor; and that is the End of the Law. Now you must take heed of causing any to suffer upon bare Suspition, or Evil Jealousies, when as no Transgression is truly charged, nor justly proved against them before you: And you are not to be both Accusers and Judges of any one, in any Cause. You have a late Act for the taking up, and punishing of idle, lse and dissolute Persons; such as are Vagrants, and wandering Rogues, Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars: Now this Law is good, if it be duly and justly exe∣cuted upon such as are truly guilty herein; and it is right that sturdy Beggars, and Rogues, and idle and disorderly Persons, should be taken up from wandering, and set on work in some good Imployment in the Creation, which may maintain themselves, and prevent them from worse things: But now you must take heed of judging any to be such, who are not really so; for, many of the Servants of the Lord now, as it was in Generations past, are moved to leave their own Country, and Dwellings, and Relations; and go abroad in the Nations, to preach the Gospel of Christ, and to bear witness of his Name in the World; to the turning of People from the wayes of Sin and Death, to the Way of Righteousness and Truth: and it may be such cannot give you an Account, or sufficient Cause of their travelling abroad (so as to satisfie you) For that is lawful in the sight of God, which you may not judge to be so; for God's Wayes are not man's wayes, neither are his Thoughts as man's thoughts: There∣fore, I say unto you, If you cause any such of the Servants of
the Lord to suffer by that Law, you abuse your power, and subvert the Law; for such are not Vagabonds, nor idle dissolute Persons, nor Rogues, nor sturdy Beggars; no more than Christ was, who had no where to lay his head; and the Prophets and Apostles were, some of which had no certain dwelling place, but left their Countries, and Re∣lations, and wandred up and down the World, from Town to Town, and from one Country to another, even as the Servants of the Lord do by the same Spirit, at this day, who can no more be truly judged for Va∣gabonds, and Rogues, &c. than Christ and his Apostles could be, who were a perfect example to us in these things; For it is a lawful occasion, in the Sight of God, whatever you judge of it, to travel up and down (not being burthen some, or chargeable to any) to beat witness for the Name of the Lord, and against all Sin and Iniquity, that people may be reformed, and instructed in the right way; Therefore you must make a special distinction in your Judgement, between such as are Rogues, and idle and dissolute persons, who are hurtful to the Creation, and such as are innocent and harmless, and not of evil behaviour, (though you may through prejudice otherwise judge of them) this is to inform you herein, that your Judgments may be according to God, and not according to man, neither with respect of persons. Also you have another late Act for the Observation of the Lord's-Day, wherein is inserted, That none shall wilfully, maliciously, or of pur∣pose disturb, or disquiet the publick Preacher, or to make any publick Disturbance in the Congregation. Now the Law is good, and it is right that all such be punished, who do malitiously, wilfully, or of an evil purpose disturb or disquiet any man, or people, to the danger of breach of publick Peace; and let all such be punished according to their desert: But yet you must take heed in this cause; for many of the Servants of the Lord are, and may be moved by the Power of the Lord to come into a Congregation, or an Assembly of People to declare against Sin and Iniquity, and the Wayes of Wickedness in People; or to ask a Question soberly of the Teacher, or to instruct People to Edifica∣tion in the Way of the Lord, or such like may they do, as they are moved, nd yet not maliciously, nor wilfully, nor of wicked purpose; for it was the Apostles Practice, and the Practice of the Saints, to go in the Synagogues and Meeting-places, and to dispute with the Teachers on the Sabbath-days, and sometimes they spoke to the people by way of Exhortation, and the people bid them speak on; and yet these were not Disturbers of the Assembly, neither were they malicious men, or wilful, neither did they these things to any evil purpose; and it was the Practise of the Saints, that all may speak one by one in the Church, when they were assembled together; and this is the Pra∣ctise of the Servants of the Lord now; and yet they cannot justly be con∣demned by your Law, though they come into your Assembly, as they are moved of the Lord, to object, or reprove, or exhort; for they do it not in malice towards any, but in love towards all, and they can no
more justly be condemned than the Apostles, and Saints in the Primi∣tive times, who were unto us a just example in these Practises, as you may read in the Scripture; and you may as justly condemn them, as us, who are guided by the same spirit in the same things; There∣fore you have need to take heed of condemning the Innocent by a Law, lest you bring innocent blood upon you; and you must make a perfect difference between such as comes among you, Wilfully and maliciously, and on evil purpose to disturb, and molest any man, or Congregation, and such who comes in the Name and Fear of the Lord, who are moved of him, contrary to their own wills, an h love to all people; And in these causes you have need of discerning and sound judgement, lest you condemn the guiltless, and abuse your power, and subvert the Law, and so bring condemnation upon your selves; And as you will answer it before the Lord in his dreadfull day, cause not any to suffer through your envy, and surmizings, or false suspition, through over-reaching the words of the Law to a wrong sense, and to a wrong end. Also it is inserted in the same Act against many evil things,  drinking in Taverns, Inns, Ale-houses, Strong-water-houses, or to Tipple unnecessarily, or any other house, &c. and also against travelling, and walking on that day vainly and prophanely, &c. Now the Law is good, that evil exercise be prevented, and prophaneness in every respect on that day, and on every day, and that such be punished that are found in any evil exercise whatsoever; But yet you must take heed that none of the Innocent suffer hereby; for many of the people of God may, and do travel on that day to meet together to worship God, and to wait upon him, to find his presence, and to receive of his refreshments to their souls; But this cannot be judged an evil practise, or prophane travelling, or breach of the Sabbath; For we read of a Sabbath-days Journey, Acts 1. and 12. where some of the Servants of the Lord returned from Ierusalem to Mount Olivet, which is a Sabbath-dayes Journey, so that such, who now travels to wait upon the Lord on that day, though it be several Miles to, and from the place of Meeting, cannot justly be judged to be Sabbath-breakers, no more than the Apostles, who travelled a Sabbath-days Journey in obedience to the Lord to wait upon him; So that you must take heed, and make a noted distinction betwixt such who travel on a profane, and an evil exercise, or about the affairs of this World, and such who travel on a good exercise to wait upon the Lord, and to serve him; For the Law it self excepts such from being taken up, or judged Sabbath-breakers: So take heed that you subvert not the Law, and abuse your power through false judgement, through your own envy, and so you smite the guiltless, and brings de∣struction upon your selves; For herein we own the Law of God to walk by, and the Apostles for an example, though we may suffer unjustly by you.
Also there is a late Act, for Discovering and Repressing of Popish Recu∣sants, by presenting to such as are Popish, or Popishly affected, an Oath, as is therein described, To renounce the Pope's Authority, and to de∣ny all his Doctrines; and to testifie against the Authority of the Church of Rome, and against any Licence given, thereby to bear Arms, or raise Tu∣mults; or by Violence to hurt the chief Magistrate, or Government of these Nations, &c. And such as deny the taking of that Oath, are to be ad∣judged Popish Recusants, and to be proceeded against accordingly. Now that Law is good, That such, who are adherent to the Pope, and by his Authority would raise Armies and Tumults, and offer Violence to the Hurt of the chief Magistrate, or Government, or people of these Nations, &c. as it is signified in the said Oath, should be discovered and repressed: But yet you must take heed, and wait for sound Judgment in the Prosecution of the same: For all are not to be condemned that cannot swear, or take an Oath; for many of the Ser∣vants of the Lord, who are Followers of Christ, cannot swear for Conscience sake, because Christ hath commanded, Not to Swear at all; though such do deny the Pope, and all his Authority and Doctrines, and whatsoever else is signified in that Oath, who cannot justly be sus∣pected to be any way adherent to the Pope in Doctrines or Practices, ex∣cept through wicked Envy you seek occasion against them thereby; and you abuse your Power, and subvert the Law, if you judge such to be Popish Recusants, because they will not Swear, because they cannot for Conscience sake; but walk in Christ's Doctrine, who commanded not to Swear; and follow the Apostle's Example, who said, Above all things, my Brethren, Swear not at all, And such cannot justly be suspected or judged for Popish Recusants, who are Followers of Christ, and keep his Commands. Therefore you must be considerate, and search deep in∣to those things that are thus weighty, lest you cause the Guiltless to suf∣fer, and thereby vex the Lord against your selves: And you must make a special difference betwixt such as will not Swear, because they are guilty; and such as cannot Swear for Conscience sake, though they are not guilty, but clear and free in the sight of the Lord of such things, as may be falsly suspected and charged against them by envious men, which may watch for Evil, and give Information against the People of God unto you: But let your Eye be single in all these things, that you may save your selves from Wrath and Condemnation, which will be a Reward of all such, who subvert good Laws to a wrong End, and seek to cover themselves in their Persecution of the Innocent by making the Law a Cloak; but such Coverings will not hide in the Day of the Lord. And my Friends, In the Execution of these, and other Laws, let the Fear of God guide you, and true Judgment and sound Discerning, that you may try into the Nature and Ground of every thing, and may not judge only by outward Appearance, but judge Righteous Judg∣ment. And this is a great Transgression in the Sight of the LORD at this Day, even the false Execution of Good LAWS, and the
subversion of them to wrong Ends and Uses by some wicked men, who are in Authority, to whom the Law is committed: And this we know by Experience, Be the Law never so just and good, yet if the Executio∣ners of the Law be unjust and unrighteous, true Justice and Judgment is turn'd backward, and for want thereof the Harmless and Innocent daily suffer; which kindleth and encreaseth the fierce Anger of the Lord against these Nations. And likewise, All you that are in Power and Authority, you ought not to command any thing of any man, which the Law gives you no power to Command; for, doing so, you make your selves Transgres∣sors; as for instance, You have no Power by any Law to command men to put off their Hats, when they come before you; neither by any Law can you justly punish them, if they do it not: neither can you justly punish such by any Law, who deny to Swear, because for Conscience sake they cannot: But what hath been inflicted upon some in such cases, hath been by Will and Ma∣lice, and not by any Law; and the Lord doth account such things against the Wicked, who cause such Sufferings. And of these things I have given you Warning, and it is in perfect Love unto you all, as to inform you truly, lest you cause the Innocent to suffer. I am a real Friend to the Common-wealth, and a Lover of Iustice and true Iudgment, and fully affected towards Iust Government, and wish well to Magistrates, E. B. The 9th Moneth, 1657.
AN 1658 EPISTLE To go abroad Among Friends IN WESTMORLAND and CUMBERLAND, And elswhere among the Flock of God. FRiends, my love and life, which is not of this World, but which is in the living God doth reach unto, and salute all you that are in the Light of Life, and in the Truth it self, which changeth not, which endureth for ever, which we receive of God the ever∣lasting Father, through the Gospel, which came unto us in the de∣monstration of the Spirit, and of Power, to the changing of us from Death, which reigned over us, to Life, in which we have power over Death, and to the turning of us from the power of Satan, where∣in we were held, unto the power of the living God, wherein we be∣came fruitful, and a good savour unto him through Nations. Dearly Beloved, in the same Truth be faithful unto death, in that which cannot sin, nor be overcome of the Tempter, which Satan hath no∣thing in, wherein only our fellowship and union standeth one with another, as we abide in the living Vine Christ Jesus the Light of the World, in which you have believed unto Eternal Life, and have entered into the Rest which is prepared; as you continue therein, you cannot be moved or shaken, but are as Mount-Sion, established in the Power, and Life, and Wisdom of the Everlasting God, which condemns Darkness, and all its works, and gives dominion and rule over all the powers of Death and Hell, which worketh in the Chil∣dren of Disobedience, who know not God, nor receive the Truth, much more in them who turns from the Light and Knowledge of the Truth, into the Liberty of the Flesh, to serve sin, having made ship∣wrack of Fear, and of Faith and a good Conscience, who shall bear their own shame and condemnation in the Sight of God & man, and shall have no part with us in the Inheritance of Peace and Righteousness; but the later end of such is worse then the beginning: Wherefore you that are in the Covenant of Peace, where sin is not remembred, nor committed, nor the unclean thing touched, dwell and abide in the
Life of God, and in his Strength, which reigns over all the World, with its temptations, and over all false Brethren, and over all de∣ceitful Workers, whose Eye becometh darkned, and heart hardned through the deceitfulness of sin, turning the Grace of God into wantonness, and giving liberty to the unclean thing, which is accursed, and joyned to the Harlot, and become one Flesh; but in the Counsel of the Lord God walk before him, and keep your selves pure and un∣defiled, and partake not of the deeds of the Wicked, neither give place to the Devil, to be perverted by him from the Truth of the living God, which is Truth in it self for ever, though the Backsliders despise the Way of it; and every one abide in your own, and know a mea∣sure of the Strength of Christ Jesus in you, to defend you from the Ene∣my, who seeks to beguile and to devour, and to divert from the per∣fect Way of Life and Peace; and dwell in your own measure of the Grace of God, which is perfect, which is sufficient to teach, and lead and preserve in all the Wayes of God, which the Unclean cannot walk in; but he that keepeth you, reproveth, and condemneth, and cast∣eth out the Devil, and all his works and Workers, who abide not in Christ Jesus, nor in the Truth, wherein we worship the Father, who are called of him, and faithful and chosen Followers of the Lamb, who taketh away our Sin, and giveth power over it, and overthe Temp∣ter, who seeketh to betray the Just One. And from the Eternal God I warn you, Every one know a Hiding∣place in God; the day of great shaking cometh upon the Garden of God; the Beast that had a Wound by a Sword, whose deadly Wound is healed, may live, and power may he given him for a Moment, to make war against the Lamb and his Followers; and Satan may prevail to winnow you, and to try you for your Life; therefore be armed with the whole Armour of Light, which manifesteth the Mystery of Iniquity, and the working of spiritual Wickednesses in high places, and which defendeth you from his power, out of the Snare of the Devil, in the Simplicity, as it is in Christ Jesus, who is our Rock and our Strength, by which we overcome the fiery Darts of the Enemy, which come against us; and dwell in the Truth, that you may know the Life which standeth in God, with whom there is no shaddow of turning, but is the same forever, and keepeth Covenant with his own Elect, which can∣not be overcome of the Devil, nor deceived; in whom, you abiding, you cannot sin, but are kept from being touched with the Wicked One in the Way, and in the Truth, and in the Peace of God, lively and precious in his sight, to serve him in Fear and Faithfulness. And if any go out from the Light, the Living Way, they become as withered Branches, to be cut off from the Body, no more to have Fellowship in the Body, but is reprov'd and judg'd with that which keeps us in the Body. And though some go from the Lord, yet his Faithfulness endureth forever, and his Promise is yea and amen to his own Seed, which keep Covenant with him, and fulfil his Law of
Righteousness and Judgment; and he that breaketh Covenant let him be condemned, that the Creature may be saved in the Day of the Lord; for who draws back, such God's Soul hath no Pleasure in them, but is oppressed with that, and his Soul vexed: Therefore all walk in God's Wisdom, which is Pure and Peaceable; and let not the Name of our God be spoken against through any of you, who have been Partakers of the Word of Truth, through any Disobedience or ungodly Walking; but rather deny your own Liberty, then make it an Occasion to the Flesh, wherein Satan's strength stands; and so God's Blessing you will receive, and his Nurishment unto your Souls, and will be preser∣ved in Faithfulness, not to end in the Flesh, you that have begun in the Spirit. And this in pure Love towards you all, as a Testimony of my Love to the Seed of God in you all, was I moved to write; as seeing in the Light the Day that cometh upon you, of which some may not be aware; and I am clear thus far of the Charge committed to me of God towards you, and am in the Truth it self, which cannot change, and am in it your Friend in the Service of the Lord God, E. B. This is to go abroad among all Friends in Westmorland and Cumber∣land, and elsewhere among the Flock of God, carefully to be Copied over, and read in your Meetings.
A Second General Epistle To all the SAINTS. A Servant of the Lord and Minister of Jesus Christ, thereunto ordain'd and call'd through the Powerful Operation and Gift of the Holy Ghost, unto all his Brethren in the same Life, who are born of God, and Witnesses of his Power; and unto all the Saints and Churches of Christ, who have believ'd and receiv'd the sure and faithful Testimony, and are call'd with the Heavenly Call, to fol∣low the Lamb whithersoever he goes; who is given to you, and recei∣ved of you, a Light, a Guide, and a Teacher in all the Wayes of God: Unto you all that are scatter'd abroad in the World, whether in Bonds or at Liberty, whether strong Men or Children in Christ; unto you all I send Greeting; and above all things wish, and desire and pray unto the Father, for your increase in the Knowledge of him, and Faithfulness in all his Wayes, and that the Increase of his Government may abound among you; and that Grace, Mercy and Peace may plentifully be en∣larged, that nothing may be lacking to you in any thing of that which maketh perfect; but that in Christ Jesus you may be compleat, and that through him you may receive Power, and thereby be strengthned to do all things. My dearly Beloved, and much longed for, in the Fellowship of that Spirit which hath begotten you to be Sons and Daughters of one Father, and Heirs and Fellow-members of that Inheritance of Life, Peace and Rest, which abideth forever. Oh, how I long to meet you all in this, and to find you perfectly settled and established upon the sure Founda∣tion, which God hath laid amongst you, beyond all Doubts, and Fears and Stumblings, above the World and all its Temptations, and above Hell and Death, and all the wayes thereof, having all the powers of Darkness subjected under you, serving the Lord in righteous and per∣fect Holiness, walking in his Strength and Wisdom, shewing forth his Light in the World, as his only redeem'd People. Oh, how is my desire more and more kindled and enlarged towards you all, that you may perfectly attain to the Knowledge of the great Mystery of Salvation, to wit, God dwelling in you! I say, my desire is, That you may know even as you are known, and that you may receive him as you are received of him; and that you may be a perfect Body,
growing up together, and springing forth in all good Fruits, of Truth and Righteousness unto the Father, who is glorify'd through bringing forth much Fruit: And you very well know, that for this End he hath call'd you, and in this his appointed Day caused his Glory to shine forth, and hath visited and brought us to the knowledge of the hidden Mystery of Eternal Salvation, which Mystery hath been seal'd up for many Ages, and is kept secret forever, from the wisdom of this World; but unto us, that have believ'd in the Light of the World, are they clearly discover'd, as at Noon-day; being reveal'd to us by the Spirit which worketh in us the Will and Mind of the Father, and is powerful and mighty, and subdueth and breaketh down the Hardness of Hearts, and through the working thereof every high Thought is brought into subjection to Jesus: And this same Spirit quickeneth and maketh alive to God, and changeth and reneweth into his Image and Likeness, and it raiseth up from under the Bondage of Corruption, to live to God in all things in newness of Life, old things being done away, and all things being made new through the working thereof; and in this same Spi∣rit is the Father alone worshipped, and by it God is known; and his Pro∣mise is fulfilled, it witnessing in all things unto the Father, and is the Earnest of the Inheritance which fadeth not away; and by it know we the deep things of God, which the World by wisdom knoweth not; and thereby are we seal'd and bound up in Covenant with the Father: This is known to you that are Children of the Light, and hereof you have the Witness in your selves, and of God you are approved, and not of men. And all ye my Brethren, who are call'd into the Work and Mini∣stry of the Gospel, unto whom the Word of the Lord is come, and the Gospel of Christ to you committed; Dwell in the Life of God, and feel his Power and Authority, and live in the same Life of which you minister to others, that you may bring People to God, and may ef∣fectually turn them from the dominion of sin unto the Dominion of Christ Jesus, People may be guided out of Darkness in the marvellous Light. Cry aloud, spare not, proclaim the Mighty Day of the Lord in all the Earth; and fear ye not, neither be ye dismay'd at the Face of any man, but be bold and valiant for the Truth upon Earth, and give your Testimony as you have receiv'd from God; and preach Christ Jesus the Light of the World unto all People, that they may receive him, and be converted, and live: For Blindness and Darkness hath cover'd the whole Earth, and all have gone astray from the Lord, as Sheep without a Shepherd: Therefore awake ye them that sleep, and cause the Deaf to hear, and the Dead to rise, that such as have been stray'd may be gather'd; for this is the fulness of time, he is now seek∣ing his Sheep that have been lost, and bringing them Home that have been stray'd; and you, as Instruments in the Lord's Hand, hath he chosen into this Work: Therefore get on the Strength of the Lord, and preach the Gospel of Peace, even the Power of God, that Sinners may be converted, and the Wounded healed, and the Weak may
be strengthned, and they that are ready to dye may be restored to Life and Salvation: This is the Work of the Lord, whereunto you are called; therefore all who unto it are called, be faithful unto the end, and not only by word, but by Life and Conversation also, hold forth the Way of Life: For you must feel that in your selves, of which you minister to others; and you must hold forth the Life, the same which you minister in words; and thereby shall you be made manifest to that of God in all People, and God's Testimony shall answer for you: And see that in all things you divide God's Word aright, not crying Peace to the Wicked, nor healing up the Wound falsly; but that true Judgment in all things may be brought forth by you to all people; Judgment to the Fat, and Bread to the Hungry; they that are Naked must be clothed, and they that are falsly covered must be made bare. Improve the Gift which God hath given you, to him only, and not unto your selves: Be not hasty to utter words before the Lord, but wait for Power from on High, that the Way of God unto Salvation may be faithfully and truly held forth by you unto all people: And faint not, though your Burdens and Tryals be many, but bare all things patiently: love not your lives unto death, that the good Work of the Lord may be accom∣plished, which he hath begun by us, and made prosperous and powerful in our hands unto this very day; you have the Witness (of this:) Our Cause is good; we seek Truth and Righteousness, that it may be esta∣blished in the Earth, and people may be brought unto God; unto this God hath called us, and hath owned us in it, and will never forsake us; for the Work is his, and the Power is his, and whatsoever he will, he bringeth to pass; and therefore why should we doubt, or be weary? For we shall see the Travel of our Souls; the Scattered shall be gathered, and a Remnant of the Seed shall be brought in, which is scatter'd in every Nation, as dry Bones, unable to live: How shall we hide that Treasure which God hath given us, from them that perish for want thereof? Or, How shall we rest satisfied till the scatter'd Sheep be brought Home to the Fold? Our Hearts are troubled to see so many Thousands walking in thick Darkness, and to see the Seed of Israel de∣voured by the Destroyer. Therefore, my Brethren, let us put on strength, the Lord is with us; let us make War in Righteousness for the Lord, against all the Powers of Darkness; let us continually be armed to do and to suffer all things for the Name of the Lord, that People may be instructed in the right Way: we know no man can have power over us, but what is given them from above, and all that which comes to pass against us is not worthy to be compared with the Crown of Glory, and that Inheritance of which we have already received the earnest, and sealed with the spirit of Promise, and the Fathers Name is written upon us; therefore in all things unto which he hath called you, be faithful and obedient, that his Work may be accomplished. And all ye Children and Babes in Christ, that are begotten of God, and are thirsting and seeking after him in Truth and Righteousness, he
whom ye seek is coming to raign amongst you, and his Dominion shall be set up and enlarged, and the desire of your Hearts shall be fulfilled; Righteousness and Truth shall meet in one, and Judgment and Mercy shall be exalted. Wait upon the Lord, and feel his Power and his Presence continually, that you may grow as Plants of Righteousness, and may partake of the Heir-ship with Christ, being crucified to the World, and become dead to all its Wayes, and no more you to live, but Christ to live in you; through the Light which he hath lightned you withall, hath he given you an entrance into the Inheritance of the Fa∣ther: And as you walk in the Light, you grow into Fellowship with the Father, and with the Son. Abiding in the Son you cannot sin; for he keeps you from the wicked One, and he hath no power over you that abide in Christ, who is the Power of God, which is the Salvation of all that believe, and a Condemnation of all that believe not: therefore all you that are convinced everywhere, hearken to the Voice of the Lord, that your Souls may live: and mind the Power of God, and the workings thereof in your Hearts, which conquereth Hell and Death, and subdueth all the Powers and Wayes thereof: and every one be obe∣dient to the Lord, as Children of one Father, that of his fulness you may receive, and be filled therewith: and meet together in every Place; and as the Day approacheth exhort one another, that you may grow up in Unity as Members of one Head: and mind always the Testimony of Truth its self, and walk therein, and you cannot stumble: Have not respect to Persons, but to the Truth only; for Persons may change, but the Truth abides for ever: So let not an evil Eye look at Evil, when it comes to pass, to take occasion thereby against the Truth; for then you stumble and fall: but I say again, have respect only to the pure Testimony of Truth which is sure, and cannot err nor alter, though man may change and err; and that is the Testimony which is held forth for Salvation, evon the Testimony of God, with whom there is no shaddow of turning: Therefore all take heed unto your selves, that you give not, nor receive any offence against the Lord, and against your own souls; but know the Seed of God, in which stands the Election, where the Covenant of God is sure, and unalterable: and a Birth you must all know to be brought forth in you, which must inherit, and that is it which is born of the Spirit, which doth obtain the Promise; it is not that birth which is of the Flesh, which works by willing, and running, and thinking; that obtains not the Promise of God, neither is Salvation shewed unto it, but in Pati∣ence, and in Long-suffering is the Victory received, over all the Powers of Darkness, which make war against the Kingdom of God: So all Friends, dwell in that which lets you see before the World was, and that stops and limits all Strife in the mind, and gives you victory over it: and none must glory in the Flesh, for that glory must be confounded; but let him that glories, glory in the Lord, in the Spirit, and not in the Flesh: And take heed that none of you abuse your liberty, which is in Christ Jesus, neither turn it into fleshly Bondage, and thereby the Just comes to suffer, and the fleshly part comes to rule above the Seed of
God; but dwell in the Cross which suppresseth every high Thought, and whatsoever is against God, in the first motion; and thereby you will be preserved from the Enemy, which watcheth for Evil against you, and seeks occasion against the Way of the Lord, but mind that which keeps you pure; for it is the pure in Heart, that sees God, and it is him that is of clean Hands, and of a pure Heart, that inherits God's holy Mountain: And as concerning all your Afflictions, and Sufferings, and Tryals, and Persecutions; and whatsoever is laid upon you by the Lord, or by Men; I say, bear all things patiently, and endure all things in Long-suffering; these things are but for a moment, and they are not worthy to be compared with the Price of God's Inheritance; and if you dwell in the Counsel of the Lord, all these things will be turn∣ed unto your good; in all Tryals and Sufferings, the Lord's Arm will be revealed, and these things must come to pass, that Truth may ap∣pear in its beauty, in Victory over all that which doth oppose it, and vengance is the Lord's, and he will repay; for he doth enquire after our Blood, though no man lay it to heart, or consider the cause, or unjust Sufferings of the Innocent, who are become a Prey to the Un∣godly, and unjust Men, till God arise to plead our Cause: And all Afflictions and Sufferings are but for to try, and prove; they are not to confound or destroy the Lord's People, and therefore in patience they must be born, and the Life of God felt, which gives Dominion over all these things: And receiving all things as from the Hand of the Lord, then in all things your Peace will remain, and God's Testi∣mony will witness Peace and acceptance with God. And of all Injustice, and Abuses and Cruelty acted upon you by any, at any time, keep account of it, and draw it up in short and plain words, the occasion and manner of it, and at every Quarter Sessions, let a true Declaration of all unjust Sufferings be presented in prudency and singleness of heart to the Justices, or Grand-Jury, by such as are wise and faithful; and appeal to the Witness of God in them in such Causes, that that of God in all Men may witness for us. Let this be done, as cause is seen, at every Sessions, in the Wisdom and Authority of God, that in all things Justice and true Judgment may be sought af∣ter, and in Patience waited for, till the Lord alone, our King, and Judge, and Law-giver, comes to reign over all his Enemies; when all that now suffer for him, shall reign with him. A Servant to the Churches of Christ, E. B.
To the Elect and Chosen Seed of God in London. 1657 TO the Elect and Chosen Seed of God most dear and precious, who are re∣deemed to God, and joyned in Covenant with him, and have tasted, and felt, and heard of the Love and Peace of the Father; and to all the Faithfull and Called of God, who are Partakers of the Power and Presence of an Endless Life; in particular unto you the Flock of God in and about London, who fear the Lord, and wait upon him, and over whom he is the chief Shepherd. The Salutation in the Father's Love, by me a Brother and Companion unto all the Children of Si∣on, and chiefly unto you a Friend in Heart; and nothing more desiring for you, then your encrease in God, and that Grace, Peace, Love and Fellowship from the infinite Father of Heaven and Earth may be largely encreased, and aboun∣dantly multiplied amongst you, and in all your hearts, that you may shine forth in the Beauty of the Lord, and the Garment of Righteousness, and Truth may be spread over you all; and that the Spirit of Holiness may rest upon you, that the fruit thereof may greatly abound in you, and spring forth from you, whereby the Father, who hath begotten you, may be glorified through the Nation, and among his Saints through the World; and my Soul wisheth, that the Fear of the Lord be amongst you, and his terror upon all your Enemies, Amen. DEarly Beloved, and much desired after in the Lord, the Spirit of the Father in upon me, to put you in remembrance of these things of the greatest price, which belong unto your Peace, which have been hid from you in the time of Darkness, but now are re∣veal'd unto you, whereof your Eyes have seen, your Ears have heard, your Hands have handled, and your Hearts have perceived; and now be not unmindful thereof, but take heed unto the precious Treasure of Life Eternal, which the Father hath given unto you; I mean, the Knowledge of himself, who is manifest to dwell in you, and to walk in you, and to lead you, and to guide in all his Wayes of Peace and Truth; and this is that Treasure more desirable, and of greater price then the Glory of the whole Earth; yea, it is Peace to the soul, and Gladness to the heart, and Refreshment to the life, to feel and witness the Teaching of the Spirit of the Father, leading into all Truth, and preserving out of all Transgression. Wherefore I beseech you all, let this be your whole desire, and the full practice in your life; and then shall the Countenance of the Lord shine upon you, and his Face shall make you glad, if in all things you look unto him for Counsel, and wait upon the teaching of his Spirit, which dwelleth in you, which the Father hath given unto you, because you are his Children; and this he requireth from you, that his own Spirit in you, which hath begotten you, may be the root and moving cause of all your works and words, and herein will you receive acceptance with him, and Peace from him, and righteousness in him, and everlasting joy by him continually; and and this is the Inheritance unto which you were begotten Heirs to
possess for ever: wherefore let your love, unity and felloship be in the Spirit, and let your Knowledge, Judgment, Meeting, and Waiting be in the Spirit, and let your ministring and receiving be in the Power of God, and in the Spirit, and so shall you never suffer loss nor condemnation; but all your works shall abide the Fire, and shall not be consumed when the tryal of all things come, and the Foundation of every work is discovered: And I say again, if the Spirit of Life, even the Spirit which quickens to God, the second Adam, who is the quicking Spi∣rit be your Guide, your Leader and Teacher in all things, then you shall have perfect Peace with God, and your Fellowship will be encrea∣sed, and his Presence shall go before you, and his Righteousness shall be your Justification, and Desence, and his Covenant of Life and Peace shall be confirm'd unto you; and there shall be no more going forth, but the Tabernacle of God shall remain with you alwayes, and his Habitation shall be in you forever, and the Promise of the Father shall be sealed unto you, and his Mark, and express Image written in your Fore-heads; and that quickning shall live in you, and not you unto your selves, and hereby shall all know that he is your God, who liveth in you in Power and Dominion, and that you are his People who liveth unto him in Truth and Righteousness; and this is the Covenant and the Promise to be waited for by you all, that you may be married to the Lord in Righteousness and Loving-kindness, and your Maker may be your Husband, and you subjected under his Power, to rule over you, and to govern you in the Way of Peace. And now, dearly Beloved, mind that Word of God which hath be∣gotten you from Death to Life, and to be Heirs of his Inheritance of Life; and feel the Word which is quick and powerfull dwell in your hearts, alwayes dividing in you betwixt the precious and the vile, and as a Hammer, and a Fire, alwayes beating down, and burning up that ground and fruit which is in the disobedience, from which the cause of Condemnation doth spring, and so shall you be saved from every ap∣pearance of evil, & shall not be overcome thereby, nor led captive at the will of the Enemy, but shall be saved from Sin, and the Wages thereof, and no condemnation shall be unto you, if your hearts be kept clean, and undefiled, by the Word of God which is pure, and sanctifieth, and is but one in all his Children, and it begetteth unto one Life, and to be of one Mind and Soul, and by it only dwelling in the Heart, is the encrease of God received, though by the ministring of it, one may Plant, and another may Water, yet it is my Father that gives the en∣crease, who is greater then all, unto whom the Ends of the Earth must look for Salvation, and unto him must you all look for to pertake of en∣crease, of his hidden Treasure daily, that you may be refreshed as the Heritage which he hath chosen, and may grow therein, as Plants planted by his own right Hand, growing from strength to strength in him, and renewing your strength in him, and may not fain, nor be weary. And forasmuch, as mighty hath been the Power and Presence of the Lord amongst you, and his Love great unto you, and caused his voice to be heard, when you were Dead to raise you unto Life, and
many of you have had the taste and feeling thereof, who have seen the Way of Life before your face, that you should walk therein, and live: I do warn you all in the Name, and by the Spirit of the Lord, there∣in to continue unto the end, having your Faith established in the Power of God, and your building standing on that true Foundation which can never be moved nor shaken; but that perfect victory over Death, and the Grave, and the powers of Darkness may be trodden down through the obedience of the Cross, whereby victory is obtain∣ed over all the World, and the Affections and Lusts thereof condem∣ned; but such as goeth from the Cross, perceiveth not the Power of God, neither can overcome, but are overcome of the Enemy, and shipwrack is made of Faith, Truth, and a good Conscience, and the latter end of such is worse then their beginning; for the Lord is disho∣noured, and their condemnation will be great. Wherefore, my Friends be watchfull, and be armed with the strength of Christ Jesus, and feel his strength in you to resist the wick∣ed One, that he may not touch you, to betray you of your Life and Peace, and bring you into condemnation; for I am not ignorant of the many temptations which are near unto you in that place: Where∣fore I say again, feel the Strength and Arm of God reaching to you, by which you may do all things; and dwell in his Life and Power, and that ye may overcome by the Word of God, and by the Testi∣mony of Jesus, and then will your Peace be encreased, and your Fel∣lowship with God; and Angels shall minister unto you, as you over∣come the Enemy, which would subvert your minds from the obedience to the Truth, and then your rest in God will be sweet unto you, as you dwell where nothing can make afraid, Sin and Transgression being re∣moved far from you, not having a place in you, but the Life reigning which Satan hath nothing in; and this is the freedom of the Sons of God, who are redeemed unto him, to live in him, who being dead to sin, cannot live any longer therein; but are washed and separated from all the works of Death; Death having lost his sting, it cannot hurt nor wound you; and the Grave having lost its victory, it cannot overcome you who do witness this; for Transgression is hid, and Iniquity is put under, and Life it self reigns through Righteousness over all; and here the Seed is brought forth, in which there is no Iniquity seen, nor Transgression charged against it, for it sins not; but rules over the Sinner, and ful∣fils the righteous Law of God, and doth his Will in all things; and for this you must all wait to feel God's Promise perfectly fulfill'd in you, and sealed unto you by the Eternal Spirit. And again, Friends, feel the Life of God in your own particulars, even the Bread of Life which comes down from Heaven, which nou∣risheth the Birth which is immortal unto eternal Life, never to taste of death, and therein have Fellowship in the Covenant of Life, and be at peace with God, and one with another; for that is blessed of the Lord, where Brethren dwell in unity, shewing love, kindness and sub∣jection one to another, being of one spirit, and like-minded, serving one another in love, not exalting your selves, nor accounting your
selves above another, for that must come down with shame; but every one approve your selves to God in all things, and be known to him, and not unto the World; but let his Spirit witness for you, and approve you, and not man; and the work of the Spirit springing through you let be the Evidence unto all people, that you are by Grace what you are; and this is well-pleasing unto God, that his Spirit witnesseth for you, and that Love, Unity and Humility be amongst you; and none think of themselves above what the Spirit of the Lord witnesseth, and worketh in them, and this a sweet savour will be amongst you to the Lord, you being kept in his Wisdom and Counsel, in good order, and subject unto him, walking as Examples of Righteousness, to edifie one another, and to be a strength one to another; and in all your Conversations to be manifest to God's Witness in all people; and thus shall you have praise of God, and be approved of him, and he will justifie you in the sight of all your Enemies: I write this unto the Faithfull who do not minister Self, but Self your Servant for Jesus sake. And as concerning disorderly spirits, who are not subject to the Wisdom of God, nor to the Law or Christ, such have no part with us, but are judged with the Life of God, and cast out; and such as are not faithfull in the Lord's Treasure, and hear the Word, but do it not, having the words, without power, and hold the Truth in unrighteous, such have no reward in God, but their iniquity stands uncovered, and their transgression is manifest, and not hid; for Death reigns through disobedience, and they are not circumcised in heart, but live in the flesh and their portion is of this World, and the Inheritance of Life is not their Heirship; for the birth which should inherit is not brought forth, but an untimely birth, which receiveth not the Possession of Life. But, Friends, dwell in the dominion over such, and in peace abov them, and be not troubled, but believe in the Truth, and bear all things patiently, and be not offended in Christ, though hitherto you have seen occasion of stumbling, yet the Lord will remove them, and the Path of Life hath been plain before you; for to such as walk in the Light, there is no occasion of stumbling, but Offences are seen through, and beyond, and the ground thereof judged; and therefore be diligent in the Work of God; that is his Work which his Spirit calleth you unto, and that is his Worship which his Spirit leads you in, which exerciseth your hearts al∣ways to God; and keep your Meetings in the dread of the Lord over all your Enemies, that the Weak may be strengthned, and the Lambs sed; and watch over one another, as the Family of God, among whom his dwelling is who is the good Shepherd, that keeps his Flook, and feed∣eth them into eternal Life, whose Presence and Arm be amongst you for evermore: Feel Christ the Power and Wisdom of God to reign in you, and govern you all.

TO 1658 harles Fleetwood, Steward; Robert Hatton, Recorder; Sackford Gunstone, Henry VVilcock, Bailiffs: Being Judges in the Court of Kingstone upon Thames. he state of the Controversie laid before you, depending in your Court, between Richard Mayo, Plantiff, and Edward Burrough, Defendant. FRIENDS, THE Innocency and Truth of my Cause doth lift up its Head unto all People, and stands justified in the sight of God, and all just Men; and in Justice and Righteousness it cannot be con∣emned, or judged guilty by any man: And it is upon me yet once ore, to state it before you, that you, and all men may see the counte∣ance and favour thereof, for it dares shew its Face unto you, and all eople, though much already hath been written and spoken about it, which you have not taken notice of (as you ought to have done) but et many are informed in the truth of the matter, and what hath been poken is not in vain, though my just Cause lies always at the Stake, and hardly thought upon by you, and vilified, and evil spoken of before you y my Adversary, who alwayes seeks false Judgment against me, to stifie himself in his iniquity, and to condemn the Guiltless: But the Lord knows, and just Men know, and the Witness of God in your Consciences may shew you, That I have not wronged Richard Mayo, or spoken of him any thing, saving the truth, and because thereof; nd without any other Cause, am I thus prosecuted by him, in his leading before you, and begging of you for false Judgment; which, if e should obtain it, and you should give it, yet should I be clear in the ight of the Lord, though by you I may deeply suffer: And your own nrighteous Judgment (if it proceed from you) will return one day upon your own heads, and the weight of your own Iniquity shall the Lord ay upon your own Consciences, in the Day when he judges the secrets of all Hearts: And to God I have appealed in this thing, who justifi∣eth me, because of Truth; and then who shall condemn me, while Truth is on my side, and I not convinced to the contrary? Therefore in the Fear of the Lord God, I say unto you, Take heed what you do in this Matter; but deal impartially in the sight of the Lord, in the Examination thereof; and try, whether I have spoken the Truth, or whether I have spoken Falsly; and hearken to my PLEA, which I have often asserted before you, and do yet
once more lay before your view; and I do appeal to the Light of your Consciences, and let that justifie me, or condemn me. And this I testifie, as my sufficient Plea, unto you (which no man hath truly answered before you) That I have spoken nothing but the Truth of Richard Mayo, my Adversary; to this I stand to be justified; and if I be condemned, it is for this; this resteth with me forever; and if I fall, I f for it (viz.) For speaking the Truth; and if I stand, I stand by it, and no man whatsoever can convince me to the contrary; and hereof am I invincible, and if you condemn me for this (to wit) For speaking the Truth, it will be upon you, and I am clear. And this is my only Plea, which I have often, and may by the Spirit of the Lord, alwayes clearly demonstrate: and I do indeed wave all the multitude of Arguments that have been, or can be made, by the Lawyers in this Business; and not by words of man's wisdom, but by Truth must I be justified. And I do here again return to my first manner of proceeding, and stand to the naked simplicity of Truth, and I have no other defence to shelter under, neither do I chuse any, nor no other Weapon to resist my Enemy with, but the Word of the Lord, which is Truth; and if Truth will not justifie me, I will not be justified; and if it will conde me, my Mouth shall be stopped; for, by the Truth I stand, and if I fall, fall for it in this matter: and therefore you my Judges, patiently hear few words again, as to the beginning of the matter betwixt Richard Mayo and me, which is thus, He sent for me by a Messenger to come to him, an being come to him, he challenged me to speak what I had against him and again under his own hand he challenged me to dispute, either in pub∣lique, or private with him; and he again bad me call him Deceiver if I durst: and upon all these four particular Invitations and Challenges, and also knowing him to be guilty, as I am still able to prove, I did say to him, That he held forth Damnable Doctrine and Error, and that he was a De∣ceiver; and this was the beginning of the Controversie: Whereby I would have you to take notice, how Unrighteously he hath dealt with me; first to invite me, and challenge me several times; and then for speaking the Truth of him (which I am able to prove) to Arrest me, Imprison me, and thus to prosecute me: Is not this Unchristian-like, and not like a Minister of Christ? And this I proved in your Court, His challenging of me: And also I have manifested divers particular Say∣ing of his, which do appear to all sober men to be damnable Doctrine, and Error. And for the manifesting of my innocent Cause further, and that you may know, that you ought not to condemn me (neither c you with a safe and good Conscience in the sight of God) and to lay the Truth as plainly as I can before you; therefore I do here insert the particulars to you again, which I proved in the open Court against Richard Mayo, which I do say is damnable Doctrine and Error, all, or some of them at least. 1. That Paul, as a Minister of Christ, exhorted Saints (the Corinthi∣ans) to follow and obey a Light, which was not Christ, nor the Light of the Gospel.
2. He did exhort the people of Kingstone, as a Minister of Christ, in his Preaching to them, To follow and obey a Light, which (said he) is not Christ, nor the Light of the Gospel. 3. He said, That a man may be a Righteous Man, and not a Godly Man, with∣out distinction. 4. Also at another time before that, Richard Mayo affirmed, That the Light of Christ, which every man is lightened withal, John 1. 9. is Carnal, and Darkness. 5. He did affirm under his own hand, That Christ was not the Word that David walked by. 6. He affirmed, That the Devil is the Power of God. 7. He affirmed, That the Gospel is not the Power of God, no more then a Rose Cake is; which he laid his hand on in the Window, at that present of his so saying. 8. He affirmed, If one man murder another, he did it by the Power of God. Now hereby it may appear to you (if you do not wilfully harden your selves against the Truth, and the Righteousness of my Cause) that I have done Richard Mayo no Wrong, only I have spoken the truth of him: I said, He held forth damnable Doctrine and Error; which saying is truth, and I had a good Cause to speak it; for he invited and challenged me divers times to speak it: and then, when this is considered by you, let your Consciences judge what wrong I have done him; seeing it doth appear, I have spoken the truth of him, and had good Reason so to do. Ye my Judges, at whose Door my Cause (which is Innocent) lies despised, and ready to be condemned, come but to plainness and honesty in your own hearts, and be not passionate towards me; but use Meekness, and let the Sincerity of your hearts tell me, whether I have lyed, or spoken truth: But if you do the worst that can be done against me, I must, and have already committed my Cause to God, and I doubt not but he will avenge my Cause, and recompence my Adversaries in his Season. Now again consider, If Richard Mayo did make his Invitations to me, on purpose to ensnare me (as it may be justly supposed that he did) that he might have occasion to execute his Malice upon me; then you ought not to give Judgment against me, and to be his Executi∣oners; for, if he hath laid his Plot to ensnare me, how can you justly give him power over me? And he hath no power over me, except you give it him by unjust Judgment; and you can but give him power over my Body; for my Spirit is at Liberty, and in dominion over you and him; because I have the Truth on my side, and it is hard for you to strive against that; for it cannot be buried; but the Truth of my Cause will al∣wayes live to vex its Opposers. But and if his Challenges to me were not to insnare me, but for Information (supposing himself to have been clear from all damnable Doctrine and Error) then he had done well to have owned my words as a Reproof, and to have repented, and not to have held forth any more such Doctrine: And you ought not, for my reproving him, to condemn me; for, r eproving any man for Evil ought not to be
condemned; Good Men will not do it, neither would he (were he not an ungodly man) prosecute me thus violently, and thus continually beg your Judgment of 100 l. against me, for reproving of him, and decla∣ring against his false doctrine, which he delivers to the people; when as himself invited me to speak to him: And the Lord knows, the Souls of people are so dear to me, that where I hear false doctrine held forth, which would destroy the innocent Souls, I cannot but reprove it, lest people receive false Dostrine for true, to the Destruction of their own Souls; and upon that account I spoke in this Cause. Wherefore take you into Consideration, what Richard Mayo's End was in inviting me; and do not you fulfil his evil purpose, which I believe, if he had pow∣er over me, would execute his farthest Cruelty upon me; I have good Reason to believe it; for many cruel threatning words have proceeded from him already against me; but the Lord can deliver me from them all; but if he will not, He will give me Patience to bear it, whatsoever is suffer'd to come to me. But if any shall doubt, and cannot receive these things, and believe, that these particulars are damnable Doctrine and Error, as they are laid down in themselves; and if what is spoken already be not sufficient, I may upon any just Opportunity, prove unto you, and unto all men, in the sight of my Enemies, That these particulars held forth by Richard Mayo, and al∣ledged by me before you, are damnable Doctrine and Error: And if I could be convinced to the contrary by him, or any man, in sober Arguments, according to the Scriptures, and if he shall be able to prove that these things are true, and found and saving Doctrines, then may I confess, That I have wronged him, which never can be done: Therefore can I never confess (without lying against my Conscience) that I have wronged him; but God justifies me, and just Men, and my own Conscience excuses me from all wrong in this matter; and here, or hereafter, shall you and he know it also, that I am without Offence to him in this Cause. And if I suffer, be it upon you that are my Judges, and the Guilt of my Sufferings will be upon you one day. For, for the Truth's sake am I not afraid nor ashamed to suffer whatsoever you lay upon me. And whereas it is chiefly pleaded by my Adversary, and his Council, That he is damnified, and much endangered, by the speaking of my words: And because I said, He held forth damnable Doctrine; There∣fore (say they) he is in danger to lose his Place, and so He, and his Wife, and Family cannot tell how to live, &c. These things they plead, and upon this account beg Judgment against me, because he is, or may be in dan∣ger to be damnified. To this I reply, and Friends, I would have you to consider, He hath not yet proved to you the Dammage of the value of Two Pence, nor is he in any outward Estate worse, by loss of any thing outwardly, by any thing that I have spoken; and it is unjust to condemn me in an 100 l. upon supposed Danger and Dammage, which may come, while as he hath sustained none at present. And further I say unto you, I have had no Intentions of Evil against him, nor Purpose in my
heart, to endanger or damnifie him in any outward thing, God is my Witness; but that nakedly and simply I spoke the Truth of him: And if speaking the Truth to him doth endanger him, and damnifie him, according as they plead, then is he a bad man, and an evil person, and not well worthy of your taking part with him, if you be just Men (as yet I kw nothing to the contrary) nor worthy of giving your Judg∣ment against me for him: If the speaking Truth to him can so endan∣ger him, then consider you what a man he is; for speaking of the Truth can never hurt an honest Man, nor damnifie a good Man; for honest Men rejoyce in the Truth, and the speaking of it is an Honour to them: But the speaking the truth may indeed damnifie a bad Per∣son, as to discover his Wickedness, and to prevent him of more Wickedness, which he may intend; but speaking the truth cannot damnifie a good Man. And if it be so, that Richard Mayo (because of his badness) be damnified by my speaking the Truth to him; must I therefore be condemned for speaking Truth, or ought you to do it? Let that of God in you answer: Will you justifie his false doctrines, and condemn me for reproving him? Did ever any good Men, or just Iudges of old, condemn any man for speaking the Truth? Or will you shame your selves in the sight of Wise-men, by acting contrary to a good Con∣science? Which, if you do condemn me for speaking the truth, I do, and must tell you (while I live) That your Iudgment is Unjust, and you act contrary to a good Conscience, and are Unrighteous Iudges; and that you commit the great Abomination, in justifying the Wicked, and condemning the Righteous. And is it not a Shame to him that professeth himself to be a Minister of Christ, to plead, The Loss of his Livelihood, and of his Calling, and the Poverty of his Wife and Family, &c. because of my speaking the Truth to him? Never any of Christ's Ministers pleaded any such thing: Were not they reproached, and much spoken against? And they were called De∣ceivers, and Seditious Men, and such like: And did they proceed on this manner, as he hath done against me? Nay; They forgave their Enemies And if I had spoken falsly of him (as I have not) he ought not to have done thus, if he had been a Minister of Christ, as he profes∣seth: And doth his Livelihood, and his Place, and his Maintenance of him∣self and his Family, depend upon my forbearing to speak the Truth? For, he pleads, That he is damnified and endangered in all these, by what I have spoken. And I still testifie, and all good Men know, that I have given no Of∣fence, saving then speaking the Truth: And rather then he shall be damnified by my speaking the truth of him, will you unjustly damni∣fie me for speaking the truth? Is this the Way of JUSTICE, to condemn the Truth that I have spoken, to save the Guilty from supposed Danger? Consider of this, and save your selves from Unjust Iudgment, lest the Lord justly judge you, and condemn you. This I shew in short, and much more I might, as to the Unjustness of the Action prosecuted against me; and now I come to shew something
of the unjust Proceedings in this matter against me, in the time of my Tryals and other times; and some part thereof I here lay before you, that you, and all may see I have had as unjust Proceedings against me in the matter, as an unjust Action at first brought upon me. At my first appearance, in my first Answer, I demurred to the juris∣diction of your Court; and shewed, That your Court and Judicatory being Temporal, you could not (in that Court) take Cognizance of this Cause, being of a Spiritual Dependancy, and ought only to be try'd in spiritual Jurisdiction, by spiritual Judges (if there were any such) and shewed out of the Laws of England reasonably, that your Court had no power to try this matter: But one of the Bailiffs, Iohn Forth, said (which should have been my equal Judge) They would over∣rule that, and they would try the matter; without shewing any just Reason out of the Laws, against my Argument grounded upon the Laws; and they did over-rule me in that. And the Court-day before the Tryal, when the Jury-men were to be chosen and nominated, I told them, That the Jury-men should be such as had the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Ghost in them, or else they could not try the Matter, because it was Doctrine that was to be try'd, which none could try, but by the Spirit of God; neither could I cast my self into the Determination of any in this Cause, but such. And the Bailiffs, Obadiah Wicks, and Iohn Forth, answered, If they were men that could take the Evidence, that I spoke my words against Richard Mayo, they were sufficient to try the Matter: Whereby it doth ap∣pear, that they had unjustly determined in themselves, not to try the Doctrines, but to have a Verdict against me however. Again, Some that were called to be of the Jury were heard to say, before they saw me, or ever heard the Matter; If I came into their hands, they knew well enough what to do with me: Hereby it doth appear they were not equal men, but malicious, and prejudiced against me. And moreover, In the very time of the Tryal, some of the Jury at the Bar, said, They would not believe any thing, or take any Witness for Testimony, which any of these on my part, that were called Quakers, spoke: And this was also the Witness of their malicious and envi∣ous spirits against me, who were rather as a Party against me, then my Equals: And were not these unjust men for the Tryal of such a Matter? And moreover, When all his Witnesses could not say enough to give colour for a Verdict against me, one of the Bailiffs, Iohn Forth by name, who was one of the Judges upon the Bench, proffered to come down off the Bench, and swear, as a Witness against me; and when some spake against that, he sent for a man into the Court, out of the Town, Iames Levite by name, and whispered with him upon the Bench, and told him what he should swear; and he went to the Bar, and took his Oath against me, That I followed Richard Mayo with Reviling Lan∣guage, in three several Rooms, in Bailiff Gunstone's House: Which I do testifie was a false Oath before the Lord, and all men; and many
know that I speak the Truth, and that that man took a false Oath, who was sent for into the Court, and told by one of the Judges what he should swear. I suppose Bayliff Gunston himself knows, that this was a false Wit∣ness; and are not these unjust Proceedings? I appeal to your Consci∣ences, and upon such proceedings as these, was a Verdict gained against me, by much ado, in above three hours time; and the Foreman of the Jury himself said, he would not have brought a Verdict against me, but onely for the man's Oath, Iames Levite, which as I have said, swore falsly, being sent for, and told by another man what he should say. Again, when the Fore-man of the Iury said, they could not try the Cause, and desired it might be referred, the said Bayliff Forth on the Bench cryed no, and told Richard Mayo; he should have a Verdict first, and ought my Judge thus to have spoken? No, he appeared to be rather a Party against me, then my equal Judge; and to all sober men, these Proceedings may appear to be unjust: And I hope some of you will make more conscience of your doings, then to pass Judgment upon such an Unrighteous Verdict: And moreover, the Iury did not try the Cause, which onely ought to have been tryed, which was, whether I had spoken truely, or falsly of Richard Mayo, that is to say: they ought to have tryed, (and that was the thing in controversie between us) whether these parti∣culars alledged by me against Richard Mayo were true, and sound Doctrine, or damnable Doctrine and Errors; for if the Particulars mentioned be true, and sound Doctrine, which were affirmed by Richard Mayo, then I have wronged him, and I must confess it, and assent to your Judgment: but if the Particulars be false Doctrine and Error, then I have done him no wrong; for I have spoken nothing but the truth, and for that; how can you condemn me? And this was the Cause to be tryed, which the Jury themselves confessed they did not try; and therefore the Matter is not yet tryed in truth, neither have I had a legal Tryal before you; and then how can you give Judgment against me, being the Action it self is so unequal, and the Proceedings so unjust also, and the Matter yet not fully tryed? Do but consider of these things in the coolness of your spirits, and let not me receive worse dealing from you, because I am a Stranger, neither because I am a Quaker so called; but deal justly, and truely, for I desire nothing else of you, but true Judgment, for that will justifie me, and clear me: and respect not Persons, but have re∣spect to the Law of God, which commandeth you to hear, and judge the Cause of the Poor, and the Strangers, without respect of Persons; and if you give regard to the Law of God in this Matter, you cannot give Judgment upon this Verdict, which is unjustly brought in, by partial men, as is manifest, and you must either wholly arrest Iudgment, or at least you must bring it to a new Tryal, else you do me much wrong and injustice, and all good men will so judge of it: And further, divers sufficient reasons hath been shewed by men of knowledge in the Law; first against this Action, and also against the Proceedings herein, which might be reasons to you not to go on in Judgment against me, but to clear me;
and even in your own way, (as I may say) you have been dealt with, and you have been shewed my Innocency; so that if your Hearts be not hardened, you cannot go any further against me, but go contrary to the truth of my cause, and contrary to your own Law also: and though it was the dear love, and respect of Friends to the Truth, in freeness of their love to me, more then any desire of mine, or my knowledge; I do own their love, and justifie it; yet much that hath been spoken in forms and tricks of Law, and puntillio's of Law I do wave, and let it pass, and keep always to the naked truth of the Matter, as before laid down: And therefore if any Jury shall upon their Oaths justifie, Richard Mayo's Doctrines to be true and sound Doctrine; and if you your selves, upon your Oathes, dare give Iudgment, that Richard Mayo's Doctrine is not damnable Doctrine, and Errors; then I must lie pati∣ently under your Judgment, and under the breach of such Jury-mens Oaths, and of your own Oaths also: and therefore I demand of you accor∣ding to right and justice let me be cleared, otherwise let me first have a fair Tryal before I be condemned, which yet I have not had, because the Matter was perverted from that, whether I had spoken the truth, upon which the true Issue dependeth, and upon no other thing; Whether I spoke malitiously, was a straining of the Cause to a wrong head, and per∣verting it from its proper Issue, and hereby was the just Cause of the Innocent clouded over, and rejected, and vilified, and even betrayed into another meaning, more then it ought to have been; but it can shew its face above all this, and Truth cannot be daunted, though it may be vailed, and lie hid for a season; and though I be condemned by the Prejudiced and unfaithful Jury for speaking malitiously, yet the Lord bears me witness to the contrary, that I have no malice in me against any man, and I love your Souls better, then that you should endanger them to destruction, and to everlasting burning, by giving Iudgment upon your Oaths against me upon this Verdict, in this Cause which is thus unjust and unequal in it self, and in its Proceeding also; for if the Jury had tryed, whether I had spoken the truth, or whether I belyed Richard Mayo, then it would easily have been known, whether I spoke maliciously; for if I belyed him, and if his Doctrine be true, and sound, and not Error, then may it be easily judged, that I spoke maliciously, because I spoke not the truth; but if his Doctrines alleadged by me, be not true and sound Doctrine, but damnable Doctrine and Error, then I have not belyed him; but spoken the truth in love, and not maliciously; for Truth and Malice goes not together; and till this be tryed, to wit, whether I have spoken truly or falsly, who shall be able upon their Oathes (without forswearing themselves) to give it upon their Oathes, that I spoke maliciously? nay, how shall any men lawfully swear, that one speaks malitiously? it is a hard cause to swear, that any man speaks in malice; for who enters into the heart of another man, to know the thoughts, save God, and his Spirit. And this I say at least, and safely too, that that Jury, which gave into the Court upon their Oaths, that I spoke my words maliciously
against Richard Mayo, have greatly endangered the forswearing them∣selves, and the breach of their own Oaths; and some of them know before this day, that they did transgress therein against God, whom God suddenly after cut off with Judgment, and took off the Earth by death; and though they that are yet living may be insensible of their own wickedness; yet let all good men fear to dye out of this Body with that burden upon their Consciences, as some have, and others of them may have, in this particular, for breach of Oaths; and though they have given it to you upon their Oaths, that I spoke maliciously, yet wo will be unto you, if you shall upon your Oaths justifie, they have done well, and condemn me falsly upon their false Verdict, and if you do condemn me, it is upon their false Verdict, because I spoke ma∣iciously against Richard Mayo; and you cannot do that, but you for∣wear your selves, and act contrary to your trust, who are set in place to udge justly by what doth appear to your view; and cannot, nor dare not, I know, upon your Oaths say, that I have spoken falsly and ma∣liciously against Richard Mayo; but and if you do, one day you will feel that you have spoken against your own Oaths, and Consciences, and against God, and against your own Souls. And this is all that I can lay before you, as to this Particular, to warn you, that you do judge justly, and that you condemn not the innocent and just Cause of the Upright, but that you may save your selves from the anger of the Lord, who will be avenged upon all false Swearers and Unrighteous Judges, that judges not in righteousness the Cause of the Poor, and of the Stranger; and the Cause yet remains before you, to shew your selves just or Unjust, Righteous or Unrighteous Judges in this Matter. And whereas Richard Mayo, and some of your selves spake to me, to confess I have wronged him, and would have me to acknowledge that I am in a fault, and that I have spoken wrong of him; yea, it was said to me, if I had not wrong∣ed him, could I not confess that I had, to preserve my self, &c? To this I must answer; Nay, I cannot confess contrary to a good Conscience, and contrary to Truth, that I have wronged him, if my life stood upon it, as it is but my liberty at most; for God hath given me to make Conscience of my words, and to keep it void of offence towards him and all men; and to confess that which is false, to be true, would stain a good Conscience, in the sight of God and his People, and that I may not do, no, not for my own preservation, and the Lord deliver me from the Judgment of such, who would have me confess that which I am not guilty of; for that is all one to say; I am clear, when I am guilty, as to say, I am guilty, when I am clear; and I rather chuse to suffer what may be imposed upon me, then to transgress the Truth in my own Heart, and if I should say, his Doctrine were sound and true Dorine, and not Damnable and Error, I do believe the Witness in your own Consciences would rise against me, and many more would say, I then spoke falsly, then doth now; for I hardly ever heard any, no, not your own selves say, that his Doctrines alledged by me against him, are sound and true Doctrine, neither can you in good Conscience say
it; So I say, I cannot lye against my Conscience, what ever come of it; for to walk with the Lord, and to have his Peace, and not to lose his Presence, is of more worth to my Soul, that is immortal, the all the Sufferings that you can lay upon me can be dammage to my mor∣tal Body; for my life and soul you cannot touch, but therein am I free, though outwardly entangled amongst Bryars and Thorns, which wo pierce me, and seek to catch me▪ and if there be no other way for me to be preserved, but by confessing contrary to my Conscience, that I have wronged Richard Mayo, I freely give up my self to suffer, rather then to be preserved by such means; and you do evil in putting such a thing upon me, and expecting it from me, which I cannot give, b transgress the Law of God, and offend him, and my own Conscience; and if you defer the determination of the Matter, upon such hopes▪ that I may confess that I have wronged Richard Mayo, I desire, you would not defer it one moment longer, but let me be quitted of your Temp∣tation, for it is your Temptation, and not true love; for I cannot con∣fess any such thing, though I do acknowledge it hath now depended in your Court, and at your door, near two years, and I should be glad that it were ended justly, because I am not a man given to Suits of Law, neither do I love it (though it be so that I am fallen into it) to offend any man, or be offended in that way by any, yet may I not use any unlawful means, or any indirect way to obtain an end of this busi∣ness, but the rather I am content with what the Lord suffereth to come to pass, though it be the very greatest Malice of my very devouring Ene∣mies; and because I would have Peace with all men, and have all men re∣conciled to God, and one to another, to live in love and unity one with a∣nother, upon that account I would this business were ended, and though I do not doubt my Cause, nor am faint of it, but can freely receive the determination thereof in the Court, be it for me or against me; yet I would have it ended, and have sought it in justice, and once did to my Adversary say, I could refer it to any sober men; and another Friend being with me, Oliver then Protector, or Charles Fleetwood, or Col. Pride, all these were mentioned, and to any of these, I could have re∣ferred my Cause; and though before he seemed willing, and said, That if any sober man in the Nation, that was no Quaker, would say, that his Doctrine was not sound, and that he had not wrong, &c. But when these men were mentioned, he was unfaithful to his word, and would not refer it. And also not long ago, a day and time was appointed by his own ad∣vice and consent, by a Friend of his own, to bring the Cause before Alderman Tichburn, to which I was willing, and that he with some other man might hear & determine the Matter, and the time appointed, we met at the Alderman's House, and the Alderman with some more of us waited for Mayo's coming, till near the 9th hour in the evening, and he never came, so ungaretful and unjust was he to his own Friend, to Alderman Tichburn, and to me, that we waited all for him some hours, and he came not at all, though his own Friend, by his own consent and desire
did bring that appointment about; and thus I would have you to know, that I seek peace with all men, and with him, upon just and equal means, and can refer it to honest men to hear and determine; for who are truly just towards God, cannot condemn me, nor my Cause: and likewise ye may see how unwilling my Adversary is to bring his Busi∣ness to hearing and determining by wise and discreet men, and how unfaithfull he is to his own words and desires; only he thinks he hath gotten a Verdict that will do something for him, and upon that he de∣pends, waiting also for your unjust Judgment, and because he hopes alwayes for your Judgment, which, I say, is unjust, if you condemn me in this matter: Therefore he will not bring his cause to be heard and determined by any other, because he supposes you will proceed according to that unjust Verdict, which if you do not, you offend him, and lose his unjust cause; and if you do, you offend God, and con∣demn the guiltless cause of the Just; and whatever ye do, this fol∣lows upon ye; and if you offend God and despise the cause of the In∣nocent, and the Truth; ye must bear your own burthen, in the sight of God and Just men; And if his cause were good, he need nor thus shrink and faulter, to let any man hear the matter, but his hope of your unjust Judgement nourisheth his heart in his unrighteous cause- And these things were in me to lay before you, that it may not be said by you, we know not these things, for I would have you to know them, and take notice of them, and to compare all things in equality, and to Judge according to the Law of God, and the good Law of this Land; I am not careful at present to answer or say more to you about this matter, onely this remains with me; the Lord God can deliver me from the Teeth of the wicked if he will; but if he will not, I cannot bow to the Devil; but hath given up my life, to live to him, or to suffer for him; and this Testimony remains for ever; not as I will, but as he will, who brings all things to pass, according to his pleasure. I am a Lover of your Souls, and a Sufferer for the Elect seeds sake, and a wit∣ness against the malice and injustice of evil men, E B
To all that are Moved to go into other Nations. ALl ye my Brethren and Companions in the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto whom the Word of the Lord is come, who have received power from on high, even from the Father, to bear witness of his Name, and of his Kingdom in the Earth, unto Peoples and Nations: and all ye that are Anointed with the Holy Ghost, and that are moved with the Power of the Lord to go into other Nations, to manifest the Way of Life, and the Word of the Kingdom of God, which you have handled, tasted, seen, and felt; in the Name and Power of the Lord God Almighty go ye on in faithfulness to preach the Power of God, the Gospel of Peace and Reconciliation to every Creature under Heaven, without exception of Nations or Peoples, that Sinners may be converted unto him, from the power of Satan to the Power of God, the Creator of all things, and that such as are lost from his Presence, may be brought home into the Covenant of Life, and that such as are out of the way may be turned into the Way of Peace and Salvation: In the dread and fear of the Lord God go ye on and prosper in your way; proclaim the Name of the Lord, and declare his Majesty unto all People; sound forth the Word of his Power in the Ears of all Nations; shew forth the Light of the Glori∣ous Gospel in the whole Earth; preach Christ, and hold him forth unto all the Children of Adam, who is given of the Father into all the World, and he hath lighted all Mankind (without exception) that cometh into the World, and is given for a Covenant, and for a Light unto all people, that he may be Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth, and may bring Salvation and Life Eternal unto as many as do receive him. Cry aloud, and spare not, and shew this unto all people; set the Way of Life, and the Way of Death before them; cause the Deaf to hear, and the Blind to see, and the Dead to arise; lift up your Voice, and spare not, that all Nations may know the Salvation of our God, which to us is come, and may be Witnesses of the same Power and Deliverance of which we partake; ye are sent forth as Lambs amongst Wolves, and as Birds among Fowlers Snares, be ye therefore wise and innocent: And I charge you all, dwell in the secret Counsel of God, and enquire of him in all things, that his Wisdom may defend you from the subtilty of men, and his Power and Authority thorow you may bind and chain the Uncircumcised, and reach to the Witness of God in every Creature, and to it in all people you may be made manifest that you are the Servants of the Lord; be bold and valiant to give your Testimony unto all Nations; fear not man whose Breath is in his Nostrils, nor be afraid of high looks, but lay your Sword on the Neck of the Uncircumcised; and spare not the Proud, nor pity not the Chil∣dren of Babylon; and lay the true Measure upon all People, that they may see themselves, how they are all drove from God, and in Trans∣gression
and Enmity against him, Children of Wrath, and Heirs of Destruction, upon whom the Wrath of God abideth, and are subject to the Curse every moment; and this is the state of all Man∣kind: And the Light in every one shall answer this Measure, and wit∣ness you, and your Word to be the Word of the Lord; which Light, if they love, it will bring every one to know the Power of the Crea∣tor, to reconcile them, and to bring them into Fellowship with him, and to receive his Blessings, and his Inheritance, being changed by the Power of God into his Image: But if they hate the Light, and deny the Power of God, and his Covenant, and will not have Christ, who hath lighted them, to teach them, and to rule them; but do continue Enemies in their Minds to the Lord, and will not receive your Message, then they perish forever, and you are clear; seal your Testimony against them, and the Lord shall be justified when he arises to Condemnation against them all, who cannot own this Message, and receive you in the Name of the Lord. Be bold and valiant, and spare not to shew all people this Message, and to Declare unto them in the Name of the Lord, by whom you are sent. And I warn you all, Let the Fear and the Judgments of the Lord be in your Hearts, and stand wholly in his Will; and be obedient to the moving of his Power in all things, that you may be armed against all the Swelling and Roaring of the Proud Waves of the Sea, which will beat against you; put on the whole Armour of God, that you may withstand all the powers of Darkness, and may overcome all the Temptations of the Devil: Look beyond your life and your liberty, and beyond all things of this World; and the Life of God know and feel in you, to give you Dominion over all, and with his Word and Power to reach to his Witness in all, that you may leave a Testimony behind you for him. Thick Darkness you will find covering all people, their Ears deaf, and their Eyes blind, and the Ground wholly barren and untilled, you will find overgrown with Cursed Fruit, and wild Branches, which must be cut up, and cast into the Fire; and aboundance of Idolatry, and vain Superstitions, and great Hardness of Heart you will meet with, and find all People in the Degeneration, ignorant of God, and without him in the World; and abounding in all Unrighteousness and Unbelief, worshipping their Idol godds, which will grieve your spirits; but be you Patient, and Long-suffering, and be not offended at any of these things; but Plow in Hope, and Sow in Hope, and Thresh upon the Mountains, and beat them to dust, ye Children of Sion; and bring all people to know the Fear and Judgments of the Lord in them: You are sent forth to beget People unto him, and to turn them to his Knowledge, to till the Ground, to pluck up the wild Branches, which cumber the Ground; and the tender Grape must be spared: Therefore let the Word of the Lord dwell in you; and divide the Word aright; and cry not Peace to the Wicked, neither cry Judgment to such as are of a Broken Heart; feed the Hungry with Bread, and feed the Fat with Judgment.
Be ye good Stewards of the Lord's Treasure; cover the Naked, but make bare the Harlot, and discover her Abominable Whoredoms; let all the World know how they have committed Whoredom with the great Whore, who hath sate upon Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Peoples. And proclaim unto all Nations, That the Lord God is risen for the Deliverance of his Chosen; and he will make War in Righte∣ousness against all his Enemies, and they must lick the Dust of his Feet, and bow under his Scepter: And openly declare unto all the World, That God is setting up an Everlasting Kingdom, and the Dominion thereof shall reach over all the Earth; and the Kings of the Earth must bring in their Glory to it: In the Name and Power of the Lord God go ye into all the World with this Message and Testimony, which shall be answer'd to be the Message of the Everlasting God, with the Light which he lightened every man withal; that you may bring Glory, and Honour, and Dominion unto him, who hath called you to bear witness of his Name in all the World. This I was moved of the Lord to give forth, unto all that are moved to go into other Nations; by a Companion unto all that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes, E. B.
A General Epistle to the SAINTS. To the Seed of God, Elected and Chosen of him before the World began, and now called by his Word and Power into the Kingdom of Peace and Righteousness, to be Heirs of the Inheritance of Eternal Life, that never fades away. DEarly beloved Friends, who are called and sanctified through the Grace of God that hath appeared unto you, and in you; be mindful of your Calling, and make your Election sure, that you may feel it, the Seed of God, and the Heir of Life born and brought forth in every one of you; that the Promise may be fulfilled in you, and you may sit down in the Kingdom, feeling the immortal Crown of Life, as the Reward of all your Sufferings, and Tryals, and Patience; for the Inheritance of an endless Life is the Portion of the Righteous, who have followed the Lamb through his Sufferings, and laid down their Crowns at his Feet; and now his Feet are treading down, and will tread down all mortal Crowns, and stain the glory of all Flesh, and bring it into contempt, and set up his Kingdom to have Dominion over all. And so Friends, you in whose hearts the Day-Star hath appeared, of Light and Life, feel the growth of the good Seed in your selves, which must rise in you all, over the contrary part, and over that nature which is related to the Kingdoms of this World, that must be kept down in you all, and all must be subject to the Lambs Power, and to his Dominion; every Work, Word and Motion must be brought in subjection unto him, that he, who is Light, and Life, and Righteous∣ness, and Truth, and all Vertue and Goodness may alone reign in you, and over yav and the contrary may be kept in the subjection, and the Body of Si and Death may be wholly put off, and Immortallity brought forth in you all, by the Gospel which hath been sounded forth amongst you in Power and Life, and not in the words of man's wis∣dom; and this Gospel, which we have received, and you have heard, hath wrought its effect wherefore the Lord sent it, and many are turn∣ed from darkness to Light, and from Satan's power to God; and the Lord hath gathered his Jewels, and is gathering of them; and he hath planted his Inheritance with a pleasant Plant of Righteousness and Renown; and his Arm hath wrought great deliverances in the Earth, and hath raised up the Poor, and exalted the Meek and Lowly; and he hath brought down the Mighty from his Seat; and these things hath he done in us, who hath wrought all our Works; and he hath broken the Chain of Antichrist, and will tread down that spirit more and more, till whole Babylon be sunk, as a Stone into the midst of the Sea, and till Righteousness alone sit upon the Throne, that his People may rejoyce in him for evermore, when they see their Inheritance in him, and their
Souls rest in him, where he is become the everlasting Light, and the days of Mourning ended. Now Friends, all of you keep in the Life, and Power, and Wisdom of God; dwell and walk therein, in all things, and feel the Head Christ, and have no Master but him, and in all things seek the Glory of the Lord; for they that turn to seek themselves, become as the Dross, and as withered Branches, whom the Lord will take away, and such shall not cumber his Ground: They that go from the Life, and Light, and Word within them, they go into Error, and turn aside after Vanity; and these shall never see the Countenance of the Lord, who continue not unto the end in the Faith, but make shipwrack of it, and of a good Conscience; and these become Antichrist, and Servants of Sin, and deny the Lord that bought them; having lost Sincerity, they run into a feignedness; and having lost the true Hope, they become unstaid; and such will be tossed, and change their way, and so become hardned. And therefore, Friends, I say unto you all, live in the Power of God, and feel the enjoyment of his good Presence in you Hearts, in your Families, and in your Meetings; and live in the Power of Godliness, and not in the Form without Power; for that is but Idolatry, where people are zealous in the performance and practice of Righteousness, and wants the sence of the Lord's Presence: but keep out of this, and look at the Lord, in all things stand in his Counsel, and fulfil his Will, and walk in his Spi∣rit that leads into all Truth; and feel that Kingdom, that Power and Government which is not of this World, but over, and above the king∣doms that are earthly; and in this will be your Peace, and your Comfort, and your Assurance for evermore. And Friends, the Lord hath not onely stretched forth his Arm to bring Redemption, and Salvation unto you, and his deliverance out of spiritual Sodom; but his Arm hath also wrought great deliverance for us without, and he hath appeared for us in much Loving kindness; in that he hath stopped the way of his Adversaries, whose mout were open∣ed to devour us; and doubtless it was in their wicked Hes to have cut us off, that themselves might be exalted: but the Lord eminently broke their Counsel, when they were in confederacy together, how to overcome us by Craft and Guile; and the Lord scattered them by a se∣cret Hand, and this was one great Deliverance. And again, when they were risen in Numbers, with their Hearts full of devouring Envy, they were suddenly confounded and brought to nought; and certain it is, that both these Deliverances were chiefly to us, though others have good thereby; and I cannot but mind you of them, that you may prize them, and receive them as from the Hand of the Lord, and may walk worthy of all his Mercies that are reached forth unto you from time to time; and for his Name sake, and for his Seed sake are these things done; and he will gather his Seed yet more and more, and make up the numberless number of his Chosen, that his He∣ritage may be pleasing unto him, and therein he will delight, that Righ∣teousness may sit upon the Throne, and Truth, and Justice, and Mercy flow down, that his Soul may be delighted.
And now as concerning Places among men, for the service of your Nation, as men, this I have to say; mind Gods Wisdom to guide you, and if such things be put upon you, do as you have freedom in the Lord, though these things be less then the eternal Election, which gives to see over, and feel over mens kingdoms (and in the Election doth your eter∣nal Peace and Inheritance stand in God) yet in man's kingdom Truth and Righteousness must rule, Justice and just Judgment must have place on the Throne; and this we wait for, that Righteousness within and with∣out may be exalted; for the Gospel of Light which we preach, destroys not, but brings the Nation into equal and just Government among men, and Truth brings the Nations into good order, and ye must salt the Earth. So keep over these things, in the Life that gives you Dominion, to act only for God, even as men that may glorifie him in your Bodies, and in your spirits, even in your daily Practises amongst men: and keep in the Power of the Lord, which keeps the heart pure; and feel the Word in your hearts, and then you will not be corrupted, but will be kept in singleness and uprightness to God and man; and in that will be your Crown, as men, in seeking the Glory of the Lord, and not your own. And so, Friends, have respect unto the Lord God in all things, that his Truth may guide you in all things, even as men, and therein stands true honour in this World, and in the World to come. And so keep your Meetings, and live in good order, let no strife be amongst you; for that will eat out the good, and quench your love, and deadness, and barrenness will cover you, and you will become unfruitfull to the Lord. And all you that are moved of the Lord to go abroad, to whom the Message of the Gospel is committed; I charge you all, to live in the Life of God it self, and then Life will speak through you; and keep in the Dominion over the earthly part in your selves, and over all false spirits in the World, that you may feel through the corruptible in all people, and may answer the Witness, which will slay the Evil, and wound the Wicked, and convert the Soul to God: and let your Con∣versation be holy and just, that you may answer the Witness in all. And though we have seen the fruit of our Labour, and hath our Reward with the Lord hitherto, yet it is the beginning of the Harvest; for there are Mountains to thresh, and Darkness to beat under; for the World hath been as a Wilderness, and now it must be planted with the good Seed of the Kingdom of God. Wherefore, be valiant for the Lord God, and for his Truth, and sound forth the dread of the Lord among all People: the false Church, the Whore, must have the Cup of God's Wrath given unto her, through your hands; and as she hath done unto us, so we must give unto her double. So go on in the Name and Power of God, and the Lord God Almighty be with you all. Let this be read in all your Meetings, and copied over, and sent abroad among all Friends. E. B.
Two Epistles to Friends in London; being a Testimony against de∣ceitfull Spirits, and such as profest the Truth, and turned from it, and were unfaithfull to the Lord. FOrasmuch as in these our dayes the God of Truth hath made ma∣nifest his Name and Truth in the hearts of his people, and hath gathered the minds of thousands into it, to worship him in the Spirit, and in the Truth, in which he is accepted; and of this Truth which is but one, and there is not another, are we made Witnesses, and Ministers of, and hath the Testimony in our selves, that we are of God, and are a good savour unto him, in them that believe, and in them that perish; and we have the Testimony, that he that is of God heareth us; and we know the whole World lies in wickedness, and who are in the Truth, in the Light, and in the Life, have followship one with another in Holiness and Righteousness, in that which comprehends the World, and condemns all the works thereof which are evil; and this Truth, and Worship, and Fellowship stands in Christ Jesus, the second Adam, whose Kingdom and Rule is not of this World, but from Heaven; who according to his Promise, in his Counsel, hath made known his Power, to the raising up a righteous Branch, a royal Priesthood, a peculiar Peo∣ple, zealous of his Name, to shew forth his Praise and Glory in Justness and Righteousness, in Love, Mercy, and Peace, and works of Purity, having our Conversation in Heaven; and since that Day of the Mani∣festation of this Truth of the Gospel of Peace and Salvation, which is the same now, as was in the beginning, which is in Christ Jesus the Light of the World, who is the same to day, yesterday, and forever, and changeth not: I say, since that very day hath the Lord prospered his Truth, to the renewing of many into his Image and Likeness, and to the turning of many from Darkness to Light, and from Satans power to God, by the Mouthes of his Ministers, and through great Sufferings, and Tribulations, and Afflictions, and Labours, hath the Lord honou∣red his Name and his Truth in Nations, and given it a praise among all that fear him, and hath honoured it, and exalted it in the sight of the Heathen, to the confounding of the Wise and Mighty, and to the bringing out of the Captivity of Darkness, Sin, and Death, wherein in times past all have walked, while Strangers from the Life of God; so that thousands who have received the Truth are established in it, and cannot be moved nor shaken, but are built upon the sure Foundation, their Faith standing in the Power of God, with whom the Arm and Pre∣sence of the Lord God is, defending and preserving continually, and unto such the Truth is precious, and the Way of the Lord, and his Name and Honour is dear, yea, more then life or liberty, or any other thing which passeth away; who for the Truth's sake as is it in Christ Jesus do daily give up themselves to suffering, and to reproach for well∣doing, and not for evil, and loves not life unto death, that the Lord
God and his Name and Truth may be honoured, so that in the Truth which is received, and learned of the Father, daily do we walk in all Purity and Holiness of Life, answering the Mercy and Love of the Lord, in the exercise of a good Conscience both towards God and man, in Patience, and Long suffering, and Wisdom towards all, to the putting to silence of Gainsayers, rendring love and mercy toward our Persecu∣tors, and are set in our hearts to fulfil the will of God in all things: And now whereas (that the Scriptures may be fulfilled) some may, and have denied the Truth, which once was received and loved, to the making shipwrack of Faith, and of a good Conscience, abusing the Mercy and Grace of God, which to them appeared, and follow the counsel of their own hearts, and not the Lord; having lost the feel∣ing of the Spirit of the Father, and are, and may be separated from us (in the self-separation) through an evil heart of unbelief, that it may be made manifest they are not of us, though they arise from among us, and may, by disorderly walking contrary to the Truth, cause the Truth to be evil spoken of, giving occasion thereby to the Enemies of God to blaspheme his Name and Truth in the Earth, and may be a stumbling to the weak, and an offence to the Way of the Lord before the Simple, through their Disorders and Confusions, raising the rage of the wick∣ed against the Lambs of Christ; being not led in the Wisdom of God, but in the Confusions, taking liberty to their own hearts desire, ful fil∣ling the will thereof, without the Fear of God, above the Cross of Christ, in the nature uncrucified, and speaking high Words in the presumption, and not in the Light and Power of God; and acting in the vanity of the Mind (in the pretence of Truth, and moving of the Spirit) such things as Truth, and the Children of it, who are guided with the Spirit cannot justifie; but is judged and denied, and cast out from among the Children of Light, who walk in the Truth, and do try the Spirits whether they be of God. Therefore in the Fear of the Lord God this is written to go abroad among Friends, and others, to inform and shew unto all, that the Truth, and we that are in it, and Ministers of it, do stand clear from all such who act and speak out of the Truth; and contrary to it, in the Disorder and Confusion, and not in the Fear and Counsel of God, and with the Truth such are judged and denied, and fellowship with them we have not, nor of their works do approve, though such once owned us, and were convinced of the Truth, and re∣ceived the Seed of the Kingdom into the unprofitable Ground, yet being separated from us, and gone out from the Truth, and are not subject to it, and its Government, but are unruly and disorderly, we, and the Truth do such deny, and the spirit that rules them, being not the Spirit of Christ Jesus; and such have done evil against their own Souls, and against God, and are Troublers of the Righteous Seed, and have, and do dishonour the Lord, and his Truth in the sight of the Heathen, causing the right way to be reviled, and reproached, and evil spoken of, through the offence by them, to the making sad the hearts of some, whom God hath not made sad; and even more especially in that they pretend to the Truth in their words, but in works deny it; and profess
to be in it, yet secretly condemning, and openly reviling the Ministers of Righteousness, which God hath blessed, and doth daily bless with his eternal Power, to the turning many unto God, and to the strengthning of the weak and feeble, which we with many others do witness to be the Ministers of Life and Reconciliation, and there is no other, and are esta∣blished in it, and cannot be moved by the temptations of the Devil; though the wicked one may revile for a moment, to winnow some, and to try them, and to draw the hearts and minds of others into a Snare, out from the obedience to Christ Jesus, which do become Mockers, and De∣spisers, and Subverters of the simplicity of the Gospel of Peace, and of the Ministers and Ministry thereof, which is the Power of God unto Salva∣tion, and there is no other, though some harden their hearts through un∣belief, and blind the Eye, till they be past feeling, through rebellion against the Truth, which they hold in unrighteousness, and not in the Power of God, having made the offence of the Cross to cease, yet boast∣ing in the Liberty of Christ, while they are unmortified, having run from the Judgment, and not truly came thorow it, in the finishing of Con∣demnation; and that spirit that goes out of the Cross is subverted, and seeks to subvert others from the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and that spirit is denyed fellowship with, though it have the conformity in the Hypo∣crisie. Wherefore this is the Word of the Lord God unto you that err after that spirit, Be awakened, be awakened, and remember, and re∣pent, and come to your first work, to that which condemneth you, lest the Lord by his hand of Wrath and Judgment upon you, make you an Example and of Misery and Destruction to all that shall hereafter deny the Lord, and his Truth: Hear, and consider, to the Light in you all I speak; have you another Truth then that which hath been known and declared from the beginning? is there any other way to Life, then which we have been Witnesses of? who have not handled the Word of God deceitfully amongst you, nor sought yours, but you, nor preached our selves, but Christ Jesus, and hereof we have the witness in our Consci∣ences in the Holy Ghost: and is there any other Salvation, then that which God hath manifested, which is Christ Jesus the Light of the World? Be awaked, and consider; Wherefore then do you separate your selves disoderly, and resist the Word of Life, which once begat you towards the Lord? Consider what you are doing, and whither you are walking; the End of your way is Perdition, and that is accursed which preacheth another Gospel: How do you dishonour the Lord in the sight of the Heathen, before whom you discover your Nakedness, and your Shame doth appear, having put off, and cast aside the Armour and Weapon of Truth, whereby you might have been defended: But Scorners and Fools take occasion through your disorders and confu∣sions to blaspheme the Name of the Lord, and it is through you. Be stirred up, and consider, and search your hearts, and come to the tryal, ye that vex the Lord's Soul, and grieve his Spirit, lest it cease to strive with you, and you be wholly given up to fulfil wickedness, till there be no place, nor time of repentance found; and this is a warning to you all, in the Presence of the Living God, that you may return to your
first love, to fear before the Lord, and to walk in his Truth, if there may be mercy, and to fulfil his Will, which is the Light which you are lighted withal, by Christ Jesus, who is the Lamb of God, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, the Author and Finisher of Faith, and there is not another: And know this, ye that deny him that is given, yea unto you all, he will deny you before his Father; and of all your Blood I am clear thus far, whether you resist or receive, who am the Lover of your Souls, sometimes loved of you, while you were Lovers of the Truth, and am now a Witness for the Lord, and his Truth, and against that spirit which leads you in the Rebellion against the Govern∣ment of Christ, which is Order and Peace, out of which you have erred, to the piercing of your own Souls; and though you now exalt your selves against me, and the Truth, and boast your selves, as though you reigned; yet in the day of the Lord shall the Light in you all, which is now darkned, bear witness to me, and of my faithfulness in repro∣ving you; and the Truth is for ever dear to me, and my soul de∣lights no less in it, though you rebel against it, in the heady exalted presumptuous high wilful spirit, which is not subject to the Govern∣ment, nor Authority of the Ministry of Christ; but Truth is over you all, and the Mountain of the Lord is established above you all, and all your words, and works, and boastings, and feignedness, and disorders are denied, and in them we have not fellowship, but the contrary; and do in the Authority of the Lord, even by the same Authority which hath begotten us unto God, and called us, and carried us in his Work unto this day, deny you all, in the ground and state wherein you stand, till repentance, and turning from whence you are fallen, to the Light which Christ hath lighted you withal. And all faithfull Friends, this is the Word of the Lord God to you, hear and fear, walk in the Truth which you have heard, and learned, and received of the Father, in it dwell and live, and know there is no other then that which is made manifest, which is sure to you all, and cannot deceive, nor be deceived; and be not shaken in mind, nor trou∣bled, though some deny the Lord; but let their fall be a Warning to you, to be more watchfull, to be kept to the Lord, lest you be tempt∣ed; and dwell in the Mountain of Holiness, which no Beast can touch, where is a hiding place to preserve you in the time of tryal. And I charge you all in the Presence of the Living God of Life, let your minds be setled, and hearts staid in the Truth, which is the Foundation of God, and know the Armor of God to gird you up to God, where no offence is taken against Christ, nor against the Way of Truth; but the Power of God doth remove that which would be offended, and tram∣ples upon that which gives the offence, and in this you will be preser∣ved until the day of Salvation; and beware of that spirit that boasts above the measure, and of that which makes the offence of the Cross to cease, for there hardness of heart and unbelief enters, and so ano∣ther is followed then the Light, and another joyned to then Christ Je∣sus, and there is the way to perdition; who goes from the Light within them, they deny God, and his Truth, and follow the imaginations
of the soolish heart, and runs in rashness, and in the forwardness, and that ground receives the unclean spirit in again, with seven worse, and the latter end is worse then the beginning; and this Truth doth not change which is the begotten of the Father, but is the same for ever: So in it all be faithfull and fruitfull to the Father in your Places and Cal∣lings, shewing forth in all wisdom, and pure conversation, among yo Enemies, to the putting them to silenc when they speak evil of you; and be Examples of Holiness one to another, that the Lord God may dwell amongst you, and may never have cause to with-hold his presence from you, which is Life, and Peace, and Rest for ever: And believe not every spirit, but dwell in that which discerns spirits; and if any say, Lo here, or lo there is Christ, go not after them, without you, for you have not been so taught; but know the Christ of God, the Lamb of God within you, and follow him, and obey his voice, and be establish∣ed all of you on this sure Foundation, whom God hath laid, and no man can lay any other; and if you build thereupon, and thereby you sll never suffer loss, but your Work shall abide the Fire; and in the Fa∣thers House your Bread you shall receive, and never shall hunger no Thirst, but the Life will be refreshed and increased daily, and you Lamps will alwayes shine, and you shall never be darkned, not stble; for that which stumbles is out of the Truth, and the ground stands to receive the seed of Satan, who is a Devourer of the Simplicity, and the Betrayer from the Truth. Therefore I charge you all in the Presence of the Living God, that you hold fast the Faith and Hope which you have received through the Gospel, that you may never be moved  the Grace of God, and from the Love that hath abounded in you; t may be found watching in the Door, with your Light shining, when the Bridegroom cometh; and behold. he cometh quickly, and his Rewd is with him, blessed are they that tarry for him. This is the Testimony of my Love unto all the Seed of God, who am as a De∣ceiver, and yet true; and as not known, yet well known unto the d. E. .
To such as have Backslided from the Truth. WHEN the Life in you all doth arise, it shall witness me, and answer the Word of the Lord unto Life, or unto Death. Friends, all you to whom the Word of the Lord came, and n whom the Way of Truth was made manifest, hear and consider: How t hath the Love of the Father been unto you? How many and infinite have been his Mercies from day to day, often visiting you with his Power and with his Presence; yea, when you sate in Darkness, and in the shadow of Death, his marvellous Light appear'd unto you; and when you were held cap∣tive in the covenant of Sin and Death, he stretched forth his Hand to redeem ; he loved you while you knew him not; and he brought Deliverance out of a nge Land, where you were strayed among Devourers, and scatter'd, and ge aray, as Sheep without a Shepherd; yea, when you were dead in Transgression, he said unto you, Live; and he also bound you up when no eye pitty'd you, even then when you were Enemies to him, walking in the Vaten of your own hearts, and knew not him who lives forever, who had been soug by you, but not found; in that very day he sent to visit you with his E Gospel of Peace and Truth, to gather you unto himself (I am a  and he caus'd his powerful Voice to be heard, and his Name to be  among you; and his Truth was declared in the Demonstration of the rit; and the Power of the Lord was made manifest in you, to the bringing of you from Darkness to Light, and from Death, which had reign'd over you,  know a Measure of the Life of God: Yea, the Way of Life Eternal was set  you, that you might not perish, but live; and his Witness in you all,  i but one, the Word of the Lord, reacheth unto you by the Mouthes of  ts, to the revealing of Sin, and judging it by his Righteous Law,  in your hearts, causing his Terror to be known among you, and his udgments reached your hearts; and in that day beautiful was his Presence  you, and precious was his Truth among you, in your first Love; and his Lit and Power, and the Knowledge of his Ways were pleasant to you; and the Sl of the Kingdom of God, which you receiv'd with Joy, grew up in you, and per'd at that day; and the Lord loved you, & his Presence was with you, g his own Children, whom he begat by his Everlasting Word, that you  be a Praise unto him forever: And when the fear of the Lord and his Jgnts were placed among you, and your Hearts were broken, and while you were of a hungering Soul, and thirsty after the Lord, then was it well with you, and the Day of Peace dawn'd unto you, and the Word of the Lord was wet unto you; and he was gladly receiv'd that came in the Name of the Lord. Bt O how have some of you lost your first Love, and are again darkened, and ready to faint, and to turn aside for a thing of nought? And how do such grieve the Spirit of the Lord, and vex his Righteous Soul, and are become a Sde to him, in dishonouring his Name; the envious man having entered, nd sown his Seed in some of you, and brought forth Strife, and Divisions, and Disorders among you, which are not of the Father, nor of the Truth, and Prejudice, and Evil-Surmisings, and secret Jealousies one against another is risen in you; all which is to be condemned, with the Light, for the Fire; I judge it all under my Feet, in the Power of the Lord God, and am in that which reigns over it all; and through these things Unity is decay'd, and Love is wax∣ed cold, and there is fainting in the way, and the Zeal for the Name of the Lord perisheth, which ought to be among you; and Rendings and Tearings, Biting and Devouring one another, and striving for Mastery there is, which ought not to be, which the Wrath of God is against, all this is out of the Light, out of the
Wisdom and Counsel of God. My Spirit is vexed, and my Heart is troubled within me, because of these things (not for my self, but for you, and for the Glory of the Lord, over whom I am jealous with a Godly Jealousie) that you may not perish, nor his Glory be dispised among the Heathen? What mean you thus to deal against the Lord, in dishonouring his Name in the sight of the Enemy, even to the wounding of your own souls, and to the piercing of the hearts of the Faithful, who have watched over you, and been Messengers of Glad-tidings un∣to you from the Lord? Every one of you in particular be awakened and stirr'd up; and fear before the Lord; and come to the Light, which the Son of God has lighted you withal; and search your own hearts, and try your selves, that the ground of these things may be seen, and condemn'd, and remov'd; and Love may yet spring amongst you to the Lord, and one to another. O Friends! Consider, It was one Father that begat you into the Truth, which is but one, by one Word of Life, which is not divided; and you were begotten unto him, and not unto your selves: And Christ Jesus (which is but one, the same to day, yesterday, and for∣ever; who is the Foundation of God, and abides forever) was preached unto you all, to be the Way, the Truth, the Life and Salvation, and there is none besides him; why then are there Divisions amongst you, and some for one, and some for another? And herein are you carnal, and your minds abroad, and not'staid upon him, which gives the increase; and all this is to be judged with the Life of God: Wherefore I beseech you, in the Fear of the Lord, as you love him and his Glory; yea, as you love your own souls, Come to the Light, which lets you see all this, and condemns it: and strive not one with another, nor exalt not your selves one above another; but let all that be condemned; and all your evil Surmisings, and foolish Jealousies, & separate Worshippings, & Backbitings be brought to Judg∣ment, and let condemnation pass upon it all, never more to appear to hinder your Fellowship with the Lord; and know the Life of God in you all, which is but one, which is not at strife, nor divided; and let that arise, that all Vails may be taken off, and Hardness of heart judged, and the Countenance of the Lord may shine upon you; when that exalted spirit, which has appear'd in some, is brought down, of which I charge you all to beware, lest there be a total departing from the Lord, and his Name be reproached through you among the Heathen; and it had been better for such they had never been born. Therefore, I say unto you all, lay it to heart, till the Judgments of the Lord take it away, and purifie your hearts from all these things which ariseth out of that which is not of the Father, that my joy may be renewed, who have been in travel for you, tell Christ be formed in you, that he alone may rule in you over all those things, which are at enmity against the Life, and hinders your grow. And if you yet harden your heart against Reproof, who are stubborn; well, the Lord will ease him of his Adversaries, and break you as a Potter's Vessel: And though you oppress the Life of God for a moment, yet my Peace with him ll these things never take away; but over all these things I tread, & am not offend in him who is my Peace forever: And though those things cause sadness of heart, yet the Lord giveth no cause of Sorrow to them that are faitful to him; but will arise to confound all Deceit, and Deceitful Workers, who err from his Way, and count the Knowledge of his Wayes a Burden; and of you all, though you perish, I am clear, who am not hated of the Lord, though falsly judg∣ed by his Enemies, over whom I trample, as the Dust; and the Living God gives Victory over you all. I am not of this World, E. B.
Something of TRUTH Made Manifest (In Relation to a Dispute at Draton, in the County of Middlesex, in the first Moneth last) In Opposition to the False Account given of it by one Philip Taverner, in his Book, stiled, The QUAKERS▪ ROUNDS, OR A Faithful Account, &c. FOrasmuch as one (who hath (I suppose) ambitiously stiled himself Mr. Philip Taverner) hath taken in hand to set forth to the view of the World an Account, and Relation of a Dispute, hapning in the eleaventh Moneth last, at Draton, near Colebrook; to which Relation I am a little engaged to write something by way of answer thereunto, that all people may know the Truth; and being the Truth is somewhat concerned herein, that is the Reason wherefore I have taken in hand to write a little by way of answer to his Relation, being without any prejudice towards the man, as concerning any Wrong he hath done to me, though me, as well as the Truth, he hath wrong∣ed, as may appear to such who desire to know the Truth. It's true, a publique dispute I had, the time and place mentioned, with a company of Priests, and this same Philip Taverner was one of them; and the occasion of the Dispute was thus; I being a few weeks before at a Meeting with some Friends in the said Town, one Richard Goodgroom in his relation mentioned was present at the hearing of what was spoken, but at that time did not object any thing, though afterwards in London, and other places, he went up and down, in a backbiting manner, and gave forth, That I had held forth blasphemous Doctrines, or the like; whereupon I much desir'd a Dis∣pute for the tryal of those things; and it was accomplished; and that day the Truth was much made manifest, and Deceit confounded. And as to all the things objected against me by Richard Goodgroom, which he would have seemed to have taken great occasion thereby, as if some great matter of Heresie and Error had been utter'd by me: I say, the very Truth of all these things was demonstrated, according as I had laid them down, and his Arguments against them made of none effect: And though such as hardened their Hearts might go unsatisfied, and in greater Unbelief then they came; yet I am sure, the Upright-hearted, and such as desired the knowledge of the Truth, were wholy satisfied; and this many can give Testi∣mony of with me.
And though by his Relation it may appear otherwise to some, yet wherein he hath related falsly, it shall fall upon his own head; and his Folly shall truly more appear in the End, then he would have, or seem to cause any in me to ap∣pear at this present; and so he might with more Credit to himself been si∣lent, then to have meddled in that wherein he hath shewed himself so im∣perfect. For I believe, That this same Philip Taverner hath given a Relation of four times as much as he did speak at that Meeting; and hath related; as though he spake that which he never uttered, by so many times fo much as I have said; and hath not related so much by many times, as was spoken by me, and them of my part, as many may witness: Which Work of his seems not to be per∣fect, neither yet altogether honest, as sober Men may judge; but such a thing must redown more to his own Dishonour, then to the Truth's Disad∣vantage. And first, As to the Title of his false Relation, which is stiled, The Quakers Rounds, or, A Faithful Account, &c. To this I answer, That the very Frontispiece, and Title of his Book, savours of a vain, light, scornful spirit; and so every Spiritual Man may judge of it to be so. But why dost thou Philip Taverner say, A Faithful Account, but that to confirm Falshood with audacious words, having a shew of Confidence up∣on it, thereby the more easily to enter ento the Hearts of the People, as if it were irreprovable; coming also from the hand, and under the hand of a Mr. Philip, &c. having so stil'd thy self to make thy Fame great, and to publish thy Work under a seeming Authority; but hadst thou had more Humility, less Pride would have appear'd, and hadst thou had a better Heart, less of Unfaith∣ful Dealing would have proceeded from thee: But, as I have said, Evil shall fall upon himself, that hatcheth it for another. But why dost thou say, Faithful Account, in the Title Page? Signifying to the World, that all in it is true, and nothing of Truth wanting in relation to that Dispute; and yet in thy Epistle sayst, Thou dost not undertake to set down the multitude of words that that day was fill'd withal: and pag. 29. sayst, That a third man of the Company made a large Discourse concerning the Person justified; but rela∣test not one word what was said by him; and here thou hast not dealt faithfully, nor given a faithful Account: And pag. 31. thou sayst, E. B. at such a time, did multiply many words; but dost not relate his particular words; and so hast not in this dealt faithfully, nor given a faithful Account: And also in many other things thou hast not related what was spoke at all; and thus thou hast con∣tradicted thy self, in saying, A Faithful Account; and yet confessing in effect, Unfaithfulness. And thy own words being compar'd together, prove a contradiction in thy own Mind and Pen; for, to give a Faithful Account, as thou sayst thou hast, is to relate the whole Truth, and not to keep any back; neither to speak more then the Truth, by adding thereto any thing. But again, thou sayst, Thou undertakest not to relate the multitude, or every parti∣cular of words; neither dost relate what particular words such a one and such a one spake; but sayst, He said so, and multiply'd many words, not saying what his words were: And therefore thou hast heaped a Contradiction upon thy own head, and it shall remain, till it hath made thee ashamed. And now as to the particulars, upon which the Dispute depended, so far as they are truly laid down in my words; and in my intent and meaning I am ready to justifie them; yea, at any place or time convenient; or before any Auditory whatsoever, upon lawful Occasion; but as thou hast laid them down, or some of them, thou hast wronged me and the Truth, and either
not understood my meaning, or subverted and perverted my words to thy own Advantage. And whereas in the Epistle thou sayest, I would not own them, viz. The Par∣ticulars laid down, to be mine, at first; and yet owned every one of them in the Dis∣couse, &c. Answ. I did not own them; but how? and how did I own them, but thus? The Objector had laid down some of the Particulars, not in my words, which made them vary from the intent of my meaning; and others of the Par∣ticulars he had laid down utterly false; and so I did deny them, as coming from him: but as to the substance of some of the Particulars, I did own, having laid them down according to my own honest Meaning, in my own sound Expression of words; and thereupon I engaged a Dispute upon the Particu∣lars, having first denied them, as laid down by him, and in his corrupt Ex∣pressions; and then owned them in the simplicity, in the words, as by me uttered; I mean some of them, but some I altogether denied. And as to speak of that Text, Ioh. 5. 39. By which (sayest thou) I endea∣voured to skin over what I spoke, but to no purpose. I do deny thy words; for, that same verse shall stand a Witness for me: and against thee, in all the World; and that verse shall prove, that some of the Scriptures were spoken to the World, and not to the Saints; and the Truth it self is my Covering, and I need no other thing to skin over, as thou scornfully speakest. And whereas thou sayest, There was just matter of Reproof in the Dispute, in both Parties, &c. Answ. Whilst thou hast condemned others, thou hast judged thy self, who was of the one Party, a strong Contender for the Priests Party; and ha∣ving now accused both Parties, wouldst clear thy self to be of neither, but canst not; for, it is known thou didst take their part: and in the Title thou sayest The Discourse was betwixt a party of them called Quakers, with Mr. Philip Taverner, &c. where thou dost own thy self to be one (and reckon∣est thy self the foremost Master) of the Disputants: And now, upon better considerations I think, when thou hast searched into their Folly, with whom thou wast joyned, thou wouldst absent thy self to be none of them, but a third Party: But let me tell thee, What Disorder, Prejudice and Passion, as thou speakest of, that was amongst the Priests, thou hast a part in, and must own their Sin, and their Condemnation; for thou art also guilty: And that there was any Passion (except pure Zeal for God and his Truth, which thou mightest falsly so call) or Prejudice, or such like amongst us, I do deny it, and know thee to have born a false Testimony; and all thy Covers, as if thou wert a Moderator, or the like, in thy speaking, will not hide thee, nor cover thee from what I have said of thee. But as to the things in particular, I now come, and may shew what my words are, and the Ground of them, and how I laid them down, and upon what Occasion in the first Meeting, whereupon the Dispute did arise; and I do not here go about to give a perfect Relation of that Dispute; for my Memory hath not contain'd what passed; but as to the intent and meaning of my words, I would give all the true knowledge thereof, and how far I do own the Particulars charged against me. First, As to that, The Scripture are not the WORD of God, because the Devil spoke something, and Pharoah something, which is there written. Answer, There is some truth in this; but my words were drawn up by him at the shortest, and the most for his own Advantage laid down by him: For I do remember, That in the first Meeting, I was speaking con∣cerning the Word of God, and concerning the Scriptures, which are a De∣claration
thereof; and shewing the difference betwixt the Word, and the Letter, and Scriptures; for the Word of God was in the Beginning, and the World was made by it, and it endureth forever: But the Scriptures were not in the Beginning; for Moses was the first that wrote any thing of the Scripture, who was long after the Beginning; neither was the World made by them; neither can they endure forever; and therefore the Letter, the Scriptures, are not the Word of God, which the Scriptures call the Word; for, also in the Scriptures are written what the Devil spoke, and what Pharoah, and other Wicked Men spoke; and therefore they are not the Word of God, but (as I have said) a Declaration of the Word; and what is written of is the Word: but the Scriptures (the Writings) are not, but a Testimony and Declaration of the Word. Much more as to this might be said, and was spoken by me at the Meeting, which is not particularly related; and this is sufficient to any honest man, that is Spiritual, who hath an Under∣standing to judge hereof. Now I suppose themselves, none of them are so ignorant, as they will say, The Scriptures are that WORD which was in the Beginning, and which shall Endure forever: But (say they) the Scriptures are another Word, a Declarative Word, or such like termes. Now when we dis∣pute, or contend with any about the Word of God, we dispute what that Word is which the Scripture saith is the Word; and do deny that Word to be the Scriptures (Writings) though still we do own the Scrip∣tures a Declaration of that very WORD of GOD; and that the Scriptures, in any place, do call themselves the Word, or signifie so much, I do deny it; and it is left for any of our Opposers, to prove it that can; if they do, I will confess it to be the Word, and revoke all that I have spoken to the contrary. And as for thy Deductions and Consequences, drawn from my words, I do deny them; for they are not to me, but will turn upon thy self; for thou sayest, A strange kind of Assertion, as if nothing of the Mind, Will, and Counsel of God were declared in the Scripture: And whitherto can be the tendency of such giddy Doctrines, then to a weakening of the Authority of the Scriptures, and begetting Slightings and undervaluing Thoughts, and that the effects may be lightly estee∣ming the Scriptures? These and such Deductions, hast thou drawn, through thy Ignorance, from my words; from all which I am clear, as having no Intent to any such things; nor any Intent, but to testifie to the Pure Innocent TRUTH: And thy Deductions are far more ignorant and impudent, then my Assertion is strange; and let thy Consequences be what they will from my words, the truth of my words will justifie me in the Sight of God and his Saints; for, I do honour the Scriptures above other Writings, and give them the Authority, and Esteem, and Respect due unto them, and more I dare not. And some of thy pages I pass over, as not worth taking notice of; on∣ly I do say, Thou hast wronged me, in not relating so much as was spoken by us, by far; and in relating more then was spoken by thee, or thy Party. And the next thing I note is this, where R. G. said, he would, and went about to prove, That the Letter is the Word of God; but was not, nor is ever able to prove: and thou hast changed the words of his Argument in thy Re∣lation, from what they were as he laid them down in the Dispute, from called, to owned; for thus his words were laid down, at that time, said he, That which Christ and the Apostles called the Word of God, is indeed the Word of God; but Christ and the Apostles called the Scriptures the Word of God: Ergo.
Now I denied, and do yet, that it can be proved, That ever Christ and the Apostles called the Scriptures the WORD of GOD; and neither do thy Proofs now, nor his then, of the minor Proposition, prove, That the Scriptures (viz.) the Writing, were ever called the Word; although it be true, that the Pharisees made the Word of God of no Authority by their Traditions: But that Scripture doth not say, That the Letter is the Word, which thing he was to prove, or else he said nothing to the purpose. And as to the other Scripture, 1 Thes. 1. 13. that will not prove that the Apostle called the Letter the Word; for it was the Gospel which they received as the Word of God, and not the Letter: The Gospel is the Word of God, not denied by me, but sealed unto: but the Gospel is not the Letter, and Writings; but the Gospel is the Thing written of; and that is it which the Apostle means to be the Word of God; for that is the Word, which he preached to the Thessalonians, and which they received: And so thy Arguments and Proof of thy minor Position is deny'd, and so the ma∣jor Position falls to the Ground: And by this, nor any other Argument, can all you Priests of England prove the Letter of the Scriptures to be the Word of God, which thing R. G. took in hand to prove, but could not; and would have cry'd against it in me, as a great deal of Heresie, for denying it; but Error is fallen upon his own Head. The next thing I note, is in pag. 13. where thou wouldst seem to cover over R. G. thou sayest, his words were not, That I had the thing signified in my hand, when I had the Bible; but that I had that which declares of it. Now to justifie him in Evil, thou hast wronged me and the Truth; for he did say, when I held up my Bible, I had in my hand the thing herein signified, upon this very Occasion, I holding up my Bible in my hand, and saying to this very effect, That in my hand, I had the thing which did signifie in words of such and such things; but I had not the thing signified: And Richard Good∣grom made answer, and said, But I had the Thing signified; and this some can witness: Whereupon I made answer, and said, If it be so, that I have the Thing signified in my hand, then I have God, and Christ, and the Spirit, and Hea∣ven, and Hell, and Men, and Beasts, and all things that herein are written of; and then he saw the Folly of his own Ignorance, I perceive. And much more, might be related as upon this Subject, which was said on both Parties, which I desire not much to recollect, only what I have said I can certainly remember, and can justifie it: And I must confess that, Philip Taverner hath done pretty fairly, though in some things he hath not done so. And no was to the next thing charged against me in the Relation, being pla∣ced the second, though it is the third, That evil Motions, not consented to, were not sin. In the first private Meeting, I remember my words were laid down thus, and so I own'd them in the Dispute, That Temptations or Motions unto evil, are not sin to any man, who doth not consent and obey to serve Temptations or evil Moti∣ons, and they are not sin to the man, except they be consented to by the man; and this was proved in the Example of Christ, who was tempted of the Devil, and had motions to do evil, yet did not consent nor commit sin; for he resisted and over∣came the Tempter; and so the Devil's Motions and Temptations, which were sin in themselves, yet they were not sin to Him: And this Proof then they could not deny, neither can any sober or upright Man. And so in the Dispute the thing was put to a farther Question, thus, But are not those Motions, which arise out of a Man's own Heart, Sin, except they be consented to? To which I was willing to speak something, and to own the very TRUTH; and to justifie, that there is a State, wherein Evil Motions may rise out of a Man's own Heart which are Sin in themselves, and Sin in
the man; yet not sin to the man, if he doth not consent to them, obey them, and fulfil them; and the Scripture doth prove it, Rom. 7. where he saith, It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me, for in his Mind he served the Law of God, and with his Mind did not consent to the Motions of Evil and Sin; and the Sin was not his, nor reckoned against him by the Lord, because with his Mind he consented not; and this no Upright Man can deny. And also, I apply'd my self at that time, for Witness, to the Experience of sober people and Christians, Whether many times there had not been evil Motions in their Hearts, presenting themselves, to which they had not con∣sented; but the Lord had given them Power over them, to resist them, and deny them, and they were not overcome of them? And whether ever they were accused and condemned for such Motions, which the Lord gave them power against? Or, Whether the rather they had not Peace and Joy in the Lord, who had discovered to them, and given them power over the Evil which had presented it self? And I also gave them that which I had witnessed concerning the thing, as a Testimony, agreeing with the Scriptures, to that particular: And though the Relation saith, as if I spoke of my present State to be so; but herein the Hearers were mistaken, if so they understood me; for, my present State is another, then what it once was; I bless the Lord, I speak without Boasting: And my present State I did not then, nor now shall declare; for I am not known to the World, nor desire to be, as what my State is: But this was my Intent, and is in these things; My State was, say I, yea, I believe from Ten Years old, till many Years after, that many times I had Evil Motions arising in my own Heart, which sometimes overcame me, and sometimes the Lord gave me to overcome them, so that I consented not to them, nor obey'd, nor follow'd them; and when they did overcome me, and lead me aside, then was I troubled and condemned of the Lord; for they were reckoned to be my Sins, when I consented; and many times the Lord gave me power over them, and I consented not, but re∣sisted them, and denied them, and then had I great Peace and Joy in the Lord, and no Condemnation; and this was my Experience for some years together, though my present State be another Condition, of which I shall not speak, as not being needful at this time; and this is the Truth, which no sober Christia can deny. Its true, we spent a little time in disputing upon those things, but to little purpose, as on their part; for what I then said, many of the people saw to be the very Truth; and all were well satisfied, except such as might harden their hearts: and much more passed betwixt us. And as to this thing, which I cannot relate, only P. T. as he began, so he goes on, giving a Report in his Relation of much more then himself spoke, and a great deal less then we spoke, which thing in him was not very fair not honest: For, I then proved by many Scriptures, That some were perfect in this life, 1 Cor. 2. 5. even perfect without Sin, Iohn 1. 47. 1 Iohn 3. 7. and yet I did declare at that time, That many of the Saints and Children of God, were not come to the State of Perfection, which admits of no Addition; for many of the Saints daily receive more and more of God's Wisdom, and of his Power and Life revealed in them, wherein they grow up to God from Strength to Strength: And though they did so much contend against it, yet in the end were forced to confess to the substance of what we spake, as to the par∣ticular of Perfection. The next thing is concerning Perfection; and I am charged with holding, That Perfection is attainable in this Life; which thing I did hold forth and con∣tend for, and am not now ashamed of it; and my very Proofs, which then I used, some of which are related by P. T. are sufficient to prove the particular, if I should say nothing more; and even as the thing is related, though what
I spoke, the whole is not related by much, as about this particular of perfection; but what is related shall stand as a Witness for me, and against them that do so much plead against Perfection, even of such perfection to be without sin in this Life: And to this I shall say little more, but leave his own Relation unto the consideration of sober People, onely must say, that P. T. hath belyed his own Memory, in saying his Relation is A faithful account, and yet hath related much more then he spoke also about this Particular. As to the next thing which is objected against me, That the Scriptures were given to the World, and not to the Saints: this is utterly false, and was neither thus spoken by me, nor yet my meaning; and at the Dispute I did deny that I spoke the words, neither had I any such intent as they have deducted, though still I do confidently affirm, That that Scripture, Iohn 5. 39. was spoken to the Unbelieving Iews, that went about to Kill CHRIST, who had ne∣ver heard God's Voice, nor seen his Shape, nor had not Christ's words abiding in them, and to them he spoke that Scripture mention'd; neither had I any such meaning, but that the Saints and all sober people, and all people might search the Scriptures, though such a bad consequence they have drawn upon my words, and said, It is a giddy assertion that hath dropped from me, and yet him∣self is forced to confess what I spoke is true, to wit, that that Scripture in the fifth of Iohn was spoken to the unbelieving Iews, and not to the Saints; and yet P. T. to confound himself, confesses that I said, The Epistles were given to the Saints; and this is a Contradiction from his own Pen: First, to say, that I asserted, the Scriptures were given to the World, and not to the Saints, and yet saith, I confess the Epistles were given to the Saints, which are some part of the Scriptures. And whereas P. T. further speaks, questioning in himself, how far I own the Authority of the Scriptures, and such like, which shews his ignorance, or his unbelief; for I have, and do here again speak plainly, That we do own the Authority of the Scriptures, and we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures have had hope: and they are able to make the man of God perfect through Faith; and what Christ and the Apostles owned the Scriptures to be, the same we do, and neither more nor less; and in this we are approved of God, and let men judge what they will. And whereas P. T. further speaks something of Iesuites, and saith, he does not apprehend me to be of that measure of subtilty, which is found among men of that Brother-hood, unless saith he, I have more then an ordinary Art of hiding my self, &c. To which I answer, Iesuites I deny, and all of that Fraternity, and what∣soever savours of Popery; yet am I hidden from people, and what I am he knows not, neither the World; for, from that Wisdom am I hid, neither can I manifest my self to that Wisdom that is devilish, and knows not God, nor the least of his Sons and Servants; for in all those things of which we then discoursed, the depth thereof could hardly be spoken of; because of the dark∣ness of peoples understandings. And especially concerning Justification I was very sparing, and could hardly freely declare my self; yet what I spoke was a great satisfaction to many then present, though the one half that I spoke is not truely related; though so much as is related shall stand a sufficient Witness for me, and against them that oppose me, and that my words and meanings were honest. This was the thing charged upon me, That no man was further justified, then he was sanctified. Now my intent and meaning in this was honest; and as about this Particular much was spoken, which now I do not recollect to repeat; onely P. T. hath hinted in short at things how they passed, and my words shall be for ever witnessed, That Sanctification is a Witness of Iustification, and no man can further know himself to be justified, then he is sanctified; nor justified, then he is restored. And had P. T. but laid down my full answers as I spoke them at that
Dispute, there would have been no need to have written any thing in answer; onely I do remember I did stand to manifest, that the New Birth, Sanctifi∣cation, and Justification were all agreeing in one, and not one without another; and that Christ wrought Righteousness perfectly without us, and also fulfilled Righteousness in all that believe; and no man is justified by the one of these without the other, and that hath not the other; and they hold the contrary: and R. G. did publickly affirm, that a man was justified by Christ, excluding the New Birth, and the work of Sanctification, which I denyed and must al∣ways deny, that any man, who is not born again, but is in the old nature, and not sanctified, but is in the Pollutions of the World, is justified by Christ's Righteousness; neither can he in that State, till he be born again, and Sanctified, have any benefit, or manifestation of Justification by Christ; and this all men shall witness, though because of this I now may be falsly judged: And though R. G. did openly testifie, that Christ justified Sinners, as Sinners, yet say I, all that are justified, are justified through Faith; and Faith doth purifie the Heart, as was largely spoken by divers of us at that Meeting, which is not particularly related; which definition of our Justification, they could not except against; for we never were, nor are ashamed to declare what we hold concerning Justi∣fication, which is through Faith in the Blood of Christ, the Seed of the Co∣venant: and though at that time they made much jangling, yet to no purpose, as to convince us of any Error, or any sober men there present, of any Error in us, as concerning that thing. And whereas it is related, as if I should say, We are men brought up at Plow-tayle, and understand not Schollar-like terms: my words were not thus spoken, but upon the occasion of their speaking words which is not in Scripture Language, as in∣herent Righteousness, or the like; Whereupon I desired them to keep to the Form of sound words, and of Scripture Language, that people might under∣stand what they spoke; for said I, ye are Schollars as you profess, and some of us were brought up at Plow or Cart, and may be do not understand Schollar∣like terms, though I did not mean all of us; and what some of us do under∣stand, as to that, I shall not now speak; yet this I say, the least of us do under∣stand betwixt Truth and Error, and betwixt that which is Righteous, and that which is Unrighteous, and in that is more peace, then in the knowledge of Arts or Tongues; and our knowledge in that, is as Dung and Dross in comparison of the other. And as to Justification, upon which Subject we contended a long time, though they foolishly charged us with it, we do deny utterly the works of man, and the works of man's righteousness, as in relation to our Justification, and that it is only and wholly by the Grace and Gift of God, and the Righteousness of Christ, who is revealed in all that believe in him, by which Justification comes; yet say we, That Faith without works is dead, and will not justifie a man; but by that Faith which brings forth works, even the works of God in us and through us, by that Faith are we justified, and according to the Apostle's words, so we believe; not by works of Righteousness which we have done, nor by a dead Faith without Works, but by a living Faith, which worketh in us, are we justified; let vain men deduct what they may, this is truth in the sight of the Lord, and all men. These indeed are the Particulars upon which the Controversie depended; and having been some hours together, they were willing to depart, and R. G. would give little hearing to me, when I charged him with something uttered by him, at divers times in my hearing, which I should have proved to be un∣sound Doctrine and Error, had he had that patience to have stayed: and whereas P. T. doth speak of having a Pope in our Bellies, with such like scornful words, which a discreet man would not have defiled his Mouth withal; but that he must shew himself to be of that Generation of Priests, who persecuted the Innocent in every Age: and for his telling of our Error, and recovering of our feet out
of the Snare, and delivering us from the Delusion; its true, his words stand but upon a supposition, and that supposition stands upon the Report of others, as he seems to intimate, which is but a thing far off true credit; for what Error, and Snares, and Delusion, did P. T. convince us of, in five hours discourse? not any at all; but the rather, was forced to confess to the most part of what we delivered; then what need was there to utter these his words in writing, as if he had heard some great Matter of Delusion or Error? but all these his words I do bear; and if he hath harboured such thoughts of us, as it appears too much by his words, let him cleanse his Heart by Repentance, lest his intended evil bruise his own head. And whereas he hath commented upon a Book, called, A Standard lifted up, which Book I own, and that which is therein written, and himself is forced to own, what himself objects against, and comments upon: If saith he, E. B. means so and so, then his words are truth; but if so and so, then it is Pope-like, or such like. Alas poor man! Must I be judged upon thy own meaning? nay; or must thy interpretation be the judge upon my words? We have no such law, my words stand true, as I have laid them down, to be received by such as are Spiri∣tual: and such as love to raise constructions falsly, where there is no just ground; their judgment I do deny; and Charity will teach P. T. to judge upon the best sence; and so let him own my words as truth, and judge himself for his false construction of true and upright words; onely this I take notice of, saith P. T. A perfect Conformity to the Law of God in our own Persons, though not wrought in our own strength, but in the Strength and Power of Grace, the Spirit working all in us, and for us, is no other then the Righteousness of the Law. I need not much strive to confound this black Doctrine by many Arguments, or multitude of words; for the thing, as laid down in his own words, is vile and abominable to the understanding of any spiritual man; for say I, if it be the Spirit working in us, and for us, not in our own strength, then is it God that worketh in us, both to will and to do, and the fulfilling of the Righteousness of the Law in us, and not the Righteousness of the Law wrought by us; and if it be in the strength and power of Grace, and not in our own strength, then it is the work of Christ in us, and the Work of God's own Righteousness in us; and any man that knows the least of God in Truth, will witness to this, and against his imagined Doctrine held forth by P. T. I might demand a Proof of him from Scripture, where it is said or signified, That the working of the Spirit, all in us, and for us, and the working of the power of Grace in the Creature, is reckoned to be our own righteousness, the Righteousness of the Law; and my words stand true from which he draws his false Consequences, and layes down his dark Assertions, and my own words I do own, which are, Such as are taught by Christ, and guided by him in all the Wayes of Righteousness, are justified by him, and none else; not in any word or work whatsoever, but in what they are led to fulfil by him: and in these words there is neither Contradiction nor unsoundness, though he hath ignorantly charged them with both; but the words shall stand for a Testimony against him, and all his false deductions; and he and all shall know, That God justifies the Righteous, and condemns the Wicked, and that it is the New Man that is justified, and not the Old: And let Righteous Men judge what can be in such a mans heart, who can draw so bad Consequences from such upright words. But further, he goes on, and hath transcribed more of my words, as, Christ Iesus the Son of God is the Light and Life of the World, and hath enlightned all man∣kind that cometh into the World, with the true Light, &c. now saith he; How do these agree with man's State in the first Adam? In transgression is a State of perfect Enmity, and Death reigns in every man, and he is possessed with blindness and unbelief, &c. I say, these do very well agree, and they are both true; for Death reigns in every man, and he is in Unbelief and Ignorance, and in a State of perfect
Enmity against God, as he is in the first Adam, yet Christ hath lightned him, and the Light of Christ, shines in Darkness in him, and the Darkness com∣prehends it not, and he is enlightned, that he may be changed from Death to Life, and from Ignorance to Knowledge; and though he walk in Darkness, and is in Blindness, and in a State of Enmity, it is because he does not walk and believe in the Light which Christ hath lightned him withal, and in my words there is no disagrement, nor contradiction, the Darkness is in his own Mind, who cannot comprehend the Light, nor the words that proceed from it. Further, he questions upon my words, of having the Witness in themselves, of being restored again. First, whether none are restored again, but such as have the Witness in themselves? I answer, all that are restored again, and do be∣lieve, hath the Witness in themselves; and none do believe, nor are restored, but they have the Witness of it. Secondly he queries, whether all are restored, but some want the Witness in themselves? I answer, All are not restored, nor do believe, and such want the Witness in themselves, that are not restored to God; but them that are restored want it not. And again, he queries, whether the Light which is in all, is sufficient without any thing of further Grace super∣added, to bring up every Man to believe in Christ, &c? I answer, The Light which every man is lightned withal by Christ, is sufficient to bring up every man to believe in Christ, that loves the Light and walks in it, and unto such is Grace added and increased daily; for as every man improves the Measure of the Gift of God, so it is increased, the Light is increased, Grace is increased, Faith is increased; but still the Light of Christ in it self is sufficient. Again, from my words, to wit, The Spirit is given to be the Guide and Rule of Life to the Children of God; from whence he queries, whether the Spirit is so given to be a Guide and Rule of Life to the Saints, that they have no more need to attend upon the Scriptures? I answer, It is promised, that the Spi∣rit shall lead into all Truth; and such do own the Scriptures, but not as their Teacher; for the Anointing dwells in them, and they need no man to teach them, but as that Anointing teacheth all things, and they have no need of the the Scripture to teach them; for all the Children of God, are taught of God, and need not any other Teacher, nor need not to say one to another, know the Lord; and yet all such do own the Scriptures to be the Testimony of that which they believe, and have received. Again, from my words, to wit, The Light of Christ in every one shall give testimony to the truth of what I speak, unto which I do commend my self; from this he queries; can these be Witnesses to me, and of the Truth in me, who are ignorant of the Life and Power of the Creator, &c. who are following the counsel of their own hearts, which are evil, &c? I answer, Yes, the Light of Christ in such shall judge one day, and to it I com∣mend my self, and by it one day shall be approved, though now the Wicked hate the Light, yet doth it witness against them, and for us, that we are of God; though its true they cannot judge between Light and Darkness, between Truth and Error; yet the Light in them, which shines in their darkness, does judge and put a difference; and when the Book of Conscience is opened, it shall justifie us, and condemn our Enemies. Again, he queries, whether I make the Holy Ghost and the Eternal Spirit two? I answer no, they are one, neither do I seem to make them two, it is want of knowledge in him, who cannot understand, but raiseth Objections where there is no cause. Again, from my words, this is acceptable and well pleasing to God, above all words and outward conformity &c. from this he questions, whether the doing the greater things of the Law is acceptable, where the less are neglected? I answer, no; for every tittle of the Law, less and greater, must be fulfilled by Christ in us, in whom we are accepted: and thus I have returned a few words to the con∣sideration of people, and particularly to the people of Draton, and the Coun∣try there about, to whom I direct my speech, thus.
All ye people, who are scattered, as Sheep without a Shepherd, and know not Christ the Everlasting Shepherd to lead you, and to rule you; Cease, oh cease from all your Teachers without you, who are dumb Shepherds, which do not gather you to God; such are they that preach for Hire, and divine for Money, and that take Gifts and Rewards for preaching, who through Cove∣tousness, by feigned words, do make Merchandize of Souls: Such do keep you alwayes learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth under their Teachings; your Souls are starved under them, and you perish for want of true Knowledge; and Death raigns amongst you; and many are in the broad way, that leadeth to Destruction; but few in the strait Way, that leads to Life: and Iniquity and Wickedness abounds amongst you; and like Teach∣ers, like People; for, from the least of them, even unto the greatest of them, every one is given to Covetousness, Jer. 6. 13. Great Ignorance hath blinded your Minds, and great Darkness is over your Hearts; and your Teachers do deceive you, and they cause you to err; and you give your Money for that which is not Bread, and your Labour for that which doth not profit; even as the people of Israel did, so do you, and in their Transgressions do you walk; and your Teachers are in the steps of the Phari∣sees; they are called of men Master, as the Pharisees were; they stand praying in the Synagogues and Temples, as the Pharisees did; and they have the chief Seats in the Assemblies, as the Pharisees had; and they even shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men, as the Pharisees did, and will not enter in themselves, nor suffer them that would. Cease from all your outward Priests, and hearken to the Voice of the Lord, which breaks down that nature which is contrary to God, and raiseth up the Seed which is Heir of God's Kingdom; and turn your minds to the Light in you, which Christ hath lightened you withal; which Light shines in your Con∣sciences, and convinces you of your evil Deeds; it reproves you for Vain words, and Ungodly speeches; it will let you see what your hearts go after, and what your love goes out unto; and if you love that, it will lead you to Christ; and he will be revealed in you, to teach you, and to give you the Witness of Peace and Reconciliation with God: The Light is your Eye, by which you may see God; it will lead you out of all idolatrous worships and works, and from your false worships, which are an Abomination to the Lord; and you must be converted and changed into a new Nature, and you must put off the Old man and his Works, before you can worship God aright; for he is worshipped in Spirit and in Truth only; and such the Lord is now seeking to worship him. Therefore cease from your Steeple-house-worship, which is in the Traditions of men, and not in the Spirit of the Lord; and that worship must be confoun∣ded; for its Root is corrupted, and its Branches will wither; and the Breath of the Lord is kindled against it. If you love the Light of Christ, and walk in it, there is your Teacher; and if you hate it, there is your Condemnation.
The next day after the Dispute, this was written, and sent in a little time after to Draton, and up and down that ways. Richard Goodgrom, FRiend, hath not thy Ignorance, Folly and Wickedness towards me now appeared? And is it not manifest in the sight of many people (And now thou mayest cease to boast, and also to back∣bite for the time to come; and no more secretly to surmise behind my back, to the raising of unruly spirits against me, so much as in thee was possible: and hadst thou been more crafty and more subtile, more Mis∣chief thou mightest have done; but the Innocent is delivered, and thou art taken in the Snare thou laidst for another, and false doctrine is prov'd to proceed forth of thy mouth: And thou and thy Company may be a∣shamed, when you consider the managing of your Work against me, who many times appeared immoderate, in speaking many at once, confusedly; and also were unreasonable, in not being satisfied with just Answers; but it shews your Blindness and Unbelief, who cannot understand the Truths of the Gospel of Christ, but contend against them, though in the end you are forced to confess to them, as was sufficiently witnessed that day of the Dispute; and thou in particular, who reproachedst me behind my back, in divers places, where I have heard of it by my Friends, whom thou judg'dst had not been so; yet they have discover'd the naughtiness of thy heart, both in the Country, and in the City: Thou hast given forth, that I had prea∣ched false doctrine, and such like wicked reproachful back-biting language behind my back, not like a man faithful to God and thy Neighbour; but one that hath surmised Evil against the Harmless: And thou mayest re∣member, all these things thou objectest against, who wouldst have made a great matter of them against me, yet are they sufficiently prov'd to the Understanding of many honest People. And if thou and thy Company will be blind, it is because you harden your hearts against the Truth; and I am clear in the sight of the Lord: and all shall know, that have an Ear to hear, That what I profess, preach and practice, are the saving Truths of Iesus Christ; though they may be branded to be Heresie by such as thee, who may call Light Darkness, and Darkness Light, and put Good for Evil, and Evil for Good: And at a convenient Opportunity I may take in hand to prove, That thou thy self hast held forth that which cannot be justified by the Scrip∣ture, but are condemned thereby. Many things fell from thee in my hearing, which I may object against, and prove the contrary; and I shall not go behind thy back, as thou hast done, to slander thee; but I shall rest con∣tented, and wait the opportunity to lay open thy Nakedness and Weak∣ness in the sight of all people: And whatsoever thou judgest, The Scrip∣tures (the Writings) and the things written of, are two things; the one is the Word of God, but the other is not; and this all sober men confess to, though thou dost jangle and twist about it with thy lame Arguments, to no purpose at all, except to shew thy Weakness and Folly. And also, No man is justified by Christ's Righteousness, until he receives it, and
as he receives it; and this thou shalt one day witness: For, though Righteousness be in him, sufficient to justifie; yet by it art thou, nor any man justified, but in the receiving of it, and dwelling in it; and this shalt thou confess to be truth, in the Day of the Lord: and in the mean time let me bear thy false censure, in calling this Heresie. And also, a man may be tempted to sin, and there may be evil motions to him; yet he not being overcome of the Temptation, not consenting to the motion of sin, it is no sin unto him, neither shall sin be imputed to him, if he commits it not; but he that commits sin, though he profess never so much of Justification, yet for his sin shall he be condemned; and this shalt thou witness in the day of Iudg∣ment. Also, That there is a Perfection attainable in this life, even to be perfect, and without sin in Christ Iesus; and this I affirm to be the Truth of the Gospel, and that wherein the Faith of God's People stands: and though thou madest a twisting and a wrangling against it, yet it is too strong for thee; and in thy wisdom, and thy arguments is thy folly and thy weakness seen; and Truth stands over thee, and thou canst not it nor me repre∣hend. And also, That some of the Scriptures were spoken to the World, and not to the Saints; this I also have sufficiently proved, and thou art not able to detect it; and all thy snarling in opposition to these things is confounded, and thy Arguments made without effect; and all, whose eyes are open, see thee to be of too short a measure, and of too weak a capacity to under∣stand the deep things of God, which are hidden from thine Eye, and them thou savourest not in that wisdom; though thou hast the words, yet thou art ignorant of the Life; and the Life is in dominion over thee, and to it must thou submit, and lay down thy Crown: And from thee am I hidden in that Life and Truth which I do profess. And though I be as a Deceiver, yet am I true; and though I be slandered, and reproached, and back-bited by thee, yet it is for Christ Iesus's sake, and for his Truth's sake, and not as an Evil-doer. But Friend, learn more Wisdom, then to judge a man before thou hearest him, or to condemn the matter before thou hearest the Proof of it; for, by these things thou hast not gain'd a good Report, but God condemns thee for it, and men see thy shame in it; and the burden of it one day shalt thou bear, even thou, and all that own thee in these things. And now thy spirit is try'd, and it is found too light, and cannot stand in Judgement; for it is unsavoury; and though seperate from the World in appearance, yet is thy spirit of the world, and reacheth not the know∣ledge of the things that are eternal; but art imagining in thy mind, not being guided by that Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures; and so thy knowledge is natural, and cannot contain Spiritual Things: Therefore Friend, come down to God's Witness in thee; the Light which shews thee sin, and convinces thee of evil; that Light is thy Teacher, if thou lovest it, and thy Condemnation, if thou hatest it. I have divers particulars against thee, at a convenient season, to manifest thy Folly and Weakness by them: And whatever thou judgest me, I am a Friend to thy Soul, Edw. Burrough.
Richard Goodgroom held forth at the Dispute at Draton, the 18th day of the 11th Moneth, 1657. HE said, The Letter was the Word; and by the Letter (he said) he meant the thing contained in the Scriptures: And when I said, I had the Letter in my hand (meaniug my Bible) but not the thing signified; he said, But I had the Thing signified. And he said, People were justified by Christ, excluding the New Birth, and the Work of Sanctification; and Christ justified Sinners, as Sinners (that is) while Sinners remaining in sin. At Justice Fortescue's house, in the year 1656. he did deny, That any was converted to God by a Light within: And then I asked, If it was not that same Light that converted, which gave the Knowledge of God? and they confessed, Yea: and yet did deny, That the Light within converted to God; though I shewed them that Scripture, 2 Cor. 4. 6. which did confound the Deceit. At Uxbridge one time he said, Christ needed not to have come to have judged the World; for there was sin enough in the World to judge it before he came: Then I ask∣ed, If Sin judged the World? and he answered, Yea: and he said, They were in the Covenant of God spoken of, Nehem. 9. which turned the Law of God behind their backs. E. B.
A TESTIMONY Concerning the Estate of the True Church, What she hath been, and what she is: Being given forth from the Motion of the Spirit of the Father. COncerning the true State of the Church, what she hath been, and what she is at this day; and concerning her Increase, and Decrease, through Ages and Generations past. And her present State is this, Returning again out of the Wilderness, where she hath long been fed, having a place prepared of God. Now the Apostle saw her a Woman, cloathed with the Sun, covered with the Light of Heaven, and with the Glory of God; having the Moon under her Feet, the Light which was ordain'd to rule the Night. Thus she was, and this was her state in the dayes of the Apostles, when ma∣ny were converted out of Darkness, and renewed to be Members of this Church; for her Glory shone through the World, and she flourished through Nations; and this was her state in the Apostles dayes: And she travelled to bring forth the Man-Child, Christ Jesus, which is the Child and Husband of this Woman, which was clothed with the Brightness of the Glory of God, the elected Spouse of Christ, the Lamb's Wife, and his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones; having Power and Dominion, and treading under all contrary: And thus was it with her in Generations past, whose Seed spring forth, as Branches, fruitful and glorious. But in process of time it came to pass, That this Woman, the Spouse of Christ, his Body, the Wife and Mother of this Man-Child, she was bereaved of her Beauty; and her Garments were taken away; her Seed was made War against, and was smitten, and overcome; and she fled into the Wilderness, and there hath sate desolate, as a Widdow, lamenting the loss of her Children; and being deprived of her Husband, and the Man-Child, which should have ruled the Nations: For she hath been fled into the Wilderness, and her former Beauty hath not appeared to be, and her former Glory hath seemed to be gone; and she hath been driven away from her Head, from her Husband, and from her Seed. Behold all people the Estate of such a Woman, and read this Parable who can, A Woman most Glorious and Fair, having her Husband Ruler of the whole Earth, and having an Heir born to rule over Heaven and Earth, being cover'd with the Light of Heaven, and of the Everlasting Day, and having the Light of the Night under her Feet; yet hath this Woman been deprived of her Glory, and sate desolate in the Wilderness, a mournful place, separated from her Husband, and made Childless, and without Seed: And what Eye that sees this aright, but must Mourn? and what Heart that truly perceives it, but must lament? A Woman so Great, and so Glorious, and so Fruitful, as to bring forth the Heir of Heaven and Earth; yet has she been left as a Mourner,
as without Husband, and without Issue for many Generations: This hath been her Estate and Condition for Ages, since the dayes of the Apostles, which Iohn saw (in a Vision) would shortly come to pass after him, and we see it hath been come to pass within this sixteen hundred years: And this hath been the Estate of the true Church for many Ages, A Woman childless, whose Heir hath been taken from her, and whose Seed hath been made war against, and killed, for many Generations. But her time was decreed, and she should but be thus for so many dayes; and now are the dayes expired, and she again shall receive her Heir, that hath been caught up from her; and her Seed shall spring forth; and her Slain shall live; and her Beauty shall be given her; and her first Glory shall be encreased; and she shall feed no longer in the mourning Wilderness; but she shall be fed upon the Mountain of God's House, which is to be established upon the top of all Mountains; and her Seed shall spring forth numberless; and her Heir shall rule with an Iron Rod; and her Marriage Day is come, and the approach thereof nigh; and Life shall be revealed: Thus she hath been, and thus she shall be; the Lord hath said it. Now as for all those Multitudes of Sects and Peoples, that have professed Re∣ligion; and as for all those Churches, so called, that have gone under that name, which have professed Christ to be their Head, and made a shew of him in appearance; the Papist's Church, the Protestant's Church, and all the Sects that have risen out of them; they have not been the true Spouse, the Lamb's Wife; but Children of Fornication, and not of the Seed of that Woman that was once clothed with the Sun; and they are come up, and their Original begun, while this true Woman, this Spouse of Christ, hath been Childless: None of these are clothed with the Sun; nor none of them have brought forth the Heir of Salvation. Come, let's reason with you; Who was your Mother? who brought you forth? and in what Womb were you bred, you that have appeared in the world, and for many Ages, for the true Spouse? The Mother of the Heir hath been childless, and as a Widdow banished from her Husband, and her Heirs separa∣ted from her, and her Seed killed, and made War against; She hath not born you, nor brought you forth; Then of what Womb did you spring, all ye of the Papist's and Protestant's Church, and all the Sects that came out of you? answer me this: None of you have been fled into the Wilderness; for you have appeared in the World: None of you have been as a Widdow, mourning; for you have been practizing Ordinances, and rejoycing in the World: None of you have been without Issue, nor your Seed made War against; for you have been fruitful in the World, and one Sect brought forth another, and one Church brought forth another; therefore none of you have been that Wo∣man which Iohn saw: For never none of you, from the least to the greatest of you, were ever clothed with the Sun, nor had the Moon under your Feet, nor ruled the Nations with the Rod of Iron; therefore none of you are the true Spouse, the Lamb's Wife; he is not Husband to any of you, nor is he your Child nor Heir. And this is the Word of the Lord God to you all, you Churches and Sects, Your beginning and springing forth was from another Womb, while this Wo∣man lodged in the Wilderness, and while she was childless, and without Seed: and the Mother of Harlots brought you forth, the great Whore, whose Super∣scription is, Mystery of Babylon; and her Character is, Mother of all Abomina∣tions: For, while this other Woman hath been fled into the Wilderness, which Iohn saw was fled thither, this woman, the Mother of Harlots, which brought you forth, hath been fruitful and flourishing, and hath had an Husband, and many Children: For Iohn speaks of two Women; of a Whore, and of a Virgin; of one, the Blood of whose Seed was drunk; and the other drunk the Blood; yea, one that was made war with, and against; for the Saints
were killed, and their Blood drunk; and that other killed the Saints, and was made drunk with their Blood: the one was fled into the Wilderness, he saw, of which I have spoken, other making all Nations drunk with her For∣nication and ruling over all the Nations of the Earth, as a Queen: And while the one of those, the Virgin, the Lamb's Wife, hath been fled into the , and left Childless, without Seed; the other, the Whore, hath , and brought forth many Children, taken great Pleasure in the  and committed Fornication with the Kings of the Earth: And these thing  saw were to come to pass; and we see (that have Iohn's Spirit) is come to pass already. And  all ye Sects upon the Earth, and Churches so called, that have been in the World for many Ages; Which of those two Women are you of?  the Seed of whether of them are ye? Who of these two was it that brought you forth? answer me, and make it appear. But I have said already, The Virgin brought you not forth, the Lamb's Wife did not bear you, nor you are not of her; for you were brought forth while she was banihed▪ and deprived of her Heir, and without her Husband; and you are of the Seed of that Whore, the product of her Fornications, generated by the seed of Adulrerers: And though you have been warning, and fighting and striving one against another, yet you were bred in one womb, and are of one seed. And thou me of you, in one appearance of the Whore's beauty brought forth, have made War against them brought forth in another appearance of her, and ned her flesh; yet have ye given your power to the Beast; and Iohn saw that also, which we see is fulfilled; Some that should hate the Whore, and make War against her; yet shuld they also give their power to the Beast: This have we seen fulfilled amongst you Sects and false Churches, and your beginning we know, and the first beginning of Whoredom, and when the Whore began with her Fornications since which time all Nations have drunk her Cup; and her scent has been upon Nations, and Multitudes, and Peoples. Her first Whoredom Iohn speaks of in his Epistle, and her beginning; They went out from the Bo∣dy, from the Spouse; and from the Virgin; they went out from the true Church, being false Members, not as ever being of the Body of Christ, nor of the true Church; but such as had been amongst the Members of the true Church, and were once convinced, which had got the Form, and put on Sheep's Clothing upon the Wolvish-nature: and here was the beginning of her Whore∣dom, She went from the Spouse, and went into the World, and the World heard her, and received her, and they drunk of her Cup, and committed For∣nication with her; and she played the Whore in the Unbelieving World, after she departed from the Saints; she went out from them, and they denyed her, and it was manifest she was not of them: and this was the beginning of Whore∣doms. And she was but young yet in her Whoredoms, and little in the world, and had not yet deceived many; but in process of time it came to pass, she encrea∣sed so mightily, that she made all Nations drunk, and overcame them; Kings and Rulers, Bond-men and Free-men, they all drunk of her Cup; and she be∣came so great, that Nations, Kindreds, Multitudes and Peoples were her Seat, her place of Government, where she sate Ruler and Queen, having Dominion over all; and all were bewitched by her, and made drunk with her Cup: And of this Woman came ye, all ye Sects upon Earth; and you are the Multitudes, Kindreds and Peoples, upon which her Seat hath been, and over whom she has had her Government. And this is she that has drunk the Blood of the Saints, and overcome them; and the Heir and Seed of the other Woman, the Virgin, hath long been made war against; and killed and slain by this woman and her seed; and this hath been the State of the Church for many Ages, since the dayes of the Apostles: she has been fled, and her Seed made war against, and killed, and her Heir
caught up to God; and the Nations, which should have been ruled by her Heir the Whore has set upon them; and the Peoples and the Multitudes, which he should have govern'd, have been the Seat of the Harlot, the Mother of all Abomi∣nations: And was it not like to be so? and how should it be otherwise, when the Man-child, the Woman's Heir, has been caught up to God, and he has been as prevailed against, and the Remnant of the Woman's Seed made war against, and killed? and this has been since the dayes of the Apostles. And so all you Churches and Sects, by what name soever you are known in the World, you are the seed of the great Whore, and she hath brought you forth while the other Woman has lodged in the Wilderness, and remains childless: If any man hath an Ear to hear, let him hear. Now it may be objected unto me, and thus may it be said, By this Accompt the Church, the Lamb's Wife, has been prevail'd against by the Whore; because it is said, She hath killed the Saints, the Members of Iesus, and of the Church: This seems to she, as if the Church of Christ had been prevail'd against; but Christ sayes, The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against them, but she should remain forever, [and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against her: And how do those two things agree? it seems doubtful to us, may some say. Answ. To all this I do answer, The true Church, the Spouse of Christ, in her self was never prevail'd against, so as not to be in beeing, or that she was not; but in her self has remain'd in beeing, and not prevail'd against, so as not to have a Place or Beeing; and Christ's words are true, she has had a Place and Beeing to wit, in the desart Wilderness, which place was prepar'd her of God, there to be fed for such a time: So she has a Place, and has a Beeing▪ though in the Wilderness, a place desolate, and of mourning. So she has not been prevail'd against, as that she has not had a Beeing; but the Lamb's Wife, the Mother of the Heir, that which is perfectly so, which was and is to be joyn'd to Christ, which is of his Flesh, and Bones taken out of him, that cannot be prevail'd against, never was, nor never shall be; for the Devil nor Satan have nothing in him, of whose flesh and Bones she is, which is taken out of him; and it is as possible for to prevail against him, as to prevail against her; for she is of him, as Eve was of Ad; if any have an Ear to hear, they may hear: But her Off-spring has been over∣come, her Seed made War against, and her Heir taken away, and caught up from her; so she not prevail'd against, nor overcome, though banished into the Wilderness, fled thither, and there has she fed, and had a place, and has been left Childless, as I have said: So the Mother, and the Lamb's Wife, hath had a Beeing, and in her self never prevail'd against, nor overcome; and Christ's words are true: Yet has her Seed been kill'd, & made War against, and overcome (as Iohn said) and both these are true, and this is my Answer; and if any have an Ear to hear; they may hear; though a Parable to the World, yet plain to the Seed, which now God hath raised, and is raising; for the Woman again is re∣turning, and her Seed again is springing, and she is becoming as fruitful as ever, and her Glory shall be as great; the Light of Heaven shall cloth her, and the light of the Night shall be under her Feet as perfectly, when she is restored, as it was before the Apostacy, though People cannot believe this in the Apostacy. No Revelation, nor immediate Teaching, nor Miracles now to be expected, cry the Professors, and these false Sects and Churches; It was extraordinary Times, and extraordinary Manifestations were amongst the Apostles and Churches of old (say they) but the same now are not to be expected, nor never to be looked for; but thus they are in▪ Blindness, and Ignorance, and Unbelief. But we believe, the Glory of this Woman, that hath been long fled into the Wilderness, and hath been long without Issue, while she hathbeen fled, shall have the same Fruit and Issue, and the same Clothing that she had before she fled: When the Whore and her seed is removed from the face of the Earth, the Glory of the Lamb's Wife shall be as great, her Beauty as fair, her Fruit as plentious as before the Whore was; and they that believe it not, believe not the Scripture;
for that testifies of the Glory of the Church to be the greatest in the last days, as we are sure, and certainly know it shall come to pass, when the Waters are dried up, which have been the Seat of the great Whore. Now though all those Churches and Sects of People, are said to be, and known to be the Seed of the Whore, and not of the Virgin, as I have declared; and though Nation, and Peoples, and Multitudes have been all running to Fornica∣tion, and been deceiv'd, and made drunk; yet this I have to say, In all sorts of People, and amongst all those Sects, amongst Papists and Protestants, and all Sects risen out of them, in thousands of people, notwithstanding the Darkness, and all the Apostacy that hath rul'd in the general; yet in some of all Sorts and Sects there hath been a Sincerity, and Simplicity, and a Desire, and Zeal for God, and of God in them, and amongst them; yet the Sincerity, Simplicity, and Desire, which hath stirr'd in some of all Sects, it hath no sooner appear'd, but it hath been smit∣ten, and betray'd by the wicked without, and so by the error of Judgment within: For even amongst the worst of Sects, we know there are some in whom there is Simplicity, and Sincerity, and Zeal; and yet err in Judgment; for this is possi∣ble, and we know it is so with Thousands, and ten Thousands at this day. There may be a Simplicity, and Zeal, and Sincerity of Heart, and yet err in Judgment, and the Judgment not truly guided by the Spirit of the Lord; but a false spirit, and a false thing, even the spirit of Whoredom it self ruling the Judgment, and be chief there; and this destroys, and murders, and betrays the Zeal and Simpli∣city: and this is, and hath been ever since the dayes of the Apostles, great error in Judgment, and the Judgment of all those Sects have been mis-guided and mis∣led, and a false thing, and not the Spirit of the Lord has guided the Judgment; and thereby the true Sincerity, Zeal and Simplicity hath been enslav'd, and held under, by reason of the erring in Judgment: And the State of such is truly to be lamented, where Simplicity is devour'd, and Sincerity betray'd, and held captive by the Whorish spirit, that sits Ruler in Judgment. I do not speak of all people of all Sects, that they have Zeal and Simplicity; but of some people in all Sects, and through all these false Churches; and so the spirit which hath guided the Judgment, that has abased the Zeal, and abused the Sincerity, and betray'd it; so people have been a running, running after the Form, and blind in Judgment, and lost Sincerity, and Simplicity that has been betray'd in them, though some∣time appearing and stirring; and so the wrong part in people has fed upon the Form and Appearance, and the Seed starved, and the Sincerity eaten out; and so one Sect hath made this the Rule of their Judgment, and another Sect another thing the Rule of their Judgment; one cries, Tradition; another, Scriptures; another cries, The Practice of Saints before us; and none of all have been guided in Judgment by the Spirit of the Lord: & where the Spirit of the Lord is not the on∣ly rule of Judgment, guiding the Judgment in all things, that people, & that man are in Error, and the Sincerity in them has not its free course, but bound under, with a spirit which is Bondage, & leads into Bondage: And when people come to be turn'd to the Light of Christ in them, and receive a measure of the Spirit of the Lord to guide the Judgment, then the Sincerity, & Simplicity, & Zeal will grow, and thrive, and be encreased; but till then the Good is eaten out, that lies under, and is oppressed, and ever, and alwayes the Desire quenched, the Sincerity lost, the Simplicity betray'd by the spirit of Whoredom, which rules the Judgment; and these things are manifest in our Age. Therefore all people come out of your Sects and false Churches; for the Woman is return'd, and returning out of the Wilder∣ness; and the Seed shall spring forth, as in the dayes of old. E. B.
THE True State OF CHRISTIANITY, Truly Discribed, and also Discovered unto all PEOPLE: What it was in its Beginning, and Purity; and what it now is in its Apostacy, and Degeneration. And here, by true Testimony, is declar'd to the whole World, how, and wherein, in divers particulars, the Christians through all the World (so called) now are fallen, and gone back∣ward, and revolted from what the true Christians once were. And this sheweth unto all the World, the woful State and Condition, wherein them that are called Christians now stand; being departed and revolted from the Spirit of Christ, and from his Teachings. And this is given forth, that all People may understand concerning the Times, and the changing of Times; and concerning what hath been, what now is, and what suddenly cometh to pass in the Earth. BEhold and hearken, give ear and listen diligently all ye People through the whole World, that are called Christians: All you, I say, that go under that name, and that bear that name, and are named Christians, from one end of the Earth to the other, through all Nations and Countries, whi∣ther you are scater'd, upon the face of the whole Earth. Behold and take notice what the Word of the Lord is unto you, and what the Testimony of Christ is towards you all; for the Line of true Judgment is laid upon you; and the Measuring-Rod is put forth to reach over you; and the Servant of the Lord hath viewed your State and Condition, and what you were in your beginning and increase, and what you now are in your De∣crease and woful Apostacy, into which you are fallen, and degenerated from the Life of Christianity. Oh! let your Ears be open to Instruction, and regard well what I through the Lord do say unto you, even all you, and every particular of you under Hea∣ven, that make a Profession of Christ in words, and are known through the World by that name of Christians; hearken, I say, and consider, and remem∣ber from whence, and into what you are fallen, and return and repent: The Lord hath with you a Controversie, and he will plead with you because of your Back-slidings and Revoltings; for you are gone away backward, and you
are turned aside from the Life of Christ, and from his Spirit; and are now without that which was the Reason and true Ground of your Name, Christian; and you have lost the true▪ Character of the Name, and now have only the Name, without the Life and Power thereof; and are dead to Christ and his Life; and have a Name to live, but are dead; and having lost that which gave you a true title to the name of Christian, you deserve not that Name, nor to be called by the Name of Christ, because you are departed from his Spirit: And this is to be declared to you in the Name of the Lord, that you may take a view of your own estate, to the end, that you may be awakened, to return from whence you are degenerated. The Lord had a People in all Generations, unto whom he was a God; and they feared him, and served him, and worshipped him; and his Name was pre∣cious amongst them, who were his chosen People, and with whom he dwelt; and his Power and Presence was amongst his People, that did walk with him, under what Name soever they went in the World: But the first time that ever the People of the Lord were called Christians, or known by that Name, from other people, it was at Antioch, in the time of the Apostles, who were Followers of Christ, as you may read, Acts 11. 26. And the Disciples were first called Christians in Antioch: and before that time the People of the Lord were never called Christians; and this Name was given to them by the Heathen, be∣cause they were for Christ, and of his part, and did follow him, and preach him to be follow'd, and in all things exalted his Name, and did and suffer'd all things for the Name▪ of Christ, therefore were they named Christians; and that Name was true unto them; for they had upon them the express Image and Character of Christ, and follow'd his Spirit, and preached him unto all people for Life and Salvation, and that all people might come to Christ, and become Followers of him; and therefore they were rightly named Christians, to be known by that Name from all other people upon Earth, who were not Followers of Christ; who could not rightly be call'd Christians, because they were not of his part; and from thence forth unto this day, all people whatsoever, that be∣lieved in Christ, and became Followers of him, and that professed him, were called Christians from that Original and Foundation of the Name, which then was laid. Also you may read, Acts 26. 28. And Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persadest me to be a Christian: Here again Paul followed Christ, and preach∣ed him, and was on his part altogether, and highly extolled his Name; there∣fore King Agrippa called him Christian, and was almost perswaded to be a Christian; to wit, A Man for Christ, to take part with him, and to be on his side: and the Name, interpreted, this is the signification; and all that have this Character do truly deserve the Name of Christians; for they are anointed Peo∣ple; and this was the beginning of the Christian Name. And before that time, as I have said, were the People of God never called Christians in any Generation; and ever since that time, through all Ages, all that professed Christ, and believ'd in him, throughout the whole World, were called by the Name of Christians; and the Name and Religion of Christians were honourable, and greatly beloved of God; for that People was the peculiar People, a chosen Generation, as you may read, 1 Pet. 2. 19. and whilst the Life of Christ was manifest, and the Spirit of Christ did lead them and teach them in all their Wayes and Practices of Religion: And whilst, I say, they re∣tained the Power and Life of that of which they had the Name, the Power and Presence of the Lord was amongst them; and above all the people of the Earth were they blessed; and more then all people upon the Earth besides had they the Countenance of God shining amongst them, and upon them, and pure unity with God, and one with another, had they in his ife, where∣by they were made a terror and a fear to all Nations, while they stood in the Counsel of God, and were Christians in life, and power, and practice, as well as
in name; and the Lord greatly encreased them in number; for, as you may read through the Acts of the Apostles, through all the World many believed in Christ, and became Followers of him, and received the Knowledge of him, and became anointed People, and received the name of Christians; some∣times Thousands at one Sermon were converted to the Faith of Christ, and became subject to his Spirit, and had his Mark upon them, and all such were called Christians; and the Apostles went through many Nations, and of the Iews, and Greeks, and of the Heathen, and all other people, some of each were converted from that way in which they had walked, to follow Christ, and they became Christians; and here was the encrease of Christianity; and through many parts of the World they planted Churches and Assemblies of Christians: And, as I said, while they stood in the Counsel of God, the Name and Religi∣on was of him greatly beloved. But now the Christians are Apostatized and degenerated from the Spirit of Christ, and from that which gave them the true Name of Christians; and the name is retained only, and the Life and Power lost; and now many have a name to live, but are dead; and that is departed from, which gave the true interest and title in the Name. Hear this all ye Christians, That Life, Light and Power of God, which was amongst the Apostles and Christians once, you are departed from, and have lost the sence and knowledge of, and have the Name and not the thing, which was the Reason and Ground of the Name. Wherefore all ye through the World, that are called Christians, look back to your Original, look unto the Apostles, who were the first that were called Chri∣stians, from whom you had the Name, and see how you are degenerated, and fallen from the Life that they were in, and though you retain the Name of Chri∣stians, yet you are not Followers of Christ, nor taght by his Spirit: and none in the dayes of the Apostles were truly counted or called Christians, but who fol∣low'd the Spirit of Christ, and were first converted to him, and changed by his Power from Sin to Righteousness, and from Death to Life; and such as were so, were truly called Christians. But now all such as are called by that Name, and are not followers of the Spirit of Christ, nor converted to him, neither changed by his Power from Death to Life, and from Sin to Righteousness, such are in the Degeneration, from the Life of Christianity, and have a Name without the Life and Power thereof. And now it remains to be shewed, how, and when the Degeneration came upon the Christians; and wherein they are apostatized and degenerated from that ife, and Spirit, and Practice, which was amongst the Apostles, that were first called Christians. The Spirit of the Lord spoke through the Apostles, and foretold of a falling away from the Truth, and from the true Christian-life; and Paul said, Acts 20. 29, 30. said he, Grievous Wolves shall arise, and enter in, who would not spare the Flock; and from among themselves should men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw Disciples after them: And he also said, 1 Tim. 4. 1. That some should depart from the Faith, and give heed to seducing spirits: And he also said, That it should come to pass, the people should become wicked, departing from the Truth, having the Form of Godliness, but denying the Power thereof; and such were led away with divers Lusts, and men of corrupt Minds, and reprobate concerning the Faith. And the Apostle Peter also foretold, That there should false Teachers arise among the Christians, who should bring in damnable Heresies, and many Christians should fol∣low their pernicious wayes, by reason of which the Way of Truth should be evil-spoken of. And the Apostle Iohn saw, That many false Prophets were gone out then, and many Antichrists were then come in among the Christians.
Now all these do shew and declare of a Degeneration, and falling away of Christians from the Life of Christianity; and we see these Prophesies fulfilled, and Flocks of Christians are devoured from the Life of Christ, by devouring Wolves which have entred among them, who have led them into pernicious ways, and into damnable Heresies, whereby the Name of Christianity is become reproachful amongst the Heathens, that never were called Christians; and ma∣ny Thousands are departed from the true Faith, from that Faith which did puri∣fie the hearts of the Saints; and many Christians have given heed to seducing spirits; and have the Form of Godliness, but deny the Power thereof; and they are led of divers Lusts; and are become men of corrupt minds; and are re∣probate, and without the true Faith. And the Apostles prophesied of the Degeneration, which we see fulfilled in these our dayes; and even while some of the Apostles were yet living, they saw the Christians Apostatizing, and falling away; and the Spirit of the Lord spoke through Iohn, Rev. 2. 3. to the Christian-Churches in Asia, who were already departing from the Christian-Life; some of them were departed already from their first Work and some of them were given to the doctrine of Balaam, and to the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing the Lord did hate; and others of them were seduced by Iezabel, and taught to commit Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols; and others of them had a name to live, but were dead; and others of them were neither hot nor cold; and the Lord said, he would spue them out of his Mouth. Now here the Christians were falling away you may see, and as before it had encreased, so now the true Christian Life began to decrease, and the glory thereof became darkned through all Asia: And also Rev, 13. 11. 1. 16. Iohn saw one Beast arise out of the Sea, and another out of the Earth, which set up a Kingdom over the whole World, and caused all people upon Earth to wor∣ship the Beast; and the Beast hath been great in his power, and he hath ruled over the World in great dominion; and all that would not worship him, he hath had power to kill, and hath killed them; so that the true Christian Life and Religion, as the Apostles received it, and practised it, hath been extin∣guished for many Generations; and People have had the Form of Godliness, but denied the Power, and lived under the Name and Profession of Christianity, but have been without the Life; and this is to be considered of, and diligently searched into, by all you that go under the Name of Christians through all the World; for unto you only I direct my words. And now it remains to be shewed what the state of Christians is at this day, and wherein particularly they are apostatized and degenerated from the true Life and Practice of the Apostles, who were the first Christians; for wherein the Christians now are contrary, and not agreeable to the Apostles, in Faith, in Practice, in Worship, in Ministry, and in the entrance into Christianity, and in any other thing whatsoever. I say, wherein they are contrary, and not agreeable to the true Christians of old, to wit, the Apostles, therein are they degenerated, and fallen from the true Life of Christianity; and this shall be the Rule of Judgment to try all you that are called Christians upon the face of the Earth: wherefore awake, and come forth to Judgment, for the measuring Rod is laid upon you all, whereby you shall be truly measured and compared with them that where the first Christians upon Earth; and the Heathens shall see your nakedness, and your shame, and his; at you, when they behold how wofully you are fallen from that Life, in the Purity thereof, of which you do profess the words; and shall not they rise up in Judgment against you; who never had the name of Christians, who are not faln nor degressed from what they have profest in any measure, com∣parable to you, who now retain only the name of Christians, and are depart∣ed from the Life of Christ.
First, concerning the entrance into Christianity, and the way and means whereby people are now made Christians, and receives that name; In this will your fall and degeneration appear. For the Apostles and first Christians upon Earth, before they were Christians, or were called so, they were first converted, and changed and translated from Death to Life, as you may read, 1 Iohn 3. 14. and Col. 1. 13. and they first re∣ceived Christ, and became followers of him, and received his Spirit to teach them, and to guide them: For the Apostle said, If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, Rom. 8. 9. to wit, no Christians; and the Apostle said, as many as were the Sons of God, were led by the Spirit of God; and also it was promised by Christ to all that were his, the Comforter should come, the Spirit of Truth, and he should lead them into all Truth; which promise, all that were Christians did receive, and they were led into all Truth by the teachings of the Spirit of Christ, which dwelt in them; for all that were Sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into their hearts, which Spirit sanctified them through the obedience thereof. Now these were Christians, and were truly so called; For they had the mark of Christ and his Image upon them, and he dwelt in their hearts by Faith, Ephes. 3. 17. These I say were truly called Christians; and none but such at that day of their Original were called Christians, or had Fellowship in the Christian life: nor were any looked upon by the Apostles to be Christians but by them that were such. But look back all ye Christians upon Earth, and see your fall, and wherein you are contrary, and not agreeable to the true Christians in their first and pure Estate. I say, look to your Original, and see how you are Apostatized from them in your entrance into your profession of Christianity; for though you have the name of Christians, yet you were not made so, nor received that name by being first converted and changed, and translated from Death to Life, and from being the Children of disobedience, to be the Children of God, through the work and operation of the Spirit of God in you; for hereof are Thousands and Ten Thousands of Christians now wholly ignorant, and altogether without the feeling of the Spirit of God, to change them, to convert them, and to translate them, but are accounted Christians by tra∣dition, or natural education, and because of being sprinkled with a little water upon the face, being Infants, or by a bare confession and profession of the Name of Christ in words, and professing of a bare belief in the Scriptures, by this way and means were you made (and received you the name of) Christi∣ans without any real change from darkness to Light, and from Satan to God, as I have said. Now here appears to be a woful degeneration in the very entrance of the thing, and this is not agreeable, but rather contrary unto that way of Chri∣stianity, wherein the Christians in their beginning were so made and called; for then none were Christians, or so called, but who through the preaching of the Gospel were first converted, changed, and renewed as I have said, but now in these Nations all are called Christians that are spinkled upon their faces with Water, by a Teacher, when they are Infants, or that do but profess Christ in words, though they are not guided particularly by his Spirit; neither have re∣ceived Christ to dwell in them, and to be King over them: and here again appears a wofull Apostacy; for none in the beginning of Christianity in the World were made Christians, or so called, but who received Christ, and in whom he dwelt, and was in them; as you may read, 2 Corinth. 13. 5. and who were Followers of him, and had his Spirit in them, the Comforter to teach them, and to lead them into all Truth; but now thousands upon thousands, who have the name of Christians, have not received Christ to dwell in them, nor to rule them, neither is he manifest in them by his Spirit to teach them, and they are not led into all truth; but live in deceit and unrigh∣teousness, and are not Followers of Christ, but follows their own hearts desir,
and their own hearts Lusts, and are condemned in their own Consciences, and have not received the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, to be their Guide and Leader out of all Unrighteousness; and here appears a woful Degeneration. And that you Christians, through all the World, are revolted, and gone back∣ward from Christianity, as it was in its Original; a Lamentation may be taken up because of this woful Fall, into which you Christians are fallen: Consider of your own state, and return, and repent. Again, The Christians were begotten of God, and born of him, 1 Joh. 5. 18. And they were born of the Word of God, and of the incorruptible Seed, 1 Pet. 1. 23. And they were created in Christ Iesus unto good Works, Eph. 2. 10. And they were New Creatures, and old things were done away, 2 Cor. 5. 17. They had put off the Body of Sin and Death, Col. 1. 18. And were the Servants of Righteousness, and free from Sin, Rom. 6. 22. as you may read. But now also, Woful are you Christians degenerated from this; for, Thou∣sands upon Thousands of you are not born nor begotten of God, though you have the Name of Christians; neither are you born of the Word of God, which lives forever, nor of the incorruptible Seed, neither are created again, nor become new Creatures, nor have put off the Body of Sin and Death; nei∣ther are the Servants of Righteousness, nor free from sin. But on the contrary, Are the Servants of Sin, and free from Righteousness, and are in the corruptible state, and are old Creatures, and are not washed, nor purified as the Saints were, as you may read, 1 Cor. 6. 11. and here is a woful Degeneration of the Christians now, from what the Christians were in the beginning: The Christians then were New Creature, and put off the Body of sin, and were washed, and sanctified: But the Christians now are not so, but the contrary; to wit, Unwashed and Unsanctified, remaining in the Polluti∣ons of the World, and are of the birth which is born of the Flesh, and are in the old nature, serving sin and the lusts of their own Hearts; and thus are you fallen from that which the true Christians possessed; for, being compar'd to them, you are not agreeable, but rather contrary to them in all these things and the Lord is now come to search you, and to try you; and to all People shall you be discover'd; for the Lord is now risen to bring all to Tryal, and to Judgment. And again, Herein will the Apostacy of the Christians appear, in respect of Unity and Fellowship; for the Christians, in their Beginning, while yet the Life of God was not darkened amongst them, They were of one Heart, and one Mind, and one Soul, as you may read, Acts 4. 32. And the Lord promised, That he would give unto his People one Heart and one Way: And Ezek. 11. 19. the Lord promised, To give his People one Heart, and a new Spirit: Which Promise the Christians received; and they that believed were of one Heart, and there was no lack amongst them; but some sold their Possessions, and distributed to them that had need: and they were Members of Christ, and he was Head amongst them, and over them: And they were Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bones, Eph. 5. 23, 30. And all the Christians were of one Faith, Eph. 4. 5. and had Unity and Fel∣lowship in the Life which was made manifest in them; for they had tasted, and hand∣led, and seen, and heard the Word of Life; and they had Fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ. But all ye Chirstians upon Earth, how are you degenerated? and how great is your Fall in this? For you are not of one Heart and Mind, nor in Unity and Fellowship one with another; but are of divers Sorts and Sects, and are run into many Opinions, and Divisions; and are of many Wayes, and Minds, and Hearts: Divers sorts there are of Papists, and divers sorts of Protestants, so called, which are all divided in Opinions, and striving and contending about Faith, and Religion, and the Worship of God; and are opposing one another, and putting one another to Death, because of a difference in those things; How great is the difference through many Nations amongst Christians about those
things? which sheweth that the Christians are wofully fallen in respect of Unity, and it is manifest such Christians have not received the Promise of God, as the Apostles had; for now the Christians can suffer one another to lack, and to perish, and die and starve for hunger and want: Behold in all this all ye Christians generally how you are fallen; then, in the beginning of Christianity, no lack nor want was amongst them; they that had much, sold it, and gave to them that had none; but now thousands are oppressed through Want, while others have too much; some are feeding and clothing excessively, with their multitude of Dishes and changes of Raiment, while others have scarce whereon to seed, or to cover their Nakedness; and this manifesteth, that you are not Members of the Body of Christ; neither is he Head in you, nor amongst you; but you are Members of an Harlot, and joyn'd to a Harlot, and one with a Harlot; for you profess many Faiths; some say, They believe Christ is given to all; others believe, Not so: some say, They believe he died for all; others they say, They believe contrary to that. And thus the one Faith, which the Apo∣stles had, the Christians of this Generation have lost; and they have lost the one Head, Christ, and have many Heads; every Sect hath their Head: Many Heads among the Protestants; many Heads among the Papists; but thus it was not in the beginning of Christianity; therefore you Christians are subverted from the true Life of Christ. The Christians then were of one Faith; but now of ma∣ny: The Christians then had one Head, Christ; but now the Christians (so call'd) have many Heads: The Christians then could lay down their lives one for another, and were written in the Hearts of one another by the Spirit of the Living God; but the Christians now are in Envy one towards another, and in Strife one with another; the Great Men do oppress the Poor, and they go to Law one with another for Earthly things; and one Stealing from another, and one Hanging another, and Murdering one another, and making Slaves one of another, and Robbing one another, and seeking utterly to destroy one another; and yet such have the Name of Christians, amongst whom all this is acted. But consider, How woful is your Fall? and how wicked is your Degenerati∣on from the Life of God, and from the true Christian Life and Unity which was amongst them in their Beginning? Then they were of one Heart, and of one Way; but now divided, and in Strife and Contention about Religion, and the Worship of God; and also about Earthly things; for which they de∣stroy one another, and seek so to do: Then they could lay down their lives one for another; but now they are taking the life one from another, through wickedness; a woful Apostacy, and great night of darkness is upon you: then none among them had lack of any thing, nor none destroy'd through wasting any thing upon their Lusts; but now Thousands perish for want, while others have too much, and are destroying it upon their Lusts: Then had the Christians one Head, Christ; but now the Beast reigns, that hath many Heads: Then they were of one Faith; but now the Christians profess many Faiths: Then the Christians handled, saw, heard and felt of the Word of Life in them, and they had Fellowship with the Father and with the Son; but now Thousands of Thousands of Christians are without the sence, and feeling, and knowledge of the Word of Life in them, and walk in Darkness and in Ignorance, and have no Fellowship with the Father, nor with the Son. Behold, behold, ye Christians, how ye are fallen, and how great is your Fall! A Mourning and Lamentation may be taken up for you: The Garment of Righteousness is rent from you, and the Beauty of the Son of God appears not upon you. Alas, alas, What doth it advantage you, to have the Name of Christians, seeing you are thus wofully degenerate from that Love, Unity and Life, in the Fellowship of God, which was among the Apostles, who were the first Christians, and from whom ye derived the Name; but are without the Life, as hereby is manifest to the World. Again, Herein doth the Apostacy of the Christians appear, in respect of
Holiness and Purity of Life; for, The Christians were of a holy Life and Con∣versation, the Apostle said, 1 Thes. 4. 7. God hath not called them unto Uncleanness, but unto Holiness. And as you may read, Tit. 2. The aged Man were to be Sober, Grave, Temperate, Sound in the Faith, in Charity, in Patience; and the aged Women likewise, their Behaviour was to be as became Holiness; and the young Women were to be Discreet and Chaste; and young Men were to be Sober minded; and Servants were to be Obedient to their Masters, and to shew good Fidelity: For saith the A∣postle unto the Christians, The Grace of God had appeared, teaching them to live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly, in this present World: for that end was Christ given, that he might redeem them from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of Good Works. Now here, in short, is a true Description of the true Christian Life and Conversation, which was exhorted to, and no doubt but practiced by the Christians, in the dayes when Christ was manifest amongst them; but from this Practice are the Christians degenerated: For, How are the aged Men and Wo∣men now given to Covetousness, and Earthly-mindedness, and are Peevish, and Perverse, and Immoderate, and in the Works that are Evil; shewing that they are not in the Apostles Doctrine, and not in the Christian Life, but to it are become dead, bringing forth Fruits contrary to the Fruits that the aged Men and Women brought forth in the beginning of Christianity; shewing they are not of a holy Life and Conversation, as the Christians were, and ought to be: And also, how are the young Men, and the young Women degene∣rated from the true Christian Life, and now are given to Wantonness and Plea∣sures of the World, and the Lusts, which are evil; following Vanity, and Pride, and Vain-Glory: And Masters and Servants being corrupt in their places, serving themselves one of another, and making a Prey one upon ano∣ther? And thus all sorts of Christians are fallen from the Christian Life, and Holy Conversation; and shew, that they own not the Grace of God, which hath appeared to all men, to be their Teacher, as the true Christians once did: For it is manifest, That the Christians now (so called) have not deny'd all Ungodliness, and Worldly Lusts; neither do live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly in this present World, as the Christians did; but on the contrary: How are ye Christians fallen from the pure and Holy Life, abounding in Wickedness and in all Ungodliness? How doth Pride abound among Chri∣stians? How doth Lying, Swearing, Drunkenness and Whoredom, and all the works of the Flesh abound; Dissimulation, Back-biting, Envy, Wrath, and all that ever can be called Evil is abounding amongst ye Christians, so cal∣led? This shews that your Apostacy is great from that Life and Conversation which the Apostles, and Churches of Christians were in, who had denied all Ungodliness, and worldly Lusts; but generally ye live in all Ungodliness, and worldly Lust: judge ye of this Backsliding into which ye are faln; they were taught to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World; but ye live unrigh∣teously, and ungodly, and out of the Fear of God, and the Grace of God is not your Teacher, as it was theirs: Also you may read how much the Apostles exhorted the Christians to a holy Life and Conversation; the Apostle said, 1 Cor. 3. 17. The Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are, speaking to the Christians: And he said, Eph. 1. 4. They were chosen in Christ, that they should be Holy and without Blame before him, in Love: And Col. 1. 22. They that had been sometimes Enemies to God in their minds, were reconciled, to present them Holy and Un∣blmeable in his sight. And 1 Pet. 1. 25. The Apostle exhorted the Christians to be holy in all manner of Conversation: And Phil. 3. 20. the Christians witnessed, That their conversa∣tions were in Heaven. Now herein doth the fall of Christians appear, in respect of their Life and Conversation, and walking; for the Christians in the Apostles dayes were of a holy Life; and exhorted all thereunto, but the Christians now, both
Teachers and People are degenerate in their conversation, and live in all Unrighteousness, as I have said: And the Conversation of Christians now, being compared with what the Christians Conversation was then, it is alto∣gether contrary, and sheweth, That though you have the Name of Chris, ye are not Followers of Christ, nor led by his Spirit; but by the spirit of Antichrist. Oh, how wofully are you fallen, you Christians, from the Life of Christ! having a Name to live, but are dead: The Lord God is coming against you, to break you to pieces; for you have poluted his Name, in that you profess to be his People in words, but in works do deny him. Oh! Remember, remember from whence you are fallen, and return, lest the Anger of God consume you from off the Earth; for your conversations greatly dishonour the true God. Oh, what Gluttonny and Drunkenness is amongst Christians? What Pride and Vain-glory? What Cruelty, Envy and Murde one against another? what Whoredoms and Fornication? what Cozening? what Cheating? How doth all Wickedness abound amongst you, in your lives and conversations? Let the Lord be Witness, and your own consciences be Wit∣nesses against you for your Abominations; they that were true Christians, who followed Christ, lived not in, but were redeem'd from such Transgressions; but you live in them, and act in them, wherefore be ye Witnesses against your selves, that ye are fallen and digressed from the true Christian Estate. Again, Herein will you Christians appear to be degenerated from  Christianity, in respect of your Ministry; for the Ministers of Christ, in the beginning of Christianity, they were made Ministers by the Gift of th Holy Spi∣rit, which was given to them; for they were commanded to wait at Ierusa∣lem for the Promise of the Father; and they were not to go forth, till they had received Power from God by the Gift of his holy Spirit; and when that was come, they should be Witnesses and Ministers of Christ, Acts 1. 4, 8. And as they were waiting with one accord, in one place, the Holy Ghost fell amongst them, an fil∣led them, and then they began to speak, as the Spirit gave them utterance; and they went up and down, and testified to the World of what they had heard and seen, Acts 2. 4. Now this was the Call of Christian Ministers, and this  the Authority by which they went forth into the World, to wit, The Spirit of God poured upon them; and by Authority of this only they went up and do the World, and declared what they had handled, seen and tasted of the Word of Life, 1 Iohn 1. And as every man had received the Gift, so they might mi∣nister the same one to another, 1 Pet. 4. 10. And this was the Practice of the Christian Ministers, in the beginning of Christianity, concerning their C to the Ministry. But how are the Christians here degenerated from what the Apostles were in, for by another way, then this, are your Ministers made, not by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, received from God; neither do the Christians now wait for such a thing, to go forth by Authority and Power thereof: but they are made Ministers by Natural Learning, and Education at Schools, having Authori∣ty by man, and are approved of man, and not of God: And a man knoweth which of his children he will make a Minister, when they are Infants, and there∣upon puts him to Schools, to learn Arts and Knowledge of Earthly things, for so long time, till he hath gain'd so much Knowledge and Craft to be appro∣ved of such and such men (and as is his Knowledge, and Oportunity serves; withal, having a great Place provided, where there is great store of Main∣tenance) such a man becomes a Minister, and a Preacher to others; having never received, nor thought to receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost; nei∣ther having heard, seen, tasted nor handled any thing of the Word of Life from God, in his own particular; neither hath he received the Gift of Christ to be made a Minister by. This sheweth greatly your Degeneration from the true Christian Spirit; none then Ministers among Christians, but them who
had received the gift by the Holy Ghost, and power from on high; but now Ministers are made and approved, and sent forth amongst Christians, be∣cause of natural learning and education, without receiving the Gift of the holy Spirit: And the Ministers of Christ then spoke as the Spirit gave them utterance; but now Ministers study for what they speak, and read old Authors to gather forth Matter to preach to the people: Then the Christian Ministers heard, and tasted, and handled of the Word of Life in themselves; but now the Ministers have their Knowledge from Books, and what they have heard and read without them. Oh! How great is your Apostacy, ye Christians? and in respect of your Ministry, how greatly are you degenerated from the Ministry which the Chri∣stians once had? Behold and consider this all ye Christians upon Earth: Your Ministry is proved not to agree, but rather to be contrary to that Ministry which was amongst Christians, in the purity of Christianity, as here by is ma∣nifest: and you are fallen from the Ministry made by the Gift of the holy Ghost, to a Ministry made by natural Learning; Consider all ye Christians how great is this Fall. Again, In respect of the Maintenance of your Ministry your Degeneration doth appear; for the Ministers of Christ amongst Christians, as they were called by the Spirit, so they were maintained in the Work of their Ministry by the  Gift of the people, who received their Ministry; and they were to give freely, and minister freely, as they had received freely, Mat. 10. 8. 2 Cor. 11. 7. The Apostle preached the Gospel of God freely, and would not make it chargeable to any, 1 Cor. 9. 18. And the Ministers of Christ among Christians at that day, went through the World, and preached freely the things that they had received from God: and they sought no mans Money, nor Gold, nor Appel, Acts 20. 33. And saith the Apostle, 2 Cor. 12. 14. I seek not yours, but ; and that was their end altogether, to bring people to God by their Ministry: only Christ did allow, Luke 6. 4. Into whatsoever House they entred, that was worthy,  might there abide, eating and drinking such things as were set before them. And it s the Apostles practice sometimes to reap carnal things, where they had sown Spi∣ritual things; and it was a small matter that they did so: Yet by a free Gift they desir'd to reap it, and not by Force and Violence did they ever obtain any thing. t concerning this, Great is the Degeneration of Christians in this Gene∣n; for now the Ministers amongst you Christians are maintain'd by an rd power, through compelling Maintenance of Tythes, and other Set-W, from the people, even from them that do not receive their Ministry, and they do not preach freely, but makes their preaching chargeable to whole Nations, and the maintaining of Christian Ministers is become a bur∣n to whole Nations, and great Oppressions upon the poor; and now the ers seek mens money, and gold; and it doth not appear, that they on∣ly seek a people to God; but on the contrary they seek peoples mony to them∣selves; and it doth not satisfie the Ministers now to eat and drik such things that are set before them in a House that is worthy, but they must have so much a year and so much a Sermon, and so much for every par∣ticular man of his Parish, be they worthy or unworthy, to the value of a hundred, or two hundred |pounds by the year; whereby poor people are greatly oppressed; and they will reap carnal things by force and violence, from them to whom they sow no spiritual things; for they are suing at Law, and putting in Prison, and distraining peoples Goods by Force and Cruelty, to maintain them and their Families in Pride and idleness, which things the Christian Ministers formerly in the dayes of the Apostles never did; but were often under great Sufferings, in Fasting often, and in Cold, and Nakedness often: Lring with their hands, 2 Cor. 11. 27. Wherefore ye Christians, behold how you are fallen, and how your Ministry  generated both in its Call, and in its Maintenance, being diverted quite
contrary to what the Christian-Ministry was once: Behold, I say, how you are fallen! and your Ministry quite subverted from what the Ministry  in the dayes of the Apostles: Then the Maintenance of Ministers was by a free Gift from them that received their Ministry; and they would not make their Ministry chargeable to any: But now the Maintenance of Ministers is by Force and Cruelty, and great Oppression of many people; and their Preach∣ing is chargeable to many Nations. Then they sought no man's Gold, nor Mo∣ney, nor fought Riches from the people; but only sought the people to God; But now men's Money and Riches are sought, and taken from them by Violence, without regard of seeking people, or bringing people to God. Then to eat and drink (in a house that was worthy) such things as were set before them; and to reap carnal things, as Meat and drink, and Necesses, by a free Gift, from them that received their Ministry; this was a sufficient Maintenance for the Christian Ministers: But now, so many Hundred Pounds by the Year, to maintain themselves and their Families in Pride and Idleness, and to reap it by Compulsion and Injustice from poor people: In this manner are the Christi Ministers now maintain'd, which is manifest to be quite contrary to the Practice of Christian Ministers in the Apostles dayes. Behold your Fall, ye Christians, and how you are degenerated! The Lord is come to try you; and to search you; you are weighed, and are found too light; you are measured, and are found wanting; what the Christians once were in their Purity, you are not, in many things, but the contrary; which sheweth that you have the Name of Christians only by Tradition, but are witho the Life; and being paralell'd with the Christians, who truly follow'd Christ, you are no whit equal to them in any thing, but wholy contrary in all things; shewing you follow another spirit, then they who were Followers of the Spi∣rit of Christ; so witnessing to the whole World, that you are degenerated, out of Christ, the true Vine, and are Branches in a degenerate stock, which brings Fruit forth through you, which hononreth not God, but grieveth his pure Spirit: And be Witnesses against your selves, that you are fallen and de∣generated from that Life and Practice which was amongst the Apostles and Christians. Again, As concerning your Worship; which is now practiced amongst you Christians through the World; herein also will your Apostacy greatly appear; for the Worship of the Christians was one, and guided by one Spirit, and was in the Spirit, and in the Truth, saith Christ (Iohn 4.) concerning the Worship of Christians, God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in Sp  in Truth. And saith the Apostle, We are the Circumcision, that worship God in S rit, and rejoyce in Christ Iesus, and have no Confidence in the Flesh, Phil. 3. 3  these were Christians. And also, Rom. 6. 7. They worshipped God not in the O∣ness of the Letter, but in the Newness of the Spirit; and the Spirit guided them i all things, and was their Teacher in all their Worship; for, the Spirit  them to pray, and they pray'd in the Spirit; and they knew not what they should ray for, as they ought, but the Spirit made intercession for them, Rom. 8. 26. And the Christians were exhorted to pray in the Holy Ghst, Jude 20. And the Preaching of Christians, it was in the Spirit, and by the Teachings of the Spirit; For they preached as the Spirit gave them utterance, Acts 2. And Philip was led by the Spirit, and the Spirit of the Lord moved Philip to go and preh to the Eunuch, Acts 8. And the Apostles went up and down, as they were mo∣ved and led by the Spirit; and preached and prayed in what place, and at what time and season, as the Spirit moved them, and gave them utterance; some∣times in the Fields, and sometimes in Houses: This was the Practice of the Christians in their Preaching and Praying. And also the Apostle said, I will pray with the Spirit, and with Understanding; I will sing with the Spirit, and with Understanding: And he exhorted the Christ.
To speak in Psalms, and spiritual Songs, singing to the Lord, and making Melody in their Hearts to him, Eph. 5. 19. Now this is the Testimony concerning what the Worship of Christians was, its manifest, that it was in the Spirit, and by the Teaching of the Spirit, their preaching, praying, and singing were in the Spirit, taught and exercised therein by the Spirit which they had received from God. But now the Worship of Christians at this day, is not agreeable to this, but be∣ing said to the line of Judgment, is proved contrary: for first, the Christians nw are divied in their Worship, and have many Forms of Worship, some worshipping after one manner, and others after another; so that amongst the Christians ther divers Forms of worshipping, and they are striving and con∣ding about th Worship, every one praising their own Form, and striving one against anothers Form of Worship; and this sheweth, that the Christians now are not guided nor exercised by the one Spirit of God, in their worship; and this shews that the Christians now are degenerated from the true Worship of God in Spirit, which once the Christians Worship stood in; for then the Worship of Christians was one, and in one Spirit; but now the Worships of Christians are many, and divers, and divided one from another, and they are not in unity in their Worship,  in strife and division; and herein you are apo∣statized from the Life o ristianity, and its manifest that the Worship of Chrs now, is not in  St, and in the Truth, but in vain Traditi∣; learned in natural knowlge by people that are not converted unto God, and any part of the Worship which is now practised amongst Christians, whether amongst Papists of any sort, or Protestants of any sort; I say; every part of the Worship now practised amongst Christians through the World, may by taught unto, and learned of, and exercised in, by a man that knows t God, neither is in the Truth, nor converted to the Truth; neither hath the Spirit of God guiding nor leading of him: And I say, That which may be done, or practised by a man, that is not in the Spirit, nor in the Truth, not is yet converted to the Knowledge of God, nor is not in any measure gued by the Spirit of God, is not the Worship of the true God, which is in the Spirit and Truth; but, as I have said, any part of the Worship now prsed amongst Christians, may be done and practised by aman that is out of the Spirit, and out of the Truth, and unconverted to the Knowledge of God;  therefore the Worship now practed amongst Christians, is not the true worship of the true God, which is in the Spirit and in the Truth, and which cnot be practised without it. Many more things might be said, as to prove the Worship of Christians now,  practised by them, is not the true Worship of the true God; but this is  which I have said, that which is practised without the Spirit of God, is not the true Worship of God, which must be in the Spirit, and cannot be practised without it; but such is the worship of Christians; for the Christians ow generally pray, some after one Form, and some after another, in their own wills and times, and know not the movings of the Spirit of the Father tereunto, nor guiding them therein, but in such a manner as they set unto themselves, or as the custom of the Country instructs them therein, and know not the intercession of the Spirit of the Father in them, nor know not the pray∣ing in the Holy Ghost: and as for the preaching of Christians, it is not now practised as the Christians of old practised it, nor by the same Spirit: now they study for what they speak, and gather out of the Scriptures; ome ha∣ving it written in a Book what they will preach to the people and this is not to preach as the spirit gives them utterance, neither is this from the teach∣ing or moving of the Spirit of God, but by humane Art, and humane Craft, knowing before-hand, what, and how much to speak, so much as they have collected in their thoughts from such a Verse, and how long to preach, till a Glass be run, and know what to have for preaching: and this, and such like,
is the manner of the Preaching now among Christians, which hath no savour in it of God's Spirit, or of the Teachings and Leadings of God's Spirit in it; but altogether contrary, to wit, This Practice savours of Idolatry, and of vain Tra∣ditions and Superstitions. And in short, This Practice of Preaching among the Christians now, is not in the same manner, neither by the same Spirit, nor for the same End, as the Preaching of the Christians was in the dayes of the Apostles; which sheweth, that the Christians now are Apostatized, and greatly Degenerated from what the Christians were then: For again, The Christian Ministers now do not go as they are moved of the Lord up and down, from Country to Country, to convert people to God, as the Christian Ministers did then: But enquire for places of great Maintenance, where there are great store of Tythes, and Set-Wages; and if they can, there they settle themselves, and preach in manner as I have said. And this practice savours nothing of the Teachings of the Spirit of God, nor of the Movings of that Spirit whereby the Christian Ministers of old were guided; which sheweth, that the Christian Ministers now are in the Apostacy, and in the Degeneration from God, and from what the Christi∣an Ministers were then. And as concerning the Practice of Singing no amongst Christians, it is not in the Spirit, nor with a good Understandi but in a vain Form and Tradition, and not in the Spirit of the Lor  now the Christians, many of them, in a Form sing the Conditions , as David's Prayers, and Praises, Troubles, and Afflictions; when as themselves are in a condition quite contrary to what David was, and so sing that which unto themselves is false, as being out of that condition of which they sing; and this is not singing with the Spirit, neither is it to sing spiritual Songs: And others of Christians have another manner of singing, all which singing of Christians now hath no sa∣vour of the Teachings of God's Spirit in it; neither is it according, nor by the same Spirit, as the singing of the Christians once was. A woful Apostacy is fallen upon you, ye Christians through the World, and you are fallen, you are fallen from the Life of Christ, and the true Pra of Christianity, as the first Christians were in; then their praying was in the Spi∣rit, and the holy Ghost; but now without the Spirit, in Forms and Traditions; Their Preaching then was as the Spirit led them, and as it gave them utterance; but now by humane Learning and Policy, at such a Place for so much a Year, an Hour by a Glass, what they have gathered by study upon other mens Works: Then the Singing of Christians was in the Spirit, and their whole Worship was spiritual, in the Spirit, and in the Truth; but the Singing of Christians now, and all their Worship, is in vain Traditions, exercis'd without the Leadings and Movings of the Spirit of God: Then the Worship of Christians was one, and by one. Spirit, now it is divers, and in division, and in many co∣trary spirits. Alas, oh ye Christians! consider how great is your Fall, and how wol your Degeneration, in respect of your Worship; fallen greatly from the teach∣ing of the Spirit of God, in your Praying, in your Preaching, and in your Singing, to follow humane Learning, and worldly Policy, and vain Traditi∣ons, the Customs of the Country, and your own Imaginations, in your Pray∣ing, Preaching, and Singing, as I have proved unto you. Oh consider how great is your Apostacy from the true Life of true Christia∣nity! Greatly do you err from the pure Way, wherein the true Christians walked, and being truly paralell'd with them, and measur'd with the Spirit of true Judgment, you are found not equal to them in any measure, but rather contrary altogether; shewing you are guided by another spirit then once the Christians were, and that you follow another Teacher then once they did; your Practices do make it manifest, which are contrary, and not according to what the Practice of the Christians once were: Is not my Judgment just upon you?
Have you not lost that, and are departed from it, which gave the Name of Christian; and so have the Name without the thing; a Profession of Chri∣stianity, but no true Title therein; but having lost that which gave the true Title to the Name? So that this is your state, and this is your Conditi∣on generally, ye Christians through the World; A Name you have of Christianity, but to the True Life thereof, in every Particular, are you dead. And now all ye Christians upon Earth, Behold, behold how you are fallen and degenerated in all these things, and many more, which might be named I Faln I say from the true Christian Life and Practice, wherein the Christians once were; shewing fully to all the World, that the Spirit of Christ doth not now guide you Christians, but another Spirit, which brings forth through you other Works and Fruits, and of another nature then what the Christians once brought forth; and being compared with them, you are no whit equal; in the very way and means, whereby you are made Christians, you differ from them, and in all your practices, and in life and conversation you are contrary to them: And in respect of your Worship and Ministry, in every part thereof, are you altogether contrary unto what the Christians once were; yea, in your very Apparel you shew a Degeneration from the true Life and Practice in Chri∣stianity, for the Apostle exhorted the Christians to adorn themselves in modest Apparel, with Shamefacedness and Sobriety; not with brodered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or costly Array, 1 Tim. 2. 9. And the Christians were there exorted, That eir Adorning should not be the outward plaiting of the Hair, or of wearing Gold, or putting  of Apparel. But now amongst ye Christians is a practice found quite contrary; What Vanity and Excess is in your Apparel, striving to excel one another in Pride and Vain-Glory, in your Gold, and Silver, and costly Array; spending the Creation of God to satisfie your lustful Minds; shewing another spi∣rit then was amongst the Christians of old, whose words and Name ye pfess, but are degenerated from the Life, in things of greater and less moment. Alas, alas! Oh wo is me for you! How is my spirit often oppressed in the remembrance of your woful Fall? What shall I say unto you but this? You are revolted, and gone away backward from the Way of Life; and you have altogether forgotten God; and are degenerated from Christ, the living Vine; and the Anger of the Lord is now greatly kindled against you, to consume you, and to confound you, because you are revolted and turned aside from the pure and perfect Way of God, which once was manifest amongst Christians. And your Back-sliding and Apostacy is truly compared to that of the Iews, who did retain the Name of the People of God, after they were turned aside from his Commandments; even as you do retain the Name of Christians, though you are departed from Christ: For the Iews had seen and known much of the Power, and Presence, and Hand of the Lord, in many great Victories and De∣liverances; and the Lord had chosen them above any other People at that day, to place his Name with them, and amongst them; and yet after all that, they forgot his wondrous Works, and rebell'd against him, and became a Stiff-neck∣ed and Hard-hearted people, much more then any other besides them; and they would not be instructed, nor reclaimed by the Voice of the Prophets, but smote them, and slew them; and when Christ their Saviour came, they would not re∣ceive him, nor walk in his Wayes; but crucified him, saying, They would not have t Man to reign over them. And to this, in every particular, are the Christians now found equal, and agreeing with Back-sliding Israel; for much of the Hand and Power of the Lord were the Christians made Partakers of; and the Lord wrought great De∣liverances for them, when they were few in number, and under heavy Yoaks and Bondage, through Persecution and cruel Dealing; yet then the Lord was
with them, and increased them greatly in number, and gave them Victory in a great measure over all their Enemies; but now are they revolted, even as the Iews, and have forgotten God, and greatly rebelled against him, and have turned his Love to their Lusts, abusing his Loving-kindness, and are become a stiff-necked and hard-hearted people, as ever were the Iews; and now you will not be instructed, nor reclaimed from the Error of your wayes; but abound in all manner of Unrighteousness, and will not hearken to the Voice of the Lord, nor return to him; but are a gainsaying people, and will not return unto him from whom you are fallen; but hate the Light which Christ has ligh∣tened you withal, neither will have Christ to reign over you, but crucifie the Life, as the Iews did. And as the Sacrifices, and Oblations, the Sabboth-keeping of the Iews, and all the Works of Righteousness, were an Abomination to the Lord, after they were departed from him; even the very practice of those things, which God had once commanded them to perform, became a Burden to the Lord, and his Soul could not away with them; even their New Moons and Sabboths his Soul hated, Isa. 1. and all their Sacrifices were, as if they cut off a Dogs Neck; and their Oblations, as if they offer'd Swine's-blood; and their burning Incense, as if they blessed an Idol, Isa. 66. I say, The very Practice of the Iews, after they were revolted, and be∣come disobedient Children in those very things which God had commanded them to do and practice, and which once the Lord accepted the doing of by his People; yet after they were turned aside from the leading of his Spirit, the practice of the very same Works were hateful in the sight of the Lord; when they performed Works of Righteousness to him, and yet their Hearts went af∣ter their Covetousness, and their practizing of that which God had once com∣manded to be done, their doing of it was Idolatry, and was a Burden to the Lord's Soul; and their Righteousness, and all their Practices therein, were as filthy Rags, even loathsom in his Presence, when their Fear towards him was taught them by the precepts of men, and they had lost that pure Fear, which  was taught them of God; but they were gone from his Fear, which should have kept their Hearts clean; and their Hears were defiled and poluted, and therefore not any of their Performances to him could be accepted, but were altogether be∣come an Abomination. And even thus is it at this day, as concerning the Sacrifices and Performan∣ces of Christians; being (as I have said, and made manifest) departed from the Lord, and from the Spirt of Christ: All their Prayings, and Preachings, and Singings, their Baptisms, and Breaking of Bread, and even all that which you perform as unto God, as the Worship of him, is not accepted, but Abomina∣tion unto him; and his Soul is burdened with all these things, you not being led with the Spirit of Christ: And even your practizing of these things, which the Saints and Christians once practiced, and were accepted of the Lord in so doing, while they were led by the Spirit of Christ; I say, The very practice of those things now by the Christians, being degenerated, is become Idolatry, and Abomination to the Lord. And this I declare in the Fear and Presence of the Lord, Even all your Praying, and Preachings, and Profession, all your Sabboth-keeping, and Set-dayes of Humiliation, and even all your Practices of Religion, which you do and perform, are Idolatry, and a Burden to the Lord's Soul, in the state that now you stand, not being led by the Spirit of Christ, but being from it departed; and your works not brought forth by it, but by another spirit. And now saith the Lord unto you Christians (who are degenerated from the Spirit of Christ) To what purpose is your Preaching, Praying and Singing? They are a Vexation and Burden to the Righteous Soul, and the Lord hath no delight therein; away with it, away with it: Your Profession and Practices
stincks in the Nostrils of the Lord: All your Baptisms and your Sacraments, which ye perform in a vain Tradition▪ and not by the Spirit of the Lord, they are hateful in his sight; away with them, away with them; they shall crumble to the dust, and immediate Desolation in one day; the Lord will break them down, and never build them up again. Your Preaching by a Glass, for so much a Sermon, or so much a Year, what you have gathered out of Books▪ and studied for from other mens words; town with it, down with it; it is  Abomination to the Lord. And your Ministry, which is made and sent forth at Schools; and  natural Learning, through the attainment of such Arts and Sciences, and being approved of such and such men, and sent forth to such and such a Par  have so much Money by the Year for preaching what hath been studied fo and not by the Gift of the Holy Ghost; away with this Ministry, away with it; its a mocking of God, and a deceiving of Souls; the Lord will confound it, and bring it to Destruction. And your singing of the Saints words in Rhyme and Meeter, and their Conditions, which your selves never knew; this is Abomination to the Lord, and a Practice which his Soul hater; away with it, the Lord is risen to confound it. Away with all your Worship, which is not in the Spirit, nor in the Truth; but in vain Tra∣ditions of , practiced by you in a vain Form, and not the Power of God: The Lord will being it down to the ground, & restore and establish his own Wor∣ship, which  in Spirit and in Truth; and he will give, and hath given his Mi∣nistry again by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, which hath been lost for many Ages, while this Night of Apostacy hath over-spread the World; and the Lord shall  longer be worshipped in vain Traditions of men, but his people shall be re∣red and renewed, to worship him in Spirit and Truth; and the Christian ife shall again be brought forth, and the Spirit of Christ shall be the Leader and Teacher of his People: And now the Day of the Lord's Visitation is again revived, for togather his People, and to restore them again to his perfect Way and Worship. Therefore hearken, and behold, ye Christians, this is the Testimony of the Lord erning you; You have been fallen and degenerated from the Life of Righteousness, and from the true Way and Worship of the true God; and you have long been slumbring and sleeping in this long Night of Darkness, which overshadow'd you, and darkned that glorious Appearance of the  of God▪ which once shined upon the Christians; and in Blindness and D have  walked for many Ages, and your Worship hath been subscribed; To the Unknown God; and wofully have you been wallowing in unclean Paths; and you have erred, you have erred from the Life of Christ, and from his Spirit; and you are gone from your Husband, and follow'd other Lovers; and you have been ed in Iniquity, and altogether poluted by Transgtession; and the state in which you now stand, is a state seperated from God, a state of great Ig∣nora and Darkness, and a state of hainous Rebellion against God, whose Soul and Spirit is greatly oppressed and grieved because of your Degeneration, who  become more ignorant of God, then the Ox is of his Owner, o the Ass of his Master's Crib; and even the very same Vision is seen concerning you, as the Prophet saw concerning Israel. Therefore hear oh Heavens, and give ear oh Earth; for the Lord doth speak unto you Christians: I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have rebell'd against me; and the Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Master's Crib, but the Christians do not know, the People do not consider. Ah! sinful Nation, a people laden with Iniquity, a seed of Evil-doers, Chil∣dren that are corrupted, that have forsaken the right Way, and provoke the Living God to Anger, and ye are gone away backward; the whole Head is sick, the whole Heart is faint, and from the sole of the Foot, even unto the Head there is no Soundness; but your Conditions are Wounds, and Bruises, and fying Sores; you are not closed, neither bound up, neither mollified
with Oyent; and your Country is desolate; and your Cities are burnt as with Fire▪ your Land Strangers devour it in your presence; and it is desolate, and overthrown by Strangers: and but that the Lord of Hosts has left us a soul Remnant, even a Seed, ye Christians would have been as Sodom; if any man hath an Ear to hear, let him hear: This Vision is as true unto you Christians, throughout all the World, as ever it was unto the seed of the Iews: This is your state, and this is your condition, and thus ye stand in the sight of the Lord, though in your beginning (in the beginning of Christianity I mean) the Lord brought up the Christians, and nourished them by his Living Word, and with his Word he cherished them, and they grew unto a goodly state, and were ∣pleat in Christ, Col. 2. 10. And they were come to the  of st Men made per∣fect; and unto Mount Sion, the  of the Living God, the Hly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the general Assembly and Church of the First-Born, which are written in Heaven; and to God, the Iudge of all, Hebrews 12, 22, 23, 24. TO this state were the Christians nourished and brought up, in the dayes when they were first brought forth, when they were begotten and born again of the immortal Word, that abides forever; and they were sanctified, and purified, and made clean; unto this were they nourished, and brought up out of Darkness, and from under the shaddow of Death. But notwithstanding this, the Christians now have rebell'd against the Lord, and do rebel against him: And though the Lord hath been unto them as an Owner to the Ox, and as a Crib to the Ass; even as thus hath the Lord been unto the Christians, yet they know it not, neither do the Christians consider; but are indeed grown sinful, and laden with Iniquity; and the feed of Evil-doers brings sorth its fruit through Christians, being become children that are Corrupters, having forsaken the Lord, and his Way, which was made mantfest in the dayes of the Apostles, and the Lord is greatly provoked; for the Christians are gone back∣ward, from what they were in their beginning, as I have fully made manifest: And this Vision of the Lord is unto you, all ye Christians, even as a  that is of the most precious Seed, and the most noble Vine that is planted in a good S at is digged, and dressed, and grown to a goodly stature, and bring∣ing th some acceptable Fruit unto the good Husbandman, for a season; yet this Tree becomes blasted by an unwholesome Air, and becomes degenerate from its vertue, and property and nature; and becomes a wild Vine, and a Pla of great Disgrace, ceasing to bring forth any good Fruit, and becomes fruitful i all evil, and the Labour of the good Husbandman is lost; for, while he loo for good Fruit, nothing appears, but Fruit of an evil Taste, which is altoge∣ther loathsome unto the good Husbandman. This Parable is unto you Christi∣ans, and this is your state and your condition; Therefore behold, What shall the Lord do unto this Tree? Shall he nor cut it down to the ground, and call it into the purging Fire? Shall he not lay his Ax to the Root, and cause all its Branches utterly to wither, and cause it to cease in beeing, even as it hath cea∣sed in bringing forth Fruit? Shall not the go Husbandman destroy this , with all its corrupt fruit? And shall not his own Hand accomplish the Purpose of his own Heart? This Tree shall be Fuel for this Fire of his Anger; he will pluck it up, and not plant it again, because it is degenerated. Give ear, all ye Christians, to the Testimony which is concerning you, You are fallen, you are fallen; and being compared to what the Christians were, you are in  equal, but are diverted in all your Practices, from that Spirit which led the Apostles  Christian Churches; and your works shew another Spirit, then the Spirit of Iesus▪ Wherefore great is your Fall, and to be lamented; and though you have the name of Chri∣stians, yet you want the Life.
An Objection. But whereas it may be objected by some, and said, Seeing the State of Christianity is thus descovered, what it was in its beginning and purity, and what it now is in its degeneration; and seeing the present State of Christians is thus condemned, what do I believe concerning the state of Christianity to come? What shall succeed this present Degeneration? And may it be expected, that ever Christianity shall be restor'd to that state of Purity, as it was in its beginning? And whether may people expect to come in∣to the same Life again, and to know the same power, and Worship and Unity, which was amongst the Apostles and first Christian Churches? And whether do I judge, that ever the Ministry can again be receiv'd by the Gift of the holy Spirit only, without natural Learning and Languages? And whether the same Spirit is to be waited for, and receiv'd? And whether the same Anointing can be known in this Age, or any Age to come, as it was in and among the Apostles and Christians, before the Apostacy and Degeneration. Answ. To all this I answer, and do say, That the present state of Christiani∣ty is woful, and to be condemned of the Lord, as being degenerated from his Life, Power and Spirit; whereby all hearts are darkened, and all minds estran∣ged from the Covenant of Life and Peace, and from the sence and feeling of the Life of God: and now in all the Wayes, and Worships, and Practices of Christians, they are fallen and degenerated from that Life in which the Christi∣ans once were; and the Beast hath raigned over all for many Ages; and be∣cause of his Power, and Greatness and Dominion, who hath been able to make war with him? he hath killed the Saints, and hath subjected all Nations under his power; and every Nation hath received the Mark of the Beast, and born his Image for Generations; and all Flesh hath stagger'd, and hath been made drunk with the cup of Fornication, that hath been in the hand of the Whore, who hath sate upon this Beast, who hath caused both small and great to worship him; and all that would not, he hath had power to kill them. And this Government hath ruled over the whole Christendom, and the Worship practiced hath been but the Worship of the Beast, while peo∣ple have been err'd from the Spirit of Christ, and not guided by it on∣ly: And people have been compelled to Worship by Laws of Men; they have been compelled to sprinkle their Infant,; and they have been compel∣led to go to Steeple-houses; and compelled to keep a Sabboth; and com∣pelled to hire Priests, and to pay them Wages against their wills; And all this compelling by an outward Power hath not been the Worship of God, but savour'd altogether of the Worship of the Beast; for you may read, Rev. 13. 12, 15, 16, 17. how the Beast caused all, both Small and Great, to worship him; and all that would not worship him by his power, he hath had power to kill them. And all compelling, and causing to worship by an outward Power, is the worship of the Beast, for Christ, nor his Apostles, never caused any to worship God by an outward power: For while Christianity kept its Purity and Authority, they begot People to God, and to worship him, by the Word of God, and by the power of the Spirit; and they did not bring any into their Sect, nor to worship with them, by an outward Law and Authority; for that is in the Government of the Beast; it was he that first caused both small and great to conform to his worship, and it is his power that upholds it, and maintains it unto this day. But now the Seed of God is arising, which is able to make war with the Beast and his Kingdom, and his Worship shall be thrown down to the ground; and all this causing and compelling to Worship; causing to keep a Day; and causing to hire Teachers, to maintain them; and this causing to go to Steeple-houses, and to maintain them; and all this causing to pay Tythes; it shall fall to the ground, and be beat down by the Seed of God, which is arising, and they shall be no more found among true Christians; nor the Beast shall not be worshipped, nor his Authority any more of force; for the Day of the Lord
hath now appeared, and the Light is sprung forth, which hath made all things manifest, and now the difference is known, between the worship of the Beast, and the worship of the true God. And concerning the state of Christianity to come, this I know and believe, a glorious Restoration thereof shall appear throughout the whole Christendom, and Christianity shall again be restored to its former purity; and Christians shall, and may receive the same Spirit from which the Christians have been degenerated; and the same Life, the same Power, and the same Worship, and Unity shall be revived amongst Christians in the Restoration; even the same that was in the beginning before the Apostacy; and the Glory of God shall again appear among his people, and they shall again worship him in Spirit and in Truth only, as they did before the Apostacy; and all this traditional worship, and false imitations which hath been set up since the Apostles dayes, shall be overthrown and confounded; the Lord is risen, and will dash down, and overthrow all this Idolatry now practized amongst Christians: And a great shaking and confounding shall suddenly come among Christians; for the Lord will break down that which hath been builded, because it is polluted; and he will pluck up that which hath been planted, be∣cause it is defiled; and a mighty work will the Lord work in the Earth, the Kingdoms of this World will he change into the Kingdoms of Christ, and Christ shall reign in and among his People; and his Spirit shall be the Teacher and Leader of his People; and all false Teachers will the Lord confound and consume; all these Hirelings who go for Gifts and Rewards, and all this man∣ner of Preaching and Teaching, which are come up since the Apostles dayes; all this Preaching which they study for, and by a Glass, and for so much Money a year, all this shall be tumbled down into the Pit: God's Ven∣geance shall come upon it all, and the Anointing shall be received, and it shall dwell in People, as it did in the Apostles; and the people shall need no other Teacher, but as that Anointing teacheth all things; and for this Spirit and Anointing all that fear God may wait to receive it in this present Age; which Spirit brings into the same Unity and Life, into the same Worship and Fellowship that was amongst Christians in the beginning, before the Apostacy; and this State may Christians be restored to; and for this State all that fear God, and love him, are to wait; for this shall come to pass in the World. And as concerning the Ministry, I know, and do believe it may be, and is re∣ceived again, as the Apostles and Christian Ministers first received it, to wit, by the eternal Spirit and Gift thereof, through the Revelation of Christ Jesus in them: and such may and do preach the Gospel freely, as they do receive is free∣ly, and without natural Learning and Languages. For by that can none be made Ministers of Christ, nor by any thing with∣out the Gift of the holy Spirit; and Christ's Ministry shall again be received thereby; this I believe: and all this Ministry made, and sent forth by natural Learning, and without the Gift of the holy Spirit, the Lord will confound it in this Age; for this is come up since the Apostles dayes, to make Ministers by natural Learning, and it stands in the Apostacy, from the Life and Spirit of Christ, and its call, and work, and maintenance savours not of the Kingdom of Christ, and the Lord will bring it down, and the Gift of his Ministry, will he restore by his Spirit; and this is, and shall come to pass, and it may be waited for in this present Age; and the Lord will restore his Ministry, as in the beginning, and his work shall be glorious; for many there are, is, and shall be converted to God, and brought out of the degenerati∣on, and to that shall people come which all Christendom hath been apostatized from, and shall receive the same Spirit, and the same Anointing which was amongst the Christian Churches; and life and immortality shall again be brought to light through the Gospel, which hath been hid for Ages while darkness hath been over the minds of people.
And I say and testifie before all the World, That Christianity shall be restored to its former state; Life shall spring forth; and Truth shall be encreased; and Faith shall wax strong, even the same Faith that the Apostles had, which gave them Victory over all the World, which shall again give People the same Vi∣ctory; and this shall be known in the Earth. For the Marriage of the Lamb shall come, and all his People shall be joyn'd unto him; and there shall be one Way, and one Worship, and one Teacher; and every one shall sit under Christ's Vine, and none shall make afraid: Yea, and more then a Vine shall he be known, and more then a Door, and more then a Shepherd shall he be known to be to his People, and greater then a Rock shall he be witnessed to be, and more then a Teacher in the Wilderness: If any man have an Ear to hear, let him ; more and greater is he becoming to his People, then is lawful yet to utter: Eye hath not seen, nor it hath not entred into the Heart of man; but it is revealed to us by his Spirit. The joyful Day is approaching, the Lamb's Wife is making her self ready; the Wedding Garment is putting on, and all that which is polluted is to be done away: And Blessed is he that cometh to the Marriage of the Lamb, that he may become one Spirit with the Creatr. Here is Glory and Rejoycing forever, when this is known, That the Wife hath not power over her own Body, but the Husband; nor hath the Husband power over his own Body, but the Wife: Where this is known, Death is swallowed up of Life, and Sin is overcome of Righ∣teousness, and the Inheritance of Life Eternal comes to be possessed, and Death and Hell is cast into the Lake, and he which hath deceived can deceive no more; And blessed is the Eye that sees this, and the Heart that under∣standeth. Wherefore all ye Christians upon Earth, Awake, awake, and put away your Whoredoms, cast off your Idolatries, and strip you, and make you clean of all your Adulteries; drink no longer of the Cup of Fornication, nor eat no lon∣ger of the Abominable Flesh, nor wear no longer your Garments of Unrighte∣ousness; but strip ye, strip ye, make ye bare; all your old Garments must be put off, before you can appear before the Lord. A great Work will the Lord work amongst you; he will shake and over∣throw all your Altars. Images and Idols, which you have set up and worshipped; The Lord hath uttered his Voice; the Beast that hath many Heads and many Horns shall tremble; and one Head, and one Horn only shall be exalted, and the Government shall be set up, of whose encrease there shall be no end; and peo∣ple shall be brought into that, and they shall go forth no more; for who come to this, Time is no longer, and the Kingdom and Government is delivered to the Father, and he is become all in all. And all that ever come to know these things, must first come to the Light of the Lamb in them, with which every man is lightned that cometh into the World: And all that ever know these things, must first be brought to the Principle of God in them, which they have transgressed against. And all that own the Light of Christ, and walk in it, shall come to know these things, which to know, and be in them, is eternal Life. Therefore all ye Christians, come to the Light which Christ hath lightned you withal, and that will let you see the Government of Satan, and of sin and death, which has been ruling in you; and the Light will teach you to war against it, till it be subdued; the Light will discover unto you that nature, in which the king∣dom of Satan bears rule; it will let you see the Devil, who is the Prince of dark∣ness, who is the Adversary of God, who is out of the Truth, and he has drawn all people out of the Truth; but if you love the Light of Christ in you, it will teach you to war against him, and against all that that is out of the Truth; for all that is of Satans Kingdom, that is out of the Truth, and must be destroy'd by the com∣ing
of the Kingdom of Christ; whose coming is in the Light, which Christ hath enlightned every man withal; who comes to destroy the Devil, and his kingdom, and all his works: So to the Light must all minds be turned, which will reveal the kingdom of the Man of Sin, and consume it: The Appearance of Christ is Light; and Christ is the Light of Israel, which is as a Fire, to consume all fruit∣less Trees, which cumber the ground, which the Lord will consume by the bright∣ness of his coming. And now is the Man of Sin reveal'd, even in the hearts of Christians, so call'd; and he hath long shew'd himself to be God; but now the Lord will bring him down: For, Antichrist has rul'd for many Ages, and the Lord of Life has been crucified in spiritual Sodom; but Sodom shall be consumed by Fire; and the Lord will avenge himself of all his Enemies; and all People and Nations shal know, that there is a God, who executes Justice and true Judgment, who is a God near at hand, to reward his People with Everlasting Life; and to give unto his Ene∣mies, Judgment and Condemnation.

A DECLARATION To all the WORLD Of our Faith; And what we believe, who are called, QUAKERS. And this is written, that all People upon Earth may know by whom, and how we are saved, and hope for Eternal Life, and what we believe concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit; and of the things that are Eternal, appertaining to all Mankind to know and believe. Concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit, thus we believe▪ FIRST That there is only one true God, who is a Spirit; and his Pre∣sence filleth Heaven and Earth; and he is Eternal and Everlasting▪ the Creator and Preserver of all things; that Heaven and Earth, and all things therein by him were framed and brought forth; and all things in unto this day by his Power; and whatsoever he willeth in Heaven and Earth▪ he ings to pass by his Word and Power. And we believe, That this God only is, and ought to be feared, loved, obeyed and worshipned by all Creatures; and no other thing besides  in Heaven and Earth. A we believe, That his Worship, and Obedience, and Fear and Love is to be given in Spirit, even in what his own Spirit moveth and leadeth his Peo∣ple unto. And we believe, His true Worship, required and accepted of him,  not by the Tradition of men, in outward Observances, or Set-dayes, o Places; but he is worshipped only in Spirit d Trth, without respect of Time, ces or things; and that none can worship m in Righteousness, but his n, who are born of his Spirit, and are led and guided thereby. And we believe, That this God hath given his Son Christ J  e World, a free Gift unto the whole World; and that every  that co∣eth into the World is lighted by him, that every man mi    sayed. And we believe. That he is given into the World, and no Nation▪  or Pople excepted; but unto all Mankind is he given of God, and
them, and every man through the World, that believeth in him, and receiveth Christ, who is the Wisdom and Power of the Father, shall be saved with eternal' Salvation; and every one that believeth not in him, shall be dam∣ned, and shall possess everlasting Misery. And we believe, That Salvation, Iustification, and Sanctification, are only in him, and wrought by him, and no other: for there is no other Name given under Heaven, but hm alone, by which Salvation is. And we believe, All that receive him, and believe in him, are recond to God, and are made alive to God, to live to him in all things, an do receive the Forgiveness of Sins, and are set free from all Unrighteousness, and from the Body of Sin and Death, and have the Witness of the Spirit in them; and the Spirit of the Father they, have received, and it witnesseth in them of the Father and of the Son, and of the things that belong unto their Peace; and it is the Earnest of the Inheritance, and the Seal of the Promise of Eternal Life, and by it are the deep things of God revealed to Mankind, and by it the Father and the Son dwells in the Saints, and by it have they Fellowship one with mother; and the Father, Son, and Spirit are one. And this we faithfully believe. Again, concerning Christ, we believe,. That he is one with the Father, and was with him before the World was; and what the Father worketh  is by the Son; for he is the Arm of God's Salvion, and the very Power and Wisdom of the Creator; and was, is, and is to come, without Beginning or End. And we believe, That all the Prophets gave Testimony of him, and that he was made manifest in Iudea and Ierusalem, and did the Work of the Father, and was persecuted of the Iews, and was crucified by his Enemies; and that he was buried, and rose again, according to the Scrip∣tures. And we believe, He is now ascended on High, and exalted at the Right-hand of the Father for evermore; and that he is glorified with the same Glory, that the had before the World was; and that even the same that came down fro Heaven, is ascended up to Heaven; and the same that descended is he that ascended. And we believe, Even that he that was dead is alive; and lives for evermore; and that he cometh, and shall come again, to judge the whole World wi Righteousness, and all people with Equity, and shall give to every man according to his deeds, at the Day of Judgment when all shall arise to Condemnation  Iustification; he that hath done good shall receive Life, and he that hath done evil everlasting Condemnation. And we believe, He is to be waited for in Spirit, to be known after the Spi∣rit, as he was before the World was; and that is the Knowledge unto eternal Life, which all that believe in him do receive; and he subdues Death, and de∣stroyes him that hath the power of it; and restoreth from Death to Life, and quickeneth by his spirit all that the Father hath given him: and we believe such he justifieth and sanctifieth, and such are taught of him; but he condemns all that believe not, but continue in unbelief, and are not taught or him. And this we faithfully believe. And we believe, That unto all people upon the face of the whole Earth, is a Time and Day of Visitation given, that they may return and be saved by Christ Jesus, who is givn of the Father to call the worst of men to Repentance; and the most ungodly of Sinners are convinced by him of their ungodly deeds, that they might believe, and be converted and saved. And we believe, Herein is the Love of God manifested to all Mankind; and   are shut out by him before they were born into the World; but unto all men is a Vation given, and they that do perish it is because they do not believe in
Christ; and destruction is of a mans self, but Salvation is of God, through be∣lieving in his Son, who takes away sin, and reneweth into his own Image, that they may become Heirs with him. And we believe that there is a Crown of Eternal Glory, and an Inheritance of Eternal Life to be injoyed for evermore by all that believe, and are chosen of God; and that there is an everlasting Misery and Destruction to be possessed by all that believe not, but continue in the state of Reprobation, and are not chan∣ged from the wayes of Sin and Death; but walk after the wayes of their own Hearts Lusts, fulfilling the will of the Flesh, in the Evil of this World, and follow not Christ, the Light of the World, that they may be saved: And we believe upon all such the Wrath of God abideth, and that they have no part in the Inheri∣tance of God. And we believe, That it is only he that is born again of the Spirit, and that walks after the Spirit, who is changed from Death to Life, and who is redeemed out of the World, and all its wayes; such only must inherit the Kingdom of God, and they only have right thereunto, and none besides, even they that are wash∣ed and cleansed from all Unrighteousness by the Blood of Jesus, by which their sins are remitted; For his Blood cleanseth from all Unrighteousness and Sin; yea, all such that walk and abide in the Light, which Christ Jesus hath lightened the World withal. And we believe, That the Saints upon Earth may receive forgiveness of sins, and may be perfectly freed from the Body of sin and death, and in Christ may be perfect and without sin, and may have Victory over all Temptations by Faith in Christ Jesus And we believe, Every Saint, that is called of God, ought to press after Per∣fection, and to overcome the Devil and all his Temptations upon Earth; and we believe, they that faithfully wait for it shall obtain it, and shall be presented without sin in the Image of the Father; and such walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit, and are in Covenant with God, and their Sins are blotted out, and remembred no more; for they cease to commit Sin, being born of the Seed of God. And we believe, The Gospel of Christ is the Power of God unto Salvati∣on, and that it ought to be preached freely unto all people, and Christ to be held forth unto all Mankind, by the Ministry sent of him: And we believe this Mini∣stry is received by the Gift of the Holy Ghost; and all they that receive it, are lawfully call'd to the Ministry; and they may preach the Gospel of Christ freely, as they have receiv'd it freely: And this Ministry is not of Man, but of God, and is made powerful to the converting of Sinners, and to the bringing of people to God, and to the Knowledge of his Wayes. And we do not believe, That any man is a Minister of Christ, without the Gift of the Holy Ghost; or that the Gospel can be receiv'd by natural Learning or Education. And we believe, Such as preach for Hire, and have Hire for preaching, are not the lawful called Ministers of the Gospel of Christ; such as are Proud, and High-minded, and Covetous Men, who do not profit the people at all; such as have run, and never were sent of Christ, who calleth by his Spirit into the Work of the Ministry; and as every one hath received the Gift of that, his Spirit, so he may administer to others. Concerning Rulers and Governour, we believe, That there ought to be Ru∣lers and Governours in every Nation, City, Country and Town; and they ought to be such men as fear God, and hate every evil way; who will judge for God, and not for man; and will judge righteously, equally and justly, and will give true and sound Judgment unto all men, without Bribery, or Respect of Persons, not regarding the Rich above the Poor; but being a Praise unto all that do well, and a Terror to all Evil-doers whatsoever; having knowledge in the pure Law of God, and themselves continnally exercised therein. And we be∣lieve, That every Law of man ought to be grounded upon the Law of God, pure
Reason, and Equity being the Foundation thereof, that God's Witness in every man may answer to it: and the Law ought to be known unto all people, before Trangression be charged or punished in any man. And we believe that every Transgression ought to be punished according to its nature; and that the Pu∣nishment exceed not the greatness of the Transgression; neither ought any Trans∣gressor to ape unpunished; neither ought any upon false Suspition or Iealou∣sies, to be caused to suffer, without the Testimony of true men, or the Confession of the Party. And we believe, that the Executors of the Law ought to be Just Men, and not given to Pride, Drunkenness, or any other Evil whatsoever; and ought to be chosen every year, or otherwise, by the Consent of the people; and that no man be stopped of his free choyce, except justly taxed. And we believe, that all Governours and Rulers ought to be accountable to the people, and to the next proceeding Rulers, for all their Actions, which may be enquir'd into upon occasion; and that the chiefest of the Rulers be subject under the Law, and punish∣able by it, if they be Transgressors, as well as the poorest of the People: And th true Judgment and Justice will be brought forth in the Earth, and all that do well will have Praise, and live in Rest and Peace; and all Evil-doers whatsoever may stand in awe, and be afraid of God, and just Men, and the Execution of Iust Laws. Concerning Religion, we believe, That it is only the Spirit of the Lord that makes men truly Religious; and that no man ought to be compell'd to, or from any Exercise or Practice in Religion, by any outward Law or Power, but eve∣ry man ought to be left free, as the Lord shall perswade his own mind, in doing, or leaving undone this, or the other Practice in Religion; and every man, of what Profession in Religion soever, ought to be protected in Peace, provided him∣self be a man of Peace, not seeking the wrong of any mans Person or Estate. And we believe, That to oppose false Opinions, and unsound Doctrines and Principles, seeking to convince them that oppose themselves, by Exhortation, or sharp Reproof, by word or writing, ought nor to be counted a Breach of the Peace; or to strive about the things of the Kingdom of God, by men of contrary Minds or Judgments, this ought not to be punishable by the Magistrates and their Laws; for we believe, the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are only to preserve mens Persons and Estates, and not to preserve men in Opinions; neither ought the Law of the Nation to be laid upon mens Consciences, to bind them to, or from such a Judgment or Practice in Religion: And we believe, that Christ is, and ought only to be Lord and Exerciser of mens Consciences; and his Spirit only must lead into all Truth. And we believe, That Obedience and Subjection in the Lord belongs to Superi∣ors, and that Subjects ought to obey in the Lord those that have Rule over them; and that Children ought to obey their Parents, and Wives their Husbands, and Servants their Masters, in all things which are according to God, which stands in the exercise of a pure Conscience towards God: But where Rulers, Parents, or Masters, or any other, command or require subjection in any thing which is con∣trary to God, or not according to him, to such causes all people are free, and ought to obey God rather then man: and we believe, That herein God will ju∣stifie them, being guided and led by his Spirit in all that which is Good, and out of all that which is Evil. Again, We believe concerning Election and Reprobation, That there is a state of Election, and a state of Reprobation, a state chosen of God, and a state re∣jected of God, and that all Man-kind are in one of these states; all that are ele∣cted, are elected in Christ; and all that are out of him are in the state Reprobate, bringing forth fruits of Death and Darkness, being Children of Wrath and Disobedience, in the alienation and separation from God, in the Transgression, unreconcil'd to God, the Enmity ruling in the Heart, being in the Fall, and not restor'd to God again, but ignorant of his Power, and of his Wisdom, having the Understanding darkened, that they cannot see nor perceive the things that are Eternal; and in this condition his best Works are Sin, and whatsoever he
doth, he cannot be accepted of God; for he is dead to God, and alive to all evil, binging forth all his works out of that Ground which is cursed. This is the condition of all Mankind upon the face of the Earth, in the first Ad, and this is the state of Reprobation; and all that abide herein are rejected of God, and ll never inherit eternal Life, but go in Perdition; yet have all such a Day of Visitation, that they may return out of the state of Reprtion;   ledge, and dessing the Love of God, ey con i he  ,   Wrath of Gd abides upon them. t they tt   of God,    Wrath; for they believe in the Light, and bec ldren of the Light, and are renewed in Mind and H, and recei the Love of the Fa∣ther, and become planted into Christ, the second Ad,  are   him to bring forth Fruit nto the Father, and ll their Fruit   om  grd which is ssed; for they are led by the Spirit of th Far; and ch are in the state of Election, who are ade Hers with Christ   Eve Inheri∣tance, that never fades away. And this we faithfully believe, That cy is not shewed to the Reprobate, nor Judgment to them that are chosen of God. And this is to go abroad in the World, that all pple m    , and wh  have receiv'd of God; and they that believe this, and walk ,      Father shall be saved; but they that beliee ,       be condemned, because they do not believe.    be tten,  in rt, this is given forth, by one that hath believed and received the Knowledge of thse things from God, A Friend unto all People, E. B.
Some of the  PRINCIPLES OF THE QUAKERS (Scornfully so called by men) VINDICATED, And proved Sound, and True, and according to the SCRIPTURES: In Opposition to the False Charges, and Lying Reports, given forth against the Truth, in two Printed Books; put forth by one Philip Taverner, a supposed Minister of the Gospel, in Middlesex near Uxbridge. And hereby Truth is Manifested and Discovered, and the Controversie determined by the Judgment of Truth, between Philip Taverner aforesaid, the Accuser, and Edward Burroughs, De∣fendant of the Truth, who contends for the Faith of the Gospel, and for the Word of God in the Heart, against all such Gainsayers, as have the Form of Godliness, but deny the Power; and many such are in this Age. WHereas P. Taverner, one of Truth's Opposers (whether thro Ignorance or Subtilty, I now determine not) hath again ap∣pear'd against me and the Truth in Print, as in Vindication of himself, and his former Work; who about four Moneths ago, gave a false Relation of a Dispute; but instead of mending the matter, he hath made his own cause the more vile, as may appear to such who take a perfect view of the Proceedings from the beginning to the end thereof: Now the intent of this my Reply is to clear the Truth further, and to take off his false Aspersions, which he hath cast upon my innocent words in my former Book, in answer to his first. And as for the rest of his Book, which hath no relation to mine, nor to the Dispute, I shall pass it by. The Title of my first Book was, Something of Truth Made Manifest, &c. To which sayst thou, A plausible Title to cover a Railing and Bitter spirit under, that it may walk in the World less suspected, &c.
Reply, My words are truth; for in  ok Truth was made ifest to y in relation to the former Dispute, to the Satisfaction of many: and as  ing an erness of spirit, I do deny; only I am zealo for the  Truth▪ to speak plainly, by reproving them that gain-say it; and to   God in every mans Conscience  I desire to be manifest, and seek not  wor to cov E, th  may not be s  ou  y to  t: but let all my Enemies sct wat th ill;  of     to stand approved, and no of man  for  ew inrd    of man, but of God: And as for railing Language, and   inst thee, I have used none, but spoke the truth in Plain∣ness. ing thou est to st at, is, where I sd [I suppose thou   d thy self Mr. Philip Tavern.] nd ou now  to hide  s from the force of my words to the sight of the World  appears  to ke upon thee with some Shame; and thou sayest, Th  not pre∣ Mr. before thy Name, but the Stationer did it; who (sayst ou) w pleased to   Man with that Title, &c. Rep. No instead of clearing himself, he hath shewed moe guilt of Ambi∣tion,  efore; and my words were, [I supposed] and not an absolute   saith; and had not I good Reason to suppose it,   was his An, being also contrary to the express Command of Christ, Mat. 23.  ineed, I hardly ever read any Superscription like to it, by the greatest   of men, as men accoun; and it is a thing far above Humility,   ming any man, much less one that professeth himself to be a  of Christ, to subscribe himself, o be with his consent, Mr. such an   seems to cover himself from Ambition, because saith he, he did it  himself, but another; I say, I shall not charge him here with Falshood; but I   it is very unusual for any man to add any thing to another mans Book, without his knowledge; I never knew it done by any Stationer, who hath had  knowledge of their Wayes: but yet he acknowledges it was done in Ho∣nour to him, to subscribe him Master; and here he hath justified the thing; and , that he is indeed guilty of Ambition, who confesseth, that it is an  to him, to be subscribed Mr. by another; for he saith, The Man that   Honoured him with that Title: And here men may take notice what Honour is my Adversary looks after, even the Honour that Christ forbiddeth, who   his Ministers, Be not ye called of men Masters; but the man hath honour∣  Taverner with titling him Mr. as he saith. T next thing treated proves also that he is Ambitious; for he plead much the lawfulness of Titles, of Civil Respects, as he calls it; and this is all to justi∣ the Title of Master to himself, and thereupon hath wrested divers Scriptures:  though the Unbelieving Greeks used the word, Master, or Sir, Ioh 2.  e hath quoted, is this an Example sufficient for Christians to break the and of Christ? Mat. 23. 10. Neither are any other Scriptures a Warrant  thy man so to do; though for a whole Page he treats only as for the lawful∣ of ch Titles, yet in the end would shut guilt from his own Door, that he  not Titles; for he saith, This he speaks not that he would have it so done to . And this his seeming to justifie himself proves himself guilty, know∣ing that he had given truly occasion for People to judge he would have it so; and in the end would blind the minds of the Simple with words of seeming Humi∣lity, that he would not have it so done to him, as if he cared not for it. And whereas I said in my first [That I am without any Prejudice towards the man (viz.) P. T.] He saith, I must give him leave to question it; first, from my Rail∣ing Words against him; secondly, from my Scornful Pitty expressed, &c. (saith he.) Rep. I have no Prejudice against him, God is my Witness; and he may que∣ what he will, who is in the Unbelief; for its manifest by his former, that
he questions where he hath no just occasion, shewing much prejudice in himself, for he said in his first Relation, commenting upon some of my words, If by such words I meant so, then it was truth; but if I meant so, then it was false: And  not this a perfect sign of prejudice in him, who had not just occasion to except against the words as they lay; nor could not condemn them, but upon giving his own Interpretation of them first? Whereupon I said in my first Answer, p. 14. [Alas poor man! must I be judged upon thy own Meaning, &c.] and yet in  words I shewed no scornful Pitty to him, though he falsly supposeth it, and s it; and so while he cannot believe that I am without Prejudice against him,  hath shewed himself guilty of prejudice towards me and my words, to be see, and justly believed by many. And whereas he sait, Its doubtful how I own the Authority of the Scrip; because I say in my first, [We through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures   Hope] have had Hope, saith he: Now it seems, because I place my words,  have had Hope, his unbelieving doubtful Heart questions whether I own the ∣thority of Scriptures; and would falsly conclude, That through the Comfort of the Scriptures we have no Hope now; and saith he, Are you now flown so high that you need not, &c. pag. 3. And therefore I may now answer further, Ye, through the Promise of the Lord, declared in Scripture, we have Hope  this pre∣sent, That God will bring down and overthrow all such that deceive the , who are made Ministers by man, and of man, at Schools and Colledges; and all this set Maintenance by Tythes, and casting people into Prison, and spoiling their Goods to maintain Ministers, as at this day in the Nation; many Hundreds have been cast into Prison, and many Hundred Pounds worth of Cattel,  Bedding, and all kind of Goods have been distrained for to maintain the Mini∣stry. I say, We have Hope, according to the Scriptures, That God will being down all this, and your preaching for Money, and bargaining with people  so much the year, and your preaching what you have studied for from the Scrip∣tures, by a Glass in a Steeple-house, where the Mass used to be said; God will confound all this, and poor people shall be delivered from the Mouthes of those Deceivers, that make a Prey upon them, and preach for Hire, and seek for their Gain from their Quarter; and these things, with many other, we hope for at present: Wherefore think not in thy self, we now do not hope; for we  do, and and have had Hope, through Patience and Comfort of the Scrip∣tures. Whereas I charged P. T. in my last, [That he had wronged both me and the Tr in his Relation, &c.] which he saith in his Answer is false; and he saith, He  not apprehend me and the Truth so well agreed, that it is possible to wrong us both   &c. pag. 4. Rep. That he wronged me it appears, in his not relating all that I said  the Dispute (the Ground of this Quarrel) not by half and more I k; and in relating more then himself spoke, by far: And let sober men judge ∣ther he did not here wrong me, in relating a thing that passed between us,  relating much more then ever he spoke, and much less then I spoke; if the truth of that Matter (were it wrong or right Matter) and my self also, be not by this kind of Doctrine wronged, I appeal to all honest People, whilst both he and I  silent: so the False-Dealing and Wrong in his first Book, is upon him still, ac∣cording to my Charge, unremoved. And the Lye in this his last Book, in that he saith, I say Falsly; when I have spoken the Truth, which is a Lye in the highest degree, in saying when I spok the truth, That I spoke Falsly; and his Proof, in that the Truth and I do not agree, is, because I said in my first, [The Saints have no need of Scriptures to teach them; but the Spirit of the Father leadeth and teacheth into all Truth.] Rep. My words are justifiable; for, It is the Spirit that leadeth into all Truth, John 16. and the Saints need no man to teach them, but they have the Ainting with∣in them; and they know all things by the Unction, 1 John: and the Spirit of the
Father is given them, by which the Scriptures were given forth; And the Lord is the Teacher of his People; and they need not any to say to them, Know the Lord, Ier. 31. Ye they that witness this, do not make the Scripture of none effect, but own it in its place, yet not as their Teacher; for then they should deny the new Covenant, Ier. 31. and then something besides the Spirit leads into Truth, and they have something to teach them besides the Anointing: but if this be all the Proof that can be given against me, That I and the Truth do not agree, I doubt not but ll Spiritual men will see the Emptiness and Weakness of the Witness against me; and will be more confirmed, rather then shaken, that I and the Truth do fully agree, though P. T. speaks otherwise falsly against me; and as if I had contradicted the Apostles words, which he quotes against me, who saith, Whatsoever things were written afore time, were written for our learning; which Scripture I do own, and no way contradict; its the Error of his Judgment, which so judgeth; for, even they for whom the things that were written, were for their learning; yet they were led into all Truth by the Teachings of the Spirit, and they were taught of the Father; and what was written to them, was not written because they knew not Truth, or to teach them Truth, 1 Iohn 2. 21. let him learn what this means. The next thing he notes is, whereas I said [I then proved (meaning at the Dis∣pute) b Scriptures, That some were perfect in this life, 1 Cor. 2. 5. even perfect without sin, John 1. 47. 1 John 3. 7.] And to gainsay this he hath brought, 2 John 1. 8. If  say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us: and saith he, Who speaks truth in this E. B. or the Apostle? as if I had spoken contrary to the Apostle: Solomon also (saith he) tell us, There is not a Iust Man upon Earth, that doth good, and sinneth not: which also he brings as a Witness against what I have affirmed. Rep. Its true, I held forth a state of Perfection to be waited for, and attain∣ed to upon Earth; and I am not ashamed of my Principle, neither is it found too light, For that Scripture, 1 Cor. 2. 5. doth testifie, that some were per∣fect upon Earth in the dayes of the Apostles; and if they were so, the same is to be waited for and witnessed in this Age; for the Hand of the Lord is not shor∣tened: And that Scripture, 1 Iohn 3. Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not; and  is born of God doth not commit sin, vers. 6, 9. doth clearly manifest, there is a te upon Earth free from sin, wherein Power is received and felt over all Temptations, and over the Devil, even such an estate, That the Wicked One can∣ ch such that are born of God; and this was the thing I held forth, and do vindie against all Opposers; That the Saints may wait for, and witness up∣on Earth, to have power over sin, and over its Temptations, and free from the committing of sin, by the Power of the second Adam living and dwelling in th: And thus must thou believe P. T. or else thou believest not Scripture,  that any are born of God, or abide in Christ; if thou believest not that, t confess thou errest in Judgment, who art unbelieving of what the Scrip∣t bears witness of. Therefore tell me plainly if thou believest, That there y that are born of God, and abide in Christ; then must thou believe,  do not commit sin; ele thou deniest the Scripture: And what I held forth herein, I do not contradict the Apostle, nor Solomon's words; for its true the Apostle said, If we say we have no Sin we, deceive our selves: but art thou so blind that thou dost not see, he speaks there of a state before Confession of Sins; and the words saith the Apostle, If we confess our Sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us  Sins, and to cleanse us from all Unrighteousness; so I do agree with the Apostle's words, and do not contradict them: For I do say, If any say they have no sin, before they do confess their sin, and forsake their sin, and be cleansed from it, I do say they are Lyars, and the Truth not in them; and I also say, If that after a ma hath confest his sin, and be cleansed from it, and hath his sin forgiven him, and witnesseth that he is born of God, and does not commit sin; I say, he  the Truth also, and the Truth is in him. And though Solomon did say,
There is not a just man upon Earth, that doth good, and sins not; yet is my affirmati∣on true notwithstanding; for Solomon forgat the Lord, and his Heart went af∣ter many strange Women, and became a Transgressor, and in that state did not know the Birth born of God, which doth not commit Sin; for he was but un∣der the Administration of the Law, which doth not make perfect, as pert to the Conscience; and peradventure in that state; he being erred from God, he did not see any that did not sin: These things will be plain to some▪ though perhaps thou mayst shut thine eye against them; and Solomen was not our Exam∣ple in Conversation, I am sure, nor hardly in Doctrine. And thus I  weighed thy Text, which thou seemest to say before, I have not weighed; and my Principles are proved sound, and thou and thine too light, and the  the Lord will scatter them. And P. T. confesses, Every Real-hearted Christian may be, and is in  called Perfect. Rep. Then wherefore doth he oppose me, who testifieth the same thing? and he now confesseth even, That every Real-hearted Christian may be, and is called Perfect in Scripture: And is not he here guilty, in that he charged me falsly, in pag. 21. of his last, With going Rounds, like unto a Horse in a Mill, who sometimes denies Perfection, and sometimes confesses it, to be attained in this life? but he is forced in the end to confess to the Truth, and to iustifie me▪ And also the Scripture doth testifie, The Saints were already perfect and com∣pleat in Christ, while they were in the Life upon Earth, Col. 1. though there be a time wherein all the Saints do complain of the Body of Sin, in their War∣fare and Travel; yet there is a state also, wherein they have put off the doy of Sin, and are the Servants of Righteousness, and free from Sin, Rom. . 22. But P. T. shews little Experience in those states, as of the Travel under the Bo∣dy of Death, and also of the Victory over it; and so what he spe is but by guess from other mens words, and then it is no marvel if he errs in udgment, and bring one Scripture to contradict another, not having the inf Spi∣rit that gave it forth, nor feeling the States, nor the passing thorow these Con∣ditions declared therein, for there is a time of Travelling, and complaining under the Body of Sin, and its Burden; and a time of Freedom from it, and Victory over it, yea, even in this life upon Earth. And whereas I said in my last, [Many of the Saints daily received more and  of God's Wisdom, and of his Power and Life revealed in them, wherein they grow in to God from strength to strength.] Now saith he, But whether he doth not own some to have attained so high, that there can be no Addition, is a Query; my soul (saith he)  not been able to enter into his secrets in this thing, (because my words were, Mary of the Saints, &c.) Rep. My first words it seems he cannot contradict, but owns them to be the, so I need not defend them; only he supposeth a Question, in which there is not much Edification to be answered; and I have no secrets in what I speak; for to the the Children of Light my words are plain, though to P. T. and such, they may be Parables and Secrets: But as for my own particular, I now here answer  Question, and further reply, I do grow up in Wisdom and Knowledge daily; and never knew so much of P. T's. Deceit, as now I do, since, and at the Dis∣pute (the Ground of this our Debate) so I thought good to let him know, that I do grow in Truth, which doth daily discover more and more Deceit in him, and them that oppose Truth; and so also grow in the Knowledge of his Error of Judgment and Ignorance, that I may condemn it, and judge it. And whereas I said, [The Light which everyman is lightned withal by Christ, is sufficient to bring up every man to believe in Christ, that loves the Light, and walks in it; and unto such is Grace added and encreased daily, &.] as in page 16 of my first more appeareth, In opposition to this, to overthrow it, as he supposeth, he hath nominated that Scripture, 1 Cor. 2. 14. The natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of
Now my words are true, and no Contradiction to the Apostle's words;  to such as are blind, that cannot discern between Light and Darkness;  will judge falsly, and out of an evil mind make an appearance of seeming  where there is none; for the Light that lighteth every man that  the World, is Christ, Iohn. .9. and that Christ, the Light, that  every  that comes into the World, is sufficient to bring every man,  loves the Light, and walks in it, to believe in Christ; these are my words, mind; and would any man, that were not stark blind, make this Doctrine; or bring a Scripture to prove the contrary? I own, and do no way contradict; For the  Man doth  the things of God, nor know : yet this is not Contrary to what I say,  Christ Jesus lighteth every man that comes into the World  Light  is sufficient; and he changeth men from Natural to  so they  to believe in Christ, that hath lightened say, or hold forth, That the natural man God, and that the natural man hath Faith,  never to my mind to say: so he hath drawn  evil Consequence and then confounded his own for my saying and intent is, that the World; and his Light is natural to spiritual, and to give things of God, and of his Spiri is no Contradiction to the Apostles wor though understanding, I suppose, rather than Principle is proved sound, and the Title of the  a Lye. And whereas I said, [That Christ wrought Righteousness perfectly  and  Righteousness in all that believe, and or that hath not the other.] pag. 12. of my first. He saith, Whther I do  Iustification and Sanctification, he leaves all rational men to judge, &c. That Christ wrought Righteousness without us is not denyed by him, the Righteousness of the Law in the  he cannot well deny;  read Rom. 8. 4. and that no man is justified by the Righteousness that  wrought without, who believes not, nor is converted to God, but in the  of Satan: This all the Children of God believe, and know, That none  justified by Christ's Righteousness without  who are convert to God  received Christ; and he is in them,  else they are  and not justified: And so I am not ashamed of my Principle to be too light; for he that hath not Christ, is a Reprobate, and not justified by an Righteousness without. Neither  found. Iustification and Sanctification, which be are one in Christ; for he is made unto us Sanctification and Iustification; and that is in the Pollutions of the World, unsanctified, is not justified  condemned & so none are justified by a Righteousness without them, but  in the same corrupt  with him, must not I be judged justifie, If any Work be in the Strength and Power of strength, then and that no Work or Word is justified, but what the : And though P.T. ignorantly commenceth  these words, yet are they words of  and Righteousness, and all that he saith  nothing to the And whereas I did ask him, which he had Ignorantly affirmed in his that Righteousness, which Christ works , in his Strength and is called Our Righteousness?] which he see to answer, but my words; for I meant not Ours by enjoyment, but Ours
the Prophet speaks, when Righteousness that Christ works in us by his Spirit, and the Power of his  is Ours by enjoyment in the second Adam, as the Gift of God to us; but in the first Adam, in the Righteousness of the Law, in the and that was the strength of my Query▪ where that Righteousness▪ us by the Spirit and Strength of Christ; and not in our own, is called our ∣teousness, ours as in the first Adam: But I see thou hast not understood of my Query for weakness of Understanding; and then how should  rightly answer it? Also I Queried, [How Christ working Righteousness in us, by the Power of  not by our own strength, can be called the Righteousness of the Law] Now I meant, the Righteousness of the Law in the Flesh, and not  Spirit; I know the working of Christ  in us to will and  do by and Strength, and power of Grace, is the fulfilling the Righteou  the Law  Christ in us, but it is not the Righteousness of the Law in the But to this thou hast not answered, conceiving, and not the innocency of my Queries. And whereas he stumbles, and is offended, because I said, [ No  is  in any word or work, but what they are led unto by the Spirit, and those Words  the Spirit leads unto, no other words or works.] And from  would falsly Iification by Works, and by something I say, No, shall no Flesh living be justified, that moveth and leadeth  and Works of Truth and Righteous  Words and Works which he is and this is not Apostle's words, which he seem against me While we were sinners, Christ dyed for us; justified by his Blood, : This is not  what I say, for we do  the Blood of Iesus to justifie, but yet not  are not cleansed by it, and  by the Spirit into all Truth, but it is  are justified only, who are led into all Truth by his Spirit, such are  by his Blood in the Spirit, and  from W, who are born of the  Word, but they are not justified, nor saved . Then he Querieth▪ Whether I  Pardon of Sin out of Doors? I answer, No, for they that are  into all Truth by the Spirit are pardoned, and forgiven, and  no more, but blotted cannot be read; for they are leased from it, and commit no sin. Then he asketh, Whether Causes of Iustification; the one, ? Re. I say, and the Work of Righteousness is in God,  free Love and M, which is ov Works, and they receive the  of it, and the Gift of it, that are led by the Spirit, as the Effect thereof,  none else. Though he asketh, Whether Forgiveness of Sin hath its rice from  Christ worketh in us, or from what Christ hath done and suffered for us? I say,  soever Christ hath done and suffered with while man hath not rece Christ, nor the Work of Christ in him, but remains in the first Adam, in Tra∣gression, the true Work and Ground of Iustification he knows not, nor  not, neither knows the Mediator-ship between God and him. Then  the conclusion of this matter P.T. saith  for to ow, E.B.  the Truth are not so forsake  &c. Rep. Hold Friend, come back again▪ What  thou proved yet any thing against me, save that I hold the T? Thou hast  a Cosion too soon, without sound Evidence, and thou  not be Iudge in thy own Cause; neither hast thou prov'd me and the Truth to disagree may judge. It appears thou art the man that seemest to be Righteous in thy own eye
none falsly herein; for, who can clear themselves from the Guilt of it, of that Generation? if any, I condemn them not; but can P. T. do it? ask his Neigh∣bours. Hath not he sums of Money by the Year, Tythes, or other Wages for, preaching? try him a little, give him nothing for a Year or two, and then if he preach to you, and never complain for want of Wages and Money, then I  believe he is clear, and then he may better boast than he can now: And as for  vers of that function in that Country, they have cas men into Prison, where they yet lie, and taken suit of them at Law, and taken their Goods, because some could not for Conscience sake give you Hire, and Tythes, and Money; and  hese free; or guilty of my Charge? let the Lord judge, and all his Saints. He saith, He doth not plead for all who go under the name of Ministers in England; he fears there is many of them no better then Wolves in Sep's Clothing▪ c. Then why doth he not come out, and cry against them, but remain gst them  their Practice? For wherein can he clear himself of anyone thing, which they are guilty of which he confesses are Wolves in Sheep's Clothing? Was not his Call the same  theirs? d is not his Practice in Ministry and Maintenance gen∣rally the same with theirs? If he hath ought to say, to clear himself, we will answer further  otherise all men shall Judge. That while he accuseth some of England's Ministers to be VVolves in Sheep's Clothing, himself is found also guilty; except▪ I say he can make appear a perfect difference between his Call, Practice, and Maintenance, and theirs, which he is never able to do, or to justifie that he is not of the same nature, and by the same spirit, but contrary to theirs, that he accuses▪ and  to be lves in Sh Clothing: and I have as much gro to suspect him to be one of the Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, as he has ground to suspect his own Companions and  to be such. And in that he saith,  of the Quakers▪ have been found guilty of Blasphemy and that some of them are found vain light Person▪ or eady, and high-minded. Rep. He doth here secretly charge and prove nothing; for Blasphemy   come out of and have deny'd all lightness after the Flesh and High-mi, and if any such come among us, they are deny'd, and are not of us till  be converted to God▪ and turned from all evil: But this his secret charge against others is but that himself may seem cl▪ Then he asks, Are all guilty of preaching for Hire, and divining for  and ds me.

He here again charges falsly; for we know that Scorning and Jeers aft the Flesh are not Works of the Spirit, nor Fruits of it, but that we have d∣nyed and its ca out,  do we scorn or jeer any, ing a in Isa. 3. Then he no less then confesses his Wrong-Dealing, who in his last changed  words, from called to ned, which word is of much consequence in that  but would cover R. G. by saying, That R. G.  not undertake to prove the Sc considered as meer Writings, but the thing contained in the Scriptures, to be th  God, &c. Rep. Here P. T. hath endeavour'd to mend the matter, by his Concep  Meaning given to R. G's. words; now the words of R. Goodgroom were,  He would prove the Letter the Word; and upon that brought his   is not the Letter meer Writings, and nothing else, but whe  see they  not make good their own words, then they turn off the stren of  by They meant so, or they meant so; and no man ever ye could, or can prove  all the Scriptures, That the Letter (the Writings) are called the Word  as I still confessed, that which is written of is the Word; and the W the words that declare of the Word, which was in the Beginning. But  would fain concile this Difference between us; say they, The W Letter, are the Word; say I, That which is written of, is the Word: Now  these are great difference, as Spiritual Men may judge; as much as  dead Trumpet; and a living Breath sounded through it: Nay, its hard  concile that which is contrary in nature, they must leave preaching for  and ease to take Tyth and  Preaching, before I can be at  another Bith  speak and liv hem, and that which now lives in th  be slain, and their crwn  dow before reconciled I can be to them,  to me; though I have  against Persons, more the the   them that opposed the Truth; nor no Weapon shall I use against thm;   that is Spiritual, and the Sword that goes out of the Lamb's Mouth.  the many Scriptures which he quotes, page 23. o neither say nor sig  the Letter (the Writings) are the Word,   ed; though: M  5. 5.) id, He would  them   of the Lord; did he then shew  Letter, the Writings, the Scripture? I say. No; therefore he did not  Writings and the Letter the Wrd of God, as you affirmed, nd s  prove: but tho test , an rovest othing   though mny times the Word o the Lord came to such a Prophet, and to  Prophet, as thou  proved  , Il, and others; yet did the Wr and the Letter come to them, or that which the Letter and Writings   let Wise Men judge: That, no all thou cast ay, doth not prove,  Writings, the Letter, is e  of God, or th ver any    of God called them :  hat  better Proof be given, which I ne  need not revoke any  that I have said contrary,] viz.

Hast not thou falsly judged me already  many things, as I have shewed? the Lord in time may let thee see thy judgment is false, and awaken thy to Repentance; and then shalt thou confess, I have done thee no but the Wrong-Dealing lies at thy Door: so that by what is said, the thy Book is a Lye, and utterly false; which is, Some Principles of Edw. , called a Quaker, Examined, and found too light. Now in this I shall not be Judge altogether in my own Cause, but leave the view of sober Men, and require their Judgment, when they have read erly over, what one particular, instanced by him, is proved to be unound light? for, according to the Testimony of the holy en of God in Scrip∣ reby may I confirm the Truth of what I have, and do hold forth; and to ns Conscience do commend my self, to be approved in the sight of God;  good Report or bad Report of men I regard not, but trd over them both;  rein the Truth is wronged, I am bound to give my Evidence for it, and opposers; and that is the very end of this my present Work to contend   Truth, and not for Mastery, though Truth doth give me Mastery over ; and to hold forth the same Faith, Light and Truth which the Apostles before the Apostacy, which hath been clouded in all this dark Night of cy, which hath been over the World for many Ages, since the Man-child  ght up to God, and the Woman ed into the Wilderness, spoken of

A TESTIMONY Against a Great Idolatry COMMITTED: And a True Mourning Of the Lord's Servant,  the many Considerations of his Heart, upon that Oc∣casion of the great stir about an Image made and carried from▪ Place to another; happening the 23th day of the 9th Moneth. IT came to pass, and happened, that being at Kingston upon Thames, the the 22th day of the ninth Moneth, it was ordered the next Morning, that I came from thence to London; and as I entred in at Charing-Cross, I beld a very great Multitude of People gathering together, and thronging and pressing exceedingly; and the whole Streets were filled, from one side to the o∣ther, upwards and downwards, so far as I could see; with abundance gazing forth at every Window, and upon the Belconies, and House-tops; and the Glass was d down for people to look out into the Streets; and an exceeding number of people there was, all the Streets so thronged, that I thought it could not be pos∣sible that any more could throng in, or pass by: and there were Guards of Soul∣diers, both of Horse and Foot; and they stayed me, and stopped my Horse; and said, I might not pass that way; neither indeed could I well, by reason of the throng of people: and I stay'd a very little, but presently passed back another way, in a kind of wondering at this great stir I found in my way; and I beheld all spirits of people were up in a Wonderment and Admiration, and gazing they were, and hurrying, as if some marvellous and great thing had happened to them, or were to be seen by them; and I felt the spirits of Men, Women and Children were all on Fire, and they were in an admiring frame, and in a condition not usual. And as I passed along, I turned in my Mind, to see of the Lord what this thing might be, and what might be the End of it, and why was this gathering, and running, and thronging of Multitudes in this manner, and in this frame; and presently, upon consideration, I perceived that a dead Image, and invented Picture would be carry'd that way; and that all this pressing, and stir, and the gathering of this great Multitude, was only to see and behold a dead Image without life or breath; and then my spirit was grieved, and my soul was vexed within me; and it run through me, Vanity, Vanity, Folly, and Madness: What
is all this setting of Guards, gathering of people in such thronging Multitudes, and pulling down the Glass, and gazing of Men, Women and Children, high and low; rich and poor, people of all sorts that were come together? Is all this wondering of people and inflaming of spirits in this admiring mood? Is all this (said I) but to see a dead invented Image of Wood or Wax, arrayed and decked with some foolish Inventions? Said my spirit, Oh Abominable! Oh Idolatry! Oh Folly and Vanity! and my life was grieved. What is all this preparation of people in this wondering frame, but to behold an Image carried, and to see simple foolish people following after it in their Idolatrous Rob and Gestures, such who had invented it, and been at cost with it? And then my spirit was burdened, and the very smell of Idolatry and Abomination entred upon me, and the weight of all this Iniquity came into me, and vexed the Righ∣teous; and the very sence of this Abomination seized upon my Life, and I felt the burden of their so great Wickedness; the making the Image I felt a bur∣den, and all the foolish Circumstances about it, for many dayes, and the peo∣ples Folly and Madness, that so gathered and pressed to behold it, and so won∣dred after it, was a burden to me, and they that carry'd it in their foolish gest: All this is Iniquity and Abomination, said my spirit; and I was loaden therewith, and said, Certainly the Judgments of God will meet with this Work, and the Lord will be avenged because of it; and their Souls should once feel the burden of it with Terror, as mine at this present. And it came into me, It might be some would be wounded, or pressed to Death, or some Wickedness would come out of this Wickedness, that the Anger of the Lord might break forth, and smite such as were the Foundation of this sinful Abomination; and my spirit had a deep sence of the greatness and sinfulness of this high and mighty Idolatry; and it wounded me, and made me sad: But immediately (from that temper) on a very sudden my spirit was changed, and I was filled with the Indignation of the Lord God against this Image, and this stir about it; his Plagues, and Fury and Fire run through me to cry, Plagues, Plagues and Vengeance against them, because of this Abomination: And I found my spirit set on fire with the very Power of God rising in me against this Idolatry, that if I had been moved to it, and it had been possible to have done it, I could have ridden through the Guards, and over the Multitude, to have sounded the Judgments of God, and his Woes amongst them, and through them; and I could then have engaged the loss of my life, that the Lord might have been revenged upon this Image, and Image-Makers, and Image-Followers, and Image-Wonderers after, that my Soul might be freed from its present burden, through this grle Wickedness: Said I What silly, foolish, blind, ignorant people are these? What a power hath the Devil over them! and how are they led captive at his will! What an influence hath the sight of a dead Image upon their dead hearts and car∣nal minds! Was ever the like, said I? Is there greater Abomination at Rome? What Blindness and Sencelesness is over the hearts of this people? And after this manner, for a good season after, my spirit within me aggravated and unfolded this great Abomination, tumbling it over and over in my own Breast, with a secret pitty for their Souls which were ensnared and captivated through all this Wickedness. But further, I considered, that all this Abomination and sinful Ido∣latry is about the Funeral of the late Oliver Cromwel; then said I, What for him! Alas for him! who was once a great Instrument in the Hand of the Lord, to break down many idolatrous Images, and grievous Idols; and did not the Lord once stir up his heart against all such things? And did not once his Children, Officers, and his brave Souldiers and Army, pull down all the Images and Crosses, and all such like Popish stuff where ever they met with it? And said my spirit, What grievous and abominable work is this? Have they now made a costly I∣mage of him? and are such as were once his Souldiers now guarding it, and watch∣ing over it? and his Children and Officers following it, and Multitudes of the Inhabitants of London wondering and gazing after an Image of him? This
is sad, said I, and great pitty, What a change is this in so short a time? Was it but a few years since that he, and his Army, and his Servants, and his Chil∣dren, and Officers, were so zealous to throw down Images, Pictures, and Il, that they could not endure the sight and worshipping of them? And have they now made an Image of him, which his Officers, Children and Kin∣dred are carrying from place to place, and following it, and Multitudes caused to wonder after it? What a change is this, said I? Oh sad! Are people run∣g after Images again, as in the time of Popery? And have they made an  and deckt it with costly array, and set it up for People to visit a long time, and then haling it from place to place? Are they doing this in London, as they do at Rome amongst Papists? This is Pittiful: But how cometh this to pass? I began to consider, and said, I knew the Man, when he was living, and  the knowledge of his spirit; and I was perswaded; if it had been asked him in his life time, If such work should be acted about him, such an Image made like , and laid for so long time in a  place, and manner, and them carried by his ed, and Children, Kindred, and Army, and then set up in such a place, and he re∣moved from place to place. I say, I believe he would have denied it, and said, it shall not e thus for me when I am dead; I suppose he would not have suffered it thus to have been; he was more wife, I thought, he would have said; Nay, what, to ma Image of me, and deck it diversly from one form to another, and vi∣sit it; and then carry it from place to place, up and down! this will be a shame to  Children, and a disgrace to my Kindred, and a reproach to my Officers, and whole Army, and all the Nation will mock and be offended, and they may . These are they that were once Enemies to all Images and dead Idols, and  them down, and broke them down; and are these now making an Image,  setting it up, and wondering after it from place to place? Nay, (might be have said) if thus it be done, they at Rome may laugh us to scorn, and the Pa∣s may say, We have learned of them, and put their Persons from among us, and ba∣, and killed them, and set up their Practices: sure he would have said thus;  I am certain, the Witness of God in his Conscience might truly have said it, because it is Truth. But upon another consideration, I said this is come to pass after this manner, though he was once zealous against all Popery, yet he did too much forget that good cause, and too much sought the greatness and honour of the World, and loved the praise of men, and took flattering titles, and vain respects of deceit∣l men, and many great Abominations were upheld through him, as Tythes, and Old Mass-houses, and ordaining of Ministers by mans will, and the false ips, and Sprinkling of Infants, and such like Popish stuff, first invented at Rome; and he suffered the Servants of the Lord to be persecuted, and imprison∣, for denying and crying against such things as were Popish, and which him∣self sometime seemed to deny; and because of this, said I this may justly be come to pass, that an Idolatrous Image and Picture, should be made of him en he is dead, and decked, and laid in a sumptuous manner, and visited, and then carried from place to place, (as was usual in the time of Popery) for mul∣es of foolish people to gaze upon, and wonder after, and admire, and praise, that all men might see the first cause is lost, and that zeal, which his kindred and Army had once in their hearts against Popery, is extinguished, and people are turned again  gaze after Images, which is Popish; for such practises that day between Somersett-ouse and Westminster were first ordained at Rome, and practised by the Papists; and he that suffered many to be imprisoned; for denying and crying against such Worships and Practices, as were in them∣selves Popish, and which he himself once fought against; its happened now, when he is dead; and its suffer'd now that they should make a Fool of him in a Popish way and manner: For such Practices are no other then Foolery and Foolishness, tending to the Dishonour of a good Man.
but in the midst of my Considerations, a pitty struck through me, for once no∣ble Oliver, that is now dead, and his place no more found; and I was grieved he should be thus abused, being dead, by such a stir about an Image made of him, for many weeks together, as hath been; and I began to recal my former ac∣quaintance with him, and the former dealings of God towards him, and what a gallant Instrument for the Lord he once was; and how many glorious and no∣ble Victories God once gave him; and what good parts, and what a gallant spirit there was in him, and how once he shewed me, and declared what the former dealing of the Lord had been upon his Soul; and how he was troubled in conscience formerly; & my spirit run through many such things, with a great deal of sexiousness and pitty: And then said I, Alas, alas! Is it ended all in this? all his former good service for God and the Nations; all his Victories, and his good Actions, and his beating down Superstition; Is this the end of it all; the making of an Image, and carrying it from place to place? is it ended all here, what formerly he hath been, and what he hath done? how hath this cloud of Folly cast a stink and darkness upon his former brightness, and glory, and nobleness? and is this the end, and final farwel of once noble Oliver? what, only the sight of an Image carried and set up? Hath the City of London, and the Nations to better Memento of him? But, oh! had he been faithfull to the end, to God, he would have left a more lively and heavenly Character to have been read for his sake, then an Image of him, and such Idolatrous practises; and my life could have sorrowed upon some considerations passed through me about this business, and for some hours my spirit could not rest; and in the very time it lay upon me to write this: And after all this, said my spirit; Where are all the old Priests now, and his ancient Teachers, who once had a great zeal against all these things, and against all such practises? Where are they now? are they blind also, said I, that they cannot see this abominable Idolatry, and cry against it? had they any hand in it? or were they Consenters to these things? What is become of them? Is their zeal for the Lord, and against Idolatry quite gone? thought I, they might have prevented this disgrace to their old Master, who hath served them well, and set them in great places, and put them in large Be∣nefices, and they might have done something for him when he is dead, and have prevented this Folly, and Idolatry, which is acted upon him this day; for certainly all people in the Nation that fear God will be offended, and judge in their hearts such work, the framing of an Image, and sounding Trumpets, and beating Drums before it, and cloathing Horses in Mourning, and Trayling their Pikes; and even the very Honourable of the Nation clad in Mourning, and following this Image, and all this stir, and cost, and preparation for many Weeks before-hand, and such decking in Mourning Attire of great and noble Men, and all but to accompany an Image from one place to another, whereby people are deceived, who might look upon it to be the Burial of Oliver Protector; whenas it was but an Image, made by hands, & deck∣ed & trimed in a vain manner, as if it had bin some Poppit Play; which if it had been indeed his Bones, they had accompanied to the ground in such a manner, that had bin less condemnable, and I should not had ought against it: But for the Wise∣men in the Nation to be chief in these things, and to exercise themselves in such Folly and Vanity, this grieves the Righteous Soul; and if I should justifie it, the Lord would condemn me: but the shame will fall upon themselves that acted it, and chiefly upon their Priests and Teachers, because they were consenting to such Vanity, and piece of Popery, as this was: And had these old Doctors and Teachers feared God, and their Hearts been aright towards him, they would have endeavoured the stopping of this Abomination; and another way might have been thought upon, whereby a more lively and godly Monument of their old Master might have stood to Generations. What shall the making, and visiting, and carrying, and setting up of a dead Image, for foolish people to gaze upon, and run wondring after in their wicked
minds? Must this be all the Monument? And shall we have no other Repre∣sentation of once noble Cromwel? Is his Life, and former Glory and Nobleness shaddow'd with the sight of a dead Image? Alas! This presents nothing at all to such as fear God, but Folly, and Ignorance, Vanity, and Idolatry; and when they look upon it, they shall be grieved in their spirits, and vexed when they can find no more Monument of that once noble man, but an invent∣ed ge and Picture; and the Priests shall be ashamed, and may have the greatest rebuke; for they that lead the people have caused them to err. And now upon the whole matter, from the very beginning to the end thereof, I do declare against it; and that a fearful Abomination hath been committed in the sight of the Lord, in relation to this Image; and you have vext the Lord's Soul; and his Hand you shall feel upon your Consciences, and the weight there∣of in the time to come: the spending of so much of the Creation, and wasting Money, and other things, the Lord will lay to your charge; and the whole City hath been abused with running and wondring after the work of your own hands. And now all you that have gone to gaze and wonder after an Image; What saw you? What beheld you? What wondered you after, ought except folly and vanity, and a dead Image, whereby▪ the man and his Nobility was abused, in honour to whom they say it was done? And when many dayes were spent, what were you the better? What were you edified? were you not convinced of your  Folly? And might not your Wickedness reprove you? And did not the Li in your own Consciences check you, and prick you▪ and condemn your vain minds, that wondred after Folly? Though now you may be hardned, yet  day you shall confess, when the Witness of God in you doth arise, and bring all your deeds to remembrance; then shall you say, This work was Abomination, and  great Sin in them, who invented it, and caused it to be brought forth, and your selves that  wondred after it; and the Judgments of the Lord are against all these things. E. B.
A MESSAGE PROCLAIMED, BY Divine Authority; From the chosen Assembly of the Redeemed Peo∣ple in England, to the Pope (chief Bishop) of Rome, and to his Cardinals, Jesuits and Priests, and all other the Officers of the Romish Church, where it shall meet with them through the World: That they may appear, and come forth to Tryal; and shew if they have the same Faith, Power, Spirit, Authority and Govern∣ment, as had the Apostles and true Churches, before the Apostacy. And this is a full Invitation and Challenge to the whole Church of Rome, and the beginning of Controversie with her, for the perfect manifestation of the long hidden Truth; betwixt them that are in the Truth it self, and such as have the Form, but not the Power; that all things may be brought to Light, and true Judgment. WHereas we, a poor, despised, and rejected People, among the Nations of the Earth; yet Dreadful and Mighty, because the Majesty and Presence of the Lord God is with us, who hath called us, and chosen us, and gathered us, and redeemed us from among men, out of Kindreds, and Multitudes and Peoples, into one Body and one Spirit, out of all the Sects upon the Earth; and we are of one Mind and one Soul; having Fellowship with the Son, and with the Father; being come through great Tribulations, and many fiery Tryals, and are refined and purifi∣ed, and made clean and white in the Blood of the Lamb; being fully recover'd out of the great Deluge of Darkness and Apostacy, which hath overflown and drowned the whole World, and all Nations, since the dayes of the true Churches and holy Apostles. And know ye, That we are none of all the many Sects, nor of the divers Wayes, and formal Worshippers, that are but in the Imitations, fiegned of what the Saints of old spoke and performed in the Power and Spirit of God; which hath been spoken and practized by all the divers Sects and false Churches, without the Spirit, Power and Life, that was in the Apostles; so that all Re∣ligion hath been, and the Profession and Practice thereof, for many Ages; but as the floating of a broken Vessel upon the Waters, driven with the several Winds, wanting Anchor, and skilful Marriners, which have not carried to per∣fect Rest the Hope of Eternal Life.
But know ye, that now at last, through our long and wearied Travels, and after all our tedious Seekings, and our zealous Practises and Profession in Chri∣stianity performed by us, while Darkness covered us, and the Earth; hath the Lord set us safe upon the Rock Christ Jesus, upon whom the Church of Christ firmly standeth, and the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against; and he hath made our Habitation sure upon the Mountain of his House, which is established upon the top of the Mountains, whereunto we now are gathered, and rest in a certain hope and tried confidence, and doth view the whole World, and the state of all Mankind, and measureth the times and seasons thoroughout Gene∣rations; and the state of the Church we perfectly know, by the inspiration of the Almighty, her estate before the Apostles dayes, and in the Apostles dayes, and since the Apostles dayes, and her increase, and decrease, and estate, since the beginning of the World till now, and at this present time, to us is certainly known, by the Spirit of Jesus, and the Light of the Lamb, which now is risen upon our Mountain, and shines in our Habitations. And first we certifie you, as for the many false Sects and Churches (so called) and many of the divers worshippers, and separated forms of Churches, risen up since the Apostles dayes, from the least of them to the greatest, we have searched and examined, and are not fully satisfied (but rather the contrary) that they are perfectly sound in the Faith, but rather degenerated, from the Power, Spirit, and Life that was in the Apostles, and among the true Churches before the Apostacy; and we have sought out their first original and root, and we find they fall short of the true Church and the Apostles; first in respect of time, many Generations; and also in respect of life, and power, and purity, and they want the spirit, and dominion, and Government, that the true Churches and Apostles possessed; and we certainly believe, they are many of them come up, and risen in a dark Night, long since the dayes of the Apostles, while the Sun was yet unrisen, and while the Mountains of Ignorance, Blind∣ness, and Wickedness covered the face of the Earth, and the Clouds of Darkness remained upon the face of the whole Heavens; and while yet the Man-child re∣mains in God, being caught up to him, and the Woman lodged in the desolate Wilderness, being thither fled because of the great red Dragon. And we believe not, that any of them are the Lambs Wife, lawfully joyned to him, neither are they the Virgin, in which there is no spot; nor the Spouse, tru∣ly in election to Christ the Bridegroom; for we have had controversie with them this divers years, and weighed them, and measured them in the ballance of equity, and they appear to us, not to be of a true descent from that Vine, into which true Church was planted; but their original may be of a latter race. And to say no more of them, we certainly know they are foully spotted, and have not the favour, nor parts, nor garments of a Virgin; and Christ the Bride∣groom they have deeply wronged, for many false Sects have risen out of the great Whore, the mother of Harlots, who hath been in open and secret Fornication, ever since the days of the Apostles, and such are her off-spring, and not of the true Seed, elect, which is heir by right, of the inheritance of Life eternal, the King∣dom which hath no end. And for as much as the Church of Rome hath openly pleaded, as we have heard, and some of your Members also to our faces, that she is indeed the true Church, and she alone, and none besides, and that you can fetch your original by line truly from the Apostles, and Church of the Saints, and are not degenerated in any particular of Faith, Doctrine, nor Practise, from the Life, and Power, and Government, and Spirit which was among the true Church, and in the Apostles. These things, with others the like, have we heard of you, and concerning you, by many: And now, because the Lord hath put it into our hearts, to have con∣troversie with you, and to seek out perfectly your original, and to justifie you, or condemn you accordingly; and having the certain infallible Spirit
of the Lord God to try all things, we are purposed in the Lord to visit you, and to examine to the Foundation, your rise, and first beginning, from whence you come by descent, and what you truly are in your present Estate; and whe∣ther you be indeed the true Church, and have the true Spirit; or whether you are otherwise; that all the World may be satisfied, and more perfectly know the full Truth concerning the Church of Rome; and your Seed and Root we will examine, and your Birth and Original we will search out; and your Faith, and Worship, and whole Religion we will lay to the Line of true Judgement, to justifie you, or condemn you eternally; for the Saints shall judge the World; and your Garments shall be stripped off, and your Secrets discovered, and your whole Body, and Members made fully manifest, that the very truth of all things may appear, and be embraced, and the Whoredoms of the whole Earth may be laid open, that the Just and the Innocent, that hath long lain groaning in great Captivity, may be delivered from under all Bonds of Oppressions, Whoredoms, and Iniquities; and this will the Eternal God, by us, speedily bring to pass amongst you. Wherefore thou Pope, greatly admired, and highly exalted, and to all thy Cardinals, Friers, Iesuits, and Priests, and all other Officers under thee; I am moved of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, (who is the only Holiness, and highest of all) by this Message to visit you, requiring you, and charging you, in the Name and Authority of the Dreadfull and Mighty God, before whom all men and Nations are as nothing in comparison, but may be turned at his plea∣sure, and dashed to pieces by his Mighty Hand; and unto whom all the Sons of Adam in the World must give an Account: and as you will answer it to him i his dreadful Day of Judgment and Vengeance, and as you love and will obey your God and Christ whom you profess and serve; and as you would honour your God, and bring People to your Way and Worship, and Religion, upon these Ingagements, and by the Authority of the Almighty, I lay it upon you to answer, and for you to return your knowledge and opinions to the Particulars following, which I am moved by the Lord to query and demand of you, that your Doctrines, Practises, and Worships, and whole Religion, in every part thereof, may be viewed, and examined, and measured according to the Saints and Apostles writings, and may thereby be cleared, or otherwise reproved and condemned: And if your Profession and Practises in Religion be sprung from the true Grounds, and true Spirit, and your Church be indeed the true Church, that can prove her pedigree truly descended from the Church of Christ, before the Apostacy, and clear her self from all degeneration in every degree, and that she is perfect in the faith, and worship, and practises of the holy Church and Apostles of old; then shall all that love God, and fear him, and hopes for life eternal, separate themselves from all Sects, and Apostates, separated from you, and come in, and return again to you, as to a faithful Mother, and joyn with you in all things, and add themselves to your Church only, and renounce and deny all the contrary, that is not of you; and so shall your names and honour be increased through all the Earth. But and if after lawful trial, and just examination, and searching out the matter, it be proved against you, that you are degenerated from what the true Church and Apostles were, and are not builded upon Christ the true Rock and Foundation, but diverted from the Power, Life, and Spirit, and true Religion which the A∣postles were in; and that your Church is not the true Church, but a false Sect, and your original cannot be fetch'd from the Apostles, but is of a latter and more corrupted Race; then shall you deny all your Religion, and Church, and renounce your Profession and Practises, and come to them, and joyn with them, that can prove their Church to be the true Church, and can fetch their original from the Spirit of the Apostles, and that is builded upon Christ the ever∣lasting Foundation (whoever this shall be proved to be) wherefore appear and come forth to trial, upon this condition, joyn issue with us, and answer these
things in plainness, and let us know your Judgements, that a return you may reive. First, Whether you are indeed the only true Church of Christ, his Body, of  Fle, and of his Bones, called, and gathered, and united by the eter∣ Spirit of Jesus, perfect in the Faith of Christ, perfect in Doctrine, and perfect is ip, as were the Churches of Christ in the dayes of the Apostles? and  the Eternal Spirit dwell in every particular Member of your Church, and doth lead each one of you into all Truth, insomuch that you need now no teach any one of you, but as that same Spirit that dwells in you? answer  inly, yea, o nay. 2. ther are you not in any particular of your Faith, Doctrines, Pra∣ Worships, in any degree degenerated, nor deviated from what the , ne, Practice and Worship were, that the true Church was in, in the Apostles? And whether will you admit of tryal in all things you p and practice, by the Scriptures, the Writings of the Saints, yea, or y? 3. Wther your Church of Rome doth receive the pouring-down of the Spirit upon Sons and Daughters immediately, and every Member receive the Holy st, and is lled therewith, and baptized therewith, as in the true C Acts z. An whether you have received the Holy Ghost, and Eve Comforter immediately, as did the true Church, i the dayes of the Apost Answer me these things in the Truth of your Hearts, that you may be own'  denyed. 4. Wer the Faith you profess hath perfectly purified your hearts from all  and hath given you Victory over the World, that now the body of sin is ; and you are free from sin, and do not commit sin? but are every Mem∣  you without Spot and Wrinkle, and cleansed from all Unrighteousness,   Servants of Righteousness, and not of Sin? and whether you believe  Condition to be attainable in this life upon Earth, and to be enjoyed, and d for, yea, or nay? 5. What is your ground of sprinkling Infants with Water? and whether he th st instituted it, had the Gift of the Eternal Spirit, and was led thereby? for we know it was first ordain'd at Rome, in your Church; and all the Protestants received it from you, who are not able to give us a sufficient Reason thereof; but we are not satisfied therein; therefore tell us, Whether are people thereby made Mers of the Body of Christ, and baptized into his true Church? and is it a perfect Seal and Sign of the new Birth, and Regeneration, as is professed? and doth that give all Children, that are sprinkled, a Right to the Kingdom of God, and to be Members of the Church of Christ? and satisfie us plainly, Is the sprink∣ling of an Infant (never having heard the Gospel, but while unconverted and thanged in Nature) the true Baptism into the true Faith of Christ, as it is professed? answer me plainly, yea, or nay. 6. Whether the Body and Blood of Christ, that is Meat indeed, and Drink indeed, be carnal and visible things, to be seen, felt and known visibly and carnally? and whether Bread and Wine (that is Mortal, and will corrupt) be the very Body and the very Blood of Christ Jesus? and whether Christ hath any other Body and Blood, to be known in any other way or manner then what is professed to be visibly and carnally known by you? and is that Bread, af∣ter Consecration, the very Express Image of the Father, and was with the Fathe before the World began? else it is not the Body of Christ: answer me plainly. 7. Again, We are not satisfied concerning your Burning, and Torturing, and Imprisoning in cruel Inquisitions and Goals such as dissent from you, and cannot believe in your Church, which ye call Hereticks; whether is not this done by your Church, or any Member thereof? and do you justifie the doing of it by the Authority of your Church? and we demand of you to give us Ex∣ample
for such Practices in Scripture, ever Practised by the Apostles, or true Church, or any Member thereof, to Burn, or Kill, or Impris such as would not own them, or were Hereticks? otherwise, we must co it, and judge you eternally for it: And whether such Practices, done a , and in her Dominions, be not Murder, and Cruelty, and Tyranny,  shedding of Innocent Blood, and of the Devil, the Wicked One?  me plainly, and satisfie us herein, that we may know how to deal with   controversie. 8. Again, We are not satisfied concerning the abundance of  of the Saints, set up, and bowed to amongst you; and your praying  them, and to the Saints, and by Beads, and in Set-Forms; such th  practice; and also your keeping and setting apart the Saints dayes,   Holy-dayes, and eating with respect to dayes, denying of Flesh such   dayes, and observing of Dayes, and Meats and Drinks, and Fasting   own wills, and your Nunneries, and keeping Men and Women one fr ∣ther in secret Houses; whether are these things commanded and required   Lord from you? and we charge you to give us some Example, that  true Church practized such things; otherwise, if you do not, not ca  these your practices from the Scriptures, and Example of the Apo  you, we must deny you, and condemn your practies forever; and  ∣lieve, that your Church is the true Church, nor you lawful Successors   ∣ly Apostles. 9. What you believe concerning the Reign and Government of C, and his coming? is He, his Reign and Government visible, and of this World; or invisible, and from Heaven? and whether Lyars, Whoremongers, ∣terers, Drunkards, Man-slayers, and contentious Men, or any that  in any Sin or Transgression, in the first Nature; be of the Kingd  Go∣vernment of Jesus, or have any part or portion therein in time to  ∣ever? and how may such ever have part therein? and give us yo ge in these things: And also, what you hold and profess concerning E  Reprobation, that we may know whether your Knowledge and   sound and perfect in these things, and to be embraced, or condemned and . 10. What is the Man-child, that hath been caught up to God? and  the reason of his being caught up? and what is the Woman that fled into the Wilderness? and what is the reason of her so fleeing? and when is the t (is it come, or to come) that the Man-child hath been caught up, a  Woman fled, and that the Man-child shall come down again, and the W again return? and what is that Beast, the first and the second? and is s kingdom come, or yet to come, who reigned over the Kings of the Earth, and caused all, both small and great to worship him, and killed the Saints, and overcame them that would not worship him, and made war against the L, and persecuted the Woman's Seed? and when is it that the World wondred ∣ter the Beast, is it come, or to come? Answer these things in plainness,  ∣mand of you. 11. What, and who is that great Whore, that sits upon many waters with  the Kings of the Earth commits Fornications, and who hath made Nations d with the Wine of her Fornications, and who hath reigned over the  and Dominions of the Earth? and is that Whore come, or yet to come?  whether is your Church every whit free from the Fornications of that Wh and will you admit of lawfull trial by your fruits and works, and suffer  men accordingly? and whether the whole Church of Rome, or any part of  Dominions be the Multitudes, Peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, the W on which the Whore sits? and whether your Church be wholly free from  Woman which hath drunk the Blood of Saints, and of the Martyrs of I and shew us plainly who that Whore is, if you can; and what is her Flesh, and the Fire that must burnt it.
12. Whether are the false Prophets and Deceivers come, or to come, which  said should come? if you say, they are come; when did they come? and   they? and how may they be known? and what was their first original?   of what doth all false Prophets and false Prophecies come? is the Church clear of all the false Prophets? and whether is your Ministry in the very  Power, Spirit and Authority, which the Apostles were in? is its Call and tion the very same? is its Maintenance and Practice the very same? and is i Fruits, Effects and End the very same, or some other? let us know from you,   may ay you to the Line of true Judgment, for all People and Nations . ome Friends, let us reason a little with you further; We are not satis∣   Bishop of Re is true and lawful Successor of the Apostle Peter,   a Tripple Crown? and did Kings Bow and Kneel to him? and had enues, and Money out of the Nations, as the Pope hath? Pardons for Money  or did any buy Religion of him? and did over mens Consciences? and was Peter named Holiness? We you to prove rightly and truly. That the Pope doth succeed Peter Spirit, in the same Power, and in the same Conversation; and that er-see the Church be justly the same as Peter's was, and that he exe∣ ctly as Peter did. wer us plainly, What is the Seed of the Woman? and what is the  the Serpent? and is his Head bruised, yea, or nay? And what is the what is his beginning? and what is the kingdom that he is Ruler  and how is his kingdom to be destroy'd?

To the POPE. THou Mountain, hear the Word of the Lord God; thus saith th God unto thee; I will lay thee low; I will break thee down; I wi the glory of all Flesh; my Sword shall enter into the Hearts of my E will slay the Wicked; and I will cru the Head of the Ungodly; and grind the hard hearts unto pieces; I will come in a day unexpected; I Door, behold me; and I will take Vengeance without Pitty upon all mies; my Hand shall not spare, my Eye shall no pitty; but I will rend, and give unto thee, and unto all Mankind, the fruit of your ings: Innocent Blood cries unto me, that hath been unjustly shed, Righteous Soul groans under the Altar unto me; and now I am risen, begun to work in the Earth; and I will go through Nations, and down under my Power: I have raised a Seed which shall thrsh the Mo and my Word is gonforth out of my Mouth, which shall beat them to and my Power shall knock at thy Gates, and break down thy strength, shall prevail against thee. Oh thou Mountain I whose Seat is high, and whose Power is g who hath been able to make War with thee? Thou hast swallowed up and Needy; and thou hast eaten up the Innocent, as the Ox eateth up thou hast continued for Ages; and thou accountest thy self the most A and thou hast been without fear of any man; and thou hast not reg Honour of my Name; but exalted thy self altogether: But now saith the Dread of the Almighty shall come upon thee, and the Majesty of of Hosts shall appear terrible unto thee; and thou shalt know, there that can do whatsoever he will; and he will wound the mighty Men, shall heal them; and he will vex all his Enemies in his Displeasure; and break them, and none shall bind them up: Thy glory, and th glory   whole Earth, is as Grass before the Mower, and as the Flower of the Field, that  soon withered; and thy treasure, and the treasure of all Nations, is of no respect unto him; the Strength of the whole Earth is Weakness before him, and the Crowns of Princes he accounteth as the Dust; he treadeth over it all, and his Everlasting Arm reacheth beyond it all; and he is awakened, that will strike through Kingdoms, and that will stain the glory of the whole Earth, and tho must know his Power; and the Cup of his Wrath is full, of which all Nations shall drink, and none shall escape it: Prepare thy self; for the Anger of the Lord is gone forth; and the Almighty is grieved, because of the Abominations of the Earth; and he will cast into the Fire, and purge, and purifie, and new mold and correct Rulers, Kings and Peoples; for he hath long been grieved, and born the Iniquity of the Nations; but his Long-suffering is well-nigh finished; for the Nations have provoked him to Anger, and turned his Long-suffering in∣to Fury, and he hath put on the Garment of Vengeance; and the time is at hand, that Sorrow shall take hold on the Stout-hearted, when he appears, who hath been pierced; and Anguish and Pain shall come upon thee, and the World; and the Day of Trouble and great Distress ye shall not escape; the Rod of his Wrath shall smite you: The Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. And although thou art exalted as a God, yet thou shalt be a Man, and not a God in his Hand, that shall slay thee: and although thy Seat has been high, yet it shall be laid low as the Ground, and thy Honour shall be laid in the Dust; for thou art Dust and Ashes before the Lord, and thou shalt be no more admired, when Destruction shall come upon thee: The Lord hath viewed thy Way and Path, and they have not been upright before him; he hath entred into
the Secrets of thine Heart, and thy intent hath not been hid from him, and that which hath been done in secret shall now be laid open, and all secret things shall now be brought to Light; and all the Churches shall know, that he searches the Heart, and tries the Reins, who is a God, Great and Mty, and giveth unto all Creatures Life and Breath; and he will change at  all the Children of Men, and bring them to an Account before his Seat: wherefore let all Flesh tremble before him, and let all the earth  his Presence, who changeth, and subdueth and over-turneth at his P, and brings men to destruction who have rebell'd against him. fore thou Pope, chief Bishop at Rome, this is unto thee from the Mouth of ; Come down, come down, lay down thy Crown, subject thy self, before the Lord God of Vengeance, lest come upon thee, and crush ; and thou shalt know, that this hath the Lord spoken, in the day, ry flaming Sword, which is already drawn, enters into thy Bosom, thy Honour and Renown. Behold I have heard the Voice of Houl∣er Lamentation; I have heard the Voice of War; and not of Peace; I I have seen the Strong become Weak, and the Mighty become Misera∣b ud and Honourable brought into Contempt, yea I have seen her th a Queen, and has said, She never shall see Sorrow; I have seen the los n and Widdowhood come upon her, even in one day; I have seen her B ed into Bitterness; I have seen her Honour brought into Contempt; I Whore, that has made all Nations drunk with her Fornications, t the Golden Cup in her hand; I have seen the Cup of Indignation p her to drink; I have seen her cast upon the Bed of never-ceasing , I have seen the City, that was full of people, that was the Glory of I , that made all Nation rich with her Traffick and Merchandize; I that City laid desolate, and dis-inhabited, and made the Sorrow of the Earth; and I have seen the smoak of her burning ascend forever: and this is  must shortly come to pass; and if thou hast an Ear to hear, thou mayst and these things are true and faithful, and they shall not fail; but the W shall know the Majesty, Dread and Terror, the Vengeance and Indig∣ of the Almighty.

A 1659 FAITHFUL TESTIMONY, Concerning the True Worship OF GOD: VVhat it is in it self, and who are the True WORSHIPPERS. In Opposition to all the False Worship in this Nation, which is Idolatry, which is discover'd in its Foundation, and in its Mani∣festation, not to be ever commanded of God, or practized by his Apostles and Saints; but it is declar'd to consist chiefly of such things and practices as had their first Beginning and Ordination in the Church of Rome; whereby the Hypocrisie of this Generation doth appear, in denying, and crying against the Papists Idolatries, and yet are found in the practice of the same thing in their Church, Ministry and Worship, which were first instituted by the Pope's Authority. FOrasmuch as there is in the World a great Controversie among people, concerning the Worship of God; one crying, This is the right Worship; another, That is the right Worship: And people in these Nations are divi∣ded about the Worship of God, and divers one from another in their Perfor∣mances and Practices of Worship; one sort worshipping after this manner, another after that; and there is great strife through the whole Nation about this matter, and a great dis-satisfaction among people, which is the right Wor∣ship, and who are the right Worshippers; and Thousands are desiring after the right Worship of God, and to become Worshippers of him as he requires: Therefore now it is upon me to shew unto all the World, what the true Worship of God is in it self, and who are his true Worshippers. First, The Worship of God in it self is this, It is a walking with God, and a living with him in Converse and Fellowship, in Spirit and Truth; for he is only worshipped therein; and to do the Truth, and speak the Truth: This is the True Worship of God, where the Mind is guided with the Spirit of Truth, and the Presence of the Lord felt at all times, and his Fear in the Hearts of peo∣ple, and his Councel stood in, and his Covenant felt, which unites to the Lord in Spirit; this is the True Worship of God; and it is without respect of times or things.
And now none upon Earth can thus worship God, but who are changed and renewed in heart and mind, and born of the Spirit, and led thereby, where the Body of Sin and Death is put off, such as are redeemed out of the World, and out of all its wayes and nature; such only can worship God in the Spirit and in the Truth, and such is the Father seeking to worship him now in this pre∣sent Age: And there is never a one upon Earth, that can worship God as he requireth, who remain unchanged, and are in the Transgression, unrenew∣ed and unconverted, such cannot worship the True and Living God; but that which they perform and practice, as the Pretence of his Worship, is Idolatry and Abomination, and the Lord hath not required it at their hands; for none can walk with God, nor have unity with him, but who are renewed and chan∣ged; nor none can do the Truth, and speak the Truth in all things, but such who are led by the Spirit of Truth; and such are in the Covenant of God, and true Worshippers of him; and all that is contrary, is not the Worship of God, but Idolatry, as I have said. And now as concerning this Worship practiced in England, in these Steeple-Houses, Churches (so called) it is not the Worship of the Living God, but Superstition and Idolatry; for people have not learned it by the Teachings of the Spirit, neither doth the Spirit lead them therein; but it standeth in Form, without Power, and in the Inventions and Traditions of the Fathers; and there is not in it the manifest Presence of God, neither do you Worshippers meet with the Lord, nor enjoy his pure Life and Presence in your Practices; and the substance of your Worship (as it is now practized) is made up of In∣ventions, some part of your own, and some part brought along from the church of Rome. And is it not great Hypocrisie in you, to profess a denyal of the Church of Rome, and yet be found practizing some of the same things as your Worship, which the Church of Rome first instituted, and practized as her Worship? Shall we instance unto you some particular things? Was it not by the Authority of the Church of Rome, that these Houses, in which you worship, which you call Churches, were first set up, and made Worshipping-places for them? And is it not a little while since that the Mass, and old Popish stuff, was therein exercised with as great Zeal towards God (if not with as good Sincerity) as you practice yours at this day? And are there not the very Signs and Symptoms of the Romish Idolatry yet upon these Houses, being full of Images on the Walls, and on the Pil∣lars, and on the Glass-Windows, and Crosses about them, and many other things, which were Popish Inventions; as also, the Names given unto them, and conse∣crated Bells in them, and such like stuff? And was it not a little while since there were the Altars, and the Rails, and the Font, and other such like things, which lately were broken down? But however, though something there may be al∣tered, and changed, and converted to another use, and something taken away, and other Inventions brought in instead thereof, yet still they are the same Houses which you worship your Godd in; which Houses were set up by the Authority of the Pope; and there remaineth yet the Pope's Sign and Symp∣tom of the Romish Church upon them; and these Houses you call your Chur∣ches; and Thousand of Thousands of blind ignorant people, esteeming and respecting in their minds of these Places, more then of any other, supposing them to be more holy, and that other Places are not so good to worship in. Alas! poor, blind, ignorant people, that deceive your own Souls in the Tra∣ditions and Inventions of man, which you live in the practice of, supposing it to be the very Worship of God, which is no other in it self but Idolatry, and you Idolaters; for, do not all Unconverted People, and Unrighteous People, such who are not taught of the Lord, nor led by his Spirit, but dai∣ly rush into Iniquity, and into evil; are not such found Worshippers here in Steeple-Houses, conforming themselves to these things, and these pra∣ctices? And can such worship God? Or is God worshipped by such?
I tell you nay; the Lord God is pure, and they that worship him must be sancti∣fied, and led by his Spirit, which leadeth into all Truth. But now, as concerning your present Practices, which your Worship con∣sisteth of; they are not such as ever the Lord instituted, but such as men have set up in their own wills and wisdom, and not in the Lord's: As for your sprink∣ling of Infants, which is a chief Practice of your Worship; was not this first ordained at Rome? read the Records: And was it not a Popish Invention, which you are thus zealously reforming, as if it were indeed required of the Lord? Can the Unconverted and Unregenerated be truly baptized into the Faith of Christ? No: But the Unconverted and Unregenerated are Partakers of your Baptism, into the Faith which you profess. There was no such practice in the Christian Church, before the Apostacy; but when the Apostacy came in, then came up these Inventions & Immitations, which you practice as the Worship of God, when as he never required it; neither did his Saints, and his Apostles, ever give you Example for it; and by it, nor in it God is not worhsipped; neither is in it self, nor as practized by you, any part of the Worship of God; but stands in the Inventions of man, and is after their Traditions, and not af∣ter the Commandments of the Lord. And as for your singing of David's Experiences in the form and manner as you do, practizing it as another main part of your Worship; This is the same with the former, neither ever commanded of the Lord; nor (in the course and manner as you do it) was it ever practized by the Saints of old; and is it any better then a Popish Invention? For was the Nation in any better state then Popery, when that practice was first instituted, and begun to be perform∣ed? you your selves will confess, that it was in the time of Darkness, and through the Ordination of the Bishops and Prelates, whom you your selves say, were little better then Papists in their Worship and Practice; and yet this you practice at this day, as a part of your Worship, which hath no bet∣ter beginning then as I have said; and from them you have received it, to wit, From the Bishops and Prelates: Yea, the chief part of your Wor∣ship consisteth of the performances of such things as you have received Traditionally from them, and from Rome; for all these things they insti∣tuted. And as concerning your Ministry; Is it any other with that, then with these particulars, as I have mentioned? Is it not the same Ministry in substance, though in some particulars altered, as was in the dayes of Popery and Prelacy? Have not your Ministers the same Call to their Ministry, Practice in their Mini∣stry, & Maintenance at this day, as was in Generations past, when this Nation was under the cloud of darkness & Ignorance, as your selves will confess? are not they made Ministers now by natural Learning, receiving Ordination from man, through the attainments of such Arts, and Sciences and Degrees, through natural Learning and humane Policy, not having their Ministry by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, no more then the Papists and Prelates had before them, who were made Ministers by the same Power, and after the same manner, as these are. And it was the Church of Rome, and by the Popish Authority, that Colledges and Schools, to make Ministers by them, were first ordained and set up; and as that Ministry was sent forth in the time of Popery, by the same way and means (generally are as to substance) are your Ministers now sent forth, though in some particulars differing in matters of Form, yet the same for substance: But Christ's Ministers, in the time of the true Church, were not thus sent forth, but had received Power from on High, and the Gift of the Holy Ghost, where∣by they were made able Ministers; and not by any other thing, nor by any such means or way as your Ministers now are set up and established: and this Ministry is differing from the true Ministry, which Christ sent forth, and is not according, but contrary in all things; and it is not the Ministry of God, neither brings people to God; for by this Ministry people are not converted;
but are such as they that the true Prophet cryed against, saying, They have run, saith the Lord, and I have not sent them; therefore they shall not profit the People at all. And as for this Maintenance of the Ministry of the Church of England; is it not the same as was in the dayes of Popery and Prelacy? was it not by the Pope's Authority, that Tythes were first established, and set up to be the Maintenance of his Ministry? And did not the Romish Church first ordain, that the people should give the tenth to the use of Religion, and to maintain their Ministry? if you search the Records, you will find it so. And was it not the very practice of the Papists and Prelates Ministers, to have Hire, and great sums of Money by the Year, and Stipends, and large Benefits for preaching? and the same things are practised by these Ministers, which they have borrowed from the Papists and Prelates, which went before them; for are not these Ministers maintained by Tythes, as the Pope's Ministers were? And have they not Hire, and great sums of Money by the Year, or Quarterly, even as the Papists and Prelates had? Wherefore it is plain, that the Maintenance of your Ministers is the very same for substance, as theirs was that went before you, which you your selves say were Idolaters; and if they were Idolaters, how can your Ministers be free, which do practice the very same things, unto the very fame end? And do not the Priests of this Generation far exceed the Papists and Prelates. Was there ever, in Generations past, such casting peo∣ple into Prison, and spoiling peoples Goods, as is at this day, through the means of these Priests, and all about their Maintenance, and for their Tythes, and Hire, and yearly Stipends, and quarterly Gain? Did ever the Papists or Prelates worse in this particular, with any people that denyed them Wa∣ges, then these do that denyed them. Oh! great Blindness and Ignorance is over your hearts, and great Hypo∣crisie among your Ministers, who profess a Denyal and Dissenting from the Church of Rome, and cry against them, as Hereticks, and that they are in Ig∣norance, and yet practice the very same things: Their Call is the very same to their Ministry, and their Maintenance the same, and Practice in many things the very same as theirs was, which they seem to deny; and this is great Hypocrisie, to cast out and kill their Persons, and yet to uphold in many things their practice, relating to their Worship and their Ministry. Oh abo∣minable Idolatry! the Hand of the Lord is against it. But this is not the way that Christ's Ministers were maintained; they had no such Hire, nor great Sums of Money, nor yearly Tythes, as these Ministers have through the Pope's Institution; But into whatsoever House they entred, that was worthy, they might eat such things as were set before them; and the Apostles might freely reap carnal things, where they had sown spiritual things; but this was after another manner, and after another nature; for if they had not that, yet did they not cast men into Prison, and spoil their Goods that would not give it them, as this Generation of Teachers do: And the Lord God is risen to confound this Worship, and this Ministry, which is Idolatry; and this Church, which is but a feigned Immitation: and he will establish his true Worship, that is in Spirit and in Truth; and his true Ministry, that is by the Gift of the Holy Ghost; and his true Church; and this shall be brought to pass in his Day. But again, There is another Practice which you have, which the Church of Rome and the Prelates had (your Predecessors) If any come in the Name of the Lord to declare against you, and against your Abomination, to cry against your Sin, and cry Repentance among you, that you may be converted to God; this you account a great Transgression, and persecute them that do it, by Imprisoning, and Whipping, and Stocking, and by imposing great Fines
upon them, and causing them to suffer cruel things; and this did the Papists and Prelates, in like manner as you do; if any were moved to cry against them, they indeed rewarded them, even as you do at this day; the same thing you do against such as are moved of the Lord to come among you; and herein you succeed them, and bring forth the same Persecution in your Churches, as they did in their Churches; and this is the defence of your Church, and of your Ministry, Car∣nal Weapons, Imprisonment, and Whipping, and Stocking, and causing the Bodies of people to suffer through Cruelty and Injustice; and by this means is your Church and Ministry defended and preserved; or otherwise, it would pre∣sently fall, as not being able to continue, nor resist, nor gain-say the Spirit and Power of God, which now is risen to oppose them, if they had not carnal Laws, and earthly Powers, and Goals, and Houses of Correction to defend themselves by: And is this the Church of Christ? and is this Christ's Ministry, that has need of such Weapons as these? The Apostles and true Churches never did thus, nei∣ther sent people to Prison that opposed them, nor had such Cruelty to execute upon the Bodies of people, though many did oppose them out of Wickedness; but the Spirit and Authority of the Lord did defend them from all their Enemies. But your church and ministry is manifest to be another then that was, and to be defended by another means, even by the same means that the Papists and Pre∣lates of old were of a long time defended by; but when the measure of these things are fulfilled, they will come to an end; as the measure of that Generati∣on's Iniquity was fulfilled, which went before you; so in the Lord's season will your measure be fulfilled, and the Lord's People shall be free, and all Bonds of Iniquity broken. And thus it is manifest, that this Church and Ministry succeeds the Church of Rome, and her Ministers, far more then the Church of Christ, and its true Ministers; and to that it is not equal in any thing, but to the Church of Rome it is comparable in many things: so that it is manifest, that this Church and Ministry is not quite another then the Church and Ministry of Rome; but such as have dissented from them, and are truly sprung out of that Root, and is the same still in substance, though differing in some Practices, having cast out some old Inventions, and brought in some new; but, as I have said, remain still the same in nature and substance, though diffented in some particulars, yet succeed in many particulars, as I may shew more fully hereafter. And though you bare the Name, and stile your selves, The Reformed Chur∣ches; you mean, reformed from the Church of Rome: But how are you reformed, but by some visible Appearances, and not in the Ground, having put off but some of her Garments, and remain the same Body for substance in nature and matter, though differing only in Appearances? For, the Church, which is the True Church of Christ, is not thus reformed, on∣ly changed in part, and altered in degrees; but the true Church denyeth the church of Rome in her very Beeing and Ground, and in all her Practi∣ces whatsoever; for, though many Sects have risen one from another, yet all the same for substunce, only differing in particulars. But as for you, to whom this Particular is written, that Worship God in Steeple-Houses; you are not so much differing from the church of Rome, as many others are, which are not true Churches neither; but the Lord God is now gathering his people: wherefore, come out of your Idol-Worship, and Idol-Temples, for God dwells not in them, nor is not worshipped there, but he dwells and walks in his Saints, and is worshipped in Spirit and in Truth; and his Day is dawned, and his Glory risen, and he will confound this church and ministry, which bears the Mark of the Romish Whore, and have her Symptoms and Characters remaining upon them unto this day, as it is manifest. Object. And though some may object, and say, That God commanded a Temple
to be ilded for the worship of his Name, and Ordinances to be practised in the time of the old Covenant. To which I do say, yea, it was so, a Temple was builded by Solomon for the Seed of the Iews to worship in, and to come to Sacrifice to the Lord in, and there was an outward Worship, and Ordinances; but it is many hundred years since this Temple was destroyed, and Worship and Ordinances thrown down, which God once commanded, and his people once practiced; and Christ the Life, the Power and Wisdom of God, was the Substance thereof, and unto whom he was made manifest, and in whom he was revealed in the Spirit, they utterly renounced and denied the Temple, and the worship therein, though once God had commanded it; and the Saints after the manifesting of Christ to them in Spirit, and after that the Holy Ghost was given, we do not find through all the Churches of the Saints, that they worshipped in the Temple of the Iews; but witnessed against it, and said, That God dwelt not in Temples made with hands, neither was he worshipped in Temples made with hands; but in the Spirit and in the Truth their Worship consisted, and there∣fore were persecuted; but they bare Testimony against the Temple, and the Worship, and those Ordinances, which God once had commanded, and which once his People practized, though it was to the peril of their lives. But as for these Temples, and these Ordinances, and this Worship, which are now on foot; they were never brought forth by any Ordination or Commandment of God; but the Foundation of them is the Inventions of Men, and Mens Tra∣ditions taught them, and not the Spirit of the Lord; and therefore against those things, those Temples, and those Ordinances and Worships, much reason have we to cry against them all, as being neither Sign nor Substance of good, but wholly Inventions of men. The Iews Temple and Ordinances were Signs of good things to come, and when the Substance was come the Saints deny'd the Shaddows and the Figures; but as for these, they are deny'd wholy, as being Idolatry and Abomination, from the beginning to the end of them; for, as I have shown, These things (which are the matter of which your Worship and Ordinance doth consist) had their rise and beginning in the dayes of Darkness and Ignorance, since the Apostacy came in: and so, in the Name and Authority of the Lord, we do declare against them, even against your Temples and whole Worship, to the intent, to bring you to the true Worship, that is in Spirit and in Truth, and that you might know your bodies the Temples of God, and that he might dwell in you, and walk in you, according as be hath promised in the New Covenant. Wherefore all people, awake, and come out of your Idolatry, and idolatrous Worships; separate your selves, touch no more of it, that the Lord may re∣ceive you, and that you may come into his Covenant, which is Life and Peace for your souls; for in those Worships, and Temples, and all your Practices therein, you have not true peace with the Lord, nor the Refreshments from his pure Presence; but Sin and Death reigns amongst you, and great ignorance is over your hearts, and Idolatry corrupts your minds, and the Lord hath been forgotten by you dayes without number: God is not well-pleased, neither hath any delight in your Worship; for your worship of him, and fear towards him, is but taught by the Precepts of men, and by the Traditions of the Fathers, in the dayes of Popery; and if ever he opens your Eyes, you will see it; for it is with the humble and contrite in heart that the Lord dwells, him that trembleth at the Word of the Lord, whose heart is right in his sight, and hath learned his Judgments and Fear; and such as are changed and renewed, and born of the Seed of God, and begotten by his powerfull Word; such are the true Wor∣shippers whom the Lord is seeking, and such will he find to worship him. And whereas there is a great cry amongst you, and among many people at this day, about Deceivers, and being deceived; you say, and your Cry is one to another, Take heed you be not deceived, by false Teachers, and false Doctrine:
This is the Cry of Parents to Children, and Children to Parents; and   sters to Servants, and of Servants to Masters; and chiefly it is the Cry of  Priests to the people, Take heed yo be not , &c. Now to all this I do say, That there are many Deceivers, and many are ved, this is certainly true, and plainly manifest: But now, to shew Deceiver is, and what it is to be deceived, and who they are that ar  ceived. First, That is a Deceiver, that Person, that spirit, or that thing that eth or inticeth the Minds of people into something, to do, or practce,  speak something which the Lord by his Spirit doth not lead to. I say, That which leads the Creature to take up a Joy, or a Delight, Happiness in something of this World, which is under the Sun, to place fidence or felicity in such a thing; that which thus leadeth or draweth the whether it be person or spirit, it is a Deceiver, and deceiveth the Soul; or they, that do follow this, and give up themselves into the obedience to do, or speak something, that is contrary to God, or which his Spirit not lead unto, nor guide in; this person is deceived of the Presence of the  and of the Comfort, and Joy, and Happiness that is in him, and hath ple and joy in something of the Creation, that is not of him, but besides  and this Person is deceived, and in Deceit, who hath placed a Joy, and Happi and Confidence in some Creature, or thing, that is not perfectly the Lord; another spirit, besides the Spirit of the Lord, hath seated it self in the  and taken possession of the Mind, and the Mind and Heart is thereby ca∣ted by that way, in the works and pleasures of this World; and this is a ∣ved estate: and thus much of a Deceiver, and Deceiving in the ground, in  declared. But now, You that are crying one to another, Be not deceived, be not ; Are you not such as are deceived already, and lie wallowing in the Deceit, and Vanity, and Evil of this World? For, while sin hath power over you, and that Spirit that is not of God doth lead you, you are deceived; and thus it is with you, being unchanged and unrenewed in Mind and Heart, are not you deceived? For you want the feeling of the Presence, and of the Comfort of the Lord God, and you are deceived of that, for that you have not; and another thing possesseth your minds, and the Joy and Pleasure of this World; and in your Exercise, spiritual and temporal, the spirit that is of this World doth lead you and guide you, the spirit of Unrighteousness, that leadeth contrary to him; and can you be otherwayes deceived, or more deceived? For you are without God already, and want his Peace, and the Inheritance of Life Eter∣nal, that is in him, you want the possession thereof; and you are following dead Idols and Vanities, which steal away your minds, whereby it is manifest that you are deceived: For, all people upon Earth, that are not led by the Spi∣rit into all Truth; that have not received the Promise of the Father, they are all deceived, and cannot be more deceived then they are. And so is the Cry in ge∣neral among people, if any one forsake and deny their way of Worship, and Religion, and Profession, be it of what manner or nature soever, presently there is a Cry, (chiefly by the Priests, Take heed you be not deceived; and you are in Heresie, and Error, and such like: Thus have the Papists cryed against them that have dissented from them, and the Prelates cry'd the same, and now yo cry the same to them that dissent from you: But your Zeal is not so much against Heresie and Error, simply so, as it is to have your own Sect and Worship upheld, and against them that do dissent from you; and it hath been Anti∣christs way, since the Apostacy, since the dayes of the Apostles, to cry, Here∣sie, and Error, and you are deceived, to all that did decline and dissent from him; for you may read in the Scriptures, Power was given to the Beast, to compel all to worship him, and all that would not, he made War against, and had power to kill them▪

And as for your Worship in Steeple-Houses, God hath no Delight in, he th it not, but it is an Abomination to him; it is not pleasing to him, bee you be out of his Spirit, and worship after your own Traditions, after his Spirit: And this worship hath stood all this long time of An∣, while the Whore and the Beast hath ruled over Nations; and so one Tradition after another hath been brought in, and one false Worship hath risen out of another; and what people have had, it hath been by Tradition, and not from the immediate Spirit of God; and so the True God hath not been wod in his Spirit: And now all the World have been pleading for the Traditions, and they be in respect above the Commandments of God, among ye that worship in Steeple-houses; you are even mad against them that inst the Steeple-houses, and plead the Antiquity of your Worship,   your Traditions and Ordinances; now they are ancient, even as an∣ci s since the false Prophets and Antichrist came in, and did put on the Sh Clothing, but inwardly ravening Wolves; these killed the Life, and slew the Prophets, and they set up Inventions of their own: and your Tradi∣tio and Worships are as ancient as since power was given to the Beast over Kindreds and Peoples; and the Lord God is bringing down your Worship, the Original of which came up when Antichrist went out into the World, as you may read in Iohn's Epistle, and so you may plead Antiquity; yet not as ancient as the True Church is; for when the tru Churches were apostati∣zed, then came up your Worship, and your many Traditions; and this hath been while the Woman hath been fled into the Wilderness, and the Man-child caught up to God, which when the Woman returns again, your wor∣ship & ordinance will be over-thrown, and the True Worship again established, and Liberty; but first you must know the Spirit to teach you, before you can
worship in it; and the Spirit must purifie your Hearts, and make them  before you can offer to God an acceptable Sacrifice; for your Sacrifices are not acceptable, but they are stained and polluted in the fight of the Lord, who  hath beheld what you are a doing; and you are in that which his Soul hath no Pleasure in; and in the Day of your ation, the Witness in your Consci∣ences shall answer it: so you are to know God by his Spirit, before you can wor∣ship him; the Word of the Lord must be  in your Hrt as a  as a Ham, and  mu be cr   ad have Spirit, ore ye can  .

Some False Principles And ERRORS DISCOVERED And REFUTED: Answer to a Catechism-Book, which is said to contain, The Principles of Religion; put forth by a nameless Author: But is supposed to be the work of one Samuel Eaton, a professed Minister of the Gospel, among the Sect of the Independants, in Chshire. But upon true Examination, he is found to be teaching the Traditions of Men, for the Commandments of Christ; and his Principles are proved to be not according, but contrary to the SPIRIT of GOD and the Scriptures. To the READER. THE Reason and Cause of this being sent abroad, is for the better Infor∣mation of all; but more particularly for the good of that Assembly, to whom Samuel Eaton is Minister and Pastor, that they may know the Truth from Error, and the Way of Righteousness from all false Wayes; and may turn fr Idol-Shepherds, that destroy the Vine-yard, and tread it down; and may  to Christ, and receive him, who is the chief Shepherd, to feed his Flock with the Bread of Eternal Life. And the Reason why these False Principles are charged upon Samuel Eaton, is this, It being doubtful to some, who was the Author of that Catechism, wherein these Principles and Doctrines were held forth; John Gredley and Anne Sheeld by name, were with the said Samuel Eaton, and asked him, If he owned that Book (the Catechism?) and he said, He would maintain all in it: That   Answer. THE Wayes of the Lord are Equal and Just, but the wayes of the Sons of Adam are altogether corrupted, and different and contrary to the Wayes of Salvation: And the Wisdom that is of this World is Foo∣lishness with God, and its End is Destruction to its self, and to all that walk
therein. And what is Man, that he shall prescribe a Way to his Maker and who is it that will be more wise then God, to et him a Way how he must ch his People? Therefore in-vain have men laboured, and have reaped to ∣selves nothing but Wind and Confusion; And in va have they sown   to reap after them, whose Fruit hath been Emptiness, and not filled the Hand of the Gatherer. And in particular, this Book, with which I am now ∣ing, is the Fruit of an empty. Tree, which cannot satisfie the hungry , nor comfort the weary Seeker; for, the Satisfaction and Comfort of the ∣ing hungry Soul dependeth only upon the Lord, and upon the Bread of fe, that commeth down, from God; and the soul that ea thereof is ed and comforted forever, and hungereth no more, nor thirsteth any sl; but the Fountain is in him, and the Well springeth up unto Eternal Life  goes no more forth. And if so be that all herein were true and sou Do, and were learned, so as to express it over again in words, this might be, the soul still remaining in Anguish, and under Sin and Death, though  in the Knowledge that is from below, and yet in a farther Ignorance of God; for the wisdom of this World knows not God, neither can it teach not receive the knowledge of the things that pertain unto Life Eternal; but to the Se, and to Fools, doth the Lord teach and reveal the Knowledge of his Kingdom; and it is not received from Books, nor the Teachings and Tradition of  by the Manifestation of the eternal Spirit, which doth lead into all Truth, e∣veals the Mysteries of Salvation. The first thing that I take notice of, is this, thou sayst, God is a Spirit▪  he is one in Beeing, and is to be distinguished into three Persons; and the Father,   Holy Ghost are Personal Relations; and if one be a Person, such are the other, &c. Answ. The Father, Son, and Spirit is one; this we believe and know, ac∣cording to the Scriptures: but, as for thy word, Person, that is car  oo low a word to denominate God by, who is Infinite; for God and the Spirit hath no Person, nor cannot truly be distinguished into Persons; for a person has relation to Place Time and Change, and is not in all places at all ties at e; and the Scriptures know no such distinction; for God is a Spirit, and hath, no relation to one Time, Place or Alteration more then another, but filleth Heaven and Earth, and his Presence is in all, and over all, who is ble for∣ever, and is infinite, and without Person, or confined Beeing; and the Sp∣ture no where, in true Translation, doth denominate God, Christ and the Spirit by Persons, and Personal Beeings, nor doth distinguish them into ee Persons; for Persons are related to carnal, as I have said; and Persons is oo low to denominate God, and Christ, and the Spirit by. So thy Principles are unsound, and not agreeing to the Spirit of God, and the Scriptures; and there∣fore not to be believed, nor received. Whereas thou sayst, That the one standing Rule, according to which God is to b ht, worshipped and served, is the holy Scriptures; in which God hath revealed himself in all things, which he would have believed, and doe, &c. Answ. It is the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures, which Spirit was, and is within the Saints, that leadeth into all Truth, and teacheth to k all things; and that Spirit of God only is the standing Rule to walk in, and to walk by, it was the Rule to Abel, Enoch, Abraham, and the rest of the ly Fathers, that lived before any Scripture was written; and it was the Ru to the Prophets, to Christ, and to the holy Apostles; they all followed the Spirit, and walked in it; and spake, and wrought, and acted as the Spirit of God within them moved them, and led them; it was not the Scriptures, but the Spirit, that gave forth the Scriptures, that was the standing, unchangle, un-erring Rule of worshipping, serving and obeying the Lord God▪ and that same Spirit is the standing Rule to us also: For the Apostle commandeth,
is the Spirit; and that which we are to walk in is our Rule; And as many  the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God; and then the Spirit is their  and that guides the Feet in the Way of Peace: And in the Spirit is God pped; For they that worship him, must worship him in the Spirit and in the ▪ and such he seeketh to worship him: For, it is in the Hearts of his People,  within them, that God revealeth himself by his Spirit: For it is the Spirit the thing f God; and none knoweth the things of God, saving by the  of God▪ and that revealeth God, and teacheth to worship God? and to serve him▪ And the Scriptures they declare of the Rule, and of the Revelati∣  God, and are a Declaration, of all things which are to be believed and  by the Children of the Lord: so that the Scriptures are not the  Rule, neither do they teach to worship and serve God; but the Spi∣ ve forth the Scriptures, that is the standing Rule, in, and through tions▪ and the Spirit doth reveal the Knowledge of God, and how  worshipped and served. And thou sayst. The Scriptures are the Word of God, given by immediate In∣  God; and that they are given to all men, to be read: And the Scrip∣ cient to make the Man of God perfect, and throughly furnished; and   nto Salvation: And the Scriptures are plain, and easie to be y the simplest; and there is Milk in them for Babes, and strong Meat for  grown up. ▪ Christ is the Word of God, and his Name is called, The Word of  and the Word of God was in the Beginning, and shall endure fore∣ver: and this Word is not the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are not the Word; but the Scriptures are words of God, given forth from the Word,  was in their Hearts; that spake forth the Scriptures; which were wrote  the Holy Men of, God were moved by the Holy Ghost, and given by the Inspiration of the Spirit of God: And the Scriptures are a Declaration and a tise of the WORD that was in the Beginning, and shall endure for∣; but the Scriptures are not the Word: And some of them were gi∣ to one sort of Men, and some of them to another, and some of them ▪ But as for the Threatnings and Judgments propounded, and the Re∣proof of the Wicked, that part was not given to the Saints, nor spoken to em, and so not given to all; and the Promises to the Children of the Lord, and the Epistles to the Saints, and them that were sanctified, that part was not given and spoken to the World, and to the Wicked, who are un∣ted, and so not spoken to all; though all may read them, yet none can understand them, but by the same Spirit that gave them forth; and who have not the same Spirit, to guide them, they cannot understand the Scrip∣tures; for they were given forth by the Eternal Spirit; and the carnal dom, that is from below, and sensual, cannot understand nor receive the gs of the Kingdom of God, which are declared of in the Scriptures: And so the Scriptures are not easie to be understood, but are sealed from the World; ither are the Scriptures without Faith (which thou hast left out) sufficient to make the Man of God perfect; but the Scriptures, through Faith, are able to make the Man of God perfect, and throughly furnished; this we know and re; and do set the Scriptures in their right place, and give them their right Hour and Respect. And as for thee and thy Generation, who are erred from the Spirit of Truth, You know not the Scriptures, nor the Power of God; for Christ is the Bread of Life, and the Water of Life; in him is the Milk for Babes, and  for strong Men, and not in the Scriptures, who testifie of Christ the Life; and in them the Phariss thought to have Eternal Life, but would not come  Christ, the End of the Scriptures, that they might have Life; and this
is the self same state with yours of this, Age who think to have the perf of Salvation, and the Milk for Babes, and the Meat for Strong Men in the Scriptures: but will not receive Christ, who is the perfect Salvation, and  Bread and Water, of Life, for all the Children of the Lord, who are the Spirit: And so thy Doctrines, and thy Principles of thy Religion,  not sound, nor agreeing with the Scriptures; but contrary, and by a spirit; and therefore we cannot be of thy mind, but do truly unlearned of the Father, and knowest not the Way of Salvation, and so▪  canst not truly inform nor direct others. And thou sayst. Men are under a Necessity of multiplying Transg 3. 12. Ephes. 4. 17. 2. Pet. 4. Answ. In this thou hast erred, and spoken contrary to sound D▪  there is no Necessity laid upon any to commit any sin, much less a Ne multiplying Transgression; if there be a necessity, who layes it ▪ and why is that Necessity? Transgression is of the Wicked One, and is of the Devil, and there is no necessity for that upon any account sin destroyes the Soul, and is a Veation to the Lord God, and a C lasting Misery; and for to act that, there is no▪ Necessity, which hath fects: And thou hast perverted the Scriptures quoted by thee, to prove Assertion; which I have set down for the Reader to pese, that all , thou hast perverted them; for they prove no such Doctrines, as that▪ a Necessity of multiplying Transgression, which thou hast affirmed, and the Scriptures to prove it; which is; first, false doctrine uttered by thee it  also a perverting of the Scriptures to maintain it; and this two Evil▪  thou hast committed in one Work; and because thou hast done Evil, at thy Door, and there I will leave it. And thou sayst, To be justified is not to be really lansed from all Sin▪ take of real Righteousness and Holiness; but it is to be accounted and reput Holy, and not to have Sin reckoned, &c. Answ. There are none justified, but who are in Christ, and are chan and renewed; and born again; and such are cleansed from sin; For he of God sinneth not: and it is he only that is justified, and not the Old Man, that is unchanged, and commits sin; he is not justified: and who are born of God▪ and are justified, are really cleansed, and do partake of Righteousness and ho∣liness, even of the Righteousness and Holiness of the Son of God▪ and in that Righteousness he is accounted▪ Righteous, and in no other, nor   other way, then by receiving Christ and his Righteousness, and being made Partkers of it in their▪ Hearts; for the Apostle said, If Christ be not in you,  are Reprebates; and such are not justifieth, nor accounted just and holy▪ who▪ have not Christ within them, and his Righteousness; but who have Christ with∣in, the Hope of Glory, and are accounted Just and Righteous in the sight of God, the Body of Sin is put off; for if Christ be in you, the Body is dead because▪  Sin; and such are really cleansed; and if he be in you, you are made Parta▪ of real Righteousness and Holiness: and this is the Truth of the Gospel of Christ, which confounds and condemns thy false doctrine; for no man it ac∣counted and imputed just and holy, but who are cleansed from Sin, and are in Christ; for, who do commit Sin are Unholy, and so reputed of God, and Sin is neckoned to them; and this all will find in the Day of the Lord, when  cometh to judge righteously, and to give every man according to his Works▪ and nor according to what he may make a shew of, and profess in words: thou all you false Daubers with Untempored Morter, heal up the Hurt of the Daugh∣ter of Sin deceitfully, and cry, Peace, Peace, by a false applying the Pro∣ses and Words of Christ, when God speaks no Peace; and even you▪ and you▪ false daube Wall, will the Whirlewind of the Lord beat down, and destroy▪ utterly: And this I assert, contrary to thy false Doctrine and Principles. T none are justified, but who have Christ in them, and really partake of Holiness and
sness, and are really cleansed from all Sin, and are born of the Spirit of God,  of the Pr of Eternal Life. thou sayst▪ Iusti  not of any Dgree▪  if a Person from any on Sin▪ he is justifieth from all Sin▪  well from Si to be committed, are already coed▪ and who is  a  Person, is not unjustified upon &c. Answ. Grace and Faith, and Truth, and Christ himself admitteth of De∣▪ which are one; and there are several Measures of Life, of and Faith, of Sanctification, and of Justification also; for,  as every man hath received Christ, so hath he received Sanctification , and no otherwise; for, Christ is made Wisdom▪ and San∣ctication, and Salvation; and every one feels his Sanctification and his Justifica∣▪  to the Measure of the Gift of Christ; so that there are seve∣ of Justification▪ And also, a man may be justified from one sin, , and not from all sin; for, according to every man's Sanctificati∣ Witness of his Justification to him, and no more; and if thou ing by Experience, thou knowest this: And no man is justified which he is to commit; for that saith gives Licence to sin: if any, sin, shall believe, that that sin is long since forgiven, and he is justi∣  and if he shall believe, that he is justified, though he commits sin,  fore he commits his sin, this will be a cause to run into sin, and is a by thee unto all Unrighteousness▪ Why, if people can believe they from the Sins which they have yet to commit, what should restrain running with pleasure into all Unrighteousness? And if new Sins, committed, do not make Persons unjustified, then may the Sinners re∣ their Sins, and take their pleasure in Ungodliness. This Doctrine of  is pleasant to the Wicked, and it is the Way and Principle of Liberty in ▪ rather then the Principles to lead from sin; and so thou hast shewed  Work thou ar doing, by strengthning the Wicked in his Way, so that he cannot turn from sin, rather then drawing him from sin; and this is the work. And thou sayst, Such as are justified are regenerated and sanctified: and a little  thou sayst, To be justified is not to be cleansed, nor is it to partake of real Righ∣t▪ and Persons are justified from Sins which they have to commit. Answ. These are Contradictions, and proceed out of Darkness, and not Light; and thy Folly and Ignorance may be read by all men: For, who are Regenerated and Sanctified are also cleansed, and partake of real ness. And thou further sayst, That Sanctification is a real Change from sin, to the parity of  ge of God. Answ. And I say, None are Sanctified, but they are Justified; so none are , but who are changed into the Image of God; this the Truth saith▪ and wherein thou hast said contrary, thou hast spoken contrary to the Truth; and the Truth will judge thee. , Thou sayst, Sanctification is not perfect in this life; and the New Man, , or Law of the Mind, is that Grace, or imperfect Sanctification, &c. Answ. Then Christ is not perfect in this life; for he is made of God unto us Sanctification, 1 Cor. 1. 0. But we say, Christ is perfect, and therefore San∣ctification is perfect; and the New Man is the Image of God, and is created in Rsness and in true Holiness: But thou sayst, The New Man  imperfect▪ of thy Principles, when they are compared with the Scriptures, and see the  and Wickedness of them. And the Spirit and Law in the mind s the Spirit of God, and the Law of God, in which the Apostles served God; and  all the Saints: but thou sayst, The Spirit and Law in the Mind is imperfect;  this is Error in the highest degree, to say gni, That the New Man,  Image of God, tha is in Righteousness and true Holiness, and the Spirit
of God, and the Law of God, is imperfect Sanctification; and Grace is the Sal∣vation, and is God's Sufficiency, and that (thou sayst) is imperfect   thus thy Principles of thy Religion, which thou walkest in thy self, wouldst teach to others, are Abominable, corrupted Principles of E contrary to the Spirit of Truth, and to the Scriptures also. And that thy Name is concealed; for thy work deserves no a good Mans it. Much more might be said, to lay open further thy olly, but this is su men of Understanding; and contrary to thee I do aert, That the New Image of God, the Spirit and Lf God in the Mind, is perf Peace, Sanctification: and thou hast said the contrary: and now whether thy ples of Religion, or mine, be the most true, and whether false, let all judge, with the Light in their Consciences. And thou sayst, The old Man, the Flesh, the Body of Sin, the Body of the Sin that remains in sanctified Persons. Answ. Who are sanctified, are freed from th Body of Sin and D have put it off, and the Law of the Spirit of Life hath feed  from and from the old Man; for if the old Man, the Flesh, the Body of Death, be in the sanctified Persons, then there are none sctied at what are they sanctified, freed and cleansed from, if the old Man, the Body of Sin and Death, be yet remaining in them? Thou sp unlearned man, and one that knows not the sanctified state; but art thy mind and Judgment, and in thy words also; for we have put Man, and are crucified to the Flesh, and made free from the Body of Death, and this is our Sanctification; and who are remaining things, are not sanctified, but are in the Degeneration, and hav yet in the Kingdom of God, nor in Christ Jesus; but are with the World. And thousayst, The Sanctification of the First Day, hath put an end to fication of the Seventh, &c. Answ. Here again thou hast uttered that which thou knowest not dayes are alike unto God, and one sanctified as much as another, and of dayes with him, but all are holy, and pure, and good; and when ctification of any thing is put to an end (as thou sayst the sanctification Seventh Day is) then the thing is no more good nor holy, but beco and unclean, if it be no more sanctified nor holy; and in this Princi hast erred also. As for the Seventh Day, it was commanded of God to the Iews, to be and observed holy to the Lord; and all manner of Labour to all Creatures forbidden; which thing was a Sign and a Shaddow of a good Thing to co the End of which Ordinance was Christ, the Substance of all things, and End of Dayes: and that there was any disanulling of that Command Iews, and a Command to keep and observe the First Day of the Week i of the other, by any outward Command, this we read not in all the Scrip and what ground hast thou more then thy Imaginations, I know not, to a the changing of dayes, and to teach the observation of the First Day, Sabboth, instead of the Seventh Day, seeing thou hast nothing in the Scrip to raise such a Principle from; and so would make exception of Dayes, and respct of Times, which the Apostles did not, after the Holy Spirit was co for Dayes and Times all are alike to God; and who are come to Christ, true Rest of the Immortal Soul, are in the end of Dayes, and out of the spect of Times, in the Substance, which endures forever: And in the Gos Ministrtion, there is no Command or Injunction by Christ, or by his Apost given to  for the observing any one day more then another. And thou sayst, when it is sd, S not at all, The Meaning is, not Vainly Unnecessarily.
: and it is a Seal and Sign, that is of the Whore of Rome, and not of the true Church of Christ, for nor true Church of Christ never ordain'd not practised such a thing : and in the true Church, as sprinkling of Infants, and calling it  in the Faith of Christ, and the Seal of the Covenant, there was no such  and Doctrine amongst them, but it is come up since the true Church Wilderness, and since the  received power over Kindreds and it is an Institution of the great Whore, that hath  upon the Generations; and she has made Nations drink her Cup of Fornications  original of this Practice and Principle was received  of the Whore's  and not by any Commandment of Christ, or Example of his Church and . And I cannot but charge thee, That thou teachest for Doctrine the Tru∣, and holdst forth for Principles of Religion, to be believed and , the of the great Whore, of whose Cup thou hast drnk, and  also give they may drink it also: And to accomplish which Evil End, thou the Scripture, Asts 2.39. for the Scripture hath no such thing intende  the baptizing of Infants, for which end thou hast fsly cited it; for,  Promise is to as many as the Lord our God shall call, yet what is this  prinkling of Infants, which thou assertest as a Principle of Religion, and  seem to enforce it, by vertue of the Scripture mention'd▪ But Scripture, and shew'd thy self to be disagreeing to the holy Ministers of Christ, and to be agreeing with the false church of Rome sufficient to thee. thou sayst, The outward Covenant of God is conditional; and the entitles both such as make it, and their Infants unto it (to wit) the Cove . The Covenant of God is not outward, but spiritual, a I have said,  also free, even the free Gift of God; and the Promise and Covenant nifested, without the perfoming any thing by the God; for it stands not upon condition, but upon free make a Profession of Faith, which have not right nor Salvation, not to God's fore Covenant; neither can any upon infants, void of Understanding, have any assurance or Title in of Life eternal, but who are regenerated, and born of the  and degener in that state have no title nor right in the  Seed, which is Heir of the Promise, which is born of God, and not that is the Covenant; so thou hast spoken things thou knowest not,
hast manifested thy false Principles, which thou walkest in, and wouldst  others to receive them also. Then thou speakest of Bread and Wine, Which (sayst ou) are the   in the Lord's Supper, and are a Seal of the Cove als, &c. Answ. The Supper of the Lord is the Bread of eternal Life, the Body and  of Christ, and who ts thereof shall dye, nor Hger and Thirst any   as for Bread and Wine, visible and carnal, that is not the real Supper of  , and even the purest institution & Practice thereof is but a Representation of , and not the very thing; and the End and Substance being come, the  may be neglected. But as for the manner and institution of that Practice i  Church of England, and the Practice it self, we deny to be either a Sign of  past or to come; but in an idolatrous way it is held forth, and not in Honour to God; for he is thereby dishonoured: for the false church has the form of that Practice, as well as of many others (which the true Church  practi'd) without the Power, and now doth practice many things in meer I tion and vain Idolatry, and in Form and Tradition, and without the Te the Spirit, which sometime the true Church, and the Apostles practized in the , and by the leading of the Spirit of God, and what the Command of God was : So that though you may in some things practice the very same which the did; yet having not the same Spirit to lead you, nor being guided thereby, as  Saints and the Apostles were, your works are but Idolatry, and formal,  not accepted of the Lord, but stink in his Nostrils: And your Covenant is  ward, and your Seals outward, your Baptism and Supper outward and ; and while you are with Zeal prosecuting your outward Performances, and ∣lowing them, you neglect the inward, and the Substance, which is, Christ you, the Hope of Glory; which if he be in you, then the body of sin is put off, and the vail is done away, and the Representations are done away, and the Substance and  is come; and if Christ be not in you, you are Reprobates, notwithstanding all your Profession and Practices of outward Duties unto God, without his Spirit. And whereas thou hast quoted, Col. 4. 10. Gal. 5. 17. Rom. 7. 23. to , That the New Man, the Spirit or, Law of the Mind, is called, The imperfect Sanctifi∣cation. Answ. Hereby openly thou hast shewed thy self to be a Perverter of the Scrip∣tures, and a Wrester of them to thy own Destruction; for let but reason en peruse the Scriptures mention'd by thee, and see if there be such a thing  them, as held forth by thee, That the New Man, the Spirit or Law of the Mi, is called, Imperfect Sanctifiation: which thou hast asserted, and cited those Te to prove it, but as to the thing it self I have answered before; only this is to  thy manner of perverting Scriptures, which is the work of the evil spirit in thee, and not the Work of the Spirit of God. And thus I have examin'd some part of thy Principles of Religion, which th hast put forth into the world for others to learn; and the Error and Falsness of them is laid open, and how contrary to Scriptures they are; and in haste,   were, I have passed over it, not willing to rake into things which gave no just occasion against Truth; but have only confuted a few of thy many particulars; which had I narrowly sought into other things, much Unsoundness would have been discovered: but what I have said is truly sufficient to discover unto  persons the Error of thy Judgment, and of thy Principles and Practices, and  thy whole Religion. And before ever thou be a true Instructor of others in  Way, thou must first repent, and believe, nd learn the Way thy self, which yet thou art ignorant of; for thou hast shewed no Knowledge, but what is sen, and devilish, and from below, and meerly carnal and natural: and meeting wi thy Book, and enquiring what the Author was, I was engaged to say something to it by way of answer, and to lay it to the Line of Judgment, according to the Scriptures; and it hath proved very guilty of Error, and perverting Scriptures

A MESSAGE To all Kings and Rulers IN CHRISTENDOM, To all called Christian Kings and Princes, and to all the Parliaments, and Rulers, and Governours of every Degree throughout the whole Christian World. A CALL unto you all, by a Servant of the LORD, in the Name of the Lord God, Dreadful and Mighty, and the Highest Power over all the World; That ye take off Oppression, and relieve the Oppressed, and cease to grinde the Face of the Poor; and from drinking the Whore's Cup, and from carrying of her; and from all Oppressions whatsoever, lest the Lord God Almighty execute  fierce Indignation upon you, if ye will not turn at his Reproof,  hearke  his Voice when he calleth unto you. FOrasmuch as it hath come to pass in the World, for many Ages, sm the last Glorious Appearance of Christ Jesus, and the Light of his Glorious Gospel, through his Servants the holy Apostles, That Antichrist, that Man of Sin, the Enemy of Christ and his Kingdom, hath ruled in the Hearts of people, and throughout & over the Christian World; and he has been exalted within and without, ever since the falling away from the true Faith, which once was delivered to the Apostles and true Churches; and he hath shewed himself to be God, and hath sitten in the Seat of God, and hath exercised Lordship over the Persons and Consciences of Men, throughout Generations, ever since the falling away from the Faith: For the True Church, the Elected Spouse, the Lamb's Wife, which once brought forth him that was to rule the Nations, and was clo∣thed with the Sun, and had once great Beauty and Excellency, hath been fled into the Wilderness, and hath been desolate as without Husband and Issue; but hath remained in her place prepared her of God, where she hath dwelt in Mourning, and been fed with the Bread of Sorrow, being pursued thither by
the Dragon, and his Floods of Cruelty, who also waited to devour the Man∣child, when he was born; and the Martyrs Blood hath been shed, and the holy Prophets, and Apostles, and Saints have been made War against, and killed and persecuted for Righteouess sake; and the two Witnesses have long lain slain and rejoyced over in the Streets of the great City, and the Blood of the cent hath een drk, and th Lamb and his Followers have been made Wa inst; and the Dragon, the Dvil, and Satan, hath deceived the World into the Name of Christians, without the true Christian Life; and Righteous∣ness and Truth hath stood afar off, and Justice and Mercy hath been wanting, and the Fear of the Lord, and true Obedience to him, hath been in a great measure expelled out of Nations; and even all that would not worship the , nd his Images, and receive his Mark, the Beast hath had power to kill , and he hath had power to execute his Wrath against them that have fol∣lowed the Lamb, even all this time of Darkness and Apostacy, which hath over∣dowed the Christian-world, since the Apostles days until this time; and all this hath been since the falling away from the Life, and Righteousness, and Spirit of Jesus, as I have said. the Beast hath been great, that arose out of the Sea, and out of the Ear (when the true Faith was lost) and his power mighty amongst men; for he reed power from the Dragon, and made War against the true Church, and   devour the Man-child; and power th been given him over Kin∣d, Tongues and Nations; and all the World hath wondered and followed after the Beast, and have been admiring his power, and his great authority, and saying, Who is able to make War with him? for he hath had a Mouth given, that hath spoken great things; and it hath been given him to war with the Saints, and to overcome them by his unrighteous Laws and Decrees: and all that dwelt upon the Earth have worshipped him, whose Names are not writ∣ten in the Book of Life; and he hath had many Heads (even divers sorts and changes of Government) and many Horns, with which he hath pushed the In∣nocent, and ruled over the Earth, and kept all under his power; and he hath set up Images to worship, and Likenesses without Life; and he hath caused both Small and Great, Rich and Poor, Free and Bond, to receive his Mark; and be  carried the Whore, and she hath journeyed upon him from Nation to Nation, through the Earth, in the Sheep's Clothing, and made all Nations drink her Cup of Fornications. And the Whore, the false church, she hath fate as a Queen, in great State and Authority, upon Nations, Tongues, Multitudes and Peoples; and thro the Beast's authority, which hath carried her, she hath ruled in great authority over the Consciences, Persons and Estates of People; and she hath drunk the Saints Blood, and the Martyrs Blood; and in her is found even  this Day, the Blood of the Martyrs, and the Prophets, and of ust , and of all that have been slain upon the Earth; and she hath exercised Cruelty and Tyranny over the Heritage of God; and she hath had the Sheep's Clothing upon her, even part of the Garment of the Lamb's Wife; and she th appeared in much Beauty, with a Golden Cup in her hand, in which the Wine of her Fornications, and the Filthiness thereof hath appeared, and which she hath caused the Nations to drink; and by her Sorceries and Witchcrafts she hath deceived the World, and with her false Miracles, and Shews, and Images, and false Ministers, which she hath set up, she hath corrupted the Earth; and all this she hath done by the Beast's power, that hath carried her, who received his Authority from the Dragon, and from the Devil. And thus Antichrist, the Beast and the Whore, have ruled in the World in great Authority for many Generations, and the World hath been as a Wilderness y them, and waste and barren of all good Fruit; and Truth and Faith th been departed from amongst men, and Love and Peace th been far away;
and Murders, Thefts, Wars, Strifes and all Injustice, and Wickedness hath abounded in Nations; and thus the whole Earth hath been corrupted through the Whore, and false church, who hath deceived Kings, and Rulers, and Peo∣ples, by her Inchantments and Sorceries, which she hath caed them to receive at her hand, and out of her Golden Cup of Abominations; out of which they have drunk false doctrines and practices, to the deceiving of their Souls and Bodies. But now the Day of the Lord is come and coming, and the Lamb's King∣dom is to be set up; and the kingdoms of this World must be changed, and  covered again, and will become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, and the Marriage of the Lamb is come again, and the Day of Glad-tidings  to the Poor, and to the Distressed; and the Lamb's Wife shall be adorned  her Husband, she shall be clothed with the Sun,and shall be covered with her former Beauty, and shall be led out of the Wilderness; and the Earth shall be refreshed, and deliver'd from the Oppressions and Tyrannies of Antichrist and the Whore; for the Hour of her Iudgments are come: and the Darkness of the Night of woful Apostacy, which hath clouded the World, is passing over and the Light of the Lamb is risen, and the Day-star hath appeared in the hearts of people; and the Man of Sin, which hath sate in the Temple, and shewe m∣self to be God, and falsly exercised the Bodies and Consciences of deceived peo∣ple, in false ways and worships, is discovering and destroying by the Spirit of  Mouth, and by the Brightness of the coming of Jesus; and the Beast and the false Prophet shall be taken alive and cast into the Lake of Fire, and the  and false Prophet shall be tormented day and night forever; for the Breath of Life from God is entred into the two Witnesses, and they shall again Prophey, and the Light of the glorious Gospel, that that long been hid, must again be preached to Kindreds, Tongues and Nations; and the Kingdom of Christ Iesus set up; and these things is the Lord God Almighty bringing to pass: And he will confound and destroy Antichrist, and all that have worshipped him, and  that have worshipped the Beast, and drunk the Cup of Fornication, and commited ∣latry with the great Whore, they shall be taken and cast into the Bed of Torment, and shall Weep and Houl because of the great Destruction of Babylon, that great City, who hath been the Glory of kingdoms, and made rich her Merchants  false Ministers) with Deceiveableness, whom God will overthrow: That great  City of Confusion (the false church) that great Whore, the Mother of  Abominations, the ord God is risen against her to enquire for the Blood  Martrs and Prophets, and Righteous Men, that is found in her, and she shall be rewarded according to her wayes; and as she hath given others to drink  Cup of Fornication , so in like manner shall she drink the Cup of fierce  of the Lord's Wrath from his Saints; and she shall no more deceive the Na∣tions by her Sorceries, but the Earth shall be deliver'd from her, and the King∣dom of the Son of God shall be exalted over all, and the Light of the Lamb  be the Light of all Nations, and all that are saved shall walk in the Light of  and Truth shall reign, and the Fruit of Righteousness shall abound, and all peo∣ple shall glorifie God, their Maker; and the whole Earth shall be refreshed with the Mercy of him that made her. Wherefore all ye Kings, Princes, Parliaments and Rulers, through th whole Christendom, this is a Request unto you all of a Lover of your Immort Souls, That you will cease to commit Fornication with the great Whore, and that you will not any longer drink her Cup of Iatries, neither that you will cause Nations to drink it; neither that you will carry the great Whore any more, nor receive her Sorcries  Inchantments to deceive your Souls and Bodies: And this the Lord God Almighty (who ought to be the Fear and Dread of all Nations) requireth of you, and  is a Charge to you in the Presence of the Lord God, That  do not any log defend the great City Babylon, and the false Church with your Weapons and Oppression, neither that you will ever any more oppress the per∣sons
and Consciences of people, on her part, and on her defence; but that  st off the Whore, and not suffer her to sit upon you; and  you will not be Servants to her, to execute her Cruelties upon the Bodies  Consciences of People: For, these things have you done, and therefore  Lord displeased with you, and therefore deliver your selves from the A∣ of the false Church, and receive not her Delusions, neither im∣  upon the people under you; for now the Judgments of the great Whore , and the time that the Lord will reward her according to her wayes, shall have the Fruit of her doings: And if you will yet uphold her,  Fornication with her, and compel the Nations to drink of her  and cause all people to worship the Beast, and to receive his Mark, as it  en, Then the Lord shall execute his Vengeance upon you, and you shall   wise e delivered. Wherefore I say again unto you, Arise out of Darkness, and come to the Brightness of the Light of the Morning, even to the Son's Appearance, and receive his Kingdom, and lay down your Crowns at his Feet; for the Lamb is risen, whose Crown is Immortal, and ye, and all your Glory, and Greatness, and  and Power, is but as Dust and Ashes before him; and he can break you , and never build you up again: And come out of great Babylon, and  your City; for the Day of the Lord will suddenly come upon you; for great Babylon is come into remembrance before the Lord, to reward her with great dignation. Wherefore this is a Call unto you, Lay aside your Inquisitions, your Goals, and Houses of Correction, and Prisons, and all your Torturing and persecuting of the Persons and Consciences of People, about Worship, Church and Mini∣ry; for in these things, and by these Weapons, you have defended the Whore;  through the force of your violent Laws and cruel Impositions, unjustly laid  people, hath the Whore (the false church) been carried by you, and de∣ded by you: But lay aside all your cruel Weapons, and not persecute, nor , nor shed the Blood of the Servants of the Lord by unjust Laws; nor limit not the Spirit of God from crying against Babylon, and reproving her Ini∣quities; for these things have you done in defence of the Whore: for you ve been the Carriers of her, the Defenders and Preservers of her by your ighteous Laws; and through you hath she sate as a Queen, thinking she  never see sorrow, because ye have defended her, and taken part with her, and caused Nations to drink her Cup; for you have been the Executors of her pleasure, to compel the Nations to commit Idolatry, and to partake of  Fornications; and you give her authority to drink the Blood of all that would not drink her Cup: and it is now time for you to forsake these your wayes, and to learn Wisdom from the Lord, that you may rule in Righteous∣ amongst men, as men, but not to be Rulers in Christ's Throne, nor his Kingdom, by imposing such a Worship, and such a Religion upon people's Consciences, and to destroy and kill all that will not thus worship to your Image, and bow according to your Prescription; this you ought not to do,  the Lord never intrusted you with this power, nor made you Rulers in his Kingdom, nor to sit in his Throne of Conscience; for while you have done , your Authority has been from the Dragon, and not from the Lamb. And now this the Lord required of you, Let Conscience go free, and rule not over the  Man; for while you do take that upon you, to force such a Worship and such a Religion upon people, contrary to the Spirit of God, you are but Ser∣ to the great Whore. Wherefore be warned, for this is an invitation of Love, Righteousness, Truth, and just Judgment, Mercy and Peace unto you, that you may know what the Mind of the Lord is unto you, and may do it, and rule for God, and not for man, upon which dependeth the happiness and well-being of a Nati∣, and Nations, and their Rulers; and on the contrary dependeth their
overthrow and destruction, and this will speedily be brought to pass; fore come out of Babylon, and deliver your selves from that bondage with the false Church hath bound you; she hath caused you to drink hee and you have been made drunk with her false Faith, and Doctrines and Pr and ye have compelled Nations to Drink the same Cup of Abominatio ye have executed cruelty and injustice upon all that would not, and y been Servants to the great Whore; and being in Bondage your sel have brought all in bondage under you; but now the Lord is Times, and Things, and Powers, and happy are you if you dliver your and let the Oppressed go free; in so doing, if ye fulfil this my R and do the Will of the Lord herein, then Blessings and Peace Eternal if ye be disobedient, and take part continually with the Whore, y partake of her Judgments: And this hath the Lord spoken to you, the Day of Vengeance ye shall confess that you are warned, By a Friend to the whole Creation, that waits for the Redemption thereof, Edward Burroughs.
AN ACCOUNT Of some Grounds and Reasons OF THE INNOCENT SUFFERINGS Of the People of God, called, QUAKERS, And why they Testifie against the Vain Customs and Practices of the World: Presented to the PARLIAMENT in the Year, 1659. Also concerning a Great Cry up and down the Nation, That the Quakers Meetings must be Broken and Suppressed; and that this present Parliament intends to do it. With a CRY of Great Judgment and Vengeance upon the Wicked, near to be Executed; as it was received from the Lord into his Servant. FRIENDS, IT may seem strange unto you, as it doth unto others, to hear, that so ma∣ny of our Friends should be cast into Prisons; there being few Goals, or Houses of Correction in England, to which some of them have not been ommitted; and you partly know how many of them are this day in Bonds; nd it is no less strange to us, that such frequent and heavy Sufferings, for mat∣ers of Conscience, should come upon us, and our Brethren; who, for the ost part, have been Instruments with you and others, for casting off that Yoke  Oppression, which, at the beginning of the late Wars, lay upo the Ho∣est People of this Land; which made many flee into strange Nations, and to eek Habitations in the Deserts: but we wonder the more, that they should come rom those we accounted our Friends (that so much have pretended the Liberty
of Conscience) and many of themselves practized the same things for which we now suffer. May we not ask, What hath been done by our Friends? What Laws are these which they have broken? Whose Persons or Possessions have they wrong∣ed? What Force or Violence have they used to any man? Have you found them in Plots, or guilty of Sedition, or making Resistance against Authority? Have they not patiently born the greatest Sufferings that any People of this Na∣tion ever lay under, since Queen Mary's dayes, without Murmurings and Dis∣contents? And when have they fought to revenge themselves, or troubled you, or others, to be repaired for those many Injuries, and false Imprisonments, which they have endured? How have they been counted as Sheep for the Slaugh∣ter, persecuted, and despised, beaten, stoned, wounded, stocked, whipped, haled out of the Synagogues, and cast into Dungeons and noysom Vaults, where many of them have dyed in Bonds, shut up from their Friends, denyed needful Sustenance for several days together, not suffered to have Pen, Ink, or Paper; and when they have lain there many Moneths, and some of them Years, denyed a Le∣gal Tryal, continued from Sessions to Assizes, and from one Assize to another, and no Equity to be found from judge or Justice? If it be answered to us, They are common Disturbers of Ministers; they will not pay Tythes; they will not Swear; they will not put off their Hats; they travel up and down from one Country to another without a Magistrate's Pass, and on the First dayes to Meetings at great distance; they will not pay Fee when they are brought to Cts, nor plead in the Forms there used, nor give Security to keep the Peace, or to be of the Good Behaviour when the Iustices require it: And we have Laws or Customs that require these things should be done. It is forgotten what was one of the great Causes of our late Wars, the Suf∣ferings that then were imposed, and lay upon many for matters of Conscience: And was it not a chief Pretence of the fighting, That we might enjoy the Freedom of Conscience, as well as outward Rights; not only in the inner-Man, but the free Ex∣ercise in all Acts of Piety and Religion, of what the Lord should make manifest unto us? But whether this was then intended, or is now perverted, it is that which is our Right, which we must claim, and no man may take it from us; for this we know, That Christ Jesus alone hath right to rule over the Consciences of men, unto whom every one must give an Account of himself, according to the just, perfect and unchangeable Law of God, which is revealed, with that alone of God, which is made manifest in man, which he hath shewed unto him, by which every one shall be judged at the Last Day, when the Book of Conscience shall be opened. And therefore all unequal, imperfect and changeable Laws of men we do deny; and by them, and for their Transgression we shall not be judged of the Lord: and all Laws made in their wills, by their wisdoms in the things of God, which concern Religion, and the free Exercise of a Good Conscience towards God and Man, against them all we do bear witness;  knowing the Commandments of the Lord, and what he required of us, and having tasted his tender Love to those that keep them, and felt his Terrors against  Disobedience, we are made willing to bear the greatest Sufferings, rather then  against God: And in this Ground we stand not careful what man can do unto  or say of us, nor to give him an Answer in this Matter; For whether it is better  obey God or Man, let him judge. Yet here, to prevent Mistakes, we do with the like clearness, declare our free and willing Subjection in the things of this World, to every Ordinance of  that is just (according to the Righteous Law of God) and our Work is not to weaken, but strengthen the hand of the Magistrate, by labouring to bring all to own that of God, which should exercise their Consciences, To do in all  as they would be done unto; in which is fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, whic
takes away the occasion it self of the Law; and brings to live in Peace and Love, wherein should be the Magistrates Joy and Glory. And do but look on the Crimes charged against us, and all the Sufferings we lie under, and you may clearly see, That not for any Evil done, or just Law broken that concerns man, are we thus punished; but for things which concern our God; and chiefly for bearing our Witness, as we are moved of the Lord, against the false Prophets and Hirelings of these dayes, who by their Fruits are made manifest, not only unto us, but to many Thousands besides; yea, the greatest part of all the sober People of the Nation; their own Hearers will confess it: And we see and know, that they, and all Ministers and Worships in the World, set up and standing in the will of man, shall perish; and come to nothing; and the Rice of these men, their Growth and End, we comprehend, and see their Downfall hastens greatly, and all the Powers of the Earth shall not be able to support them; and with them shall fall their Tythes, their Tem∣ples, their Gleab lands and Offerings, their set dayes of Worship in their wiils, and all Laws limitting the Holy One, made to uphold their Craft; and blessed are they, who through the Day of Tryal shall stand in their Witness faithful un∣to God, not fearing what man can do unto them. Do not you approve Christ Jesus his going into the Temple? And do not you own the Apostles, who went into the Iews Synagogues every Sabboth Day, and into the Market-places, to testifie of Christ Jesus, and reason with the peo∣ple? And do not you commend Luther, and Calvin, Iohn Wicklisf, and others, (is Famous, for their Zeal, in publishing abroad what then was manifest unto them) and those Persons which in Queen Mary's dayes went into the Popish Steeple-Houses, to bear witness against their Superstitions, which caused her to make a Law against them, by which many of them then suffer'd; and by which the Priests of England, till the last Parliament were guarded; and is it now become an Offence to practice the same things? And is that a just Law, made by the late Parliament, by which many have suffered? Are not the Priests sprung from the old Root of Popery? and are they not forced to flee thither for their vindicati∣on? and is not the spirit the same (which makes these Laws) to support hem? How shall the Kingdoms of the Earth; the Papists, Turks, Infidels, Heathens be converted? Your Priests sit down in their Ease, and will not go; they call themselves, Ministers of the Reformed Churches: And have not you taught other Nations how to make Laws to restrain the Testimony of those whom the Lord ends, and is sending into all the Corners of the Earth? Did the Command of God, which gave Tythes to the Jewish Priest∣hood, concern the Gentiles? Was not the Command to the Iews them∣selves disannulled, when the Priesthood was changed? Did ever any of the believing Iews pay Tythes to the Apostles; or did any of the Gentiles pay Tythes either? Did not the Papists bring in this Doctrine, and Oppression? Did not many of the Martyrs in Queen Mary's dayes witness against Tythes? And was not that an Article for which some of them suffered? And do not you own and commend those Martyrs; or do you judge them for holding an Error? Have not all, or most of those Countries, that turned from the Pope, and are called reformed, cast off Tythes with the Pope, and were ashamed of them? And is it the Glory of ENGLAND, who pretendeth to the highest Re∣formation, to keep up Tythes [the Popish Priests Maintenance] and First-Fruits, and Tenths (the Wages of the very Pope himself) and to hale be∣fore Courts, cast into Prisons, and spoil the Goods of all who for Conscience sae cannot pay them: Let that of God answer.
And how many have, and at this day do suffer because they cannot Swear, which Christ Jesus, and his Apostles, above all things forbid? How are the Commands of Christ made void by the Customs and Traditions of Men? Were it not easie, by turning the Law against Lyars and false Witnes∣ses (which the Law of God is against) to find out that which your Law against false Swearing never did or could discover? Do you own Christ Jesus, of whom the Iews, that put him to Death gave this Witness, That he Respected no mans Person? Do you commend Mor∣decai, who could not give the outward Honour, and bow to Hamon? And do you regard his words who said, I know not how to give Flattering Titles to men; for my Maker would soon take me away? Hath not God made of one Mould and one Blood all Nations to dwell upon the Face of the Earth? And doth not he that respects Persons commit sin, and is convinced of the Law as a Transgressor? And must it now be an Offence not to put off the Hat, and give Respect to the Person of him that hath a Gold Ring, and fine Apparel? Hath not all the Earthly Lordship, and Tyranny and Oppression sprung from this Ground, by which Creatures have been exalted, and set up one above ano∣ther, trampling under Foot and despising the Poor? And is it not easie to see that Power and Authority, without contempt, may be preserved, the Power Honoured, and Obeyed, and submitted unto, and the Person Re∣spected? Hath not the great and heavy Oppressions of the Law been long felt and cryed out against, the long delays in Courts, and the great Fees of Officers, which causeth many to be excessively rich out of the Ruins of the Poor, which hath brought an Odium upon the Law it self? for to the Poor the Remedy is worse then the Disease; and while people are free to feed this De∣ceit, there is little hope to have it amended. And how full of Lyes, Deceit, Pretences, and needless Circumstances are all your Pleadings and Proceedings, to the burden of many mens Conscien∣ces, and ruin of their Estates? And how vile and wicked are the greatest of Lawyers, that will plead any thing for Money, and by their Subtilties do most commonly hide and cover the Truth? And when do the Judges re∣prove it? And how Treacherous and Deceitful are the Solicitors and Attor∣neys, that Truth or Honesty can scarce be found amongst them? And how do those eat up the People, as it were Bread; and grow Great and Rich by rai∣sing and increasing Suits, Troubles, Strifes, and Debates amongst their Neigbours? And we seeing these Oppressions are made to bear our Witness against them, and cannot uphold them; and our Testimony shall not be in vain. And how is the Power given to Justices and Judges, to bind to the Peace and Good Behaviour (being left to their Discretion) turned against the most peaceable and best-behaved Persons amongst men, meerly because they cannot bow to their wills, and hold their Tongues when the Lord requires them to speak? Do you commend Christ Jesus, his Apostles and Saints, who were sent to preach the Gospel, and travelled from City to City, from Nation to Nation, from Country to Country, that the ends of Earth might hear the Glad-tidings of Salvation? And do you commend those they called Puritans, for going ma∣ny Miles to worship the Lord? and do you now condemn those that practice the same things? Would not your Law against Vagabonds have taken hold on Christ and his Ministers, and hindred their Work? by it have many honest and good
People suffered most shameful Whippings and Imprisonments, who were tra∣velling in their own Country, about their outward and lawful Occasions, that were of considerable Estates, and could not be counted Vagabonds? And what use is made of this Law throughout the Nation you cannot but hear. Are not these things like the Sayings of those who said, Had they lived in the dayes of the Prophets, they would not have persecuted and put them to death; and yet they crucified Christ? and so the Cry is at this day against the Jews for their Cru∣elty, when themselves are found exercising the same things against his Saints and Members. Long hath the Beast reigned, who usurped power in these things; and the false Prophets, who have over-spread the Earth; and the great Whore, who have made all Nations drunk with their Abominations, and the Wine of their Forni∣cations, with whom the Kings of the Earth have committed Adltery, whom Christ said should come, and before the Apostles decease did come; who went out from the Apostles, and put on their Clothing, but inwardly were Destroyers, Ravening Wolves, which the whole World went after, who turned against the Saints who kept to the Spirit (the Life which they went from) and made War with the Saints till they overcame; and their Power reached over the whole Earth: But now is the life risen, and is again made manifest, which they went from, which gives to see before the Apostacy was. Now is the Lamb risen, and rising to make War with the Dragon, the Beast and false Prophets; and now shall the great Whore be taken, and her Flesh shall be burnt with Fire, and the Saints shall have the Victory. Therefore let all Kings, Princes, Rulers, and Magistrates, he warned not to take part with the Beast, nor to uphold (with their power) the false Pro∣phets, who have long deceived the Nations; but in their Place stand to keep the outward Peace, that none may offer Violence, and destroy another, which hath been the way of the Beast and of the false Prophets (the Prop and Sup∣port of their Kingdom) but leave Christ Jesus in his Saints to mannage the War, whose Warfare is not carnal, whose Weapons are not carnal, yet are they mighty through God, to the pulling down of the Strong Holds of Satan, and overturning the Foundation of Satan's kingdom; and they shall soon see what is Truth, and what is Error; for great is the Truth, and will prevail; they shall not need to cry out for want of Ministers, or that Christ Jesus is not able to send forth Labourers; nor will those he sends forth trouble them for Maintenance: and here is the Magistrates true Place, to keep Peace amongst all men, to punish him that doth Evil, and to encourage him that doth well; to rule the Kingdoms of the Earth in Righteousness, that Justice and Equity may be exalted, and that way may be made for the Lord Jesus Christ, who is coming to reign, and to take the Dominion to himself; and we are Witnesses in our Measures of his Coming, and of the working of his Mighty Power, by which he is able to subdue all things to himself. And this is the Testimony un∣to which we are called, and many Thousands with us in the Unity of the same Spirit. And Witnesses we stand against Priests, Tythes, Temples, Swearing, and all the carnal wayes of Worship, set up and upholden by outward Laws and Powers, which would limit and restrain the Spirit of the Lord, which is grie∣ved, and daily cries out against these Abominations. Witnesses we stand against Parliaments, Councels, Judges, Justices, who make or execute Laws in their wills over the Consciences of men, or punish for Conscience sake, and to such Laws, Customs, Courts, or Arbitrary usurped Dominion, we cannot yield our Obedience. Yet we do declare, as it is testified in all Counties, Cities, Goals and Prisons, to Judges, Justices, and others, That as we preach Christ Iesus alone in the things of God, to be our Law-Giver, so do we own him to be our King
(and own Magistacy in civil things) not resisting any; but following his Example, who was made perfect through Suffering, and for his Salvation we wait, till he alone shall plead our Cause; and therefore for Conscience sake we have joyfully born, and do bear so many and great Sufferings, since the day we were convinced of his Everlasting Truth. These things we have declared, not to upbraid you with the In∣justice of others, nor to revile the Government it self; but that you may see the Ground, and true Cause of all our Sufferings; and of the Suffering of the Saints in all Ages and Generations, and in all Nations of the World at this day: And we leave it to that of God in you all to weigh and consi∣der, whether it be not time to reform both Laws, Courts and Officers. From your Friends, who are Lovers of Peace and Truth, who wait for the coming of the Lord, to establish Iustice and Righteousness in the Earth; whom he hath raised up, as Witnesses of his appearing, and of the dawning of the Mighty and Dreadful Day of God, in Life, Light and Power; who are hated of Men, and reproached under the Name of Quakers. And whereas there is a Great Cry up and down the Nation, That the Quakers Meetinge must be Broken and Suppressed; and that this present Parliament intends to do it. And of this I have heard in divers Parts of the Nation. NOw to this I shall say, and answer; First, As I have observed the spirits of People concerning this Cry, all the Rude and Ungodly People, as Drun∣kards, and the prophanest of men, they glory apace at this News, and re∣joyce at this mightily, as if some great Prize were befallen unto them; and it makes them rude and violent enough, to the breaking of the Peace in the Na∣tion; but thus it is but with the worst sort of People in the Nation, who are rejoyced with these Tidings, That the Quakers Meetings must be broken: But as for the Honest People, such as be sober and sincere, Thousands that had a hand in chusing this present Parliament, never intended to send them up to Lon∣don for such a Work; and the Cry is by many of the sober People, If they go about such a Work, they will destroy themselves, undo themselves, and leave their Names a Reproach: why, say the people (we have a Testimony before us) hath it not been upon that Rock of limiting tender Consciences, in former dayes, that hath broken many before these, which might be Examples to these, not to do the same things? And many sober people are offended at such News, and it makes their hearts sad; whose Consciences, and the Witness therein, doth answer, That we are the Lord's People, and it ought not thus to be done concerning us as the News reports: So that by this News of the intended Purpose, to break the Lord's Peoples Meetings, the Ungodly and Prophane are gratified, and strengthened in their Wickedness; and the Righteous are made sad.
And further, as for us, We have been trodden down, and made a Prey un∣to our Enemies; and the Gates of Death and Hell have stroven against us alrea∣dy, but have not prevailed unto this day; for the Lord is with us, and who is it that shall prevail against us? and I may say. What is this that is reported to be done? what shall Dust and Ashes do, and man whose Breath is in his No∣strils? And who are they that shall break down that which the Lord hath a purpose to build? Who shall be able to prosper in going about it? or what suc∣cess shall God give to that Work? I tell you nay; it is the Lord that has raised us up, and we have given our power to him, to stand by him, and to be protected, defended and upheld by him alone; and we cannot give our Power to any Mortal Men, to seek that from them which is not in their hands to give: The Power of the Lord God is over you, he that is our Keeper and Preserver, in whose Hands is your Breath, to destroy it utterly; if you do that which doth offend him; for you shall know, that we are the Lord's People, by whom we shall stand, and grow in Dominion and Authority in his Life; and the Dread of the Lord shall be upon our Enemies, though they one gratifie another with Intentions of Evil against us; yet the Lord stoppeth the purpose of his Enies, and turns it backwards upon their own heads. And this I say from the Lord, If such a thing be in your Hearts, conceiving to be brought forth by you, it is a Birth that will devour you er ever it spring out of your Bowel, it will be too heavy a Burden, and you shall never have strength to deliver it: This is the Word of the Lord to you, It shall be a Rock to overthrow you, and it will be a Sare to catch you; and if any such thing proceeds from you, it will break you, and your own Wickedness will destroy you. Alas! Do not you see evidently the Hand of the Lord fight for us? Yea, we have evident Testimony of his Presence, that he is, and will be with us unto the end: And if any will be blind, let them be blind; for these Tidings do not trouble us, neither are we thereby moved, no not to beg of any man the contrary; for we cannot give our Power unto you, nor come under the power of this World, no not to beg of you contrary to a good Conscience, that you should forbear the fulfilling your intents: But this it is in the Name and Pow∣er of the Lord, though he requires nothing of you to exalt his Kingdom by your power, nor to prescribe him a Way how he must be worshipped; yet he re∣quires, That you should do nothing against him, nor his People, by limiting he Spirit of the Lord. And I say, The Saints of the Most High cannot give their Power to you, to stand or fall thereby, nor to go by the Authority thereof, to exalt the Kingdom of God thereby; they can beg no such thing, nor desire it of you; for it is not in your hands to give his Work of Salvation unto the Nations; you can∣not give nor lay one Stone in the building of his blessed Temple; but he alone will do it, and not by the Arm of Flesh: Yet doth he require, That you should do nothing against him, nor abuse your power; but and if you do, he will reward you according to your Deeds: and this you will find and feel in the Day of God, when he brings Vengeance and Judgment upon you, and when he sets his Kingdom over you all, and that comes to raign over the Nations which how is a Sufferer. And when I first heard the News sent abroad in the Nation, of such Inten∣tions, to break the Quakers Meetings, many Considerations passed through me, Will these go (said I) in the same way that many have been destroyed in before them? Will these run upon the same Rock? Will these take in hand to limit God, and to set him a Way? And shall all these Sufferings of the Lord's People, for these many years, be finished by these, that all the Unjust Dealing and Op∣pressions of the Saints may be upon them? Is there no Wise Man among them, nor none that feareth the Lord, that he may be preserved om e∣struction? And is this their beginning in Parliament, to destroy God's Heri∣tage?
The Lord, nor the People of this Nation, that fear God, have not in∣trusted them therein: But if it be so, said I in my heart, if this Wickedness be intended, and if they do so greatly abuse their power, they shall leave their Names as a Reproach to after Ages, and their Memories shall Rot, and their Wickedness shall lie upon them for evermore. But I considered, that we having given our Power to the Lord, from him we have found unto this day, and do alwayes seek defence, and to be carried on, and by him we stand, and to him we fall; and not to Mortal Men, who are as Clay in the Hand of the Potter. Wherefore let the Wise in Heart consider these things, and lay them to mind; for if they shall proceed to that Wickedness, the Nations shall they never set∣tle in Peace, nor shall their Rulers receive a Blessing; but they shall be a Curse unto themselves, and to all under their Authority. And this is a Te∣stimony to all sober People, shewing unto them all, where our Confidence is, and in what it remains. And nevertheless, If the Heart of the Wicked be strengthened against us, and their hands made strong to deal violently; yet shall the Righteous Rejoyce, and be exceeding Glad; For the Day of Redemption and Everlasting Peace is come unto his People, that do and have waited for him; and all under him shall bow and bend; and he will make his Peoples Cup overflow, and spread their Table even in the sight of their Enemies, and they shall Fear, and the Terror of the Lord shall lie upon them; and when they have executed their Violence, then shall the Lord deal violently with them. E. B. A CRY of Great Iudgment and Vengeance upon the Wicked, near to be Executed; as it was received from the Lord into his Servant. ON the eighteenth Day of the first Moneth, as I was travelling in War∣wick-shire, my Meditations being upon the Lord, and upon the Cause of his People in this Nation; and how Unjust and Unrighteous their woful Sufferings have been executed upon them, within these few years: even when I' was pondering of these things, in the deep consideration thereof, it came up∣on me from the Lord, and the Cry went through me, The Lord will be aven∣ged, the Lord will be avenged upon his Enemies, and he will avenge the Cause of his People. And this Cry stuck close upon me for some Hours, That the Lord would surely execute his Judgments upon the Oppressors of his Heritage, who have spoiled, and troden it down, and sought to destroy it. And I considered, and took into full view in my spirit, how grievous, how sad, and how unjust the Sufferings of God's People have been within these few years; and my Heart was even broken therewith, and my Spirit even mel∣ted; and it came upon me from the Lord, saying, Write unto the Rulers, and yet once more warn them of that Recompence, and of that Indignation, which is at hand up∣on them, even a just Recompence for all their Deeds; and as they have done, even so shall it be done to them; as they have sought to destroy the Generation of the Righteous, even so shall they be destroyed from off the Face of the Earth; and as they have unjustly judged and condemned the Innocent, so shall they be condemned, and justly judged of the Lord;
and as they have cast the Bodies of the poor Lambs of Christ into Prison, and been a Snare upon them; even so shall they be insnared, and into Captivity shall they go: And as they have caused the Goods and Possessions of the Innocent to be spoiled and made a Prey; even so in like manner shall the Curse of the Lord spoil their Substance: And as they have done, so shall it be done unto them; and as they have mete to others, so shall it be mete to them again. And I saw a great Misery and Desolation nigh at hand; even the Sword of the Lord, and it should slay them; and I beheld it was made ready for the slaughter: and in the sense of these things a sadness fell upon my spirit, considering the Desolation, and the Judgment that is at hand, to be executed upon the cruel Oppressors. Wherefore all ye Rulers, and all ye that have troden down the Heritage of God, and ye that have disregarded these many Warnings that ye have had; I say unto you all, in the Power of the Lord God, in his Domini∣on, and by his Spirit; this is once more a Warning to you from the Lord, and that these things must surely come to pass, and be fulfilled in their Season, and no man shall be able to deliver his Brother; but every Man shall bear his own Burthen, and drink his own Cup prepared for him; and though it hath been counted a light thing amongst you, and you have di∣spised the reproof, and gone on without fear; yet in as much as the Lord hath spared you, and not speedily executed Judgment upon you, but rather waited for your return; yet the dealing of the Lord towards you in sparing of you, you have not accepted; and therefore shall his Judgments be the grea∣ter upon you. For if you do now come to the Witness in your own Con∣sciences; What evil have this People done? Whose Ox have they taken, or what have they desired of you? or what have they sought from you? or wherein have they been a burthen to you, Saving that they have reproved you for your Iniquities, and desired your Redemption? Would you but now at last come to consider this, and confess the truth in your Consciences; will not that tell you, that they have suffered patiently all things that you have cruelly imposed upon them? and have not they walked peaceably to∣wards you, and humbly, meekly justly among their Neighbours? and have they not been meek and innocent even as Lambs, and as the Sheep before the Shea∣rers? and have they wrought offences towards any? have they sought the overthrow of the Government, or have they sought vengeance against their Enemies? or what injury have they done to any man's Person, or Estate, sa∣ving to Satan and his Kingdom? Have they not sought to reform and re∣claim the Ungodly from their Wayes? and have they not pittied and prayed for their Enemies? and have they not in all things walked in good consci∣ence toward the Lord, and towards all men? Yea, my Friends, in the day of the Lord, when the Witness in your Consciences shall not be limitted, but shall speak plainly; and when the Impartial Judge shall appear upon his Throne, then shall you acknowledge these things. Wherefore I say unto you, receive the Judgment of the Lord to purifie you, otherwise the Judgment shall destroy you; and now come to be more wise, that some of you may be as a Brand pluckt out of the Fire, and be re∣served from being consumed; for the Visitation of the Lord is near an end, when his Loving kindness will be shut from you, and his Long-suffering turn∣ed into fury; and he will make you know that we are his People with whom you have thus dealt; yea, you shall suddenly know it, the time is not long till he will crown his People in the sight of his Enemies; he will crown them with Praise and with Righteousness, with Honour and Majesty, and he will keep them in safety, even when Sorrow compasses you about; his Mercy and Loving kindness shall extend towards them; even when his Wrath and Judgments doth smite you, and confound you. O! what shall I say unto you; for the deep sence thereof remaines upon my heart; for when I consider how that in all Ages the Lord did avenge his Peoples Cause; and when the
time of their suffering was expired, he brake the Bonds of Iniquty, and set them free: thus did he with his People Israel of old, and many times it was his way with his People to bring them low by suffering, and then to raise them up again in Glory; and he suffered their Enemies for a season to glory over them, that he might bring them down; and thus he did in England in the case between the Bishops and their crew of Per∣secuters, and the poor People at that day called Puritans; Did not he con∣found that persecuting Crew, and deliver his People? And is not he the same to effect the same Work at this very day? Yea doubtless, and much more will he do, in as much as the manifestation of Truth is more clear then it was in their dayes; and in as much as the Rulers and People of this Nation have rejected a more clear Testimony, then either the Papists in Queen Marys dayes, or the Bishops and Prelets in their dayes; even so much the more will the Lord God execute his Vengeance with more Vi∣olence, in a more manifest way; and all shall know, that it is he that doth it, and he will set his People free; for he hath regarded their Sufferings, and he hath said it is enough; for he hath tried them, and found them faithfull; and all this hath been suffered to prove them, and not to de∣stroy them: and like as he hath preserved them in patience and peace through it all, even so will he give them Hearts to walk answerably to their deliver∣ance; and as they have abounded in Patience in their Sufferings, so shall they abound in Praises everlasting in the day of their Freedom, and the Earth shall be glad, and shall yield the increase and blessing; the Heaven and the Earth shall rejoyce, and the Hearts of the Righteous shall leap for joy, when the Lord hath broken the Yoke of the Oppressed, and set his People free, inwardly and outwardly, and then shall they sing to the Lord over all their Enemies, who shall be tormented and vexed in the Lord's sore dis∣pleasure; for their Reward cometh, and their Recompence shall be even as work, and he will give unto them Sorrow and Anguish, instead of rejoycing. But again, when I consider the long Suffering, and patience, and forbearance of the Lord's innocent People under all their Sufferings; and when I looked at their innocency, and at their Righteousness, and Spirit of Holiness with which the Lord hath blessed them, my Heart was made glad in the con∣sideration of this; and the more was my joy, the more I beheld their in∣nocency, and the guiltlesness of their Cause, whereby the unjustness of their suffering did the more appear; and withal when I looked and beheld their increase under all their sufferings, and how that the Lord had turn∣ed all these things to their good, and to the overthrow of all their Ene∣mies; how that, by that way, wherein their Enemies intended to destroy them from being a People; even thereby did the Lord most wonderfully increase them to be a great▪ People; for through all have they grown in Life and Power, and in strength and in number, and through it all have they been incouraged to follow the Lord with more zeal and boldness: and in the consideration of this I did rejoyce, with magnifying the Lord for ever, that he had brought forth his Praise even through the wickedness of the Wicked, and he had increased his People, and exalted them through the cruelty of all their Enemies; and that through all Opposition they were attained unto a happy Rest, and through all the Tempest of great Trials, they were arrived into the Harbour of Renown and great Glory: And when I considered this, how that the Lord had given them dominion, and brought their life to reign over all their Enemies, these things were a joy unto me; and looking back into Ages, seeing there was nothing, nor any People for Generations, that had grown, and risen through all Opposition like unto these; wherefore is is a Sign and a Testimony that we are the Lord's, and that these things are of him, and from him, and by him alone, that he might be praised for ever.
Again, when I do consider, how that the Lord hath raised this People, even out of the Dust; and them that were not a People, are become a People; and the Lord hath provoked Nations by them that were not a People within these few years; and the Lord has carried on this Work amongst his People, not by any thing of Man, nor by the Arm of Flesh, but in pure innocency and simplicity hath it been accomplished; not by the Wisdom of this World, nor by men in places of Honour, and of Power in the Nations; for all that has been wanting to them; and what they are, it is through the opposition of all this; for they have had none of the great men of the Earth on their side to defend them, and establish them, but all have been against them; and even Op∣pression and Tyranny executed upon them, rather then any approbation, or justification from men in outward Authority: so that truely it may be said, that there hath been nothing of man in this Work, but all of the Lord, by his own Power, and in a contrary way to all the false Sects, and false Churches, hath the beginning and carrying on of these things been; for we know that all the false Sects in this Nation have risen and been established through the coun∣tenance of men in Place and Power, and upon man, and the Wisdom of this World, and Authority of the Powers of the Earth, hath the rise and fall of all false Churches depended: and as the Powers of the Earth have sided with them, so have they been set up; and at the displeasure of Authority, have been cast down. But as for this People, they are raised of the Lord, and established by him, even contrary to all men; and they have given their Power onely to God, and they cannot give their Power to any mortal men, to stand or fall by any outward Authority, and to that they cannot seek; but to the Lord alone, who heareth their cry, and will avenge their cause. Wherefore let all the Persecutors bow before the Lord, and let all the Saints walk humbly in his sight, and let them continue in that innocent Life in which they have begun; and let them never forget the Mercies of the Lord, and what he hath brought to pass, who hath manifested great things, and will do more and more to the confounding of all his Enemies, and to the praise of his elect People. And all ye Saints upon the Earth, have ye the Lord in respect continually, and turn you not unto Idols, but let the Lord be your joy for evermore. E. B.
TO THE RULERS And to such as are in AUTHORITY, A True and Faithful TESTIMONY Concerning RELIGION, And the Establishment thereof; and how it may be Established in PERSONS and NATIONS. THere hath been a great cry of late years among the Priests, and many others, for the settlement of Religion, and this they have sought after from the Powers of the Earth, and the cry hath been to Parlia∣ments and Rulers by the Priests and Professors for many years, settle us Reli∣gion, settle us Religion. Now to this I answer, all this cry, and this desire hath been by these Priests and Professors, to have Parliaments to make Laws, to establish one Sect, and throw down and limit all others, that is the chief thing that hath been eyed in the request, and not simply to have true Religion established; if we come to shew what true Religion is in it self. But people of divers Sects have been requi∣ring, and desiring every one to have their own Sect established and set up, and all others thrown down, and not to have a place, nor to be tollerated; so that their cry hath not risen from the Ground of true love to true Religion, but their desires have chiefly risen, and sprung from self love to their own Sect, and from Malice and Envy against others that were not of their Way: and this hath been the end of their craving the settlement of Religion, and not simply for true Religions sake. Now Religion in itself is this, The fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets, loving God with all their hearts, and the Neigh∣bour as self, and doing to all men, as they would have men to do to them, and not otherwise doing, or speaking towards any, then they would that others should speak of, or do to them, and a walking towards God in all things, as they have received of his Grace, answering to the Lord in all things as his Spirit leads them and moves them; this is true Religion towards God and towards man, and to have the Conscience alwayes kept void of offence, and that no offence lie upon it in the sight of God, nor in the sight of Man; and this is true Religion in it self, in short declared, to wit, The leading of the Spi∣rit of God into all Truth, to do the Truth, and speak the Truth in all things, and this Religion is accepted in the sight of God, and to be kept unspotted in the World, from all its Pollutions. But now tell me, can this Religion be set∣led,
or any Nation or People, or any Person in it by any external Power, or outward Authority of men? or can the Laws of Kings, or Parliaments set∣tle such Religion, or make people truly religious, or establish a Nation or People in this Religion? I say no, nor any thing, saving the Teachings and Leadings of the holy Spirit of God, being received from the Father, its that onely that makes men religious, and settles a People and Nation therein. Oh, ye Fools and blind Priests and Professors, that are doting on setling Religion among unconverted people by outward Laws, and earthly Powers of men; I say, no, this must not be; for the Laws of men can but settle a Sect, or some Sects, and limit other Sects; but true Religion can never be setled by that meanes; for before any be setled in Religion, they must first be changed, and created a new in Christ Jesus, and born again of the Seed Incorruptible, and they must first be changed from Death to Life, and from Satan's Power to God; this must first be Witnessed, before a Man or a Nation can be religious, and set∣led in true Religion, he must put off the body of Sin, and be circumcised in heart; and he must have a new Nature planted in him, and he planted into Christ a New and Living Vine, before he can love God with all his heart, and his Neighbour as himself, and before he can have his Conscience kept void of offence, and be without stain towards God and towards man; and it is onely the Word of God, and his Power in the heart, that works this; it is onely the operation of God's Spirit in and upon a Creature, that works him unto this; it is not the Laws made by man, that doth it, nor external Powers of the Earth that can work it; and therefore true Religion cannot be setled thereby, nor a Nation or a People in it; but onely that which changes him, and makes him religious, that is it onely that must settle Religion and Nations, and Peoples therein: and as every one is turned to that of God in him, and thereby to feel the Power, and Word, and Spirit, that doth change him, and renew him, as I have said, by this means cometh a Man and Nations to be re∣ligious, and to be setled therein, and by no other way nor means, and this is done through the preaching of the everlasting Gospel, and through the Mini∣stry of Christ, which turneth the Mindes of People from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's Power to God, whereby they are changed and made reli∣gious, and also setled therein, and established thereby; and it is not by outward Laws, and Powers, as I have said. But what are Peoples, and the Nations yet to settle in Religion? And is Religion unsetled yet, that you are craving Laws made by men to settle Religion? What have you preached for this many years? What have your preaching been all in vain? And have you done no good this many years by your preaching, that Religion is yet to settle? Oh! blind and ignorant Men, this is a shame unto you; how many thousands of thousand Pounds have the Priests had out of this Nation for teaching Religion, and preaching to People, and yet the Nation remains unsettled in Religion, and they are begging to the Powers of the Earth to constrain, and compel a settle∣ment of Religion? and this shames them, and shews that they are they that Paul speaks of, and that the people of this Nation are them that are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth, though you have been long learning, you are unsetled, and are not come to the knowledge of the Truth: but had these Priests been such that were sent of the Lord, through their Ministry would the Nations long since have been setled in Religion, for they have been Teachers long enough, and put the Nation to charge great enough, th people might have known ere this day the holy Anointing to dwell in them, and to teach them, and to settle them in Religion; but it is manifest that they have ran, and not been sent, but left Peoples and Nations unset∣led as the Waters, notwithstanding all their preaching, and ministry for so many years, yet it seems there wants still a settlement in Religion, and seeing their preaching hath had no effect to do it, but their Ministry hath been all in vain, and people are not learned in Religion, not yet established therein, whereby
their Ministry is proved not to be Christ's Ministry (for the Apostles did settle people, and the Churches in Religion, which theirs have done no such thing) and therefore it is that the Powers of the Earth are called to, that they may force by Violence, and by violent Laws, that by that means a Worship and Religion may be settled, as they say: and their Ministry hath not drawn people by Love, and therefore would they have people forced and compelled to be of such, or such Religion; but this is not Christ's Way, nor the Way that his Apostles and true Churches were in; for the Spirit of the Father led each one of them to be religious, and that same Spirit settled and established them in it; and not ex∣ternal Laws, nor Powers of the Earth, but that was Antichrist's Way, and the Beast's and the false Prophets Way; for when they had killed the Saints, and slain true Religion, then the Beast and false Prophets they established a Religion or Worship by outward Laws; and its written, That he caused and compelled all, both small and great, bond and free, to worship the Beast and his Image; and here was a settled People in a Religion and Worship by an outward compelling Power. And thus it was then, and is now the same, false Churches and false Religions are settled by an outward Authority; and it was Nebuchadnezar and his wicked Princes, that settled a Religion or Wor∣ship by an outward Power, and by an earthly Authority, but that was not the Worship of true Religion, but was the Worship of Antichrist, and so it hath been for Ages; that Worship that is settled, and that Religion which is esta∣blished by an outward external Power, and the Laws of men, is but the Wor∣ship of Antichrist, and not the true Religion, nor the Worship of the Living God, which is in Spirit and in Truth, but it must all be overthrown and brought to nought, both that Religion and Worship that is out of the Spirit, and that Power that upholds it: and now the Lord God is risen to confound the thoughts of mens hearts, and he alone will settle and establish Religion by his own Power, and by his own Law, and through his own Ministry: and as people come to that of God in them, to feel the Spirit and Power of the Lord God to change them, hereby will every one particularly be settled in Religion, and by no other way nor means; and this I know from the Lord. But how should people be settled in Religion? for Peoples and Nations have been, and are as Waters, which have been driven with the Winds, this way, or the other way; and the great Whore sits upon the Waters, and the Beast hath carried her, and born her up, (false Worships and Churches and an outward Power) and she hath ruled and made all Nations drunk with her Cup of Fornication, and the true Religion hath been lost for many Ages, and the Sects and false Churches have been set up and established upon the Waters; and as for true Religion, it cannot be established while Nations are Waters under the Whore's Dominion: and so the many Sects which have been the many Horns upon the Beast, and one hath risen after another, and one diverse from another, and they have been striving one with another, and persecuting one another, and one subduing another, and each one of them hath cryed for help from the Beast, and from the Powers of the Earth, to be defended from the Power & Malice one of another, least one should prevail against another, & get the better one of ano∣ther; and so that Sect that could get Authority from the Powers of the Earrh, and have them of its side, that Sect hath thriven, and hath been settled more then another which hath not gotten the Powers of the Earth to defend it; and so as the Powers of the Earth have been changeable, so hath Religion been chang∣able; and what Sect the Rulers have been on, that have they highest tolle∣rated, and most defended against all other: but all this hath not been the true establishment of true Religion. But now some may suppose, and query, whether I speak this, as if I would have Religion not at all settled, and as if I were against the establishing of Religion; and so thereby may be accused, as if I were an Enemy to all Reli∣gion, and would not have Religion be established, &c.
To all this I answer, I am a Friend to true Religion, and seeks the establish∣ing of it in the right way, and by the Ministry of Righteousness, by turning peoples minds to the Spirit, and to receive the Anointing that they may be all taught of God, and true Worshippers of him in Spirit and Truth, and may be settled in the true Religion; and this true Religion would I have established in the World, and in the Nations, and would have all people therein establish∣ed by the Ministry of Righteousness thereunto ordained. But I am against the establishing of Sects, and the settling of one Sect above another, by the Powers of the Earth; and I would not have one set up, and an other thrown down by the Laws of men; for that brings forth nothing but Tyranny, and Oppression, and Strife and wickedness in a Nation, and amongst People; though thus it hath been for many Ages, false Sects and false Churches have been established by the Earth, and external Laws, and that Sect which the King or Queen, or Ruler hath been of that hath been set up, and tollerated above the rest, and the rest despised, and persecuted, and set at nought; for when and where a Prince, or a Ruler is of the Papists Religion, then that Religion is the most established and settled in that Government; and if at any time a Ruler change to be of the Protestant Sect, or one come to govern that is of that Religion, then that Sect was the most established and upheld; thus it is through Nations, and in England particularly within these late years, when King Henry the eighth turned from the Papists to be a Protestant, then that Sect was established, and all other thrown down and persecuted; and when Queen Mary rose to go∣vern, which was a Papist, then she established that Sect and false Church by Laws, and the rest were limitted and thrown down: then when the next Queen arose being a Protestant, she established that Sect again by outward Laws, and cast all others down: and thus it hath been for many Ages throughout all Nations, of what Sect and Religion the Governor and Ruler hath been, that Sect was onely established, and all the rest persecuted, as I have said: and so the saying is fulfilled, Nations have been Waters, and Peoples and Multitudes Waters: And as a King and Governor hath changed his Religion and of what Sect as he hath been, so hath the Religion of the whole Nation or Country changed, and such a Sect onely established against all others: but this I cannot call the settlement of true Religion, nor are the Nations and Peoples hereby established in true Religion, but onely false Sects and false Religions have risen and been established by the Beast's Power, who hath carried the Whore; yea, and though many other Sects have risen, and many other Horns appeared di∣vers one from another, out of the many Heads of the Beast; for his Heads have been many, and his Horns divided, and divers one from another; and each Head exalting his self above another; and each Horn pushing one at an∣ther; and each Sect and Horn crying to the Beast for Power to be established, and to have others thrown down and limited through the Powers of the Earth. And thus hath it been for Generations, and in this Nation in particular; and many Sects have risen besides the Papists and the Protestants, and all these Sects have risen one out of another, and appeared divers one from the other; and each one of them have sought to the Powers of the Earth for settlement and defence; and that the other that were contrary to them, and of another ap∣pearance might be stopt and limited; and this hath been done by these Teachers and Professors under the account of establishment of Religion; and they have begged to Parliaments and to Rulers for the establishment of Religion, and for the stopping of Heresie, that is to say, for tollerating and defending of their own Sect, which they call Religion, and for the stopping and subduing of all others, which they call Heresie; but confusion hath come upon all this, and will upon the like for ever; and true Religion never gets established by it: but as every new Sect hath appeared, that onely hath sought establishment against all the rest. But yet I say, I am not against establishing of true Religion, though thus I
speak, but would have true Religion settled and established, but doth not seek to the Powers of the Earth, to have true Religion established by earthly Laws; for that cannot establish true Religion, neither is it at all committed of the Lord to the Powers of the Earth, or to outward Authorities to esta∣blish Religion, or to make men religious; for that belongs to the Lord to rule over, and in mens Consciences, and to exercise them in the true Reli∣gion: no Ruler by any Law whatsoever ought to exercise Lordship over the Consciences of any people, either to exalt or throw down any Sect, or Wor∣ship of Religion; for they are with their Laws but to rule the outward man, to settle their Persons and Estates in security, from the wrong and unrighteous dealing of wicked men, and to limit all evil men, and evil doers from wrong∣ing and doing violence to mens Persons and Estates; this is the work, and the place of Kings and Rulers of the Earth, their Power is onely committed to them of the Lord to extend over the outward man, to defend and preserve that, and be a praise to all that do well, and live Righteously, and to be a terror, and limit, and punishers of the unrighteous evil and violent Doers, this is the Magistrates place, and the length and breadth and height of his Authority, whether it reside in King, Queen, or any other Person or Persons. But for the exercise of Conscience, that is out of their Power, and over and beyond it; it is not committed of the Lord to them to compel and cause people from, or to such a Worship and Religion, it is not the Magistrates work, but the Ministers, that are sent of Christ to teach Religion: but let all Sects have their course, and every Religion its liberty in a Nation or Country (so that they do no Vio∣lence to one anothers Persons and Estates) and if they do, then they fall under the Magistrates Power; and then let them be punished: and let every Sect strive to exalt it self, and to overthrow others, by what authority it hath in Doctrine and forceable Arguments; and let them use what Spiritual Weapons they have, and defend themselves thereby, and let them that have the Spirit of God overcome, and let them alone to be established, and let all the rest be sub∣dued before that, and let that alone to be settled onely by the Power and Au∣thority of the Spirit of God, which overcomes all the contrary; and let all men, and all of man's Power and Authority be silent and quiet, and have no hand in this matter; and this is the way to establish Religion in a Nation, and a Xingdom: let the Spirit of the Lord have its liberty; and let no man whatsoever limit it in them in whom it dwells, but let it have its course and its operation, and its ull authority by them in whom it dwells, in whomsoever it : and let all Sects whatsoever have their liberty in their Arguments, and their Practices, and their Worship, and then let it be manifest, who it is that overcomes, and who it is that is overcome; and such as overcometh by the same Spirit and Power that gives them Victory; by that alone let true Religion be established, and the rest of all Sects bow under that true Religion that o∣vercometh all others by the Power and Authority of the Spirit of God, and is established thereby, all other under that shall bow; and whilst this is in try∣al and debate, let the Powers of the Earth, and the Rulers of the World be all quiet, and look on in patience, and let their Authority herein be exercised; not to limit one, or tollerate one more then another, onely let them keep mens Persons and Estates in peace and defence from the Injury and Malice and wrong dealing one of another, as I have said; and here is the way, the true and perfect way, for the establishing of Religion in a Nation among people; and if this were brought to pass, and had been in Generations past, then would not the Papists have been prevailed against by the Protestants, they being at the first dissenting from the Church and Sect of the Papist, more sincere to∣wards God, and more upright to him, and in some things more true in Doctrine and Worship, then the other which they dissented from, though still in the main but a false Sect, and of a false Religion, though they hated the Whore in some things, and they would have prevailed against her through that since∣rity
towards God, that was in them; but they gave their Power to the Beast; and would not many other Sects have prevailed against them, which have risen out of this, and dissented from her, who was more in the Sincerity and Up∣rightness towards God, than she? for God blessed that, and loved that, in what measure soever, and whatsoever it be; I say, would not many Sects ere this day have prevailed one against another, had not the Powers of the Earth stopped, and li∣mitted whom they would, and given liberty to set up whom they would? But now the Light of the Day is arisen, and hath appeared; and the Lord is making a Way to establish his own Religion, by his own Power; and he is gathering his Seed, who shall wax stronger and stronger, and shall prevail through all Opposition, through all false Sects and false Worships of the Earth, and they shall wax weaker and weaker, and shall never be established in Righteousness; but they and the Power that upholds them, shall be broken together; and this will the Lord bring to pass in his Day: And thus I have shewed you what true Re∣ligion is, and how it cannot be established, and how it may be; and what the Authority of earthly Rulers is, and how far it extends; and do shew that true Religion cannot be settled thereby, but by the Lord alone it must; and that it is the Work of Christ's Ministry, and not of earthly Power by violent Laws to establish Religion. And this is a testimony from the Lord God of Heaven and Earth to ye Ru∣lers, and Parliaments, that make Laws, and minister Laws; meddle not with Religion, to establish one Sect or Sects, and to limit and throw down others; but fear the Lord God, and wait for his Wisdom, and remember that that hath been a Rock whereupon many before you have been split, and brought into con∣fusion; even when they have gone about to limit, or stop, or establish Religion, how have they been confounded, and never had success from the Lord to such endeavors; for the Lord hath never shewed countenance, for many Generations, to such as have attempted to make men religious by outward Laws, and to settle Nations therein by outward Laws. Wherefore now be wise, ye Rulers, and kiss the Son; for the Wrath of the Lord is already kindled, and he will break in pieces, and dash Babylon's Children against the Stones, and confound the great Whore (the false Church) and all false Sects, her Daughters who have been brought forth, and set up in Nations ever since the Woman (the true Church) hath been fled into the Wilderness, and the Beast hath carried the Whore, born her, and upheld her; and she hath jour∣neyed through Nations upon the Beast; and the Beast hath defended her; if any man hath an Ear let him hear: and this is a Visitation to ye Rulers, and to all that make Laws, and minister Laws. By a Friend to Righteous Men. E. B.
Satan's Design DEFEATED: In a Short Answer to a Manuscript sent by a Priest out of Sussex, to a Member of this present Parliament, full of railing Accusations, whereby he hath secretly smitten the Innocent, by a secret desiring the Persecution of the People of God. But herein his Folly and Madness doth appear, that while he hath accused others falsly, himself is found guilty of the same thing. With Invitations of Love to the present Authority, that they may save themselves from being the Executioners of the Priests malice, least the Lord destroy them. A Certain Paper being come to my hand (which is said to be written by one Priest Iackson, and sent to a Member of Parliament) contain∣ing divers Particulars charged as Errors upon the dispised People called Quakers, wherein he saith he hath set down some of their Tenents which they maintain; unto which Manuscript I am moved to write some∣thing in answer, as to clear the Truth from his foul Aspertions which he casts upon it; to the intent that the said Member of Parliament, and the whole House may be better satisfied and resolved, wherein they doubt of every Particular, that the Truth may appear, when as the foul Vail of the Darkness and Slanders is removed. That the Holy Scriptures are not the Word of God, nor the Saints Rule of Faith His first Particular. and Life, neither is it the duty of every one to search them. Answ. The Holy Scriptures that were given forth by the Spirit of the Lord, as holy men of God were moved, they are the Words of God, and a Decla∣ration and a Treatise Luke 1. 1. and that which the Saints had handled and tasted of the Word of Life, that they declared forth in Words and Wri∣tings, Acts 1. 1. and the Scriptures as they were given forth by the Spi∣rit of God, are a true Declaration of what is to be believed and practised in relation to eternal Salvation; It is a true Testimony concerning God, and his mighty Works, and of Truth and Righteousness; and it is a Testimony also of the Devil, and what he is, and of his Deceits, and Errors, and Urighte∣ousness: so the Scriptures are Words given forth by the Spirit; but Christ is the Word that was before the Scriptures were; for in the begining was the Word of
God, and the World was made by it, and the Word shall endure for ever; and Christ's Name is called the Word of God: And though the Scriptures are profitable, and were given forth to be read, and to be fulfilled, yet they are not the Rule and Guide of Faith and Life unto the Saints, but the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures, that is the Rule, and Guide, the Teacher and Leader into all Truth; and them that are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God; and if you walk in the Spirit saith the Apo∣stle, you shall live, and as many as walk acording to this (to wit, of the Spirit) Peace is upon them; and so the Spirit of God is the Rule of the Saints Faith and Life; and the Spirit leads them to walk in the fulfilling of the Scrip∣tures, and according to them. And as for all the Priests in England, who do profess the Scriptures to be their Rule, out of their own Mouthes will God judge them, who are found walk∣ing contrary to the Scriptures in Life, and Doctrine, and Practises, while they cry it up for their Rule; and condemn all that will not say as they ay. And the last part of this Proposition is utterly false; for we ne∣ver do assert that it is not the duty of every one to search them; but we bid every one search the Scriptures, and every one ought to search them; but yet we say, that none understands them, but who have the Spirit that gave them forth, nor none can profit thereby, but by the Spirit that gave them forth, which works the same Truth in the Heart, which the Scriptures with∣out declare of; and this I do affirm, they are the Words of God, and the Spirit of God is the Rule of Faith and Life to the Saints; and all men ought to search the Scriptures, and to believe what is therein written, and to receive and enjoy Christ, who is the Substance and the End of all Things, the first and last, the beginning and ending; and in him the Scriptures are fulfilled, and finished. They do deny the Doctrine of the Trinity, and that Christ is God and Man in one His second Particular. Person. Answ. As for the word Trinity, it is invented, and he hath learnt it out of the Mass-Book, or Common-Prayer-Book, but we own the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ, that Christ is God, and the Spirit is God; and there are three that bear record, the Father, Son, and Spirit, and these are one, but God and the Spirit are not Persons, but Infinite Beeings; and the Scripture no where, in true Translations, expresseth God under the Name Person; for Person is too Carnal to express God, and Christ, and the Spirit by: but God was in Christ reconciling the World, and this we believe and acknowledge according to the Scriptures; but for this word, Doctrine of the Trinity, the Scriptures know no such word, but the Truth we own, and the Gospel and the Scriptures too. They hold that Iesus Christ died onely signally, or examplarily, and that we are justified His third Particular. by the Suffering of Christ in us, and to be healed by his Stripes, is to be stripped off, or from Sin. Answ. Jesus Christ died, and rose again, and ascended according to the Scriptures, this we do believe: And Christ was and is the Substance, the end of all Signs and Examples, yet was he an Example to the Saints; and the Apostle exhorted to walk as they had Christ for an example; and while he was in the World he did and spoke and acted many things as Parables, Signs and Examples, the substance of which is to be received in the Saints, and known by them through the Spirit; and we believe Saints are justified by Christ, and through Faith in him, which was, and is, and is to come, who is blessed for ever; and none are justified by his Death and Suffering and Blood without them, but who witness Christ within them; for all are Reprobates, and to be con∣demned and cannot be justified that have not Christ in them, as thou mayest read, (Except Christ be in you, you are Reprobates) and all that believe in Christ and receive him, they are healed through his Sufferings and Stripes; for he sanctifies them, and gives them Remission of Sin, and justifies them,
and in him the Saints are compleat, and the New-man (the Regenerate) is justified, and the old-man is in the Degeneration, and knows not Christ in him, and hath not received him, but onely heard of him without him, and believes the Relation: but this faith doth not justifie; for all the false Christians upon Earth have this faith: but that Faith alone justifies which gives to receive Christ, and him to live in us, and to dwell in us by that Faith. They utterly renounce the Doctrine of Iustification by the imputation of the Righ∣teousness His fourth particular. of Christ, or by the obedience he performed, or Sufferings he sustained or un∣derwent in his own Person without us. Answ. This is partly true, and partly a Lye; we do indeed renounce the profession of Justification by the Imputation of Christ or his Righteousness performed without men, by men while they are in the degenerated estate, and unconverted, and unreconciled, and unborn again; for by such profession of Justification many deceive their Souls: but yet we say, that Righteousness is imputed to us, and reckoned unto us who believe in Christ, and have received him, even the Obedience and Sufferings that he performed without us, is ours, who have received him within us, and witnesseth Christ in us, and therefore we are not Reprobates; yet we do acknowledge he wrought perfect Righte∣ousness by Obedience and Sufferings without us, and that Righteousness is ours by Faith, which Faith hath received Christ to dwell in us, and he and his Righ∣teousness, his Obedience and Sufferings we enjoy in us in Spirit; if any can receive it let them: for that he wrought Righteousness this is acknowledged; but who have a part in this Righteousness, that is disputable. They wholly renounce the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, and it is one of His fifth particular. the great Reasons for which they decry the Ministers because they assert it; they say Jacob and Esau are in a man, and the good Seed is Jacob which God electeth, and the bad Seed is Esau which he reprobates. Answ. The Doctrine of Election and Reprobation we do own according to the Scriptures, and therefore hast thou belied us, and slandered us, and art found reproveable, and would incense mens minds against us for advantage to thy self; but to some in that House we are better known then thou canst report of us; and yet thou sayest we say, that Iacob and Esau are in a man, and the good Seed God electet, and the bad he reprobates, and thou mayest here see thy confusion and thy ignorance uttered in the self same Lines; for thou sayest we renounce the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, and yet sayest we say, the good Seed God electet, and the bad Seed he reprobateth: and this shews what spirit thou art of, and how that the spirit of unrighteousness doth possess thee, and leads thee to speak without understanding; and we further say, man being degenerated, became reprobated and cast out, and all by nature are Children of Wrath, and the Children of Wrath are all in the reprobate State, and none are elected but who are elected in Christ the Seed of David; and so in the first Adam all are reprobated, and all that are in the second Adam are elected; and the Election and Reprobation stands not in the Persons, but in the Seeds, and yet the Persons are blessed or cursed, in the love, or in the displeasure of God, according as the Seed of God, or the seed of the Serpent lives and dwells and bears rule in the Persons; and we do indeed decry and deny you the professed Ministers, upon many accounts more then one; and we have alrea∣dy, and may in time to come shew sufficient Reasons against you, both in Doctrine and Practise and other wayes, that you are not the Ministers of Christ, but the Ministers of Satan generally. That Iesus Christ as he is the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of Abraham is in every one, and that a measure or part of the Substance that was conceived in the Womb His sixth particular. of the Virgin Mary, is in every one. Answ. Jesus Christ he is the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of Abrah according to the Flesh, and after the Spirit the Son of the Living God; and this Christ that was, and is, and is to come, who was dead, but is alive, and
lives for evermore, the alone Saviour of the World, he hath given a measure of Light and Life unto every man, and there is a Light from him that shines in the heart, of all men, shining in Darkness; the Light shines, but the Dark∣ness comprehends it not; and this was Iohn's Testimony, and is our Testimony, That Christ enlightneth every man, or all Man-kind that cometh into the World; for in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, as the Scripture saith; and the Apostle preached the Light that shined in peoples hearts, and it was that Light that gave them the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God: but thou hast discovered thy self to be a Stumbler at the stumbling-stone, and hath taken offence at the Light, like the Pharisees who professed the Scriptures as the Priests of England do, but were ignorant of the Life, the end of the words, and knew not Christ the Substance: but the Stone at which you stumble, will break you to pieces, and grind you to powder, even Christ the Light of the World, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World. That the Soul is a part or measure of God (as they speak) and not a part of man, but uncreated; and so is that Light which is in every one. His seventh particular. Answ. The Soul is immortal, and God is immortal; for God breathed into man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul (as saith the Scripture) and the Soul is related to God; for what a man works against God, it is against his own Soul; for all Sin is against God, and against a man's own Soul: And God who hath all Souls in his hand, who is the Creator, and gave Life into the Soul that is immortal, and can never die, though Death hath passed over it, and hath reigned over all from Adam till Moses; and Christ is the Light of the World that gives Life unto the Soul; and he raiseth up the Soul out of Death and Misery, and brings the Soul to rejoyce in God its Sa∣viour; and Christ is the Souls Bishop, its Pastor, and Feeder, and who knows Christ, knows him that was before the World was made, and sees to the begin∣ning, and to the ending, and his Soul rests in God that is over all. That the Light in the Heathen, who never heard that Iesus Christ died at Jeru∣salem His eighth particular. is the same for the quality of it, with that which is in the most godly Person; onely there is a difference in the quantity; And men are reconciled to God by follow∣ing of it; This Light they say is the sure Word of Prophesie, and that it is sufficient to lead out of all Sin unto God. Answ. The Testimony of Iohn is, that Christ is the Light that lighteth every mn that cometh into the World; and if every man, then the Heathen, who hath not the relation of Christ's Life, and his Death at Ierusalem, yea and it is the same Light that is in the Heathen, the same in nature and kind, as it is in the Saints; for the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth is one in it self and the same, though it comforteth the Saints, and reproveth the World, and the Wicked for their sins: And men are reconciled to God by Christ; for he was in God reconciling to himself, and none are reconciled but who walk in the Light, and follows it; for who walks in the Light, the Blood of Christ cleanseth them  all Si, and they are reconciled, and none else: And the Word of God is in the Heart, as the Scripture saith, Deut. 30. Rom. 10. and that is the Word of Prophesie, and that Word is sufficient to lead out of all Sin unto God, if men believe in Jesus and receiveth him: and the Spirit of Truth leadeth into all Truth, all that follow it. That Christ as man is not in Heaven, yea, that he hath ceased to be man, and con∣seqly to be Mediator; and when I told them he should come in the Clouds in like His ninth particular.  as he ascended, and that at his coming the Elements melteth; one of their  told me, that the Clouds were scattered, and the Elements melted in him. Answ. Christ Jesus is ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right Hand of the Father, yea he is ascended far above all Heavens, as saith the Scripture: But that is utterly false, whereas thou sayest, we say he ceased to be man, that is y Lye, and so I pass it: And we believe according to the Scriptures, that  shall come in like manner as he ascended, and at his coming the Elements
shall melt: And it is not error for a man to say the Clouds are scattered, and e Elements melted in him; for Clouds are Darkness, and covers the face of the Sun many times, as thou mayest behold in the Firmament: But Darkness is yet over thy Heart, and the Elements are not melted away; and therefore thou art in thy Imaginations, putting Light for Darkness, and Dark∣ness for Light, and calling Evil Good, and Good Evil. That the Bodies of Men shall never rise again after death; and that the day of Iudgement is come already; and that now the Saints do judge the World. His tenth Particular. Answ. We do believe the Resurrection according to the Scriptures; For if onely in this Life we have Hope, we were of all men most miserable: And we believe that the Dead shall arise again after death, and every one shall receive according to the Deeds done in the Body; they that have done Evil shall arise to Eternal Condemnation, and they that have done Good to Eternal Salvation▪ in the day of Judgement: And the Lord cometh with, and in ten thousand of his Saints to judge the World, and the Saints upon Earth do receive the Spirit of Judgement, and do judge the World, even all things; for the spi∣ritual Man judgeth all things, even in this present Age; if thou canst re∣ceive it thou mayest. They are utterly against Water-Baptism, and administring of the Lord's Supper His ele∣venth Par∣ticular. with Bread and Wine, because they say, they have the Substance of all within. Answ. As for Baptism and the Supper of the Lord we do own it, and it is practiced of us in the Life and Power of God; but as for your Baptism, that is to say, sprinkling of Infants, calling it the Baptism into the Faith, and that they are made Members of the Church thereby; and that it is a Seal of Re∣generation, as you say in your Common-Prayer-Book and Directory, that we do utterly deny, and do say it is no Ordinance of God, neither was it ever com∣manded by him, or practiced by his Saints, but is an Institution of the Whore of Rome, and England received it by a Popish Institution, and your practice of it is Idolatry, and not any part of the true Worship of God: And as for your breaking Bread, and drinking Wine, in that manner and form as it is practiced in the Church of England among the Unconverted and Unregenerated, that we utterly deny also to be of God, or to be ever commanded of him or practiced by his Saints; and this is neither Heresie nor Error in us, but true bearing wit∣ness against your Idolatrous Wayes, and Practices, with which the Nations are deceived, whom the Whore causeth to drink her Cup; even all people have drunk her Cup, and she hath drunk the Blood of them that would not; and she hath long sate upon Nations, Peoples, and Multitudes, but now she is made bare and discovered, and all you her false Ministers: And whereas the Author doth say, These are some of the strange and horrid Opinions which they have audaciously invented, &c. Answ. It is no strange thing that Truth be called Heresie and Error; and that it be branded with a Name of strange and horrid Opinions, and such like; but we do acknowledge, that in that Way which is called Heresie do we worship the True and Living God, and wo will be unto them that put Light for Darkness and Darkness for Light: But when these particular Things, and their Answers are truly read and weighed, then let spiritual Men judge; for this Author must not be Judge in his own Cause, whose judgement is corrupted, and his wayes Abomination: And it hath been the Work of that Generation (of those called Ministers I mean) for these seven years to cry out to the Magistrates, and to send one Paper after another of this nature to them; but what hath it advantaged them? for hath not the Lord turned their Wisdom backward? and even the Way which they have thought to destroy the Heritage of the Lord, the Lord hereby hath made his Heritage more glorious; and so the have striven against the Lord, and altogether in vain, and their doings shall they eat the fruit of, and receive the reward of their own Work. And whereas the Author further saith, Such as have saving work in their Souls, and that
kw God and Christ, &c. cannot but bless God for keeping them from the great Black∣ss and Darkness, that hath invaded the Souls of these deluded Wretches. Answ. They that know the saving Work in their souls, and that know God and Christ in Truth and Righteousness, and that call upon him with an up∣right Heart, we are all one with them, and they with us: And they alone that walk in the Light that Christ hath enlightned them withall, are kept from the Darkness that doth invade the Deluded: and as for thy envious reflection,  yr deluded Wretches, and such like; these words are to thy self, for they have no entrance into our Dwellings, the Lord hath saved us by his right Hand, and we bear them as his Reproaches for Righteousness sake. And whereas thou sayest, It is very sad that after so much preaching of the Gospel, so many should take those things for new Lights, which are but antiquated Errors, &c. Answ. It is very sad indeed, that the Ministers of this Nation should have so fair a Profession upon them, and should put the Nation to so much charge, by giving them Tyths, and Stipends, and Money, and have spoiled peoples Goods, and cast their Bodies into Prisons, even of many hundreds that would not pay them: And yet the Nation should be left in Darkness, and like an untilled Wilderness, notwithstanding all the Profession of preaching the Gospel; for the Nation hath been like an untilled Field, and like People, like Pri, like Shepherd, like Sheep, as it is, especially amongst them where Shep∣hes and the Sheep are risen in Rebellion against the Nation, and have joyned with  old Caveliers: But this shews, that your preaching hath been for En to your selves, and for Money, and that you have been Ministers of the Letter, and not of the Spirit, nor of the Power of God; for had you been in the Life, and Preachers of the true Gospel, the Nations had been as a Gar∣den at this day, and not like an unploughed Field, as we see they are; people abounding in Ungodliness, and in all Pride, and Vanity, which is a shame to Christianity; Now People and Ministers, have made a shew of the Gospel, but have been without the Power, in the Form of godliness; and have had the Form, but resisted the Power: And indeed the Ignorance of the People, will lie upon their Ministers, who have been crying Peace to them, that have walk∣ed after the Imaginations of their own Hearts; and have not turned the Wicked from his wicked Way; and the Scriptures are fulfilled upon them, They have run, but God hath not sent them, therefore the People have not at all been profited by them: But the Light of the Glorious Gospel is risen in mens Hearts, ad your Folly and Vanity is discovered, and that makes you rage and swell as a foaming Sea; now when your shame is seen, you are casting out Slanders and Reproaches, thinking thereby to sedue the Minds of people, thinking al∣wayes to keep the Magistrates on your side, and to ride upon them; and that they will establish you in Freedom, and destroy them that are against you: but the Lord is opening their Eyes to behold your Deceit and Madness, and you will be left unto your selves, and fall into the Pit that you have digged for others. And whereas this Author doth further compare this poor People, which he in scorn calls Quakers, with several pestilent Hereticks, as he calls them, that have disturbed the Church; and saith he, They agree with the Adamites, and Pharisees, and Sadduces, and with the Mannchies, with the Jews, Turks, Servebus, and with the Soscinians, and many more which he names, and saith, we agree with them; and  is to render us odious, and as abominable as he c, to mn in Authority. To all which I do answer, What we do profess, and practise for Religion, we have not been learnt by Man, nor been taught it by Men; not our Gospel, no Religion; but we have received it from the Lord, and of him are we taught, and by the Spirit led into all Truth: and though thou hast done as the Pharisees did, they reckoned Christ with Transgressors, and crucified him be∣twixt two Thieves; so though thou hast compared us with such and such, whom thou callest Hereticks, and it is possible many of them might be so: And so thou
hast shewed the spirit of the Pharisees, and of the Murderers, that denyed Christ; and we are known unto the Lord what we are, though not unto mortal Mans wisdom, that perisheth: And to whom shall we more truly compare the Ministers of England? Are they not like those which Isaiah cryed against, That sought, for their Gain from their Quarter, that were Greedy Dumb Doggs? and like them that Ieremiah cryed against, that said, Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord had ne∣ver spoken to them, nor sent them? and are not you all like them that Micah cryed against, chap. 3. That preached for Hire, and divined for Money, and that prepa∣red War against those that would not put into their Mouthes, as you do at this day? and are not you like them that Ezekiel cryed against, that made a Prey upon the Flock, and made Merchandize of Souls, and fed themselves with the Fat, and did not feed the Flock; but ruled over them with Force and Cruelty? and are not you like those that Christ cryed wo against, That were called of men Master, that went in long Robes, and loved Greeting in the Markets, and uppermost Roms at Feasts; for you act those things that Christ cryed Wo against the Pharisees, who did the same things? and are not you like them that Paul spoke of, That were heady, and high-minded men, and covetous, and Proud, and went in the way of Balaam for Gifts and Rewards, and that through Covetousness, with feigned words, made Merchandize of Souls? And are not you like them that Iohn saw were coming in, in his dayes, That went out from them, and that went into the world, that were of the world, and spoke of the world, and the world heard them, and which the World went after? and are not you of them that have deceived the whole World, that hath been of the Whore, that hath caused all Nations to drink her Cup, and of them that have made War against the Saints, and against the Lamb, of that stock of the false Prophets, that wrought Miracles in the sight of the Beast? and the World wonders after the Beast, and the Beast hath carried the Whore, and he hath compelled and cau∣sed all to worship him; and the Whore caused all to drink of the Cup of her Fornication: Are not these things so? may not the Witness of God in all mens Consciences truly answer hereunto, and condemn you to be such as were the false Prophets, and the Hirelings and the Deceivers, against whom the Pro∣phets, Christ, and the Apostles gave witness? Yea, it is manifest that you are in the same way, and of the same Generation, and that you follow the same spirit, because you shew forth the same works: And are not you like the Pa∣pists and the Iesuits? was it not by the Authority of the Pope of Rome that your very way of making Ministers was ordained at Schools and Colledges? and was it not the Papists, and in their dayes, that the general part of your Church-Discipline and Government, the Call of your Ministers, and Pra∣ctise of them, and Maintenance of them; was it not first set up by the Papists? Was not this way of Tythes first established by the Church of Rome? and do not you follow the Papists herein, in receiving Tythes, and Gleab-lands, and Easter-Reckonings and Midsummer-Dues, which you hold up, and would destroy them that will not give you such things? and therefore are not you like the Papists and Jesuits? yea; we know that the Church of England is but newly come out of the Womb of Popery, and hath the Symptoms thereof upon her at this very day in many things; yea, the Testimony of God in all peo∣ple may witness hereunto: And so it is the very trick of the Whore, to cry out against others, and to charge others with that which she is guilty of her self; but now it will not cover them, to slander others that themselves may seem clear; for the Lord is opening peoples Hearts, and giving them a Spirit to discern all things. And whereas the Author speaks against the Quakers, for crying against Cuffs, Caps, and for using Thee and Thou; and for crying against Pulpits, and Hour-Glasses, and for such things; and for owning Revelation, and for holding the free Grace of God to be given unto all, and because of Trembling and Quaking, and saying, Our Wri∣tings are given forth by the same infallible Spirit that the Scriptures were given out by, and for crying down the Ministers Maintenance, and for calling some of them Vipers and Serpents.
To all this I answer, It is your Generation that makes a great noise about thee and thou, and Cuffs, and Caps; for we in plainness and simplicity do speak the proper Language, thee, and thou to a single Person, and it is the proud and ex∣alted Minds of Men that are offended hereat, which Pride and Arrogancy hath eaten out the very Sincerity, and the property of Speech also, and you are offended at us because of it, and for crying against your Cuffs, and Boot-hose-tops, and Ribbands, and Points; we cry against all these things as not becoming the Mini∣sters of Christ, but as being of the World, in the Pride, and Vanity, and Super∣fluity, abusing the Creation, which the Lord will judge among you: And as for having an hour-Glass, and preaching thereby, and as for your carnal Bells which you call people by, we do disown these things, and say, They are old popish in∣ventions; for the Ministers of Christ never limitted their spirits to an hour-Glass, neither had they a carnal Bell to call people to their Worship; and as for Revelation, we do own that the Spirit of God doth reveal Truth to us, and God hath revealed Christ in us, and none ever shall know God but by Revelation; For none knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him: And as for Free Grace, we say, The Grace of God hath appeared to all men; and it teacheth the Saints to deny Ungodliness, but the Wicked turns it into wantonness, and doth dispite unto the Spirit of Grace; and we also say, That who now speaks, or are moved to write forth by the Spirit of God, they speak and write by the same Spirit that is infallible, that the Scriptures were given forth by: And as for your Mainte∣nance, it is altogether Abominable and Oppression to the Nation, and the Lord is against it, your taking Peoples Goods, and casting them into Prison, that will not pay you Wages, and give you Tythes against their Consciences: And be not offended at being called Vipers, and Serpents; for these are the Works of venemous Vipers, and stinging Serpents, which persecute the Servants of God, and cryes to the Magistrates for help against a poor People, that useth no Wea∣pons at all against you, saving that of the Spirit of God; and though we do thus to you, to the false Ministers, to cry against them, and give our witness against them in the Name of the Lord, yet we do not deny the true Ministers of Christ, nor speak any thing against them which are the true Ministers, that have re∣ceived the Ministry of Righteousness by the Gift of the holy Spirit, which all that are true Ministers, do receive their Ministry thereby. And whereas thou sayest, we are bitter Enemies to the Doctrine of Iustification, and agree with the Cavelierish Party, and would silence godly Ministers, and are Isuitical, and such like things thou falsly chargeth upon us; and that we have a not able faculty to delude ignorant unstable Souls, &c. Answ. These are but the Author's Reproaches, and his Slanders, he hath filled his Mouth with, against the Innocent; and he hath set his Tongue on the Fire of Hell, to slander the ust, and the Innocent: and all these things we bear in pa∣tience, counting Reproaches for Christ our chiefest Riches; and thus to the sub∣stance of this Paper, I have given an answer, whereby all that love the Lord, and desire to be informed in the Truth, may receive satisfaction; for it is seen that that Generation of Priests are joyned with the prelatical Cavelierish Party, and this is known at large in the Nation, in the North especially: and so as I said, they would fain slander others, that themselves might seem clear; but the Lord will rebuke him, and his lying Tongue, and the Innocent shall be delivered from his devouring Lips: And as for any other thing in his Paper, it is not worth an∣swering to, nor worth minding; but his wickedness will turn upon his own head, and he shall bear the burthen of his own words, onely he queries, whether this be not the Pestilence that walks in Darkness? And the Flouds that the Dragon hath cast out of his Mouth to drown the Woman? Is not this the mark of the Beast, who opened his Mouth in Blasphemy? And are not these the Unclean Spirits, that came out of the Mouth of the Dragon, and out of the Mouth of the false Prophet? Answ. Now the Pestilence that walks in Darkness, is the Plague (that is out of the Light) Sin, and Death, and Misery, which smites the Ungodly, and he sees it
not: And the Floods which the Dragon cast out, is the Floods of Persecution and Cruelty (viz.) The imprisoning until death, and spoiling peoples Goods, for Tythes and Mo∣ney, as the Priests have done: And the Dragon gave power to the Beast that com∣pell'd all to worship, and that carried the Whore, the false church; and the true Church has bin fled into the Wilderness for many Generations; and the false church (the Whore) has sate as a Queen, and given her cup to drink: the false church of Rome, and the false church of the Protestants, all which are of the Whore, these have all been carried by the Beast which the Dragon gave his power to; and they have all per∣secuted the Woman, the true Church, & the Mark of the Beast he compell'd people to receive, & compell'd them to worship; and they open their mouthes in Blasphemy that deny Christ, and deny the Light, and that say they are Iews, and are not; this is Error and Blasphemy which the Beast opens his mouth in, against the Saints, and against them that dwell in Heaven: and the unclean spirits are the spirits of De∣vils, that are out of the Truth, and these the Dragon casts our in Slanders; and Re∣proaches and Lyes, such as this Author has done, and of that Generation is he. Christ said, False Prophets should come; and Iohn saw in his dayes, they were come, and he saw the world gone after them; & of that Generation are you: and now the Lord is gathering people from you again, and Babylon must fall, and all her Merchants howl and weep: and these things have been which the Scripture speaks of, & the Woman is now coming out of the Wilderness again, and the Whore must be rewarded, and sorrow is coming upon her, & as she has done unto the Saints, so shall the Saints do unto her. And in the Conclusion he saith, Worthy Sir (to this Member of Parliament) it will be your Honour to stand in the Gap, to stop the violence of this Hellish Torrent, that is so high, that it sounds from Dan to Beersheba, and threatens Iudgment to our Israel, &c. Answ. Here is the Conclusion of thy matter, which is the sum of it, a running to the Powers of the Earth for help; what, have you Ministers lost the Lord to be your strength, that you must flee for help to men to defend you from the Spirit of God in his People? Must they make Laws to establish you, and set you up? Is not this the Whore that road upon the Beast, and that the Beast carries? Is not here a De∣scription of her out of the mouth of this Author? Is he crying to you, to persecute the Innocent? It is true, the Seed of God is risen, the Elect Seed, that is able to make War against the Beast, and against the false Prophets, even with the Word of the Lord; and is he offended that Truth is risen so high? and would he have some Fire and Faggot again in Smithfield, and some Persecution and Banishment acted upon the People of God? Is this the standing in the Gap, and stopping Vi∣olence, or would he have it done this way? Yea, Judgments indeed are threat∣ned to your Generation; for, if God will not destroy you soon enough, you will destroy your selves; and your own Iniquity will be upon you, and the wick∣edness of the Wicked shall slay him. But my Counsel is not only to that parti∣cular Member, but to the whole Body of them, That they be wise, and take heed what they do; for the Eye of the Lord is over you, and his Hand can dash you in pieces; and if you be Oppressors of the People of God, and will not relieve the Oppressed, the Innocent, and break the Bonds of Oppression, the Lord will break you in pieces; for this is the Rock that hath broken all before you, Persecuting people for Conscience sake; and if you go in this way, your Destruction shall be the most lamentable of any that was ever yet before you: Do you not yet see the Wicked∣ness of this Generation? will you yet contend for them? Surely you might learn Wisdom, even by their Folly; and if you do not shut your eyes, there needs no more discovery then their own present wayes and works. Wherefore consider, the Day of God's Visitation is upon you, make good use of your time, lest the Lord breaks you down, and never build you up; and let the Spirit of the Lord have its Liberty, and limit it not; for if you do, you shall never prosper, nor never be made a Blessing unto the people under your Charge. Remember you are warned by a Lover of your Souls,
ANd Friends, Great Things hath the Lord done in these Nations in your dayes, and that by the Face of your Authority; and there has a Spirit stir∣red in some of you, and in the Army, which the Lord hath appear'd with, and yet the Work of the Lord is not finished; but greater things then these hath the Lord to accomplish amongst us, and in this Nation; and these things that have come to pass, have been but as the preparing of the way for the bringing about of greater things: It is true, many Mountains have been removed, and some Oppressions taken off, and excellent things have bin promised, and doubtless (by some of you) really intended; but alas! the Work hath long remain'd unfinished, and many of your best Friends are almost weary with waiting to receive the end of their Hopes and Desires; and many are even fainting concerning the Good Old Cause, though of late it hath seem'd to be revived by you, yet it goes but easily forwards. and even so little is its growth since your late Meeting, that many are thinking themselves to be in a deceiv'd condition by you: Why? They see that wicked Clergy's Interest more prospering then the just Freedom of the People. And this I say unto you in the Name of the Lord, That while that Interest (of this false Priesthood I mean) is so much favoured and defended, you can never prosper, nor the Nations be ever happy under you; for it is one of the greatest Oppressions this day in the Nation, the maintaining and upholding of this Ministry by Tythes, and other unrighte∣ous Wages; and the very Land groans under the Oppression of this Church and Ministry, which lies as a heavy Burden upon both Persons, and Estates and Con∣sciences of many good People, even of your dearest Friends; and though the Lord doth manifestly (even from Heaven) shew signal Tokens of his Displeasure against them, and the Servants of the Lord, they also cease not to warn you con∣cerning them, & their own doings are sufficient Testimony of the Malice of their hearts against you, and all good men in the Nation; yet nevertheless some of you seem to shut your eyes, as if you would see no Evil in them, but are crying up your godly Ministers; & some of you utterly despising the man (as not worthy to live) that doth but speak against them; and thus are you blinded, and perceive not where the Cause lie of your Interruption, to bring forth Righteousness: I say, It is the favouring of that interest which stops the issue of Good Things; and while you oppress peoples Persons, and Estates, and Consciences, to uphold this Mini∣stry and Priesthood aforesaid, the Lord shall never prosper you, nor make the Nations ppy under your Charge; and this you shall witness eternally. Wherefore I do say unto you, it is high time for you to lay aside the interest of this oppressing Clergy, so much leavened and tasted of the Whore of Rome; your selves do know that the spirit of the Romish Clergy was in the late Bishops, which you cast out for their Wickedness; and the very spirit of those Bishops is entred into these Priests, and bears rule in their hearts; and thus by succession hath the Whore of Re leavened the Clergy of England, from one Generation to another, with her taste and savour, and there is the remainer of her Murders and Cruelties in those mens Brests, and at every opportunity it breaks forth, as of late in this Rebellion you have full Testimony; and if you do not curb it speedlly, it will grow over you, to your undoing. Therefore clear your selves, do not any longer drink the Whore's Cup, neither be ye Carriers of her, to execute her Wickedness upon the Bodies and Consciences of people; for it is written, The Beast hath carried the Whore; and we see it hath been thus, as Iohn saw it was to come to pass; and so clear your selves from her Tyrannies and Oppressions, and leave this false Church and Ministry to themselves; and if God will not uphold them by his Pow∣er, why should you do it? If these Priests have not yet planted Vineyards that will yield them Fruit, and if their Flock will not yield them Milk freely, why should you unjustly im∣pose upon peoples Consciences, and compel Tythes and Money from them, for the maintenance of these men? Ye ought not to do it; for while ye Compel and Force People by Violence, contrary to good Consciences, to Maintain and Uphold this
Ministry, and Church, and Worship, you do but cause people to drink the Whore's Cup, and you are but them which carry the Whore, viz. the false Church; and this is Plain-dealing, to tell you the Truth, whether you will reject it, or receive it: wherefore cast them off, and let them not lurk under your Wings; for, one day they will rebel against you, and another day flatter with you; and for a season they will shew forth much Love and Kindness in Hypocrisie, even while they are hatching Mischief against you, and to bring the Nation into Blood; and they will cry out Heresie and Error of others, that themselves may seem clear, while as the same lodgeth in their own Hearts: wherefore I say, do not make a false Peace with them, nor do not flatter with treacherous minds; for you had better have them your open Enemies, then deceitful and flattering Friends; you had better be in a just Opposition against them, then in an unjust Peace with them: I know it appears to many of you, a thing very hard to be born; What! to forsake our Godly Ministers, think ye? to hear tell of laying them aside is an amazement to some of your minds: was it not the same con∣cerning the King and Bishops? was it not as much terrible to him, and his Lords and Council, to think of the overthrow of the then called Godly Fathers and Bishops? but better had he cast them off, and saved himself, then to have perish∣ed with them: and so I say unto you, better were it for you to lay these men aside, and their Flatteries and feigned Prayers, and to save your selves from their Flattery, then to perish with them; and the one of these will come to pass: For its decreed of the Lord, If you uphold them, and oppress People's Persons, Estates and Consciences on their behalf, and in their evil Cause, for Tythes and Wages to them, ye shall fall with them, and none shall be able to deliver neither you nor them: For I tell you again, That the very spirit of the old Idolatrous Bishops (long since cast out) is entred into the hearts of these men; and there is as great a measure of Tyran∣ny, and Injustice and Abomination lying upon these, as once was upon the Bishops; and these are no less free from any Abomination, then they were, and these are nigh as ripe for Vengeance, and Overthrow, as the others were; and it will as surely come upon these, as it did upon them: wherefore take heed unto your selves, and be wise, and learn, and do us Justice, or else God will do us Ju∣stice upon you; if ye will not take off our Burdens, and ease our Oppressions, the Lord God will ease us of you, and the Earth shall not be oppressed with you; and if ye will uphold this Priesthood against Equity and Good Conscience, the Lord will free Good Consciences both from you and them: And this is the Word of the Lord God to you. The open Enemy hath not prevailed against you; but the secret Hand of the Lord will not miss you. By a Friend to Righteousness, E. B.
A Visitation and Warning PROCLAIMED, And an ALARUM Sounded in the Pope's Borders In the Name and Authority of the Lord Almighty, and the LAMB. Being the Account of a Journey to Dunkirk, and the Proceed∣ings there among the Iesuits, and Fryars, and Papists; with some particular Queries, and also some Propositions sent unto them. Which may be Satisfaction to many, who may behold the Difference in part between the Papists and the People of God, and between the Idolaters and the True Worshippers. The Particulars, and the Heads laid down. 1. The Account of the Iourney. 2. A Letter to the Deputy Governour, and the Officers of the English Army. 3. Queries to the Fryars. 4. Propositions, as a Charge against the Romish Church; with a Letter to the chief Jesuit, Rector in Dunkirk. 5. A Warning to the Officers and Souldiers of the English Army. 6. Some Propositions to the English Priests in Dunkirk; with some other things. ACcording to the Will of the Lord, and being moved of him in Spirit, and as it lay upon me many dayes, I passed to Dunkirk: And that which I found upon me chiefly, was to visit and warn the Papists, the Iesuits, and Fryars, and that Company of Idolaters; and to sound the Mighty
Day of the Lord among them, and to proclaim it in the Pope's Borders, and to warn them of the Day that is at hand upon them by the Word of the Lord; and to sound forth among them the Everlasting Gospel of Truth; and against all their Idolatrous Wayes, Worships and Practices, which I have of∣ten felt the weight and burden of before ever I saw outwardly what their Wayes or Practices are; which when I saw their Idolatrous Practices and Worships, and heard their Doctrines, and what they profess, I found it to be according to what I had seen and felt in the Light that trieth all things. And about the sixth day of the third Moneth, 1659. I (with Samuel Fisher, who was moved to go with me) shipped from Dover, and came into Dunkirk the next day; and being Strangers upon Earth, as the Generation of the Righteous Seed ever was, we waited in the Will of the Lord, to be guided by his Wisdom what to do, and how to be guided to act and speak to his Glory: So the next Morning the Town Mayor came to us in the Street, and required an account of our coming, and our Names, and from whence we came; to which we gave him sober Answers, and a reasonable Account. And that day it much spread over the Town of our being come thither, which wrought no small Cogitations in the Hearts of many, as what our Business was, and wherefore we were come; so that the Deputy Governour, Colonel Alsop, with the Council of Officers, sent for us that Night (the chief Governour not being in Town) so we went to them, who did kindly intreat us, and examine us concerning our coming thither, and what our Business was there, and such like; to which we gave them Answers, and staid with them in Discourse some Hours: and the Deputy Governour much plea∣ded to us the Danger of our staying in the Town, and feared the Division that might grow amongst them through us; and withal, much desired us to depart the Town, supposing, as he said, the great Danger that might incur unto the Garrison through our stay: But our Answer was in much plainness, If he desired us, we could not receive any such Desire; and if he commanded us, we could not obey his Command in that case; neither could we depart the Town, but in the Will of God, according to which Will we came thither: and having many words, and much reasoning with them that Night, we parted from them. And the next Morning I was moved to write this Letter following, and to give them all a sober Account of our coming, and what our Work is in this World, wheresoever we come: which Letter was delivered to them, and read by many of them; but to it we received no Answer, according as the latter part did require, as may be seen.
Dunkirk, the eleaventh of the third moneth, English account, 1659. To the Deputy Governor, and the Officers of the English Army in Dunkirk these. FRiends, we the Servants of the Lord, are Lovers of all your Souls, and wisheth well unto you in the Lord, that Truth and Peace, and Righteous∣ness may be among you, and in your Hearts; and we are Travellers in the La∣bour of the Gospel of Christ Jesus for the Elect Seed ake, having received the glad Tydings of Life, and Eternal Salvation into our Hearts, through the Re∣velation of Christ in us, who is our Hope of Glory; and the Lord hath manifested greatly his Power amongst us, and revealed the Riches of his Grace in our Souls, to our own everlasting satisfaction and peace with God: and also he hath made us Ministers of his Grace, and of his Word to many others, to the turning of many from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's Power to God; and of him we are called, and ordained by his Spirit into this his Work, to preach the everlasting Gospel to the Nations, and to war against Antichrist, the Whore and false Prophets, who came up since the dayes of the Apostles, and have reigned over all the World for many Generations: and this is our work in the World, to fight the Lamb's Battel with his Spiritual Weapons and Armour, and to fol∣low him whithersoever he goeth, and to give up our elves in his Service, to do or suffer for him whatsoever he calleth us unto; and in this hitherto hath the Power and mighty Presence of the Lord God been with us, and is with us un∣to this day, and great is his Name amongst us his People, and to be praised for evermore: And of this hath God given us the sure Witness in our selves, even the Testimony of his good Spirit, which bears us witness in our own Consci∣ences, that these things are true, whether men believe, or reject our Testimony; for we are not Ministers of Man, nor by man's will, neither do we stand to man's Judgement, to be approved, or disapproved thereby; but to the Witness and Testimony of God's Spirit in every Conscience we do commend our selves, where ever any of us do come, in the simplicity of Truth, in the demonstra∣tion of the Spirit; and not by words of Man's Wisdom: and in the Day of the Lord shall we be justified herein by him, and by his Witness in all mens Consci∣ences; and in the mean time we do suffer all things patiently, and in the meek and quiet Spirit of the Lord: And as for us two in particular, who are now come into the Town of Dunkirk as we have in some part declared unto you already; and so here I again say unto you, not being ashamed nor unwilling to give you an account of our coming; for we came to be made manifest, openly in the sight of all men, in our Doctrines, Principles, and Practises, which are of and from the Lord, and fully agreeing in all things with the Scriptures of Truth, which were given forth by the Spirit of Truth, as the holy Men of God were moved; and as we have said to you, we still testifie, we were moved of God, and by his Spirit to come unto this Place in love to the Souls of People; and it is the Lord God that hath sent us, and not Man; and whether you believe us herein, or do reject us, the Testimony of God is sure; and remains with us; and for the Truth hereof, we are not afraid to do and suffer, but can do, and suffer in the strength of Christ whatsoever is put upon us; though chiefly our coming was (so far as the Lord shewed us) in relation to these Popish Idolaters, to discourse with their Iesuites, Friars, and Priests, and to discover to them the Errors óf their Wayes, and the falsness of their Worships, and to testifie unto them, in the Fear and Power of the Lord concerning their Church, that it is not a true Church of Christ, but a false Church, come up in the
Apostacy; and these things we have to argue with them, if the Heads of them will admit dispute, otherwise to charge these things upon them from the Lord, and by his Authority; and if they do any of them receive our Testimony, and turn from their Idols, and be converted unto the Truth, they may be happy; but if they shall reject our Testimony, and not believe the Truth; then shall they the more be fitted for Destruction, and the Day of their Destruction the sooner approacheth, and the Lord shall be clear of their Blood, and our Reward shall be with us from God; for our Testimony shall not return to us in vain, but shall accomplish its end wherefore it is sent, and the Word of the Lord by us shall either convert to God, and to the Truth that they may be saved, or shall through rejecting of it, harden the Heart against God, and against the Truth, that they may the more justly be condemned, and the Lord and his Servants be the more clear: and no other thing saving this do we promise to our selves as the success of our endeavours, and not so much in relation to the men of our English Nation are we come, though the Gospel of Salvation is freely come to them also, that they may be freed from the Captivity of Sin and Death; and we may not work, nor cause any disturbance or grief to any of them, further then what they may take at us for the Truth's sake, or for declaring it in the fear of God, and without any just cause given by us to any of you, or them; though we dare not promise to you, nor our selves, what we will do, or what we will not do; onely this we say, if the transgression of any just Law can be charged upon us, we refuse not to suffer what shall be imposed; and this we do believe, that the Lord will so keep us, and order us by his Spirit of Truth, and carry us in Meekness, and Righteousness towards you, while we stay amongst you, be it weeks, or moneths, that you will have no just occasion against us, by any Offence justly ministred by us; and if you do take occasion against us without any just cause given, be it upon your selves, to your own Shame, and Condemnation in the sight of God and men; for we are clear, onely this we do give unto the Lord, and can∣not unto Men, the exercise of our Consciences, and to be obedient unto the Teachings of his Spirit in all things, as he shall guide and lead us; and if he commands to do, or not to do any thing, and you the contrary, we must obey him, though we disobey you; for its better to obey God then Man: and when he bids speak, in what Place or Season soever, we may not be silent; for to keep our Consciences clear in the sight of God, in all things, by Obedience to him, is our care, and study, and that which we are given up to do; and if you set your selves to gain-say this, it will turn to your own destruction; for no other promise then this can we make for our selves, but to do, and speak amongst you, as the Lord our God shall move us, and lead us: and this Testimony we do bear for the Lord, he doth not move us, nor lead us to any thing, saving to what is Just, Good, and Holy, which may tend to the Happiness, and Peace, and Welfare of your Souls, and Bodies also; and in the Father's will we stand, and as we came in his Will, so we cannot submit to stay, or go at any Man's will, save the Lord's alone: And as concerning our coming, and staying, and Work here, this is a sober account to you, which may satisfie you, and any sober and reasonable men: And as concerning our being with you yesternight, many things passed from some of you, and your Ministers chiefly, to which I had a great desire to have answered, and to have cleared the things objected against us; but time and his patience afforded not the opertunity: therefore now this I do propound about the Call to the Ministry, which was the thing in dispute; to which I then could freely have spoken, whether he will give me and us a fair meeting, in some publick Place, that is convenient for your selves to hear, and be judge between us, to discourse this Matter (viz) what the true Call to the Ministry is, which is truely according to the Scripture, and that to be laid down first, and then to compare his Call to his Ministry, and also his Call to Dunkirk with what the true Call is, which is allowed of, and approved in the Scriptures; and also to compare our Call to the Ministry,
and even our call to Dunkirk, with what the true Call of Christ s Ministers was, as declared in the Scriptures; that it may be seen whether his Call, or our Call, is the most different from, or agreeable to the Scriptures; and even the Light in your own Consciences shall be Judge between us in this Cause; and upon such an Issue, upon a just Determination would we gladly joyn tryal; and such a Meet∣ing, upon such Grounds and Proceedings, may tend to satisfie your selves, and many more; and such a Meeting I do fully desire with your consent, and con∣currence, who may preserve the people in Peace and Soberness, that all may be dified in the things of so great moment, as this is: For if he can prove his Call to the Ministry to be such as was the Apostles, and Ministers in the true Christi∣an Churches, before the Apostacy, then shall we own him, and not deny him; but if he cannot do this, and if we can do it on our own behalf, in the Power and Spirit of the Lord, then may you and all men judge who are the true Mini∣sters of Christ, and who are the Deceivers. And this manner of proceedings would deside all Doubts in you about us; and we shall be clear in manifesting the Truth concerning the true Ministry and the false, and the difference be∣tween them in their Call, in their Practice, and in their Maintenance. And this is sent to you to read and consider of, in the Fear of God, as the Testimony of our Love to you and the Truth, that you may take heed to your wayes: and we would receive first your Answer, whether you do consent, and will allow such a Meeting; and secondly, his Answer, whether he will undertake such a Dispute: and we further are ready to clear all Doubts that may remain in you about us, who are your Friends, and desire your Prosperity, and Faithfulness in what the Lord calls you unto. By Edward Burroughs, Samuel Fisher. And the same day we went to the Capuchine Fryars, and had some Discourse with the chiefest of them in their Garden, concerning the Light of Christ that every man is lighted withal: and we did declare to them of the Mighty Day of the Lord, that was at hand upon them; and the Lord was come to search them, and try them, and would hew down their Idolatrous wayes, and worships, and works, &c. And in order to a fair proceeding with them, the next day I was moved to write this following Paper to them, by way of Queries, as to lay some ground of Opposition; hoping to have received their Answer, that I might have joyned tryal with them: for, it was in my heart, to search and oppose their Wayes and Practices, and their whole Religion. And these Queries were deli∣vered to them in Latine, though from them I have received no Answer to this day; but the Queries stand upon them, and my Charge they lie under, charged upon them in the Name of the Lord. To all ye that profess your selves Devoted to the Service of God, and Separation from the World, and Mortification in your lives, who are called by the the name of Fryars and Nunns, in, and about Dunkirk. THe Mighty Day of the Lord God is come, and coming upon you, and all the World; Awake, awake ye that sleep in the Earth; for the Dread∣ful God is arising to plead with you, and to give unto all the World the Cup of his fierce Indignation, because of your Idolatries, and Hypocrisies, and Abo∣minations, which have corrupted the Earth, and are come up before him, and have provoked him; and the Cry of the Just, who hath been smitten and laid slain, is entred into the Ears of the Most High; and his Sword, which is the word of his Mouth, is awakened to wound and slay all his Enemies: And the Day of your Vi∣sitation is now come, wherein the Lord is searching you, and trying you, that he may recompence you; and this is the Word of the Lord to you.
Wherefore I am moved of the Lord to propound some few Queries to you, for the tryal of your spirits and wayes; to which I demand your Answer, that all things may be brought to Light, and true Judgement, and that you may be judged justly, and by the Spirit of the Lord cleered, or condemned accor∣to your Deeds? 1. Whether there were such order of Men and Women in the true Church of Christ in the Apostles dayes? and where did Christ give Institution for such Worships, Practices, and manner of Life, slouthful idleness, and unprofita∣bleness to God and Men, as ye hold forth? And whether any are bound to be∣lieve you, and follow your Religion and Practices, except you can prove by the Scriptures, the Words of Christ, or Example of his Saints and Apostles, your Religion, and Lives, and Practices, and Worships? and whether you do admit of tryal in all your whole Religion by, and according to the Scrip∣tures and Writings of the Apostles, yea or nay? 2. Whether the World in your Hearts, and the World's nature, even the root of Lust, the root of Pride, Covetousness, and the love of this World, and its Vanities, and the root of Idolatry is subdued in you? to the Light in your Consciences I do speak: and what is the root of all these things? and what is it that subdues it? Is it an outward abstinence by the force of Locks and Doors, and Bolts, or self-separation, and secret Places, that subdues the World's nature in Men, and Women? and is it by such means that Christ gives Victory over Sin, and overcomes it in his People? or is it not by the Power of God in the Heart onely? and whether is it not damnable Hypo∣crisie in you, to appear outwardly Holy, and free from these things, while yet the Nature and Root of all these things are alive in you, and boyling up in the motions of them? and is any outward thing the Cross of Christ, and Christ crucified, which mortifies to the World, which the Apostles preached and rejoyced in? 3. Whether is it a true denial of the World in you, to deny it in one man∣ner and place, and to run into it, and imbrace it in another way and place? it doth not appear to me, that you have denyed the World, as the Apostles did: For answer me, where had they any such Seats in the finest and fattest Places of the Cities and Towns as ye have; such great fine Houses and Gardens, and such Revenues by the year as ye have, staying all their dayes in a great House, and spending their time in slouth and idleness as ye do? they went up and down the World preaching the Gospel, and had no certain dwelling Place, but fol∣lowed the Lamb of God in the Spirit; and did not settle themselves in fat Pla∣ces of the Earth, continuing all their dayes as ye do: therefore we judge that you are out of the Life, and not in the spirit as the Apostles were in, but are in the Form of Righteousness and Holiness without the Power: So I demand an Answer to clear your selves, if you can, and to prove that you are of the true Church, and that your Wayes and Practices are in, and by the Spirit of God, and according to the Scriptures. 4. What is that Death that hath passed over all, and reigned from Adam to Moses? and whether it doth not reign yet in and over you? and what is Moses's Ministration? and whether ever through it you yet truely came? and whether that part be subdued in you, which the Law of God was added upon? and whether are you come to Christ, and know him as he was before Abraham, and before Mary? and how was he David's Lord? and how his Son? and is Christ within you born, and revealed to you, by whom the World was made? and do you expect to be perfectly freed from Sin, that ye shall not commit Sin in this Life upon Earth, yea, or nay? 5. What is the Soul, and what was its state and condition before Transgressi∣on? and what is its state and condition in Transgression? and whether may man come to be restored by the second Adam into the same estate, while upon Earth, as he lost in the first Adam, yea or nay?
Friends, I demand of you in the Name and Power of the Lord God, to an∣swer me these things in writing some of you, and to subscribe your names, that I may return you an Answer, and query further of you; for we are sent of God to visit you, and to try you; and if you be in the perfect Truth, and would con∣vert others to your Religion, be plain with us, and use your best Spiritual Weapons in your Zeal towards us, and defend your Cause, and appear for your God; and if you doubt of your own Wayes and Practices, and be not able to defend your Religion, then let your Mouthes be stopped, then turn from Ido∣latry; for now is the Lord God risen that will judge ye and all the Earth righ∣teously. I am a lover of Souls, but a Witness against all false Idolatrous Wayes of An∣tichrist, and the Whore, that hath reigned in the World, and I am the Lord's Servant. E. B. By the Scorners of the World called a Quaker. These queries were sent to the Fryars in Latine. ANd we were with them again at other times in discourse with the chief of all the Fryars of the Company called Recolects also, and did in the Power of the Lord declare Truth unto them, and against their Idolatry, until such time as some of them were so offended with us, not having much wherewith to an swer in Truth to defend themselves; they of the Company called Capuchins grew light and scornful, and very wicked, and did in a manner deny us the liberty any more to come unto them: And we were with each Company of Fryars two several times; and as for the Iesuites, we had much upon us to visit them in their Colledges, but we perceived that the chief Rector of the Colledge of Iesu∣is, had heard of our being in the Town; he did refuse to discourse with us, and we went once into the Colledge, and could not be admitted to speak with him: And about a Week after we came into the Town, the chief Governor Lockhart coming home, he sent, as he said, to the Iesuites Colledge, that they should admit us to come to speak with them; and as we found it from the Lord upon us, at a convenient season, we went again to the Colledge, and were for some hours in discourse with the chief Rector of the Colledge who appeared at the first very high, and subtile, and crafty, and did in his heart reject us, and the simplicity of the Gospel; but Truth and the Word of the Lord had do∣minion over him, and before the Truth he and they all are as weak as Water: many things were disputed upon, which the particulars now cannot be related; but in about three hours time he grew weary, pretending other business, and would stay no longer with us, and so we parted, demanding of him whether he would admit some more discourse at some other time, which he did refuse; so we were not admitted to come to him any more: whereupon these following Propositions I was moved to give forth, and send among them as a Charge upon them, in the Name and Power of the Lord, and they were given and delivered in Latine up and down among the Iesuites and Fryars in the Town, unto which to this day I never could receive an Answer: therefore my charge lies upon them to this day as a Testimony from the mouth of the Lord against them, of which they can never clear themselves. And we were moved to visit the Nunns, and went to their Place, and before many words were spoken to them through a Grate (for we might not see them, and to speak to them both at once) they asked If we were of the order of those called Quakers; and they perceiving we were such, said, They might not hear us, because we were such, and presently passed away, and refused to suffer us to speak to them; and therefore we had very small time with them, onely gave our Witness against them, and passed away.
To all ye Iesuits, Priests, and Friars, and to all you in general of the Romish Church, in and about Dunkirk. FRiends, in dear love to all your Immortal Souls, I am moved to lay these things before you, that you may read and consider them in the Fear of the Lord God; for as much as for some dayes I have been in this Town according to the Will of God, and having rightly observed your Religion, in its Ori∣ginal, and in its present standing, and in its practises; and having truely ex∣amined some part of your Faith and Doctrines, and the manner of your Wor∣ships, and your Ordinances, and the Orders, and Discipline, and Government of your whole Church; and in the Spirit of the Lord, having laid all things to the Line of true Judgement, and equally measured them; hereupon I do from the Lord, and by his Spirit, propound and assert these things unto you. First, That your Church is not the true Church of Christ, the Lamb's Wife, and Elected Spouse, but is degenerated in her Faith, and in her Doctrines, and in her Worships and Ordinances, in her Orders, Discipline and Government, from what the true Church of Christ was, in the Apostles dayes, before the Apostacy. 2. That the Constitution of your Church, and the chief part of your Wor∣ship and Ordinances, and the way and manner of your Discipline and Govern∣ment are of Man, and set up and standeth by the will of Man, and are not after God, nor according to him, but are after the Traditions of Man, learned and practised therein, which is Idolatry, and are not in the Commandments of Christ, nor in the Example of his Apostles, non according to the Scriptures, but without the Spirit of God, being set up since the dayes of the Apostles, and since the Apostacy came in, which hath overshadowed the whole World. 3. That there hath been over the World for Generations, and many Ages since the dayes of the Apostles and true Churches, a general declination and falling away from the true Faith and Doctrines, and from the Worship and Ordinances, and from the Discipline and Government, that was amongst the Apostles, and practised in the true Churches of Christ in their dayes, and your Church is in that declination, and falling away. 4. That Antichrist, the Beast, and the Whore, and false Prophets, have reign∣ed over the World for Generations; the Antichrist that hath opposed Christ, and been exalted in the Temple of God, and been worshipped as God; the Beast that hath killed the Saints, and warred against them, and had power over Kindreds and Tongues, and the World hath wondred after him; the Whore whom the Beast hath carried, she hath sate upon Peoples, Multitudes, and Nations, and drunk the Blood of the Saints, and of the Martyrs, and she hath corrupted the Earth, and caused all to drink her Cup of Fornications: And the false Prophets have overspred the Nations, and deceived them; and you and your Church are the Peoples, the Multitudes, and the Kindreds that the Beast hath received Power over, and the Whore hath sate upon, and the false Prophets deceived. 5. That the true Church of Christ, the Lamb's Wife, the elected Spouse, and the beloved City, who brought forth him that was to rule the Nations, hath been fled into the Wilderness, and been fled into the Place of Mourning and Desolation, for a thousand two hundred and sixty dayes; and the Gentiles Feet have troden down the holy City, the Lamb's Wife, and had power over her for forty and two moneths; and though she hath not been prevailed against, nor overcome, so as to be extinguished from having a Being, yet her Being hath been in the Wilderness, in Mourning and Desolation; and she hath not ap∣peared in the Glory and Excellency which once she had, but hath lost her Gar∣ments
and her Attire, and her Heir and Husband separated from her, and caught up to God, and to his Throne: and in this time of the Desolation, and treading down of the holy City, the Lamb's Wife, and the reigning of the Beast and the Whore, hath your Church been extant in her glory and power, which hath been of the false Woman, and not of the Elect Spouse, that is married to the Lamb. 6. That forcing and compelling of Persons by any outward Law and Au∣thority to be of such or such a Religion, and to conform to such a Way of Worship, is the Worship of the Beast, and of the Whore, and not the Worship of God; and to kill and persecute Persons for the exercise of Conscience, and because they will not be of such a Religion, and cannot conform to such Wor∣ship, is of the Devil and the Dragon, and not of God, nor according to him; and that your Church herein is not Successor of the Apostles, and the true Church of Christ; but is of the Beast and the Whore, which Iohn saw was to come in his time, and which we see are come in our dayes, and have ruled for Gene∣rations; and I affirm, that Persons so made conformable, by force and violent Laws, to such a Religion and Worship are but two-fold more the Children of the Devil, and are not at all converted to God thereby, but becomes Idolaters, whom God will judge. 7. That none upon Earth are true Members of the true Church of Christ, having a portion in the Inheritance of Eternal Life, but such who are gathered out of the World by the preaching of the Gospel, and are changed and renewed by the Power of the Lord God in the Heart, and are led by his Spirit within them into all Truth, and are joyned unto Christ the Head, and gathered into the Eternal Unity of the Infinite Body, by the same Spirit and Aointing dwelling in them; and of such onely doth the true Church of Christ consist now in this present time, as it did in the Apostles dayes: but of such Members doth not your Church consist in this present Age, neither is it in the Order and Govern∣ment of the Spirit of Truth, but in the Form without the Power, therein was its beginning, and its standing at this day. 8. That the time is at hand, and the Day of the Lord draws near, and the fuless of time is approaching, wherein great Babylon shall be thrown down, and fall to the Ground, and the Lord will be avenged on her, and will render Judgents unto her; and the Beast, and Whore, and false Prophets, unto whom the Kingdoms of the World have been subject, shall be taken, and cast alive into the Lake, and the Devil and Satan shall deceive the Nations no more; but the Kingdoms of this World shall be changed, and become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ, whose Kingdom shall be revealed in Power and great Glory, in the hearts of his Chosen: And the Church of Rome, and all the false Sects and Churches upon the Earth, will the Lord God overthrow, and his true Church shall be gathered out of the Wilderness; and the Beauty of new Ierusalem, of the holy Church, the Lamb's Wife, shall be as Glorious, a before she fled thither, and before she was troden down of the Gentiles; and the Lord God Almighty shall be known, and his Tabernacle shall be with men. These things I assert to you in the Name of the Lord, and the truth thereof is certain, and should be ready to argue and dispute these things with any sober Person amongst you, upon equal tearms, and to prove the Infalibility hereof, by the Spirit of the Lord, and according to the Scriptures; wherefore consider of them in Patience and Meekness, and believe in the Light of Christ, which is in your Consciences, which Christ hath lightened every man that cometh into the World withall, that you may come to the knowledge of the Truth, and out of all false Wayes: and if any of you will return an Answer hereunto, in behalf of your whole Body, and can be able to clear your selves in Writing from what is charged upon you, it shall be gladly received by me, and a Reply i Meekness returned to you for the further mnifestation of Truth, that Truth
and Righteousness may clearly appear, and be embraced, and all Deceit and and false wayes of Antichrist may be confounded, and denyed; and who are in the Truth shall be confirmed, and who are in the Error may have Warning now in the Day of the World's Visitation. The Lord is coming to Judgment, who will judge the Secrets of all Hearts, and the whole World in Equity. Dunkirk, the 20th of the 3d Moneth, 1659. By a Friend unto Righteousness, and a Lover of all Souls, E. B. These Propositions were sent to them in Latine. This was sent to the chief Rector of the Jesuits Colledge in Dunkirk, in Latine. FRiend, thy wisdom and thy knowledge is earthly and sensual, and thereby canst thou not know the Things of the Kingdom of God; thou canst nei∣ther learn them thy self, nor teach them to others; for thou art but a blind Leader of the Blind: And thus saith the Lord God unto thee, The Fruitless Tree is standing in thee, that brings forth no Fruit unto God; and the Head of the Serpent is not broken in thee, that deceives the Soul; nor the Body of Sin put off, that burdens the Just: and the Sword shall cut thee to pieces, even the Sword of the Lord, it shall slay thee. And Friend, The time is at hand that the Lord will make thee know, that thou art, and hast been in thy Life time, a Dishonour to him; and that thou hast not served him, but thy self, and the Devil; and thy Heart is not right in his sight, but is corrupt and deceitful; for thou art tryed and measured, and thou art found wanting in all things: and God will judge thee, and the Witness in thy Conscience shall answer his Judgments; and all thy Idolatrous Practices, and Profession of Religion, and Church, and Mi∣nistry, thy many Prayers, and thy Works of Righteousness, all this shall not hide thee from the Wrath of the Lamb; though now thou art hardened, nd ut∣terly unsensible, yet the Stone shall fall upon thee, that will grind thee to Pow∣der, and thou shalt not escape, but the burden of thy own Iniquities shall weigh thee down into Perdition, except thou speedily repentest: Therefore fear and tremble before the Lord God, and remember thou art warned by one that seeks the Peace of Souls; but makes War by the Sword of the Spirit against the King∣dom of the Devil and Antichrist, in whomsoever it stands. And Friend, answer me this one Query; What is that Whore that hath sate upon Multitudes and Peoples? and what is that Golden Cup in her Hand? and what are the Abominations and Fornication, of which her Cup is full, which she hath caused the Kings and People to drink, and with which she hath deceived the World? Answer me this, and subscribe thy Name. E. B.
ANd now this I have to say concerning the Church of Rome, to them, and to all the World, as having been in a measure an eye and an ear Witness of their Idolatrous and false Wayes, Practices, and Doctrines; never having in all my dayes, till this time, and at this opertunity of going to Dunkirk, not having any knowledge outwardly what their Wayes and Practices were; not having any knowledge I say by my sight, and particular hearing con∣cerning them, without me, otherwise then what the Spirit of the Lord within me did make manifest: Though from a Child the Spirit of the Lord in me, hath abhorred Popery, and all that which savours of it: But now having been an eye and ear Witness in a little measure of their Practices and Doctrines, this I have to say to them, and all men; Blindness and Ignorance covers them as with a Mantle, and they are wrapped up in the body of Darkness, and gross Darkness they do dwell in; and all their Wayes, and Worships, are but the Works of Darkness, which they are led on in by the false feigned spirit of Imagination, from one Generation to another, being exercised therein: And the sense of the Spirit of Life they have not, but have wholly lost it; and they know nothing at all of the Leading of it, nor of its Teaching: This they hiss at as a thing of nought when it is spoken of to them. They have even sold them∣selves into the Land of Ignorance and Blindness, and they hate to be reformed; they are settled upon a false Foundation, even the Traditions of men, which the Lord will break down, and their whole Building will fall. And when I consider how thousands, and ten thousands lie in the Captivity of Blindness and Darkness under them, my Heart is rent for them, upon the consideration how they are led in Darkness and Blindness, and how they rest in a false confidence, which will destroy their Souls, and the Blood of many rests upon the heads of them that leadeth them; for they that lead them, cause them to err: and the Blood of Souls will be required at their hands: And as for the Poor and com∣mon Sort of them, there is a pity in me for them; because they are led by the Blind, and are out of the Way: but as for the Priests and Iesuites, and Clergy men, they are to be cut off with the edge of the Sword of the Lord God, and the Wo is unto them, and no Pitty; because they cause the People to err, and keep the People in Ignorance and Blindness, under their false and unrigh∣teous Wayes and Worships. And this I know, The Word of the Lord is gone forth against the whole Body of the Romish-Church, from the Head to the Tail of them, will God plead with them; the time is at hand, and his Eye shall not pitty, neither shall his Hand spare to punish them: The Decree of the Lord is sealed, and he will take Vengeance upon their Unrighteous Laws, which binds the Consciences of People, and limits the Spirit of the holy One; their Un∣righteous Ecclesiastical Laws I mean, under which is defended all manner of Ido∣latry, and they compel people to be Idolaters by a Law, and whereby they drink the Blood of the Saints, and of the Martyrs: But the Lord will take Vengeance upon them, and disanul their Covenants and Decrees; and his Spi∣rit shall not be limitted, but shall rend them to pieces, even their Laws and Cru∣elties, and Inquisitions, by which they are defended, and their Religion up∣held in the World, and whereby they kill the Just, and murder the Innocent, that are better then they; for the fulness of time is come, and all these shall be tumbled down; for their unjust Laws, and Inquisitions, are the main strength and Pillars of their Church, whereby their Church and Worship doth stand: and if they had not these cruel Laws and Inquisitions to defend themselves by in their Religion, they would be soon prevailed against; for they have no∣thing of the Spirit and Authority of God, to stand in, nor to fight with, against such as do oppose them; but their Weapons are Carnal, and Devilish, and by Murders, Oppressions, and Tyrannies they do defend themselves; and when these things are broken down, then their Church cannot stand long. And
as sure as the Lord lives, so shall it come to pass, a Generation shall accomplish it, and in the Generation of the Righteous Seed it shall be finished; their Laws shall be broken down, and Murders avenged, and their weakness shall then appear, and their Whoredoms and Idolatries, and all their Abominations shall be made naked, and uncovered, and judged by the Lamb, and them that follow him, whom he will gather to fight his Battel. And if the People were but sensible hereof, as in measure I am, through the Zeal of the Lord, it would raise up the Spirit of zeal in them all, to seek vengeance, and the overthrow of all their unrighteous Laws, and Inquisitions, and Murders, which keeps people in Darkness and Ignorance, and kills the Just, that the Creatures may be saved, and Tyranny condemned: And when once the Lord doth but reach forth his Arm, then shall People be awakened to mind what I now say. Who would spare their own lives for the accomplishing of such a Work, that the Spirit of the Lord may have liberty, and that which limits it may be dashed to pieces; and that the Earth may be set at liberty, and all Europe made free from the Cruelties and Tyrannies of Antichrist and of the Whore? And to all you Papists I say, and to all the Body of the Church of Rome, prepare pre∣pare; for the Lord God is coming up against you in his dreadful Power, his Word of eternal Judgemnt is gone forth, and his Vials are full of Wrath to be poured forth; and he will be avenged upon your Tyrannies and Mur∣ders, and unequal Laws, and subdue them before him: And his Dread shall fall upon your Consciences; ye that are Idolaters, Hypocrites, Ignorant wretches, wilful Persons and Bond-slaves of Satan, the Plagues of God, and the Wrath of the Lamb shall reach unto your high Throne; Repent, repent, for the Lord's Wrath is kindled against you; and if there be any among you, that feareth the Lord, let him deliver his own Soul, by turning from your Abominations, least the Lord come upon you and destroy you altogether: Give up your Inquisitions, give up your unjust Laws, and cease to murther the Innocent, and torment the Righteous. I demand this of you on the Lord's behalf, Vex not the Lord any longer; for his Patience is turned into Anger against you, and his Long-suffering will become Fury to devour you. And no little service we had in Dunkirk among our English Army; divers Meetings we had in the Town, and declared the Message of Salvation: And I must commend the spirit of our English men for moderation, more then the men of any other Nation, and I did many times clear my Conscience among them, both as they were men, Sons of Adam, and in relation to an eter∣nal State did direct them to the Way of Happiness, out of Sin and Wicked∣ness, that they might come to God, preaching the everlasting Gospel; that as they were Sons of Adam in Transgression, they might come to be healed, and come into Christ the Power and Wisdom of God, and might be saved. Again, as they were Soldiers, and as they were an Army, I was moved to speak much unto them, that they might know what their service was there in that state; sometime saying unto them, It was possible the Lord might have some good work to do by them, if they were faithful and not seek themselves, but the Glory of the Lord. And at one time being sent for by Governor Lockhart, where there were many Officers with him, and we had much discourse with them; and this lay upon me to declare in the Name of the Lord unto them; that if they did enterprize any business, as they were an Army, in a spirit in opposition unto us, and in that spirit that did reject us, and deny us, and gain-say us; then should they ne∣ver prosper in any enterprize whatsoever: but if they went on in any degree in the Fear of the Lord, and in that Spirit that was among us, then should they overcome their Enemies, and none should have power over them, nor over∣come them. And after I was parted from them, this following Paper was upon me to write unto the whole Army in general, both to Officers and Soldiers.
To the English Army, to Officers and Souldiers. Friends, I Am moved to clear my Conscience unto you, in the sight of the Lord, to warn you, that you may all learn Wisdom, and the Fear of the Lord God, and may stand in his Counsel alwayes; for that will be a defence unto you at all times, and therein will you prosper in the Lord's Work, and chiefly unto you, the small remnant of our English Army in and about Dunkirk; I say unto you Officers and Souldiers, Fear the Lord God, and walk in his Wisdom; and every particular Person amongst you, inquire of the Lord, hat he requires of you; inquire of the Lord I say, and know his Will, and be obedient unto it in all things, and so shall you prosper in standing in God's Counsel, and in performing his Will: and so shall you be exalted, and have victory over your Enemies, even as you seek the Honour of the Lord, and his Glory; for if you honour him, and do that which is acceptable to him, he will honour you, and set you atop of all your Enemies, and he will make way through the Moun∣tains, even by you, for the further appearance of his Glory; and he will honour you as his Work-men, if you be faithful to him, and walk in his Counsel and Wisdom, till he hath prepared his own way by you; for assuredly it is not in vain, but the Lord had some end in it, to himself, in bringing you to that Place; and what do you know but he may have some good Work for you to do: It is possible there is more in his Heart, and in his Purpose concerning you then yet may be discovered to you: wherefore it is good for you, that you wait upon the Lord, to know his Will fully concerning you, that you may do it, and fulfill it; and therein shall be your Crown, but on the contrary dependeth your misery and destruction. And this I do know, That the Lord hath owned and honoured our English Army, and done good things for them and by them in these Nations in our Age; and the Lord once armed them with the spirit of courage and zeal against many Abomina∣tions, and he was with them in many things he called them to, and gave them Victory and Dominion over much Injustice and Oppression, and cruel Laws▪ and he was with them, till that a spirit of vain Glory and Ambition, and Self seeing, and the Honour of this World entered into some and defiled the whole Body, and made it deformed, and void of its former beauty, and of its valour and nobleness also, at which the Anger of the Lord was kindled, and against you also was his Hand turned, with the loss of his Presence, because the sincerity and the faithful Principle was almost choaked, and the Good eaten out from amongst you, by the false spirit of Self-seeking and Vain Glory, which was entered into the Hearts of many; but this is to the Army in general, and to say no more of it to you, onely that you might search your own hearts, and may be purged, and may again return to the old spirit of Righteousness, which will reach after the liberty of the people, and the freedom of the Nations, and that all Oppression may be broken down to the dust before you, and be subdued by you as your Prey: and that there be no more a looking back by you for rest and ease in the flesh, in great Houses of residence, till you have visited Rome, and inquired after, and sought out the Innocent Blood that is buried therein, and avenge the Blood of the Guilt∣less through all the Dominions of the Pope; the Blood of the Just it cryes through Italy and Spain, and the time is come, that the Lord will search it, and seek it out, and repay it; and it would be your honour to be made use of by the Lord, in any degree in order to this matter, whether the Lord will revenge the grievous blood-guiltiness that lies upon them, by himself without an Instrument, or whe∣ther by you or others as an Instrument; whether this way or another that God will do it, this I determine not; but this I do know, The time is not long, that he will one way or another avenge, and revenge, the Blood of the Just upon the murderous Head: and this I also believe, that the Lord will do it, or make way hereunto even by you, the men of our English Nation, if you be faith∣ful to him, and do what he requires of you; for what are these few poor
Islands, that you have run through, and laid many Mountains low; they are but little in comparison of the great part of Christendom in which Ido∣latry, and grievous Oppressions do abound, which the Hand of the Lord is against, and which he will take Vengeance upon: Oh did you but see and per∣fectly know, the Cruelties, the Oppressions, the Idolatries, the Murders, and all whatsoever that is Evil, both in Civil and Ecclesiastical State, that is brought forth, and rules in full Power in all the Pope's Dominions; I do say, Were you but fully acquainted with all these things, and also of the purpose of the Lord, which is speedily to visit them with his Rod, it would awaken you, and stir you up; and it would set your spirits on fire of a great Zeal, with Desires of no greater Honour, then to be Instruments in any degree towards the execu∣ting of so good a Work; even towards the relieving of the Oppressed, and breaking the Bnds of Cruelty, that the Nations may come to Rest, and may no more be captivated with the Chains of Antichrist; I do say, it would be your greatest Honour to be Instruments in such a Work: and do you know what the Lord's Purpose is concerning you? onely this I do know, The Lord hath a love to the men of our Nation, and there is a spirit in them most fitting for such a work; even the Zeal of the Lord hath appeared, and is beginning to appear against Babylon, and against Rome, the Seat of the Whore; and the Kingdom of Antichrist shall be thrown down, and the Righteous People shall go free, and Nations shall worship the Lord; but there are many Mountains in the way; wherefore hew down the Tops, strike at the Branches, make way, that the Ax may be laid to the Root of the Tree, that your Sword, and the Sword of the Lord, may neither leave Root nor Branch of Idolatry, Oppressions and Tyranny, which the Nations are held in slavery under, and oppressed withal, to the grieving of the Righteous Soul, and vexing of the Spirit of the Lord. Oh, how great is their Idolatries! you see a little part thereof amongst you; oh, what false, feigned, deceitful and hypocritical Services do they practice; their Images, their Pictures, and their praying before them, which is Idolatry; their Candles burning, and their Organs, and Instruments of Musick, and feigned singing; all this is Idolatry and Superstition, and a vexation to the Lord; and that Law which imposeth them upon people contrary to a good Conscience, and that Law which condemns others as Hereticks that will not worship thus, and that Power that kills and destroyes those that act against those Worships, Laws, and Powers, ought ye to make war against, and to claim a disanulling of all such Laws and Authorities by which this Idolatry is imposed upon Peoples Consciences, and established in the Nations, and by which many are destroyed and condemned, who cannot bow to their Idolatries, such Laws are not to stand before you; for these be the Bryars and Thorns which cover the great Mountains, whom the Whore sitteth upon, which the Lord will judge; did you but know all their Unrighte∣ous Laws, Murders, and all Cruelties which are abounding among them, and they have a despensation to commit Unrighteousness; those Laws ought to be judged and destroyed, and your Sword is to be lifted up against them: It is the Lord's Work, I know, to make men truely religious; but yet the Lord may work by you, to break down the Bryars and Thorns, and Rocks and Hills, that have set themselves against the Lord, and which keep People under the Chains of Idolatry, so that they commit Idolatry, and are compelled to it, and defend∣ed in it, even by a Law: but the Lord will confound all this, either by means, or without means; for such is their Oppression in their Ecclesiastical State, and their Unjust Laws whereby their Church is established and defended, that it causeth the very Earth to mourn, and the Spirits of the Righte∣ous to faint, and their Hearts to fail because of Oppression; to Murder, and Steal, and Rob, and to commit Adultery, these are counted little Sins amongst them, they are even tolerated, and pardoned by the Pope, for a lit∣tle Money; and if they slay a Man, and wilfully murder him, they can run to their Altar, there they can have a Dispensation of a wicked Par∣don; and here is a Law that tolerates Murder, and the greatest Sins; where∣whereby
it is hard for any that fears God for to be amongst them; and Blood, blood lies upon their whole Dominions, and the Guilty go free, and uncon∣demned, and the Innocent suffer unjustly; for if any diminish from about their Mass-houses to the value of a Peny, that is death by their Law; while Murder is tolerated; and here is nought but Tyranny and Oppression abounding, even great Mountains, which must be thrown down, and for which the Sword of the Lord must come upon them; and God will make their Riches, and their falsely consecrated Vessels and Treasures, even a spoil, and a prey unto you, if you be faithful unto the Lord; wherefore all you Officers, fear the Lord God, and be not ambitious, nor vain-glorious, nor seek not your selves to gain unto your selves Kingdoms, to exalt your own Horn; for if you go in this way, and if this be your end; then your end shall be frustrated, and you shall not prosper; for the Lord will lay you aside with shame unto you: but let it be your work and your aim to require and demand the disnulling of their Inquisitions and cruel Laws, both in their Church and civil State; and that Christ alone may exercise the Peoples Consciences, neither be ye as Lords nor Tyrants over your poor Soldiers, but be ye loving and meek towards them; I say unto you Officers, and to all you that bear rule in the Army, Be loving and kind, and gentle unto all under your Authority, and be not as Tyrants nor Oppressors over your poor Soldiers, but be Examples of all goodness unto them, and give them no evil Example in your lives and conversations; but lead them in the Fear of the Lord, and know a measure of his Wisdom in you, whereby you may walk before them, and they may possess their freedoms in their Conditions; and may not be as Slaves to you, but as Servants to the Lord in their places: and herein shall you be blessed, as you fulfill that which the Lord requires. And likewise unto all the Soldiers I say, That ye may be sober and moderate, and faithful to the Lord, and not go in the Excess and Superfluity of this Creation; but may be all kept low in your Hearts, and tender towards God: and obey them that have power over you in all things which are just, and be not deboist nor given to Vanity; but all of you both Officers and Sol∣diers, live in that which keeps your Consciences void of offence, and that you may be clear and free in your own spirits from the Abominations of the Nati∣ons, and then you will be a Terror to the Evil in all People wheresoever you come; and being clear and free in the sight of the Lord, having no sin lying upon your Consciences, then shall you face your Enemies with courage, and not fear death; but shall be ready to lay down your lives for a Testimony of Jesus in a good Cause, and upon good Engagements: and if the Lord be your Fear, then no man can make you afraid, but you will be in that which over∣cometh the Unrighteous Power within you, and without you also; and here is the true honour, and in this it doth consist, in victory over all that which is con∣trary to God; and here is the true Way to Happiness and Prosperity in this Life, and in the Life to come, by seeking his Glory, and not your own: and all of you come to the Light of Christ, that Christ hath lighted you withall, and that will teach you all things what you ought to do, and what you ought not to do; for that Light of Christ within you, ought to be the Guide of all the Children of Men, in every State, Place, and Condition; and upon this you are to wait for Counsel to receive it from the Lord, by that of him made mani∣fest within you: and as for all your outward Teachers, that have used their Tongues amongst you, and said, The Lord saith it, when God hath not spoken to them, nor sent them; and that preach for Hire and Sums of Money, and these are them that cannot profit the People, nor ever bring you to the Knowledge of God, nor give you Counsel from the Lord; and if you seek to uphold them, and defend them against the Power of the Lord, and his Word which is gone forth against them, then shall you not prosper, but fall with them; and if you do enterprize any work in that spirit that doth oppose the Spirit of Christ Iesus in his people, you can ne∣ver have good success, but the Lord will confound you before your Enemies.
And so now that you may all come into the New Covenant, to be taught of the Lord, and to be far from all Oppression, this is the thing that you are all to wait for; and to know the Power of the Lord, and to go on in that against Unrigh∣teous Men, and Unrighteous Laws, which are set up in the Nations, that they may be destroyed, and brought under; and yet though such a Victory would be honourable unto you, yet there is a Victory more Honourable, to wit, The Victory over Sin, and Death, and the Devil in your selves, and that you are to mind; and there is a Kingdom which is not of this World, which cannot be ob∣tained by an Outward Sword, and this Kingdom are you to wait for, that you may know it, and feel it in your own particulars: and this is the Doctrine of the Gospel of Peace unto you, and the Glad-tidings held forth unto all of you; come into the Power of the Lord, and mind it, that you may be lead by it, and then may you be fit Instruments for the Lord to work by: And take heed how you op∣pose those whom the Lord hath sent, and is sending abroad in the Nations, to pro∣claim the Mighty Day of the Lord; they are no Enemies to you, nor to any mans Person, and therefore be tender over them; for they go about the Lord's Work; of this I warn you all in the Presence of the Lord. And so you dwelling in the Power of the Lord, there is nothing shall destroy you, nor confound you, but you shall have Victory over all your Enemies within you, and without you, and the Lord will make you a Dread and a Fear to the Nations. And so this is a Warn∣ing unto you all, both Officers and Souldiers, that you may mind what the Work of the Lord God is in the Nations: Your Work hath been, and may be honourable in its Day and Season; but he hath a Work more honourable to work after you; that is, To destroy the Kingdom of the Devil, and the ground of Wars: And your Victory hath been of the Lord; but there is a more honourable Victo∣ry to be waited for, even the Victory over Sin: and so we are the Friends of the Creation, that do preach this Victory, and this Kingdom, and Peace, which is Endless and Everlasting, and which many are come into, And as for the many and divers sorts of Worship, which are come up since the dayes of the Apostles, and are of the Whore, and not of the true Church; they are all to be thrown down, and the Worship that is in Spirit and Truth to be set up by the Lord, and he is gathering people into that Worship; but if you be out of the Fear of God, in the Rudeness and Wickedness of the World, and seek your selves, and not the Freedom of the Nations only; then the Lord will lay you aside as a broken Pot-sheard, and raise up unto himself a People, that shall fulfil his work, and do it; for he hath much Work to do in the Nations; for he is gathering his Elect Seed, and changing the Kingdoms of the World, and making them become the Kingdoms of Christ: and so be low in your own eyes, and do not seek your selves, but seek one anothers Good, and seek the Glory of the Lord, and the Freedom of the Oppressed; and in that you will be blessed, and prosper, till you have set up your Standard at the Gates of Rome. I am a Lover of all your souls, and a Sufferer in Patience under the Cruelties of men, E. B. And some small Discourse we had with our English Priests, that supply the Place of Chaplins to the Army; and in particular one of them, which had spoken something behind our backs against us; and we proffer'd to have some discourse with him, but he refused it (only to evade the matter at that present) he bid us state some of our Principles in writing, and he would answer them in dispute in some publick place: and being he was not willing to engage to dispute otherwise, we were free to write this following Paper; but we had no answer in agreement to dispute with us, but shifted the thing from himself, by telling us, The Governour was  willing. But this was not the same Priest before mention'd, that we had discourse with at our first coming into the Town.
Friend, FOr the manifestation of Truth, and that the perfect difference between thee, and us, may be known; and who are in the Truth, and who in the Error; and that Truth from Error may be clearly discerned: therefore according to thy own Proposals, and expressed De∣sires thereof before many, we do here assert some Particulars of that Truth which we have receed from God, and do hold forth and maintain in the World, in opposition to thee, or any other, that shall gainsay them, viz. 1. That Christ hath lightened all men with a Light, sufficient in it self to bring them to Salvation, if they follow it. 2. That God hath given Christ to be the Saviour of all men. 3. That none are justified by Christ and his Righteousness without them, but as they have receiv'd Christ and his Righteousness, and witness them reveal'd in themselves. 4. That the Saints of God may be perfectly freed from Sin in this life, so as no more to commit it. 5. That the National Ministers and Churches, not only of Papists, but of the Protestts also (as they now stand) are not the true Ministers and Churches of Christ. 6. That the Scriptures are a true Declaration, given forth from the Spirit of God, by holy Men of God, moved by it to write them; and are profitable; but are not the Foundation, nor the most perfect Rule of Faith and Life to the Saints. These things we are freely willing and desirous to discourse upon, with thy self, and any others, that shall joyn with thee, in the presence of sober and wise men, who may judge between us, in any publick Place, that may be procured by thee, according to thy Engagements in this Particular; provided it may be in the Spirit of Meekness and Moderation, and that all fair and sober Dealing may be amongst us, and the Fear of God. And to this we expect thy speedy Answer; concerning Time and Place. Edward Burroughs, Samuel Fisher. The Propositions were writ as short as could be, for to stop all Advantages against us, that right be taken by our Adversary, in case he had met us, and agreed to dispute; but upon enlargement in Discourse we might have laid open the truth of every on of these Particulars at large, to the satisfaction of sober Minds, that might have been doubt∣ful hereof, and sewed by the Scriptures the truth of all of them.
AN Epistle to Friends IN LONDON. Dearly beloved Friends and Brethren, WHom the Lord hath called with his Heavenly Call, and made you Eye-Witnesses, and Feeling-Witnesses of his Power, and of his Truth, my dear Love in the Lord falutes you all, for the Lord's sake, without respect of Persons; and I Greet you with a holy Kiss. Dearly Beloved, I bare you witness, That some of you have loved the Lord above all things, and for his Truth the Glory of this World, with its Vanities, have been denyed by you; and now I wish in the Lord, the abounding and en∣larging of the Love and Life of God in you, and amongst you all. And my Dear Friends, In that the Lord hath blessed you in the Know∣ledge of the Truth, and of his Wayes, and called you to serve him, and to live unto him, and not unto your selves; now this remains unto you all to be done by you, even that you be Faithful and Careful in the Great Work of the Lord, which he is doing amongst you, and in the World at this day: And first of all, See that every one of you stand in God's Coun∣sel, and that ye do his Will in all things, as the Lord maketh it mani∣fest to you; and watch over your own Hearts, and keep your selves clear from the Evil of this World. I am moved of the Lord to write to you in particular, and to warn you in his Name, who hath begotten you to him∣self, That you be mighty careful and circumspect in all your wayes, and that you walk as Patterns and Examples to all the tender Babes of God in the Flock; and that by your wise Conversation, and Faithfulness in the Truth, the Weak may be strengthened, and the Hungry may be filled, and they that are of the World, who thirst for the Lord, may be won into the Truth. My God knoweth, and ye know also, the Care and Burdens which I have had in that Place; and seeing I am thus ordered of the Lord at this present, I do beseech you all, for the Truth's sake, That you, unto whom God hath given Grace, and Strength, and Wisdom, and Knowledge, that you take the Care upon you to watch with the Flock, and over them that are Weak. And I say again, You must be mighty careful in the Lord, that you may walk in all things to his Glory; so as there be no turnings back from the Truth by any, nor no occasion given to the Heathen to Reproach Truth; therefore not any Service of your own must you equal with the Lord's Service: But at all times be armed with the Lords Armour, to do and to suffer for the Truth. And this seems Good unto me in the Fear of the Lord, That you in par∣ticular do keep a Meeting among your selves, once in Three Weeks, or a
Moneths time, as ye see meet; that in the Counsel of God you may consi∣der of all things in relation to the Truth; and that you may advise one with another in the Fear of the Lord, of things amongst you; that in good Order all things may be kept: And if any Disorderly Persons, who profess the Truth, be known to any of you, let it be presented to all; and Two or Three of you, as you are moved, may in the Fear of the Lord, and in his Wisdom, reprove such Persons and Things, by which in the least Truth is Dishonoured; and if such resist Reproof, then account them as out of the Body, and the Life can have no Fellowship with such; but first reprove Offences and Failings in Secret, and in much Wisdom also, lest you destroy the Righteous with the Wicked. And I lay it up∣on you, that you judge nothing but what is for Judgment; and when any thing comes before you, to be tryed, or judged of, be tender of the Simplicity; and take heed of Rash Judgment, and Forward Words; be mighty considerate in the Fear of God, that nothing be judged wholly, in which there is any thing of God; but dwell in that which doth discern, and distinguish, and separate the Precious from the Vile, that you may di∣vide Judgment a right in all Causes; and the Pure may be Strengthened, and the Deceit Confounded: For such a thing may be, and come to pass, which cannot wholly be Justified, nor altogether Condemned; and in such things, in Friends, you had need be mighty careful, that the Right Way may be spared, and the Wicked cut off. And if any of you be moved to Minister among the Flock, let it be done in the Fear of God, and in his Wisdom, to the refreshing of the Weak, and to the building up the Body; and if you do it in the Pow∣er of God, then you will be answered by the Witness of his Spirit in every one; and you, and they will feel an Increase from God. And if any Minister amongst you, with which the Spirit of the Lord hath not. Fellowship, but is an Offence to the Just, bare such in Patience for a sea∣son, and shew them in Meekness and Love their Fault, that they may be resto∣ed, rather then cast out. And if any amongst you be over-taken with a Fault, and found faulty in the sight of the Lord in any Particular; reprove, and convert, and instruct such privately in Meekness; and if they rebel and resist, then reprove them, and let them be judged openly: And charge all, that in all things they keep to their own Measures of Christ, and that they act no∣thing, nor speak nothing without the Leading of his Spirit; and that will bind under deceitful spirits. And as for those Rebellious, and Treache∣rous, and Deceitful Lying spirits amongst you, which may trouble you, as they have formerly done, to the great Dishonour of the Lord; I wish they were cut off, as for the Truth's sake, yet I exhort you to bear them with Patience, and not to heed them, nor be troubled at them; but account of them as Disor∣derly, and out of the Body: and fre not in your selves, because of the Wicked; such things be but for a time, but Truth is forever, and they that walk therein, their Fruits shall never wither. And let Friends keep their private Meetings on the First-days with Dili∣gence, and none to run abroad without Foar, but as they are moved of the Lord, and then there will be a Service in it for the Lord: and as any of you are moved, be faithful to exhort Friends hereunto; and with a single Eye be watchful, that all things in good Order may be kept amongst you, that the Name of the Lord may be a Renown, and his Truth kept without Ble∣mish, and your Authority in the Truth may be known a Terror upon the Wicked. My dear Friends, whom I judge to be Honest and Faithful, this was I moved to write to you, as the dear Remembrance of my dear Love; and I do from the Lord commit it to you, to fulfil the will of God in these things; and the Lord
bless you all with Wisdom and Counsel, and with Power and Strength; and the Lord give you Authority, that you may reign with all them that come amongst you in the Name of the Lord, and over all them that come in their own name: The Lord bless you with a perfect Understanding in these things; and my Spirit, even the Spirit of the Father, be upon you all, to teach you perfectly in all things: My Love and Life is amongst you; who desires no∣thing more then the Prosperity of the Lord's Truth amongst you. The Grace of God be with you all, Amen. This is to be read amongst you, when you are met together whom the Lord hath set to order things in his Wisdom, and this is to all the Faithful amongst you. Kingstone, 1659. E. B. To the Churches in New-England, Barbadoes, and other Islands. TO the Seed of God, and to all that are called of him, and unto all you that are hungering and thirsting after the Lord in Truth and Righteousness, in New-England, Barbadoes, Mevis, and the rest of the Islands, where the Lord hath a People to gather; the Father's Love through me doth slaute you all, whose Faces are set towards Sion; abundantly desiring for you, in the Spirit of the Father, that Grace, Mercy and Truth from God may richly abound amongst you, and in all your Hearts, that at his com∣ing, who hath given to every one of you a Measure of his Treasure, he may receive his own from you with encrease, that you also may enter into the Reward, which is Eternal Life unto all that are called, and are found faithful. Wherefore arise, and awake, all ye that have been scattered and strayed from the Lord; and come forth thou oppressed Seed of Israel, out of the Darkness, and Bondage and Oppression, with which thou hast been loaded for many Ages, whilst a long Night of Darkness and Blindness hath been over thee: I say, Awake, and come forth; for now thy Light is risen, and the Glory of the Father shall rest upon thee, and thy Bonds shall be broken, and thy Oppression shall cease; for thy King shall Reign in Righteousness over all his Enemies, and they shall become his Foot-stool, and his Do∣minion shall be enlarged to the utmost parts of the Earth. Dearly Beloved, be assured of this, That the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is doing great things; his Day-spring from on High hath visited us, and his Light hath shined into our Tabernacle; and his Arm hath taken hold of Strength, to Redeem the Oppressed People; and he hath reached forth to us from his holy Habitation, out of his Everlasting Loving-kindness, and hath cau∣sed us to reach forth to others from his own Life revealed in us, that they may know what God hath done for his People, and may also receive of the same Sal∣vation, and may taste, handle and feel of the Life which is manifest, of which we are Witnesses; and the Lord hath spoken, who can but declare? and he hath lifted up his Standard to gather the Nations, that he may search and seek out his Sheep; and this I declare unto you, and withal, am willing to
discover and make manifest, the Way and Means whereby, the Lord doth bring vation to his People; and love constrains me knowing the Lord hath a Seed amongst you, unto which my Testimony will be acceptable: wherefore all peo∣ple turn ye, turn ye; for the Lord calleth unto you, harken unto his Testimony which speaketh in you, even the Light of Chri Jesus, with which every one of  are enlightened; and search your Hearts, and feel what the Lord wit∣nesseth unto you, and what his Testimony in you giveth evidence of; for who walks in Pride, in Wickedness, in Vanity, and in the Pleasures of the World, and acteth against God's Witness in their Consciences, such are in a State to be condemned of the Lord; because they act that, and speak that which is re∣proved with the Light, shewing that they are in a State unreconciled to God, their Works shewing them to be evil Trees that cumber the Ground, who are to be hewen down, and cast into the Fire: and therefore be not deceived in your selves, neither let any man deceive you with a Profession, or Conceit of a Justification by Christ, while yet Iniquity and Transgression, and the Evil of the World are lived in, and not wholly denyed; for to the Wicked there is no Peace from God: but the Wicked are condemned by him, and the Light in their own Consciences is witness against them. Therefore all come to the Light, which Christ hath lightened you withal, which will manifest unto you your own Condition, and whether it be justified, or condemned of God; and believe not against the Light, nor hope not against God's Witness; for they that do so, their Faith and Hope is vain; but what the Light testifies in you, that believe. And all you that may find your selves sinners, loaden with Iniquity, and that are the Servants of Sin, and have no power over Temptations, believe in that Light which gives you to see this, and wait till the Power of God be made manifest in you to cleanse your Hearts, and to judge out all Unrighteousness; for Christ hath not taken away your Sins, while you daily bring them forth into the World by Action: but whose sins he hath taken away, them he hath washed and cleansed from their sins, and given them power to resist and overcome all Temptations: wherefore wait upon the Lord all ye that are afflicted because of your sins, the Day of a great Deliver∣ance is approaching; and mind the Light which lets you see Sin, that is the Gift of God's Love unto you, which will draw you from the love of the World, and crucifie your Affections and Desires which go after it; and if you mind the Light of Christ in you, it will judge and condemn every Motion that ariseth in the Heart towards Evil, and the Temptation being judged, you will not fall into Sin, but will be preserved from Sin; and that which doth preserve you from the committing of that Sin, unto which you are tempted, doth blot out and forgive all the Sins that ever you have acted; and that will witnes, Recon∣ciliation and Peace with God unto you, as you come to be changed and renew∣ed in your Hearts and Minds, to be created in the second Adam, his Image to bear, and to follow his Spirit: And Friends, search your Hearts, and let the Lord search you, and judge you; for him must you know to sit as a Refiners Fire, to purifie your Hearts, that you may be fit Temples for him to dwell with, who dwells with Holiness, and the Unclean are cast out from his Presence; and he is come amongst you, to search you, and try you, and to discover his Foun∣dation, and the Wise in their own eyes shall stumble and fall, and be broken; and its the Poor in spirit, and Upright in heart, whom the Lord hath chosen, and with such will he dwell: and now all must come to feel that which breaks down the high nature, which ruled above the Seed of God; the Ax must be laid to the Root of the cursed Tree, which hath brought forth no Fruit to God, but cumbered the Ground; and that Tre must be cut up in every one of you, and cast into the Fire, that the Plant of God's Renown may spring forth, and bring forth Fruit: Now every one must come to know the two Seeds, in which the Election and Reprobation stands, the one with all its Fruit must be ast out, and Judgment from the Lord must pass upon it; for that Seed
hath long been fruitful in the World, and flourished in the Earth, its Fr hath been according to the Flesh, which the Lord is now risen to blast with a Curse; and all your earthly glory must wither, and all your ioy and peace that stands in this Creation must pass away, and all your own wisdom must be confounded; for that receives not the Things of God, but to it they are foolish, ness, it is only the Simple and Poor in Spirit that are taught of God, and it is with the Meek and Humble that he dwells; but who are high in their Minds, and exalted above the Fear of God, who follow their own wayes and thoughts, such have no part in him, but are cast out into Darkness, and Dark∣ness covers them from the Light and Knowledge of the Lord God; they know not him to dwell in them, nor to lead them, nor to guide them, neither doth his Spirit lead such into all Truth: but they rebel against the Motions of the Spirit of God, which checks them, and reproves them for their evil Deeds; but they hate the Light, and love Darkness, and bring forth the Fruits of Darkness, which the Light reproveth for: but because they are disobedient to it, they cannot receive Power over their sins, but Sin hath power over them; and in this State there is no Peace, nor Justification to them, but Trouble and Condemnation from God. Wherefore all ye People that fear God, and love his Wayes, be obedient to the Light, which Christ hath lightened you withal, which calls you out of Transgression, and reproves you when you act against it; and this is the Measure of the Spirit of God, which is sent into the World to gather peo∣ple to God, from whence it comes; this leads to Christ, and will bring you to receive him to dwell in you, and to cleanse you from all Unrighteousness; and as you come to be made clean by the Word of God, which is Quick and Powerful, in all that believe, which Word you must feel to cleanse and purifie you in your selves, and to make you clean from all that which offends the Life of God; and then you will receive the Testimony of Justification, as you come to be quickened by God, by the quickening Spirit, by which every one must be quick∣ened from Death (which hath reigned over all) to Life, that it may reign in you; and till this be known, all Profession of the Scriptares avails nothing towards Life Eternal: therefore feel in your selves Christ Jesus, the Quicken∣ing Spirits, that you may be made alive to God again. And all you that are convinced with the Light, be faithful therein through all Tryals and Sufferings which are to come upon you inwardly or outwardly; for great Tryals and Sufferings without will come, and great Judgments, and Afflictions within will approach; but through all these things be faithful, and in them all be pati∣ent to the End, that you may obtain Life Eternal, which is the Reward of all the Faithful. And dwell in the daily Cross of Christ, in which the Power of God will be witnessed amongst you, which will throw down that which hath ruled above the Seed of God, that the Seed of God may come forth, in which the Election stands, which receives the Promise of God: but Friends, there must be a long and patient waiting under the Hand of the Lord, and of the Operation of his Spirit, before you come to witness the Election; you must be faithful to that which calls you, and take up the Cross to your own Wills, Lusts, and Desires, and Affections which arise out of the earthly Part; for that which is of the Flesh must be crucified, as that which is of the Spirit comes to live; for it is that which is born of the Spirit in you, which is Heir of God's Kingdom, and which must Inherit Eternal Life: And so wait upon the Lord, every one of you, that his Fear may be in your Hearts, and his Spirit in your inward Parts, to lead you, and to guide you in all his Wayes: And meet together to hear what the Lord saith in you, Hearken to his Voice, that your Souls may live; It is the Voice of God heard in the Creature, which raises the Soul from Death: And though you ear no word from Man, yet his Voice may be heard in you, if your Ear be turned to the Light, with it your Hearts will be searched, and
your Wayes tryed, and all your Words and Works approved, or reproved and ere is your Teacher, or your Condemner: and this was I moved in tender  to the Seed of God, to write unto you; Grace and Peace from God be ongst you all, that fear him, Amen. A Friend to the Seed of God in you, E. B. To all Friends in LONDON, &c. TO all the Flock of God in London, even to all you that are of a clean Heart, whose Minds are stayed upon God, even to all that are Faith∣ful and Sincere in the Sight of the Lord; with my very Heart I wish Grace, and Peace, and Mercy from the God and Father of our Life, unto you all th are such, without respect of Persons; and such, that are so, I love with a perfect Love, and am united to you in the Bonds of the Gospel, and perfectly present with you in Spirit; and who are such among you, that truly fear the Lord, and walk in his Way, I cannot forget, nor be separated from, her can I be of such forgotten; for are we not written in one anothers hearts, yea, I daily read such in the Book of Life, and of such may I daily be read, who know and have felt my Labours, and Care, and Travels amongst you, which have been more then a little, my God knows, and ye are my Wit∣ness; for many times the Lord hath made me as a Wall of Defence betwixt you and many Enemies; and I have not spared my own Life to serve you, but have given out plentifully of the Lord's Treasure, that you might be made rich; and I have given out from my Life of the Lord's Substance, that you might be fed and nourished; and I have kept nothing back of the whole Counsel of God, which was needful for you to know; and for all this, the Lord is unto me at this day a sufficient Reward: and of you I desire nothing to my self, but do sincerely desire of the Father for you all, That Love, and Faith, and Pu∣rity, and all the Works of the Spirit may plentifully abound in you all, that  Father may be glorified through your bringing forth much Fruit. Where∣fore my dear and beloved Friends, Look unto the Lord, who hath begotten you to himself; let his Fear be before your Eyes, and his Judgments in your Hearts; Oh! keep near the Lord at all times; for its he that preserves his People, its he that leads them and goes before them, its he that feeds them, and re∣freshes them at all times; for its be alone, and there is not another, that gives you Peace and Strength, Wisdom and Knowledge, and all good things; he is ot streightened to any of his, that sincerely wait upon him; he is the Por∣tion of his People, and the Inhaeritance of their Souls: and he causeth all them  trust in him to lie down in Safety, and none can make them afraid. Therefore, oh my Friends! I say again and again, Love the Lord, and his Way; and be Faithful in the Truth unto the End; love not your Life, nor y other thing, for his Service sake; but give up all things of this World, that you may receive all in the Lord: be watchful against all your Ene∣mies, that you be not overcome of the Devil, but resist him in all his Ap∣, that you may not be defiled, nor lose your Peace with the Lord,  is to me, and I hope to you of greater price then all other things whatso∣ever: and this I have said among you in Faithfulness, and at this present do charge yo all, To dwell in Love and Unity one with another, and to ear one with another, and to walk in Wisdom one towards another, and to be Examples of Righteousness one before another, that it may be known that God is amongst
you of a Truth; and he is my Witness, nothing without me can more add to my Joy, then to know of your Welfare in the Lord, and of your Stedfastness in the Faith of Christ Jesus; and for this my Heart wisheth, as much as for any other thing besides: And though I be outwardly separated from you, ac∣cording to my Father's Will, who gave his Enemies power over my outward man, to cast it into Bonds for a moment, yet am I present in Spirit amongst you, and my Love and Life salutes you all in the Fear of the Lord; and though the outward man may suffer, yet am I in perfect freedom, and in perfect Peace, and in every respect perfectly well in the Lord, who is my Strength, my Ar∣mour and my Crown; and in his Authority I yet once more beseech you all, even for the Lord's sake, That ye take heed to the true Light, Christ Jesus, who lighteth every one of you, which Light leads to Christ, who saveth and re∣deemeth from Sin and Death, and from all the Wayes and Works thereof; and this ye know, who are God's Witnesses of his Love and tender Mercies, and of the Faithfulness of his Servant. Moreover, my dear Friends, All disorderly Spirits, who are out of the pure Fear and Wisdom of God, my Life doth judge, and with the Power such I do deny, who are not Simply in the Power of God; and them that seek them∣selves in any thing amongst you, my God shall judge; and who are rash in Judgment, and forward to utter words, and bring forth Fruit, and not in due season, such are a Burden to the Lord's Soul: Therefore take heed, I charge you all, to the guiding and moving of the pure Spirit of God alone; for that will stand, and its Fruits will never wither; and whatsoever is otherwise brought forth among you, the Lord will confound, and it shall not profit the people. This is to be read amongst you, in the Fear of the Lord. E. B. To Friends in Barbadoes, Virginia, and New-England, &c. TO the Seed of God, and to all that are begotten of him by the Im∣mortal Word, in Barbadoes, Virginia, New-England, and that wayes, even to all that have felt and tasted of the Word of Life; Grace, Mercy and Truth be multiplyed amongst you. Dear Friends, dwell in the Truth, and walk in it, that ye may be a sweet Sa∣vour unto God, and may have Unity with him, and one with another, in his Life and Spirit; and wait, that you may have Victory over the World, and the Spirit of it in you, which hath captivated your minds in the Luts of this Creation, and which hath led you in By-pathes of Iniquity, while you were Strangers unto God, and without his Knowledge: But now having re∣ceived Grace and Mercy from God, and his Word hath entred into your hearts, whereby you are begotten into the Hope of Eternal Life, and are changed, now the Lord requires of you, to be Faithful in his Work, and Valiant for his Truth, that you may obtain the Promise, and be made free from Sin, and be∣come the Servants of Righteousness; and feel the Word and Power of God in your Hearts, which will crucifie you daily to the World, and make you alive unto God, that he may live in you, and walk in you, and work all your Works for you; and this is the Everlasting Covenant, where God works in the Creature both to will and to do, and man lives not, but Christ lives in him, and speaks in him; and this you must wait for, to be Witnesses of in your own Consciences: For what is the Profession of God with the Lips,
and the Profession of the Scriptures, while men do not walk by the Spirit a gave forth the Scriptures, and enjoy God in their Hearts? so you must all wait to be Possessors of the Substance, Christ, the First and the Last, the Beginning and Ending, him must you feel in you to destroy the Devil, and his works, and to change you into the divine Nature, which is like unto God; and this is Salvation, God with us, destroying the Enmity, and recon∣ciling man unto himself, by overcoming Sin and Transgression; and your hearts must be cleansed by the Word of God, and that which is contrary purged out; and this is the New Covenant, where the Heart is circumcised, and the Body of sin put off, and the Creature freed from the burden of Iniquity; and then there is clearness and freeness, where sin is remitted and washed away, and no burden lying upon the Conscience, but the Heir of God born, the Redeemer, which maketh free from the Devil and Sin; and they are the Sons of God, who are thus made free, whose Sins are remitted and Iniquity covered, and the Life rules, and reigns, and hath overcome Death, and Death is swallowed up of Life; and this is the Promise of God, which must be fulfilled in you that ye may possess the Treasure of God in your Hearts, and be Feeling-Witnesses of Im∣mortality; your Hands must handle the Word, and you must taste, and feel and see the Word of Life within you; and you must find the Pearl: and your own Lamps must have Oyl in them; for people have long been running without, after men, Lo here, and Loe there, and have been applying the Promises in the wrong nature; but now people must turn to the Light of Christ within them; for Christ is the true Light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World; and this Light must men follow, and then they shall not walk in Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life; and men must walk in the Light, and then the Blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin; and men must believe in the Light, and then they shall be the Children of the Light, and then Light shall shine out of Darkness; and the Light that shines in their hearts, shall give them the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. So Friends, love the Light, and walk in the Light; for it is the Light within that lets men see whether their Deeds are wrought in God, or contrary to him; the Light within will let you see of what nature your Works are, whether of the corrupt nature, or of the Divine Nature; for all mens Works are of the one of these: and all the Works that spring from the corrupt nature, are but Abomination unto God, though they appear never so Righteous; and that Righteousness which is of Man, cannot be justified before the Lord, but man must be a Partaker of God's Righteousness, of an uncreated Righteousness, and that will cover all his Infirmities, and in that only can man be presented Righteous unto God: So Friends, Wait to be Witnesses of this Righteousness, that you may be cloa∣thed with it, and may be stripped off all your own, which is but as filthy Rags, and will not hide mans Nakedness; but his Righteousness and his Sin must be condemned together, and God must be known to work to will, and to do in the Creature; and this is God's Righteousness, for which you must all wait, that you may be Heirs of it, and Possessors of it unto your Eternal Peace: and live in the Fear of the Lord, and be not immoderate nor excessive in any thing, nor let your hearts be drawn away with the Creatures; for then you commit Ido∣latry, and are overcome of this World, and you want the Authority of God, and are in Bondage unto the Creatures, and they defile you, and burden you in that state, while your Minds are captivated with them. So Friends, Mind God's Wisdom amongst you, that it may lead you in all things: and live in Love and Unity one with another, and let no Strife be amongst you, nor Conten∣tion, for that will destroy you, and eat out true Love, and your Hearts will be hardened; but bear one with another, and be in Patience and Long-suf∣fering one towards another, and then the Presence of the Lord will fill your Hearts with Satisfaction, and you will be comforted in God, and one in ano∣ther, if Love and Unity be amongst you in the Spirit: And meet together in the
Name and Fear of the Lord, and mind the Lord's Presence amongst you; mind not words, but mind the Presence of the Lord, and feel his Power in your hearts, and the words that come from the Power will refresh the Seed of God; but if any speak words out of the Power, the Seed of God will be burdened, and will judge such words: So every one feed upon the Bread of Life, that comes from God, and feel the Water of Life springing up in your Hearts, that you may grow unto God as Plants of Righteousness, and may make your Calling and Election sure: So dwell in the Light, and take up the daily Cross of Christ, and walk not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit, and so shall the Blessings of the Lord be upon you. My dear Love, even the same Love wherewith I am loved of my Father, doth salute you all; and the Seed of God in you, that I know, and to that am I known, who am a Brother and Companion unto all the Faithfull and Upright, Edw. Burroughs. Let this be coppied over, and sent abroad, and read in all your Meetings.
Good Counsel AND ADVICE Rejected by Disobedient Men: And the Days of Oliver Cromwell's Visitation passed over; And also, Of Richard Cromwell, his Son; late Protectors of these Nations: And the many Precious Warnings neglected by them, and set  nought, which from time to time were given unto them, as declared in these following Letters; whereby all may see the Kindness of the Lord to∣wards them, by his Faithful Invitations to them, and their own Apostacy and Carelesness; who rejected Warning till the Time and Day of their Visitation is shut up with the Vail of Darkness and Reproach, which lies over them, and their precious Day of Love is spent, and cannot be re-called. To the READER. FRiend, Out of the same Love from whence these were written, do I put them to pub∣lick view; and it was not without much Doubtings and Questioning in my own spirit;  at last; having found perfect Freedom and Strength from the Lord, kn that I am  and fr altogether of other Ends, saving then for the Hono of the Truth; and that all may see, that the Dnfalls of these en were not before sufficient Warnings, which makes the Lord free,  his Servant free, from what is co to pass upon them; and even their Fall lies upon their own heads, that dispised the Lords Warnings, and would none of his Counsel; but suffered the Innocent to be oppressed under their Power, and relieved not the Heritage of the Lord from her Cruel Enemies, though they had Power to do it; but  their own glory, and how to be established in greatness in the Earth, till that he Lord  cast them ut, and made them as a Reproach: And these things that have come to pass  them, may be as Warnings to all other Rulers that do succeed them; and they may  that the Lord is , and his Iudgments Righteous; and whosoever shall follow their   be Oppresss of the Lord's Heritage, as they were, the Lord shall extend his Iudg∣ments  them also, and their Destruction shall come, even like as upon thse before them. Therefore let all the Earth be warned. I am a Lover of Sion. For the hands of the Protector. FRIEND, MAny Wrnings hast thou had from the Mouth of the Lord; his Love hath been towards thee, and the glorious Day of his Visitation hath shined over thy head, wherein he hath called unto thee to hear
and obey his Voice, and would have instructed thee in the Way that thou shouldest walk, that thy Soul might live forever in Peace and Rest, when this World is passed away; and that in this present World he might have made thee a Blessing to thy self, and Posterity, and People, and a Praise in thy Domi∣nions, and unto Ages after tee, if thou hadst hearkened and obeyed his Voice, and chosen his Way and Counsel, and not thine own; and then would e have made thine Enemies to have bowed under thee, and the Force of their Policy and Arm should never have prevailed against thee; and thou shalt be delivered from the Will of all that hate thee, if thou yet wilt hearken unto him, and re∣ceive his Instruction, and set th heart to seek his Honour ore then thie own, and wilt let his Counsel be thy Guide and Ruler, and not vin man, which must be brought to nought; even now, before the Day of thy Visitation be spent, never more to be re-called, and the time come when God will cease to strive with thee, and will not call unto thee, but will leave thee to thy own heart's false Judgment, and the Counsels of Treacherous Men. And Friend, I, as one that hath obtained Mercy from the Lord, unto wom his Word is committed, being moved of him, do hereby in his Presence yet once more warn thee, That thou fear before him, and diligently hearken to him, and seek him with all thy heart, that thou mayst know his Will and Csel concerning thee, and mayst do it, and nd Favour in his Sight, and live; and now is the Day that his Hand is stretched forth unto thee, to make thee a Bles∣sing, or to leave thee a Curse forever: and the Dayes of thy Visitation are near an end, when God will no more call unto thee, nor hear thee,   the the Day of thy Trouble thou callst to him, neither will answer theeby Visi∣on, nor Dream, nor Prophets; but will leave thee to the counsels of Trus men, who will seek after thy Life, and wait for thy Over-throw, and  for Evil against thee, that they may glory in thy Desolation; and such th are, of whom thou hast need to beware: and if thou rejectest the Counsel of the Lord and followest the Desires of thine own Heart, and the Wills of men, and wilt not have the Light of the World, Christ Jesus, only to rule thee, and to teach thee, which condemns all Evil; then shall Evil surely fall upon thee, if thou lovest not the Light in thee, which condemns it; and the Judgts of God, nor the Day of his last Visitation with Vengeance thou mayst not escape. Therefore consider, and mark my words, and let this Counsel be acceptable un∣to thee, th thy dayes may be many, and Blessed upon Earth; and st consi∣der, and let it move upon thee to Meekness, to Humbleness, and to fear before the Lord; assuredly knowing, that it is he that changeth times and things; and that bringeth down and setteth up whomsoever he will; and how that thou wast raised from a low estate, and set over all thine Enemies; and thy  was exalted above them all, and he gave thee the Necks of Princes to  , and more Honourable, and their Dominions to inrit; and thou wast  a Ruler in much Dominion, and had Favour in his Sight, and in the ight of ma∣ny people, who wished well to thee for a Blessing: many Victories honor and remarkable were given unto thee, over them who had exalted themselves against God; and this thou knowest, That not by Might, nor by Multitude,  by the Arm of the Lord were they subdued and made a Pey unto thee, and their Treasures a Spoil unto thy Hands; and so it was that thou mightest have glori∣fied him forever, and exalted him in the great Congregation, and gone on in Faithfulness unto the End: and in that day, when thou wast raised up, when the Fear of the Lord was before thy face, and thy Heart was towards him, and thou wast but little in thy own eyes, then was it well with thee, and the Lord blessed thee, and made thee honourable, and his People had love towards thee, and desire for thee, that thou mightest have been as a Helper to the Poor, and a Father to the Faithful, and a Preserver of the Upright from Unreasonable Men, and an Easer of the Oppressed, and a Taker away of every Oppressive Bond: and it was not once thought concerning thee, that the hands of the Ungodly
would have been strengthened against the Righteous under thee; or that such grievous and cruel Burdens and Oppressions would ever have been laid upon the Just, and acted against them in thy Name, and under thy Dominion, as un∣righteously have come to pass in these three years, as a large Testimony might be given; and this thy suffering of such things is thy Transgression, and thou hast not requited the Lord well for his Goodness unto thee; nor fulfilled his Will in suffering that to be done under thee, and in thy Name, which the Lord raised thee against to break down, hadst thou been faithful to the end. Again consider, and let it move on thy Heart not to exalt thy self, nor to be high minded, but to fear continually; knowing that thou standest not by thy self, but by another, and that he is able to abase thee, and give thee into the will of thy Enemies, whensoever he will; and how the Lord hath preserved thee sometimes wonderfully, and doth unto this day, from the mur∣derous Plots, and crafty Policy of evil Men, who seek thy evil, and would rejoyce in thy fall, and in the Desolation of thy Family and Countries, how have they, and do they lay Snares for thy Feet, that thou mayst be cut off from amongst men, and dye unhappily, and be accounted Accursed; and yet to this day he hath preserved thee and been near thee to keep thee, though thou hast hardly known it; and the Lord's end is love to thee in all these things, and yet a little longer to try thee, and that thou mightst give him the Glory; O that thy Heart were opened to see his Hand, that thou mayst live unto him, and dye in him in Peace: and beware lest Hardness of Heart possess thee, if thou slight his Love, and so be shut up in Darkness, and given to the Desires of thine Ene∣mies, and left to the Counsels of treacherous Men, who may seek to exalt thee by flattery, that they might the better cast thee down, and destroy thee, and blot out thy Name in reproach, and make thy Posterity a People miserable; but now O consider, and let it enter into thy Heart, for thou hast not answered the Lord, but been wanting to him for all this; and hast chosen thy own way and glory, rather then his, and not fulfilled his Counsel in raising thee; for the Bonds of Cruelty are not loosed by thee, and the Oppressed are not altogether set free; neither is Oppression taken off from the Back of the Poor; nor the Laws regulated, nor the liberty of pure Consciences altogether allowed: but these Dominions are filled with cruel Oppressions, and the Poor groan everywhere under their heavy Hand of Injustice; the Needy are troden down under Foot, and the Oppressed cry for Deliverance, and are ready to faint for true Justice and Judgement; the Proud exalts himself against the Poor; and the High-minded and Rebellious contemns the Meek of the Earth; the Horn of the Ungodly is exalted over the Lord's Heritage, and they that are departed from Iniquity are become a Prey to Oppressors; and the Cr hearted deal cruelly with the Innocent in these Nations; and such whom the Lord hath freed in their Consciences from false Worships and Teachers, and from the Wayes of Sin and Death, are made Slaves, and greedily preyed upon by unjust men through casting into Prisons, and Dungeons, and unjust Fines, and Illegal Proceedings, and Beatings and Abusings, and Woundings and Bruisings, hard to be expressed, and large to be declared; even the Hands of the People over whom thou art set to rule, are full of Blood, Merciless and Cruel, and nei∣ther fet God, nor are subject to the just Rule and Government of Men: and the Mouthes of many of thy subservant Rulers, and Governours, that have their Power from thee, are as the Teeth of young Lions, and the Upright and Hrmless are devoured, and made a Spoil of by them, through Policy and Oppression, both in their Persons, and Estates; if I perish I must speak the Truth; my life is not dear to me for the Truth's sake; many who should have judged in true Justice and Righteousness the Cause of the Poor, have been as Bryars and Thorns to ensnare and pierce the just Man; and have perverted Judgement, and und it backward, and Equity hath hardly had place to en∣ter; most of the Prisons this day, in all thy Jurisdictions, have and doth
testifie the unjust Judgement, and the great Oppressions and Cruelties of some in Authority, who have used, or rather abused thy Name, and made it a Cloak for their Hard-heartedness: O my Heart is troubled, and my Bowels pained at the remembrance of this; how doth the Poor cry under the heavy Hand of Oppression, and the Needy lament for want of true Judgement, and the Op∣pressed groan for want of Deliverance? And these things are thought upon by the Lord, though not considered by thee as they ought to be: and because of this will he arise to plead the Cause of the Innocent, against him that is too strong for him, and will dash to pieces his Enemies, and break the Jaws of the Devourers, and the Righteous shall not alwayes be a Prey to the Teeth of the Ungodly. O Friend, when wilt thou consider the Oppression of the Poor, and hearken to the cry of the Oppressed within thee, and without thee, when shall it enter into thy Heart, this cause of the unjust Sufferings of the Lord's People, from which thou canst not altogether be excused? for it is acted in thy Name, though not by thee. O let thy Ear be opened unto the Cryes of the Oppressed in the Prisons, and let the Cause of the Innocent come before thee, and let thy heart be pierced at the Consideration of these things, which are come to pass in thy day, contrary to the expectations of many; and see if it be not contrary to thy own Promises sometimes vowed by thee, let the Light of Christ in thy own Conscience answer: and some of the multitude of the grievous Oppressions of which the Land is full, have been laid at thy Door and brought unto thee, but scarcely found an encrance upon thee; and this aggravates the Crime of of thy Transgression, in that thou knowest of these things; and wonderful is it to consider, that even thou with whom the Power of the Lord hath sometimes been, should now suffer that people, with whom the Power of the Lord is, to be persecuted, and thy name to be a cloak for it; how many in all parts of this Nation have been, and are at this day grievous sufferers under cruel bondage concerning Tythes, that great Abomination and Idol, and cause of heavy groanings? the bodies of many just men violently surprized, and cast into Goals and Prisons unjustly, and some illegally; their cruelly suffering the loss of their Liberties, and the enjoyments of their Families, and honest Assemblies; and others have their Goods spoiled, and made havock upon, almost to the ruin of Families by unreasonable men, through unjust Judgment and cruel dealings of some in Authority for so much unjustly challenged by the Priest, or Impropriator, it may be they distress five times so much, to the great shame of the Government of a Christian Nation; as may appear in a Book called, The Cry of the Oppressed; and how many are ready even to faint under the hard Oppression of maintaining Hireling Teachers, and Idol-Temples? many for that cause being unjust Sufferers in Bodies and Estates, by cruel imprisoment, and spoiling of Goods: the very cry of this Oppres∣sion reaches unto Heaven against thee, who suffers it, and against the Idol-Shepherds, who are the ground of it, who make a prey upon Gods Heritage; and the Lord God will be avenged upon them, and they and their Staff shall utterly perish: wo unto them, and to the Idol-Worships of which the Land is full, which they uphold, which causes the hearts of the Righteous to mourn, because of the Seed of God which is in Captivity under them; again, many are unjust and wofull Sufferers, because they cannot swear on this or that occasion, though in all causes they speak the truth, and do obey Christ's Commands, even such are trodden upon by unjust Fines charged upon them, and imposed Oppressions, the Example of which never went before, many parts of this Land is witness of this; and this is by the corruptness of some that bear rule under thee, who rule not for God as they ought, but turns the Sword of Justice, and doth unjustly thereby, and grieves the Lord, and dishonours thee; Again, some suffer long and tedious imprisonments, and others cruel Stripes and Abuses, and danger of life many times from
wicked men, for reproving Sin and crying against the Abomination of the Ti, which the Scriptures also testifie against, in Streets, or Temples, or  Places; some having been sent to Prison, taken on the High-Way, and no  charged against them; and others committed, being taken out of Peaceable Meetings, and whipped and sent to Prison without transgression of any Law,  or unjust, wholly through the Rage and Envy of the Devil, and such who have perverted Judgement and Justice; and some in Prisons have suffered superaboundantly from the Hands of the cruel Goalers, and their Servants, by Beatings and Threatnings, and putting Irons on them, and not suffering any of their Friends to visit them with Necessaries; and some have dyed in the Prisons, whose Lives were not dear to them, whose Blood will be reckoned on account against thee, one day; and many more other wayes have suffered grievous things, as Banishments out of Towns, and Whipping, and Stock∣ing, and grievous unjust Abuses, and none of these for Evil-doing, but for Good, even because they cannot bow to the Devil, but are redeemed out of the World, and therefore the World hates them; and some have suffered hard Cruelties, because they could not respect Persons, and bow with Hat, or Knee; and from these Cruelties canst thou not altogether be excused in the sight of God, being brought forth in thy Name, and under thy Pow∣er; consider Friend, and be awakened to true Judgement, let the Lord search thy Heart, and lay these things to mind, that thou mayst be an Instrument to remove every Burthen, and mayst at last fulfill the Will of God; are they nothing to thee, that such things should be brought forth under thee? O, be awakned, be awakened, and now seek the Lord's Glory, and not thine own, least thou perish before the Lord and Men; nay, if Men would give thee This was meant, that he should de∣ny to be made King; that was in agi∣tation when this Letter was written. Honour, and high Titles, and princely Thrones, take it not; for that which would exalt and honour thee in the World, would betray thee to the World, and cast thee down in the sight of the World; and this is God's Word to thee: what! shall the whole Nation be perjured Men, and thou the cause of it? and wilt thou transgress by building again that which thou hast destroyed? Then shall the Lord, and his Light, in every Conscience, bear witness against thee; let it not be, but deny thy self, and thou wilt find the Lord honouring thee. Give heed unto my Words, and understand my Speech, Be not exalted by Man, lest Man betray thee; the Lord give thee an Understanding in this, and guide thee in his Counsel; and the rather above all things, let thy Heart be stirred up in thee for the Lord: For now is he setting up the Dominion of his Son, which never shall have an End, and thy Dominion must bow under it, and all the Dominions of the Earth, or else be confounded and broken to Pieces: the Glory of the Lord is revealing, and thine shall be vailed before it; and the Glory of all Flesh shall fall: Therefore strive not openly nor secretly against his Way; for it shall prosper, there is no Enchantment against us, nor any formed Weapon that can prosper; know∣est thou not that the King of Righteousness might command thousands of his Saints to avenge him of his Adversaries, and to plead his Cause against the Rebellious? All Power is in his Hand, yea, and the Authority and Dominion shall be in the Hands of his Saints, and every one that exalts himself against them, shall be brought down; not by an outward Sowrd, or might of Man, but by his out-stretched Arm; and all Crowns that are Mortal shall be tro∣den down by him whose Crown is Immortal, and never fades away: There∣fore be wise and learned, this is thy day; as thou dealest, or sufferest to be done with the Lord's People, so to thee it shall be done in that day, when their Government shall out-reach thine, and be set atop of it; as thou hopest for Mercy from the Lord, when his Kingdom conqueres thee and thine, now deal favourably and relieve the Oppressed; boast not thy self though the Lord hath used thee in his Hand; but know that when he will he can cast thee, a Rod, out of his Hand into the Fire; for in his Hand thou
art, if thou wilt honour him, he will honour thee, otherwise he can, yea and will confound thee and break thee, and make thee weak as Water before him; his Love through my Heart breaths unto thee; he would thy happiness, if thou wilfully contemn it not by exalting thy self, and seeking thine own glory, and hardning thy Heart against the Cry of the Poor; and this I was moved in bowels of pittiy to lay before thee, who am thy Friend, not in Flattery, but in an upright Heart, who wisheth well unto thee in the Lord. A Friend to the Kingdom of Christ, and not of this World, but an Heir of Immortality with the Son of God, called. E. B. The Original of this was given to the Hands of Oliver Cromwell then Protector, in the third moneth of the Year, 1657. For the Hands of Oliver Cromwell called Protector. FRIEND, I am moved to write to thee, from the occasion of being with thee yester∣day, and I take liberty from the true love and pitty stirred up in my Heart towards thee, who am thy Friend, and wisheth well unto thee in the Lord; even that Salvation thou mayest receive, and that thy way may be blessed upon Earth, and the Fruits of the Knowledge of God might more abound in thee, and the Fruits of Ignorance less, which doth appear, which I wish might be cut off before they wholly over-grow thee, and remove the Blessing far from thee in this life, and in the life to come, and bring upon thee Destruction; for the Fruits of all Unrighteousness brings Death, Sorrow, and Misery, and the Light of Christ in thee shall answer in all things to the justness of the Judg∣ments of the Lord. Thou sayest in effect, that thou wouldest not, or thou de∣sirest not our Persecution, or that we should be persecuted by Cruelty, or un∣just Imprisonment; now consider what the cause is, that what thou desirest not to be done, yet is done, thou having power in thy hand onely to prevent what thou wouldest not have done; is it not thine own unfaithfulness to the Principle of God in thee, which beareth witness against the Persecution of the Inno∣cent? Or is it that thou mayest please men, and therefore rather suffer Wicked∣ness to abound, Injustice and Oppression to be acted against the Poor, making it appear thou art willing to do the false Teachers of this Nation, and wicked men a pleasure, then to own the People of God in relieving them, and sing them of their cruel Burthens and Oppressions laid upon them by unjust men; for a word of thy mouth, or the shew of thy Countenance in dislike of these cruel and unjust Persecutions, would bind the Hands of many blood-thirsty. Men, and stop the Mouthes of many Devourers: and therefore because of thine own unfaithfulness doth that come to pass which thou desirest not. And so I must needs say, This appears to be evil in thee, to say, In effect thou approvest not, or thou desirest not out Persecution, and yet it is done; when the Power is in thy Hand to remove it: and this in much love and great pitty I declare unto thee in the Fear and Counsel of God. Further thou sayest, Thn art not guilty of these Persecutions acted unjustly upon us. Again consider, I say, Thou canst not be cleared in the Sight of the Lord God from them, being acted under thee, and in thy Name; in the Day of the Lord the Light in thy Conscience shall answer this; for there seems to be ra∣ther a favouring of them in thee, and by for bearance of the Actors of Cruelty, by which their hands are strengthened, then any dislike shewed by thee in bear∣ing
thy Witness, as thou oughtest to do, against them: For thou knowest of some  this City and else-where, whom we know to be just Men, who suffer Impri∣nt and the loss of their Liberties, because for Conscience sake they can∣ Swear; and many others in this Nation suffering cruel things upon the like, or same ground, even for Well-doing, and not for Evil; which Oppression might be removed, and their unjust Sufferings taken off by thee, by a word from thy Mouth or Pen; and this makes thee that thou canst not be clear in the sight of God in these things, because not helped by thee, who hath the Power to help it: and this in true Love I give thee to understand, in the Day of Re∣compence shalt thou know the Lord will not clear thee, except thou repentest, and sest the Oppressed. Other things thou speakest about the Light of Christ, which lighteneth every man that cometh into the World with the Light of Life, or with the Light of Condemnation, and about the Ministry of this Nation, wi some other things, which I had a desire to have answered, if time had been seasonable, and thou willing to have heard; but thou shouldst not have appeared in such lightness, especially when speaking of the Things of God, which did grieve the Spirit of the Lord, and vex the Righteous Soul; which Be∣haviour, with some words which thou utteredst, by the Light of Christ is to be condemned, and which I do judge with the Life of God, and yet doth tender and preserve the measure of Justness and Honesty which is in thee; but thou art high above the Principle of God, and cannot receive the Teachings of the Father into that mind which is light and unstable; for the Counsel of God is manifest to the Meek and the Lowly, but there is much in thee to be judg∣ed, when thou comest to the Witness of God in thee. And as concerning the Light of Christ, at which thou stumblest, by which every man that comes into the World is enlightened; in short, this I say, The Light to thee is given of God, and it must thou own to be thy onely Teacher, to receive by it from the Father, and to be guided by it in all things, if ever thou inheritest God's King∣dom of Righteousness and Peace; and this is the Word of the Lord to thee. And as concerning the Ministry of England, for which in part thou seemest to plead, thus I say in Plainness, Generally it is not of God, but of Antichrist, and the Lord is against it; for it is the Ground of the greatest Oppression of the Poor in its Maintenance, as any one particular Abomination which this day is in the Nation, and this is the Truth from the Lord; and if thou settest thy self to uphold them, by any Law made, or to make against such whom God hath raised to bear Witness against them, their Wayes, and Idolatries, thou alt fall with them into Perdition, and be overthrown amongst them in the Just and Righteous Judgments; and this is the Word of the Lord to thee: For God is risen of a Truth to make War against the Beast which long hath reigned, and against the False Prophets which have long deceived the World; and I warn thee, with-hold thy hand from helping them, if thou meanest to be pre∣served or blessed in thy Person, in thy Family, and in thy Armies; for, as I said to thee, The Kingdom of Christ is setting up by his own Power, and all must ow and become subject thereunto; he needeth none of thy Policy, nor the strength of thy Arm to advance him; yet would he have thee not to prove thy self an open Enemy thereof, by doing or suffering to be done Cruelty and Injustice against them whom the Lord is redeeming out of this World into sub∣jection unto that Kingdom, lest thou be such a one, as wilt not enter thy self, nor suffer others to enter, and so Destruction come upon thee. Wherefore arise as out of Sleep, and Slumber not in this World's Glory and Honour; come away, and appear for the Lord, rather then against him; be not over∣come by the Pleasures of this World, nor the Fattering Titles of Men; win not at the Cruelty and Oppression acted by some, who shelter under thee, and make thy Name a Cloak for Mischief against the Upright, but let the Testimony of God in thee answer for his People, this Law is not just by which many suffer, because they cannot swear, and because they cannot cease to declare against
Sin and Iniquity, let that of God in thee bear Witness, and thou and thy name being chief in the Execution of this Law, what will thy account be to the Lord in his Day? Consider, I say, consider, and be thou changed in thy mind and heart, lest thou having forgotten God, and his many Deliverances, be shut up, and numbred for Destruction: and I say, and desire, the Lord give thee a more perfect Understanding of his Wayes and Judgments, and that the Crown Immortal thou mayst strive for, by Meekness and Righteousness, through re∣lieving the Oppressed, and shewing Mercy to the Poor, and removing every Burden which lies upon the Innocent; and this is the Desire of him who is thy Friend, and would not have thee crowned with Dishonour, through suffering the People of God to be oppressed in thy Name, which will be thy Overthrow absolutely, if thou removest it not by turning and easing the Oppressed, Edw. Burroughs. This was delivered to his hands about the beginning of the Fourth Moneth, 1657. For the hands of the Protector. FRIEND, THou oughtest to stand in the Counsel of God in all things, and not to fol∣low the Counsel of thy own heart, nor to act things in thine own will; neither shouldst thou suffer others to act under thee, and in thy name, that which is Unjust and Unrighteous: Much Unrighteousness and great Op∣pression is acted in thy name, by which the good name (PROTECTOR) is abused and subverted; and instead of Protection by it, great Unjustice is acted under it, and covered with it: and this one thing I am moved to lay be∣fore thee, which hath been acted by thee, or under thee, not without thy know∣ledge, in which thou hast; done Evil in the Sight of the Lord, and one day thou wilt know it; Several in these Nations, Justices of the Peace, and other Of∣ficers, who have been in trust under thee, when they have owned the People of God in scorn called Quakers, have been cast out of their Places, though they have not denyed to serve thee and the Common-Wealth, neither hath Unfaith∣fulness to their Trust been proved against them; and also, several Souldiers now of late in Scotland, and else-where, have been turned out of their Places because of the same thing (viz.) For owning the People of God; and these things are not right in the Sight of the Lord, that such who have been for many years Faithful in the Service, and in their Trust, and hazarded Life and Liberty for Conscience sake, to enjoy Liberty of Conscience, which they cannot now possess because of thee, but are cast out for the Exercise of their pure Con∣sciences; this Thing the Lord is grieved with, and with thee because of it. For thou didst not obtain this Victory of Peace and Freedom by thy own Sword, then why should it be thus improved to thy own Ends? Consider of it, for this makes the Nations more unhappy and less blessed, when such who de∣light in true Justice and Judgment are cast out of their Places, and so deprived of giving their Judgment among men; and absolutely this will make thy Ar∣my less prosperous, and more unblessed, when such who fear the Lord, and against whom thou canst not justly charge Evil, are cast out, and despised; and this in time thou mayst see to thy Sorrow: And as thy Friend I ay this be∣fore thee, and do in plainness tell thee, If thou thus utterly denyst the People of God in the day of thy Prosperity, and thus wholy cast them out of thy service, they cannot stand by thee, nor own thee in the day of thy Trouble; and such as
thou cleavest unto may be a broken Staff in thy time of need. Ah Friend! these things do shew that thy heart is not right in the sight of the Lord, and that Justice and true Judgment, Righteousness and Truth is even despised in this Land, and not sincerely owned by thee; when as such who fear the Lord are thus cast out of Judicatories in thy Government, and out of Defence in thy Armies: What! is this the end of that long travel in Wars, and of so many fair Promises of Liberty of Conscience, that just Men should thus be dealt withal? The Heathen Kingdoms may Mock at this, that while some have pretended Liberty of Conscience, are become Persecutors of such whose Con∣sciences are justly exercised: and as I have sometime said to thee, much Injustice, and great Oppressions, and cruel Persecutions continue daily to be acted in thy name, which is numbred up against thee upon account, because of hiding thy Face from the Cry of the Poor, as one without Bowels of Compassion unto such who have truly served with thee in a faithful Service for the Common-Wealth, who many of them now are grievous Sufferers under thee. Consider of these things, and search what will be the End of them; the Lord open thy Understanding, that more of the Wisdom of God may guide thee, and less of the policy and wisdom of Man, which will betray thee of God's Kingdom, and may in the end cast thee down in this World also. E. B. The Original of this was delivered to his Hands in the Fifth Moneth, 1657. FRIEND, IT is upon me, and also I am pressed in spirit thereunto, to give thee, even unto thee Oliver Protector, the perfect measure of thy Dominions, and how they stand in relation to thee, as concerning the Affections of the people towards thee, whereby thou mayst understand thy own Condition, and the state of thy Government, as I have viewed it in true Judgment, and marked it upon serious consideration; and what I write is in perfect Love unto thee, how∣ever thou mayst judge of it, and of these things, it will be well f thee to con∣sider, now while it is time, ere it be too late. Many Enemies thou hast, which watch over thee for Evil, and not for Good, who would Rejoyce in thy Overthrow: And first, There are a People scatter∣ed through all these Nations, who are full of Wrath and ravening Envy towards thee, in whose hearts to this day there is continual Hatred, and evil Surmi∣ng lodgeth against thee and all thy Off-Spring; and I believe (without any further knowledge) that daily Advantage they seek against thee, by subtil Conspiracies and secret Plottings of Maliciousness in their Hearts, seeking by all means, if it be possible, how to be revenged, and not slipping any Ad∣vantage how to revenge themselves, and promote their Cause; and of these scattered under thy Goverment are not a few, but rather the greater number, who thus stand in Affections to thee, with no better purpose of good towards thee, then to destroy thee by any means, if it were in their power, and to take away thy name in Reproach; such is the Cruelty and Desperateness of some of them, their own lives are not dear unto them, to take away thine; I have felt the strength of their Rage against thee, which carries them above sence, or fear to fore-go any Danger, that they might see their desired End of thee: Their Malice towards thee is so seated in their wrathful Hearts, that it cannot easily be quenched; I know the Lord hath blasted them and
their endeavours to this day, and thou hast had Dominion and Power given thee of God to bruise, and to break them to pieces; for because of the Wickedness of that Generation, which was grown to the full, did the Lord raise thee up as a Plague upon them, because of their Unrighteousness, Oppression and Tyran∣ny, and they were made as Slaves and Bondmen under thy Power; and without the Lord can they not at any time do any thing against thee: but what and if for thy Wickedness in the Sight of God, he should make them Instruments in his hand to accomplish his Wrath upon thee, even like as he made thee once his Instrument to overthrow them; and such hath been the Lord's Doings, even to overthrow his Enemies one by the other, and to use the Wicked as a Rod in his hand, to break them one against another like Potsherds: and by that which comes to pass in these Nations, thou seemest no less then to tread in their steps, and in a measure already goest on in their way, in Oppressing (through Tyranny, or suffering it) the People of God, whose Cause the Lord will assuredly plead against thee one day, who now suffer under thee in Patience: and who can tell the Purpose of the Lord, or what he may bring to pass concerning this thing, in raising up the Wicked to be a Plague to Wickedness, and in suffering the Oppressors to overthrow Oppressions? This is by me in Love to thee in sin∣cerity declared, and by thee with Soberness and in the Fear of God it is to be considered. Again, there is another People scattered through all these Dominions, who are not thy Friends, nor Wishers well unto thee or thy Government, who secretly murmer against thee, and envy thee, and even seek God against thee and thy Government, which they judge to be not according to God; and bow not to it in Love, though they are forced to submit for a time, ho∣ping continually, if not hatching, other wayes of Rule and Government, to the overthrow of thee and thine; and these are more Honest, and Up∣right, and Just in the Sight of the Lord then the former; and indeed they are not, nor their Purposes accursed of the Lord; for many of them have been Suf∣ferers, and faithfully served their Nation with perfect purpose of Freedom to the Lord's People, and they have at this day this perfect Zeal for God, and for his Wayes, though not altogether according to Knowledge, yet some of them are not far from the Kingdom of God; though they seek it not wholly in the right Way, nor look onely with a single Eye; yet doth not the Lord hate them altogether because of their Integrity towards him, and Zeal for him; who some of them have suffered Imprisonment for Truth and Righteous∣ness sake, as they have wholly thought, and their Sufferings have not been al∣together slighted by the Lord, and these are they known by Name of the Fifth Monarchy, of whom there are more then a few with them, that wish well unto them, who will rise up for them, rather then for thee, many of whom propound well in their minds, though they have not power to effect it; be∣cause their intent is not altogether according to the Lord, yet are many of them free from that whereof thy self is guilty, and some of them are cast out, and wholy rejected without any just Cause, as they suppose; and these things have grieved their spirits, and not only kindled their Rage and En∣vy, but moved their Sincerity and Honesty against thee; wherefore they are not thy Friends, but rather thy Enemies; and would not stand by thee, or with thee in thy need, but rather (I suppose) would arm them∣selves against thee and thy Power; who highly charge thee (as they sup∣pose, justly too) with Unfaithfulness, and such like; for they see, that is not accomplished which hath been promised by thee, but the contrary, even one Finger is become as heavy as was once the Loyns; and their spirits are grieved against thee for such Causes: and who knoweth but that the Lord may take the occasion to try thee and prove thee by them? for their Hearts are high against thee and thy Government, and that upon good Ground, as they sincerely think.
Again, There is through thy Dominions a People gathered, and gathering daily by Multitudes, who are called and chosen of him, and faithful to him, who have owned him above all things, and whom he hath owned, and will own in the sight of the whole World, and will encrease them to a Numberless Number, according to his Promise; and even those the Lord is making many, who are redeeming out of the World, into the Government and Kingdom of Jesus Christ; and these thou knowest are great and grievous Sufferers, by many hard and cruel Oppressions, from those who are in Authority in thy Go∣vernment, even unjust Imprisonment, and Fines, and burdensome Taxations, in many things hard to be expressed; and they undergo grievous Persecutions under thy Government, and wholy Unjustly in the sight of God; and al∣so, are cast out of all Power and Place in it, and almost out of all Sub∣jects-Priviledge too; many of them being counted as vile amongst men, though they are not so in the Sight of the Lord; Justice, and Righteousness, and true Judgment they cannot have in all these Nations, not from thy self, nor Sub-servant Judges, of whom hardly can their Cause be heard; but are deprived of their proper Right, and of Subjects-Freedom in Judicatories, and exposed to all Wrong that may be by Unjust Men, through Unjust Judg∣ment; and these things are not unknown to thee, and therefore art thou in∣excusable in the Sight of the Lord, and guilty of their Sufferings in his Presence, who hath Power to prevent it, but doth it not; and these thus suf∣fering in thy Goverment, and under it, how can they stand for thee and thy Government, or out of pure Love be subject thereunto; though, be it known to thee, that we (the People of God) do not envy thy Person or Govern∣ment in the least, neither have Purpose of seeking Advantage against thee, or it, to hurt or betray you, by secret Plotting, or turbulent Arising, as others may; yet Friend, the want of our Prayers to God for thee, is worse to thee then the secret Plotting of all Wicked Men. And how can we mention thee in our Prayers to God, except it be to be delivered from thee, who are daily cruel and unjust Sufferers by thee, or because of thee, as I have said? Or how can we be Friends to that Government, or subject to obey that Power under which we daily suffer such hard and cruel things, as the loss of our Liberty and Estates, and danger of Life also? Let that Light in thy own Conscience judge; though for all these things, we do ra∣ther pitty thee, and desire thy Repentance, then Conspire against thee, or wish thy Destruction; yet oughtest thou to consider of these things with a humble Heart, and what a Condition thou art in, who art hated of the Wicked with a deadly Hatred, and not loved of the Saints, because thou lovest not the Lord: Also it might make thy Heart to tremble, to consider how that thy Dominions are thus divided, and the Affections of the People thus dis-united, and few of them thy real Friends; some having real Offence given by thee, wherefore they are forced to loath that Government which is unjust; and others verily supposing of great Wrong sustained from thee, wherefore they are turned against thee. Moreover, and besides all this, greatly it may be suspected, that even they in whom thou dost repose confidence, who seem to cleave unto thee, may not be alto∣gether true unto thee, though in appearance subject, yet may have secret Hypocri∣sie, & hatching of evil in their minds, if it were possible to uncover thy Nakedness; and some others also there may be, who may make use of Places under thee, which may have no more Affection to thee, nor Service for thee, then while their own Ends of great Advantage are served under thee, by their subjection to thy Govern∣ment: And now Friend, these things being justly considered, and viewed by thee in Righteousness, how are thy Dominions as a broken Vessel that cannot ea∣sily be bound up, and as a bruised Reed not to be confided in by thee? and these several sorts of people being substracted out of the whole, how few is it that thou wilt find that are thy Real and Faithful Friends, who may stand by thee in a need∣ful time? Some out of Envy cannot be subject to thee, and others for the
Fear of the Lord's sake, cannot own thee in such a Government, whereby he Just suffer, even all men are ready to stand a far off from thee; and because thou hast denyed the People of God, therefore cannot he be thy Trust: and verily thy state, and the state of thy Dominions, are truly to be lamented; thou hast so much sought thy self, that thou hast lost almost all people, and their Affecti∣ons; every one judging themselves to be the greatest Sufferers under thee. Ah consider! for thou art but the Head of a Disjoynted Body, which may not easily be bound up to thee; and thou art lost for lack of true Knowledge; for the Lord hath done many thing for thee, though thou hast not known it altogether, much less then knowest thou of those things which are Eternal; which belong to thy Peace; it shews thou ownest not the Lord, who cannot own his People, but ra∣ther countest them thy Enemies, and sufferest all Evil to be inflicted upon them; and this is the greatest of thy Misery, in that the Lord hath been so good unto thee, and thy Promises so large towards him for the Feeedom of his People, & yet all forgot, and the Lord's Goodness not answered, and his People made as Slaves and Bond-men under thee, suffering the loss of Liberty, and even their, Birth∣right-Priviledge in many parts of these Nations: wherefore be awakened, O man, and sleep not totally in Carelesness, but remember thy self, either to perform the Good, or at least to escape the Evil, which may suddenly come upon thee. And this I have written to thee out of perfect Love, in the Fear of God, without the Fear of any man, or without any secret or open envying of thee; couldst thou but own the Lord, he would be thy strength to forgive all thy Iniquities; and blot out thy Sin, and to defend thee from all thy Enemies; and above all things, Love Iudgment, Mercy and Truth, and fear before the Lord, and let not his Peo∣ple be thy Bond-slaves, who are more dear unto the Lord then all Earthly glory is unto thee; and if thou couldst own them, they would own thee in the Face of all thine Ene∣mies: many times hast thou been warned, and that from the Lord, and thou shalt confess it when the Lord's hand is upon thee, and thou delivered into the Will of thy Enemies. Remember that I have told thee what the Lord hath shewed me; happy art thou if thou canst receive it, that Peace may be unto thee, and not War, Salvation, and not Condemnation, Renown, and not Dishonour, which waits for thee, except thou turnst to the Lord. Edw. Burroughs. The Original of this was delivered to him in the Seventh Moneth, 1657. To the Protector and Council. A Servant of the Lord, and to you a Friend, wisheth Grace and Wisdom, the Spirit of sound Iudgment, and the Knowledge of God unto you; that in all thing; True Justice and Righteous Judgment may be brought forth and abound unto all people, that you may be more Honourable, and may be made a Blessing to your selves and this Nation, and to Generations after you: But alas, my Friends! how long shall Justice and true Judgment be neglected, and the Innocent deeply groan for want thereof? How long shall it be ere the distresd Cry of the unjust∣ly Afflicted enters into your hearts? I say, when shall your Ear be bowed down to hearken to, & consider of the guiltless cause of many of the faithful Subjects, who lie deeply afflicted through this Nation, some under one cruel Bond of Oppression, and some under another, being most unjustly and wickedly imposed upon them by Cruel Men, who pervert Justice, and turn true Judgment backwards; and neither Fear God, nor Regard Men; but contrary to Justice and the good Laws of this Land, as men without Reason and Natural Affections to Mankind, do act most illegally, to the grievous Oppression of many approved and faithful
Subjects, and the true Knowledge and Consideration hereof is enough to pierce the hardest Heart, and to vex the most patient Mind; and undoubtedly the ce Anger of the Lord is greatly kindled because of these things, and even against your Forbearance, who seem to take little notice of such Cruelties and injustice when they are laid before you; for you do not relieve the Oppressed, neither  remove Oppressors, as you ought to do, and as the Lord requires of you: What, hath the aboundance of this World's glory, and its treasure, quite overcome and stolen away your hearts wholy from all sence and feeling of the unjust Sufferings of your Brethren, who have in times past, as faithfully as your selves, served their Nation with their Lives and Estates, to the purchasing of this Peace and Free∣dom out of the hands of. Opposers; and such may now justly claim the benefit of this Peace and Freedom, and to have a part with you therein, even by Birth∣right and by Purchase, and also by Promise from some of your selves: But alas! while they have waited for it, and thought peaceably to enjoy the same under you, are many of them entrapped into as great Bondage as ever, if not more woful and un∣just; and they are unjustly imprisoned, and unreasonably fined, and every way oppressively dealt withal, and are even spoiled in their Persons and Estates, and their lives often in danger, being through great Injustice become a Prey to their very Enemies, who now take occasion to revenge their former Cause, because of their Faithfulness for the Common-wealth against them; and all this is done while you look on, and no way shewing your dislike to these things, which strengthens greatly the hands of Evil-doers, to add to the Bonds of the Afflicted, yet are you without excuse; for you are not wholy ignorant of these things, for the knowledg of them has often bin laid at your doors; yea, and the very Cry of these Oppressions and Cruelties reach through the whole Land, to the wounding deeply of all people that fear God, to know so great Injustice and Oppression brought forth upon the nocent and faithful People, by some so far entrusted as having the Law com∣itted to them, which they pervert, and turn Judgment backwards; and the greater is the Wound, because you, who have power to stop and prevent these things, should have no more regard to set at liberty the unjust Sufferers, and to der Judgment upon those as thus pervert true Justice, by whom the Land is filled with Violence, whereby the Name of the Lord is greatly dishonoured, and the Government greatly reproached in many parts of the World; why? because the faithful Subjects cannot enjoy their Birth-right-Priviledge as they ought, according to the Law of God and man; for their Equals, yea, their Inferiors have exalted themselves above, and are become Oppressors of the Free-born Peo∣ple: and divers ways do these hainous Oppressions and Cruelties abound upon the Innocent, and not for Evil-doing, but for the exercise of their pure Conscien∣ces towards God; for many have been taken travelling on the High-way, and some out of peaceable Meetings, and out of their Inns and Friends Houses, and by some wicked men in Authority, without shewing just Cause therefore, have just Men been whipped, or stocked, or imprisoned, or other Cruelties done unto them, and yet the transgression of no just Law truly charged against them, nei∣ther have been convicted of any Evil-doing; but they have suffered wholy In∣noctly, only through the Malice, and Will, and Pleasure of their Enemies, who have taken occasion, wihhout any just Offence at all, to stock, and whip and imprison many of the true and faithful Subjects; and this hath not been done in secret, but openly, in many parts of this Nation; and you have had Information of these things that you should have bin awakened to true Iustice and Iudg; and this the Lord requires of you, though the guiltless Sufferers have born all these things without complaining, yet ought you to have judged justly, according to their deeds, such as caused such Cruelty and unjust Sufferings, that for time to come the like might not have been brought forth; but the free Sub∣jects might live in Peace, and Rejoyce under the Government, and all Perver∣ers of Iudgment and Iustice might stand in awe, and be afraid; so should you be a Prase to Ages after you: And likewise many, who are at this present remaining
in Prisons in divers parts of this Land, some upon one false Accusation and evil Surmising, and some upon another, for a good Conscience sake; the Cause of whom hath often been laid before you, which seemed for the present to have some entrance upon you, yet little is brought forth by you, as ought to be in that cause; for though none of any such do complain unto you, who have and do unjustly suffer, yet the Lord doth require you to set the Oppressed and Fals∣ly-Imprisoned at Liberty, and to bring true Judgment forth upon their Perse∣cutors. Also, There is another Suffering great and grievous, growing upon many, if it be not prevented; Many faithful and approved Men are dispossessed of their Freedom, which truly belongeth to them by the Law of God and man, in di∣vers Cities and Corporations, because for Conscience sake they cannot Swear, by kissing the Book, and laying the hand upon it, according to the vain Tradi∣tion in such Causes formerly used; though to deal justly towards God and man in their Craft and Science they are bound by the Law of God; yet because they will not Swear, and so break Christ's Commands, are they threatned, and their Windows shut up, and dispriviledged of their Trading, whereby they should maintain themselves and Families in the Creation; and this one thing tendeth to the Destruction of many, as in this World, and no little hurt will thereby grow to the whole Nation in a Generation of time; and it is required of you by the Lord to prevent these Sufferings, though many can fore-go their own Freedom in this World, and their Lives also, rather then break the least Com∣mand of Christ: and thus are many faithful People made a very Prey to their Enemies, and in divers manners it is brought forth upon them. For many also suffer deeply in the House of Correction for reproving Sin, and others are grievously spoiled in their Estates, because for Conscience sake they cannot pay to maintain a professed Minister, or uphold a Steeple-house; for it is a common thing, for a Priest to take (or have it done) Four or Five times so much by Di∣stress, as any way he can prove a pretended Due. And many other Sufferings there are, which are only for Conscience sake, as because some cannot put off a Hat to a Magistrate, or the like; which give an ill savour to the Government in which they are acted without Reproof. Ah my Friends! Be awakened to Justice and true Judgment, to relieve such unjust Sufferers, and to throw down all such hainous Oppressions and Oppres∣sors, that the Lord may yet make you and your Government blessed, after his Long-suffering to you, which hath been great; for Justice and true Judgment in a Government is the Happiness thereof, and the Foundation for a long conti∣nuance; and on the contrary, Cruelty, and Injustice, and Oppression being brought forth, the more is the Government unhappy and accursed, and the sooner will the Lord overthrow it, and bring it to a desolate End: And there∣fore my Friends, let this great Enemy to your Persons, Government, and whole Nation, to wit, Persecution for Conscience sake, be speedily removed, lest the Anger of the Lord break forth against you, and repentance be too late; for this know, In all Ages the Lord stretched forth his Hand, and in his time he quickly avenged himself for his People's sake, after their Innocent Sufferings, born by them for a season; and he is the same, and changeth not, and the same will he bring to pass. Therefore I say again, Be awakened, and let that dead∣ly Enemy be removed out of the Land, as you tender your own Safety and Ho∣nour, and the Glory of the Name of the Lord, and his People's Peace, even this very Enemy, to wit, Persecution for Conscience sake; for it doth and will ob∣struct all your good Purposes at Home and Abroad, it eats away the Affections of all good People from you, and it eats out your Strength and Valour, and it consumes the Weakness of all your Enemies; verily, it is an Enemy that will work your Destruction speedily, both in this World and in the World to come; that of God in you all shall witness me in the Day of the Lord. I am your Friend, and these things do I write as a Friend unto you, as to
warn you of that secret enemy, so much reigning and rebelling in this Nation, which indeed may work a greater Destruction upon you then any forreign Inva∣der, and this in time you may witness to your Grief and Sorrow, If something by you be not done to suppress it; all health and peace I wish unto you in the Lord; and thus far am I clear from the blood of you, and all men, come life or death. E B. The several Coppies of this were delivered to Oliver and his Counsel, in the 12th. Moneth, in the year 1657. To the Protector. Friend, THe Salutation of my life wisheth well unto thee in the Lord, and most especially that thy precious Soul may be redeemed out of death, to God, and live, that thou mayst have a Rest and Habitation in him, when this World is no more. Now whereas it is a general out-cry among the Teachers and People of this Nation, and also is doubted, and hath been sometimes objected by thy self, That the People called Quakers are Deluded and Deceived, and in Error, and such like: And now (if it be possible) that thy self and others may be resolved concern∣us; put therefore all thy Objections and Doubting into plain Positions, or let the wisest of thy Teachers do it for thee; and whatsoever thy self, or any for thee can object against us; or what thou doubtest of, or stumblest at, either in respect of our Doctrines or Practice, let the matter be stated in plain words, in Positions or Queries, and if God permit, a sufficient answer thou mayst re∣ceive, to remove all conscientious Scruples, and to confound all subtil Al∣ledgments and Evasions, whereby hereafter forever thou mayst be altogether inexcusable of all doubting or speaking against us, or suffering evil to be done or spoken against us upon that account: And this am I moved to give forth, and send to thee, that thou mayst be satisfied, and all things tried and made manifest in the sight of all men, and that all rash judgment, and false suppositi∣on, which lodgeth in the hearts of many, may be confounded and brought to nought; and let it be left off to cry out Deceivers, and Heresie, &c. and causing any to suffer upon suspition thereupon, but bring all things to light, and true Judgment, that what is proved to be the Truth may be owned, and not perse∣cuted any more, for we are willing to be made manifest to all men; and if any thing be objected against us, which may not be sufficiently answered and resol∣ved to sober men, then our Enemies are more free, and hath whereof to glory in against us: but and if all occasion of stumbling be removed by Answers ac∣cording to the Scriptures, and our Principles, Practices and Doctrines thereby vindicated, then let all the Teachers, and all our Adversaries shut their Mouthes from biting at us, and railing against us, and accusing of us to thee; and let thy Ear be shut from believing Lyes against the Innocent; and let none suffer in thy Dominion under the cruelty of men, upon such a ground; And hereof I shall be glad to receive an answer, and to joyn issue in this Cause; and in the mean time, and alwayes, am a Lover of thy Soul, but a witness against all Oppression. E. B. This was delivered to his hands at Hampton-Court, in the 4th Moneth, 1658.
For the Protector. Friends, Know that there is a God that doth whatsoever he will, all power is in his hand, and he bringeth to pass the Counsel of his own heart, and he rules in the kingdoms of men, and bringeth down and setteth up; he killeth and ma∣keth alive, and he changeth times and seasons and Governments, and bringeth to nought the counsels of men, for all power in Earth and in Heaven is in him; and all his doings are right, and his wayes are equal; and thou and all Mankind are as Clay in the hand of the Potter, he can honour and exalt as he pleaseth, and he can mar and break to pieces and dishonour whensoever he will, where∣fore be humble and low in heart before him, for he is the highest power that sub∣dueth all things under his feet; if he wound who can heal? and if he kill there is none can make alive; and know thou it is the Lord God Almighty that doth this; in whose hands are the Issues of life and death, and he it is who can break thee down, and build thee up, who can wound thee and restore thee, and bring thee to destruction, and say unto thee return; and to know him that doth this, belongs to thy eternal peace. Wherefore hearken thou to the Word of the Lord, that thy soul may come out of death, and live; and fear the Lord God, before whom thy heart is naked and bare; who can mould thee and change thee, and fulfill his pleasure upon thee, even according to his own will, and who shall say what doth he? and now come to consideration, and let thy heart be more upright before him, and chuse his way and counsel, that he may bless thee, and seek his face to behold his coun∣tenance, that thy soul may be satisfied by his Word, and the Milk of the Word may nourish thee unto life Immortal; and mind his pure presence which is life, even God with thee, Christ the Emmanuel to dwell with and walk in thee, which is the promise of the Father; and first come to the Principle of God, and feel the Word of God in thy heart, that will beat down the nature into which Temptations enter; and the Word will bring thee to war against and overcome all thy Enemies, which would defile thee, or betray thee; and it will bring thee to know a Birth Immortal born in thee, and a Crown Immortal received from God, that dies not, nor fades not away; and then he that rules over Hea∣ven and Earth will be thy Shepherd, to feed thee, and thy Teacher, to guide thee, and thy Counsellor, to direct thee in all things; and thy immortal Soul will be satisfied with the Bread that cometh down from Heaven, which the Fa∣ther giveth; and the Covenant of God, and the Mercies of David, that are sure, will be revealed, and his Promise fulfilled in thee, and Life and Immorta∣lity brought to Light through the Gospel, which is the Power of God, which destroyes and puts off, and confounds the first man and his knowledge; and wisdom, and his sin and righteousness, all which is in Transgression against the Life of God; and the Gospel the Power of God being received, it will raise up the Seed of God in thee, and bring thee to know the second Adam, the Image of the Father which the Devil hath nothing in, but he overcomes the Devil who hath been the Lamb Slain by Transgression, since the Foundation of the World; and he it is that comes out of death that must take away thy sin and destroy it, and cover thy nakedness, and create thee anew, and give thee acceptance in the Father whereby thy soul in him may be refreshed, and a habitation in him thou mayst have when this World is no more, and for this thou oughtest to wait above all things. And Friend, thou hast need of the Wisdom of God, which is from Heaven to guide thee in all thy affairs, that by it thou may be preserved from the will
of thine Enemies, and from all that hate thee; that their Eye may be blinded that watch for Evil, and their Wisdom and Policy confounded and brought to nought that hatch Mischief against thee. So feel a Measure of the Wisdom of God in thee, to guide thee in Dread and Authority, and thy Enemies will be afraid; for, to walk in the Fear of the Lord, and in his Wisdom and Autho∣rity, in Justice, Truth and Righteousness, that will make thee a greater Ter∣ror unto thy Enemies then all Worldly Policy and Craft; the Nations will over-reach thee, if thy strength be there; and if Judgment, Justice and Righ∣teousness be neglected by thee, how should the Lord Honour thee, and Defend thee? Nay, he will bring Dishonour, and give thee into the Will of thy Enemies: For want of Truth and just Judgment causeth the Land to Mourn, and her Peo∣ple to sit as a Widdow comfortless; wherefore love Judgment, Truth and Righ∣teousness, and walk therein, and thou wilt leave a Praise behind thee, and a Witness to other Ages, that thou hast served the Lord in thy Generation, and then thy Memorial shall never dye, nor thy Name come into Reproach among the Heathen. Wherefore let all Oppression be removed, and let the Just go free, and let Judgment and Righteousness run down, and be thou a Praise and a Blessing to all that do Well, and a Terror and a Dread to all the contrary. Arise, and stand up for the Lord, and he will give thee Strength and Victory, and will make thy Horn as Iron, and thy Hoof as Brass, to push down and tread under the high places of Idolatry, in all the apostatized Churches, both Papist, and o∣thers, out of the Life of the Apostles; and as thou comest into the Life the Apo∣stles were in, then thou wilt see and fathom over all this Profession of Christ, and all these Churches, that are without the Life of Christ, which are come up in the Apostacy; and as the Life of God ariseth in thee, thou wilt see who the false Prophets are, and Deceivers, which Christ Prophesied of should come, and Iohn saw were come in his dayes, which have over-spread the Nations; and these are they which have the Sheep's Clothing upon them, but inwardly they are Ra∣vening Wolves; and such are they, that will Flatter thee for great Benefices, and Places, and large Maintenances; they have Christ's words, and the Apostles words, the Sheep's Clothing, but they that put not into their mouthes, they will prepare War against them, and Raven upon them, and cast their Bodies into Prison, or spoil their Goods: And wilt thou bring thy Name into dishonour to all the Saints upon Earth, by defending of these in their Evil wayes? thou oughtest not to do it, nor to suffer the Innocent to be troden down, and destroyed, for denying such, and witnessing against them that are out of the Life of Christ; and a great Overthrow will the Lord make among those Teachers, and such a Ministry, that needs to be defended by carnal Weapons, and by Stocks, and Prisons, for such Teachers and Ministry are not of Christ, as is manifest; and as People have been scattered after them for Ages, so they shall again be gathered from them by the Spirit, to follow the Lamb whither soever he goes. And take heed these Teachers come not too near thee, neither put Confidence in them; for their hearts are not right before the Lord: and they will flatter thee, while they hatch Mischief against thee; but stand over them in the Domi∣nion of God: And if they sow Spiritual Things, let them reap Carnal by a Free Gift; and if they have Flocks, let them eat of the Milk-Freely given them; and if they have planted any thing, let them eat the Fruit, as it comes Freely; and be not thou cumbered about maintaining Ministers, but free thy self of that Burden; neither suffer innocent Men to be troden down, and de∣stroyed in their Persons and Estates, about the maintaining of such Teachers, which is become the grievousest Oppression in the Nation. And as concerning thy Family; Thou hast need of God's Wisdom to guide thee, that thou mayst Rule in God's Authority over all light, loose, proud, wanton, ungodly and deceitful Persons; take heed of such spirits, for they will be a Temptation to thee, to draw thee into Evil, and into the World, out from God: let no such be thy Companions, nor remain in thy House, lest they
betray thee with Flatteries and Honour, which perish; and such may profess much Love and great Duty in words, yet they being out of the Fear of the Lord, cannot be blessed unto thee in their Service. Wherefore Love such men, and let them be thy Companions, that Fear the Lord, and that are Solid, and Sober, and Upright, such as may be good Ex∣amples before thee, which will quench Evil, and not increase it in thee: and though such appear not in Flatteries towards thee, nor with a double mind; yet they will be Faithful to thee; and such will the Lord bless unto thee. And let no Drunkards, nor Covetous Evil-minded Persons, that seek them∣selves, and not the Lord, have place with thee; for they will be a Dishonour to thee, and bring the Curse into thy Family. And love such as make Conscience of their Words and Wayes, and be not an Oppressor of the Tender Consciences of any; but let the Lord be Ruler there, both in thy self, and in all thy Family: And be of a Pittiful Tender Mind and Spirit towards Strangers, and all People; and be Kind and Long∣suffering towards all, yet let Justice reach to all Transgressors; and be an Ex∣ample to all in Authority under thee: And let not Evil and Cruel-hearted Men bear any Place; for such render thee and thy Government Dishonourable, and by such the Land is filled with Violence, and the Just Mourn, whereby the Blessing is kept r away, and the Curse near, ready to dvour. Now Friends if thou comest to be guided by the Spirit, and with the Wis∣dom of the Father, then thou wilt bring the Nations into good Order, where∣by the Inhabitants may live in Peace and perfect Freedom, from all Oppressi∣ons and Vexations, that now are a Bondage upon the Just and Upright; for there is great Corruption entred into all places, and all forts of men; and when the Lord toucheth thy Heart, and maketh thee rightly sensible of all things, as they now stand, then thou wilt see the Ministry (as now it stand∣eth) to be quite degenerated from what the Ministry of Christ was in the dayes of the Apostles, before the Apostacy; and as it now standeth, there is much of it which is to be thrown down to the Ground, and crushed to pieces; for it is corrupted altogether, even in the way of its setting up, and in its Call, and in the way of its Maintenance, and Practice; in all these things it is corrupted and degenerated from what the Ministry of Christ was before the Apostacy: and this may be proved by the Scriptures; and so it is not to be upholden by thee, but to be corrected, and thrown down the rather. And likewise in Magistracy, thou wilt see great Corruption entred, and aboundance to be purged out; for it is much degenerated from the state as it was ordained of God; and in the Laws there is much to regulate and cor∣rect; when thou comest to the Principle of God in thee, if ever that arise i thee, it will bring thee to thresh down, and trample down all unjust men, that handle the Law; and all such, that judge for Gifts and Rewards; and all such Lawyers, that devour the Innocent for Gifts, that will not plead the Cause of the Poor without great Fees; and all the Priests, that preach for Hire; and the Teachers, that teach for filthy Lucre, and to get Gain; all such men will be counted as Bryars and Thornes by thee, to be plucked up by the Roots, and to be cut up as Evil Trees, which cumber the Ground; for such do corrupt the Land, and cumber it; and if ever the Lord doth arise in thee, he will reward them by thee according to their wayes, whose wayes are corrupt before the Lord. Be thou faithful in what the Lord calleth thee to, and thou shalt have thy Reward; and seek his Honour, and he will Honour thee; and let thy mind e to the Lord in all things, and feel his Word, and Power, and Presence in
thee, to quench all that which is contrary, and then thou wilt be blessed in this life, and in the Life to come; but if thou continuest  thy Oppression, the Lord will suddenly smite thee. By a Friend unto thee in the Lord, E B. This was given to Oliver Cromwell his hands at Hampton-Court, in the Sixth Moneth, 1658. about a Moneth before his Death. This is for the Protector's Kindred, his VVife and Children; to be read soberly by them in the Fear of the Lord. FRIENDS, Emember, that by the Lord you were raised from a low state, and when he will, he can abase you, and bring you down; he gave you the Palace of ces, and threw out them before you. Remember this every one of you, and come to the Witness of God in , and be humble, and meek, and lowly, and let the Lord's Fear be in your , and be of a tender Spirit, having your minds exercised in Purity, in Ho∣li and in Righteousness; and exalt not your selves, nor be lifted up in our , in the Pride, and Vain-glories, and Honours of this World, lest the Lord  you down, and make your Name and Posterity a Reproach, as he hath done any before you; and if you walk in the same steps, and do the same things, and  guilty of the same Abominations, and suffer the Children and Servants of the Lord to be persecuted (as ny are at this day, some until Death) shall the Lord spare you? nay, he will cause you to feel his Hand of Judgment, and bring you down with Sorrow, and he will vex you in his Wrath, and smie you with his Rod more and more, till you learn his Fear, and depart from all your ; and the Lord will deface your Glory, and pull down your Crown; and  will make you know, that he i Lord, that doth whatsoever he will. Wherefor humble your selves under the Hand of God, and search your own hearts, and cast out the Abomination that vex the Spirit of the Lord; and suf∣ not the People of the Lord's precious Flock to be devoured, and made a Prey  the Wicked; for because of this, the Rod of Affliction cometh upon you, and y suddenly break you to pieces: but mind the Seed of God in you, which is oppressed, and wait to know the. Power of the Lord, which will redeem you out of Sin and Death, and reconcile you to God, and bring you into Fellowship wi himself, to enjoy Peace and Rest for your Souls, that you may be made Heirs of the heritance of an Endless Life; and this would make you truly Honourable,  ll be more Satisfaction to you, and Joy, and Content, and true Rejoycing,  all Worldly Crowns and Worldly Glories, which will waste, and consume away, and leave you miserable: And remember that you are now warned from the  God, by who I am ved to write this unto you, in dea and tender Love to you all; and one day you shall witness it. And as concerning the Quakers (so called) who are accounted as vile in the Sight of men, and are ast out of all Power and Place in the Nation, being de∣spised of all, and also are reproached, persecuted and imprisoned, and all man∣ner of Evil and Injustice unrighteously done and spoken against them (by wick∣ and corrupt men in Authority) yet are they the Children and Servants of the Living God, and greatly beloved of him, and are as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye, and his Power and Presence is with them; and the time is at hand,
that the Lord will make their Persecutors fall, and their Enemies bow and trem∣ble, though now they suffer unjustly, and are trodden down, as not deserving a Place on the Earth; yet it is for Righteousness sake; and because they shew forth the Image of the Father, and not for Evil-doing; and will not their Sufferings lie upon you? for many Hundred have suffered cruel and great things, and some the loss of Life (though not by, yet in the name of the Protector) and about a Hundred, at this present day, lie in Holes, and Dungeons, and Prisons, up and down the Nation; and some at this time are Sick, nigh unto Death, whose Suf∣ferings y for Vengeance, and the Lord heareth the Cry: Wherefore save your selves, and let the Innocent be delivered, and the cruel Bonds of Oppression broken, and the Exercise of a pure Conscience go free, without Persecution; and then the Lord will  away his Anger, and cease to smite you with his Rod; which bath been upon you, and he will give you Peace, and make you blessed, if you come to be leá by his Spirit into all Truth. And though these Innocent Lambs of Christ suffer thus under this present Power, yet are they not Enemies to you, but are Friends to your Persons and Families,  pitty you, and love you, and desire well for you in the Lord, that you may ∣pent, and be healed, and even that your Hearts may be opened to receive Refresh∣ments to your Souls; and that you may be established in Righteousuess and Tr over all your Enemies, and may not be confounded, nor your Posterity brought  reproach, which is hastening upon you; and though our Love be despised, and  accounted hateful in your sight, and looked upon with Derision, yet we   things in Patience, truly desiring your Returning and Repentance, and  yo Destruction: But if these doleful Suffering of the Lord's poor Lambs be continued by this present Power, it will destroy you, and undo you, and break you, and confound ;  the Lord will not cease to smite you with his Rod of sharp Rebukes; and he will   know, his People's Cause shall not be unpunished. Oh Did you ut know▪ ho H∣dreds have and do suffer! how the Bodies of some have been tortured by Stocks and cruel Whippings! and how some lie Sick in stinking Holes and , on the Ground, or a little Straw at best; Ten, or often more in a Priso to∣gether, and sometimes their own Friends n suffered to come to visit th  Necessaries! Oh, Did but your Eyes behold, or your Hearts perceive the great∣ness of the Cruelty, which some of the Lord's dear Servants, and your faithful Friends, undergo; it would make your hearts ake, and your spirits to tremble! and all this is done in the Name, and under the Authority of (Protector) there∣fore how should the Lord but lay it to your charge, and afflict him and h Fami∣ly? He will make you know, there tt a God, tt can do whatsoever he will, and that Life and Death are in his Hands, and all Creatures are as Clay in the Hand of the Ptter; and be rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and pulleth down one, and setteth up another, according to his Pleasure: but if the Love of God be with-holden from you, it is because of Disobedience to him, and your Transgression. Wherefore be obe∣dient to him, and love his Wayes and Judgments, that he may make you more happy with a Crown Immortal, that never fades away. And remember once more the Lord hath warned you, by a Friend unto you in the Lord, Written the 1st day of the 7th Mo∣neth, called September, 1658. Edward Burroughs. Copies of this were delivered to divers of his Children and Kindred the day before he Dyed.
To thee Richard Cromwel (called) Protector of these Nations, is this moved of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth to be written, for thy Instruction, from Him. THere is a Great, and Mighty, and Innumerable People come and coming up out of Egypts Land, travelling towards the Land of Rest, promised of the Lord  them, to be obtained and enjoyed by them; and they do, and have sojouned Strangers in these Nations (over whom thou are called to Rule, and appointed ief Governour) this seven years; and greatly are and have they been afflicted and oppressed, and even trodden down through unjust Judgment and unrigh∣ Dealing, by the Rulers and Inhabitants of the Land; and all the dayes of thy Father, the late Protector, they were held in great Captivity and Bon∣dage, and unrighteous men made them a Prey, and laid heavy Yoaks of cruel Srings upon them, and daily increased their Task; and something thy Fa∣ther did for them in their Journey of great Distress, yet but a little of what the Lord required of him, and what the Lord looked for that he might have done; for Per was in his hands, given him of the Lord, but he was not fully obedi∣; and therefore was the Lord's Hand stretched out somewhat against him,  his Family, and he was smitten of the Lord, and suddenly taken away in Judgment; for he hearkened not to the Counsel of the Lord concerning that People, neither did fully relieve them from Oppression; but slighted many War∣ from the Lord, and the Day of his Visitation passed over, and Death took  away in Disobedience, while this People were yet under great Oppressions; for he left above a hundred of them in Prisons, unjustly suffering for right eousness sake, and not for Evil-doing; and in this he fulfilled not the Will of God, but left his Name and Glory somewhat stained because of these things; and though the Lord chose him, and shewed Love unto him, & gave him Power over his Enemies, and made him an Instrument in his Hand to break down great Oppressions; yet he was not obedient to the end, to do my Will, saith the Lord; but left something one, which he was truly called unto. Now this innumerable People, that is come and coming up, as aforesaid, are them called Quakers, and this Egypts Land, is that great Darkness, Ignorance, and Wickedness, and false Wayes and worships in the Apostacy, and fleshly bondage to sin and death, which all the World, and Kindreds, and Multitudes that are unconverted to God live and walk in; and that Land of Rest promised, to which they travel, is, the peace∣able and quiet dwelling with the Lord, free from the heavy oppression of Sin and Iniquity and cruelties of men, and free in the exercise of their pure Consciences by the Spirit of the Lord, as it shall move and lead them into all Truth; and their sojourning as Strangers, is, their denying and despising the World, and all its glories, and walking in the daily Cross of Christ, whereby they are crucified to the love, and respect, and renown, and honours of the world, and are come t of Kindreds, Tongues and People, counting the reproach for Christ great Riches; not respecting men, but the Lord altogether in all things, and also their suffering unrighteously false imprisonment, and spoiling of their goods for Righ∣teousness sake; this is their sojourning as Strangers: And that something that thy Father did for them, is, he released many of them divers times out of Pri∣fons, where they were unjustly cast, and he signified sometimes his displeasure against them that made them suffer, and shewed love to them in hearing their Innocent Cause, with some respect thereunto; and that which he
did not, which he might have done, is, He took not away Tythes, that Cause of great Oppression to many; nor the Unrighteous Laws wholy, as he ought to have done, and as the Lord required of him, And know thou from the Lord, That this same People are the People of the Lord, and beloved of him, and as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye, and his Presence is with them, and he leads them as a Flock by his Spirit into all Truth; and who shall Bless them, shall be Blessed; but he that acts against them shall not prosper, but be smitten of the Lord; for their Cause will the Lord plead in his Judgments, and avenge them of their Enemies, and the Dread of the Lord God shall fall heavy upon the heads of their Persecutors; and though they are hated of all men, and under great Afflictions, yet are they a Just People, and Innocent, seeking the Good of all men, and are Peaceable towards all, and receiving all manner of Wrongs, and Evil, and Speakings against them by Ungodly Men, but they render to no man Evil for Evil, but bless them that curse, and do good to their Enemies, and bear all things from all men in Long-suffering and Patience; for they are learned in the Practices (in doing and suffering) of the Holy Apo∣stles and Prophets, and are of the Seed of Abraham, who was the Friend of God; and they were thy Father's Friends, and are not Enemies to thee, nor to righteous Government, but wish well unto thee in the Lord, and that thou mayst not be destroyed in Wickedness, but be established in Righteousness and Peace in thy Government, to rule in God's Authority over all Wicked Men, that may seek thy hurt: And we desire for thee, that the Lord may give thee Wisdom, and a perfect Understanding, and the Spirit of just and sound Judgment, to judge Righ∣teously in all things, and to settle the Government in true Judgment, that the Principle of God in every man may answer to it, in defending & preserving, and protecting all that walk in Truth & Righteousness, & being a Terror to all Evil∣doer; for, for that end is Rule and Government ordained of God amongst men, to be a Praise to all that do Well, and a Terror to all that do Evil. And now the Lord having suffered it to be brought to pass, that thou art set up in thy Father's stead, to be chief Ruler amongst men, this the Lord God Almighty requires of thee, as thou hopest to prosper, and be blessed in this Life, and to enjoy Life Eternal when this World is passed away; and this is the Word of the Lord God unto thee, Be Humble, Meek, and Lowly in Heart, and exalt not thy own Horn, nor seek not this World's Honour, but seek the Lord with thy whole Heart; and let Justice, and true Judgment, and Righteous Government (which is ac∣cording to the Law of God) be set up, and exalted in the Nations; and come to know in thy self the Dominion and Authority of the Lord God over Sin and Transgression, and to keep down and condemn all that which is contrary to God in thy own Heart, and that will make thee a Dread and a Terror to Men and Nations; and then the Lord will be thy Crown, and his People will rejoyce in thee, and lift up their Hearts to God for thee: If thou throwest down and abolishest all Unrighteous Laws and Decrees, which have been set up in the days of Ignorance, and yet stand, whereby the Lord's dear Children are afflicted and oppressed at this day; and establishest such a Government, which is justly according to God, in which Righteousness and Truth, Justice and true Judgment may run down; and all the contrary may be stopped, and chained, and limited, and confounded; and then that which thy Father let undone the Lord will fulfil through thee: And doing these things, the Lord would make thee truly Honourable; and Happy and Blessed in this life, and in the Life to come; but in doing the contrary, the Lord will make thee a Curse, and take thee away in his Judgments, and thy Name shall be left a Reproach to A∣ges forever: And if thou Rulest in Oppression and Cruelty, and suffer∣est the Innocent to be Destroyed for want of True Judgment, then shall thy Dayes be Fewer then thy Father's; if thou be Disobedient to him, the Lord shall cut thee off, and thy Memorial shall Ro; and this is the Word of the Lord God to thee.
And as for this Afflicted and Sojourning People, They desire nothing to thee, but Truth, and Peace, and Righteousness; and no more of thee, but Justice and true Judgment, and that they and their little Ones, which to them are brought forth, may sojourn in Peace, and quietly pass through the Nations, till they come to the Land of Promise; and they may not carry of the Glory nor Riches of this World with them, nor seek great Places of Honour from thee; nor be hurtful to thee, nor the People, nor to Mankind in their sojourning; only what the Lord Commands them, that they must do; and what he forbids, that they must not do: For they have chosen the Lord to be their Leader, and to give him their Obedience in all things; and thy Government, so far as it is ac∣cording to God, they will not destroy, nor rebel against, but are true Friends thereunto, and subject in all things: And if thou walkest with the Lord, and chusest him for thy Councellor, and abasest thy self, and altogether exalt him and preserve his People, that fear him, then shalt thou prosper, and thy Name shall be greater then was thy Father's, and the Numberless Number of this (now) distres∣sed People will be unto thee a Strength, and stand by thee in thy Day of Trou∣ble, and defend thee and thy just Government, and their hearts shall cleave to thee, and thou shalt prosper for their sakes, and none of thy Enemies shall have power over the, to Destroy thee, though many may seek for thy life. Wherefore, my Friend, Awake, awake, and now consider, The Day of thy Visitation is present, and thy Father's is past; and now thou hast a time to gain unto thy self Everlasting Honour and Renown, or otherwise to leave thy Name a Curse and a Reproach for evermore: Do thou hearken to the Voice of the Lord, and fear his Dreadful Name, and bow before our God, that made Hea∣ven and Earth, who rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and pulleth down one, and setteth up another at his Pleasure, and as he will; and he will make thee know, that he lives and reigns over all, and doth whatsoever he will; and if he smites thee, none shall heal thee; and if he wounds thee, none shall comfort thee: Therefore take him for thy Councellor, and beware of the wicked Counsels of men; for thou hast may Enemies, and they would rejoyce to see thy Fall; and if the Lord be not on thy side, thou canst not long stand; but if thou be obedi∣ent to him, and preservest his People, and breakest down all Oppression, then thy Enemies shall fall, and thy Foot shall tread them down, and the Ter∣ror of the Lord shall be upon all that hate thee; but thus shall it be done unto thee, if thou be disobedient to him, and rejectest his Counsel by his Servant. I am thy Friend, and a Lover of thy Soul, and seek thy Happiness in this World, and in the World to come; known to many by the name of, Edward Burroughs. The Original of this was delivered to him a few dayes after he was proclaimed Protector.
To thee Richard Cromwel, chosen to be Protector, and chief Magistrate Governour of these Na∣tions of England, Scotland and Ireland; a faithful Presentation and Salutati∣on, by a Servant of the Church. WE are rightly and truly sensible in all things of the Mighty Hand of the Lord God, who brings all things to pass by his own Power, and according to his Will; and in Heaven and Earth, and over the Kingdoms of men he ruleth and reigneth; he buildeth up, and breaketh down; he planteth, and plucketh up; and he pulleth down one, and setteth up another: and who may say, What dost thou? or, Why dost thou it? for he is a Great God, and Mighty, and his Majesty is terrible: and all things in Heaven and Earth, and all the Sons of Men, are at his disposure, whose Dominion is from Everlasting to Everlasting; and he may be feared, and had in Reverence by all Creatures that have Life and Breath. And in particular, we are sensible of his Great and Mighty Power, who hath of late Years, in these Nations, once and again overturned, and overthrowed, and changed at his Pleasure Times, and Powers, and Authorities, and Domi∣nions; and he hath brought down the Mighty from their Seats, and stained the Crowns and Glories of the Honourable, and broken the Stout-hearted, and the Oppressors of their Governments as Potsherd, one against another, and made the Highest of Men of no respect before him; for he hath pulled down and set up whom he would, according to his Will; and in all these things hath his Hand been the very Doer and Accomplisher thereof, that he might be known and feared amongst all people through the whole Earth, who is the Dread and Terror of Men and Nations. And as for thy Father, the late Protector, Great things and Honourable did the Lord do for him, in raising him up, and casting out his Enemies before him, and giving him Victory, and Power, and Renown through Nations; and we know the Lord shewed Favour to him, and gave him Strength, Wisdom and Valour, and a right Spirit: and he was called of God into that great Work, to subdue the grievous Cruelty, once ruling over tender Consciences; and to break down the great Oppressions, which for Ages had caused the Just to groan; and the Lord was with him in Victory, and went before him, and was his Defence, and preserved him from great Dangers, and from the Wills of all his Enemies, and made him prosperous against them all: but yet we know (to say no more of him) He did not wholy fulfil the Will of the Lord, nor the Work which he begun; but became Disobedient, and abused his great Delive∣rances and Authority; and did not set free the Oppressed altogether, but left Mountains of Oppression, and grievous Yoaks of Bondage unbroken down, and unsubdued; and the Lord smote him, and took him away in Judgment because thereof. And as for thee, who art now set up in his stead, We certainly believe, that the Hand of the Lord is in this matter, if but to try thee, and it is he that hath brought it to pass, not expected by any, nor much sought after by thy self, but
its  to pass, a thing out of and contrary to the Thoughts and Expations of the whole Nations, art thou attained to this Place of nment; and there∣fore we must acknowledge something of the great Hand of God in it, being come to pass as out of due season, yet may the Lord make it seanable, and we patient∣ly wait to receive what the Lord brings to pass thereby, knowing that thou art in the Hand of the Lord, to do whatsoever he will with thee, and conceing thee: And if thou fearest him, and walkest with him, and chusest him for thy Councellor, and art obedient to him, and seekest his Glory alone, and not thy own Honour and Greatness, then the Lord will do great things for thee, and by thee; and accomplish his own Work through thee, whi fell in thy father's hands, and thou wilt be blessed, and renowned, and honoured for∣ever, and thy Name shall be had in respect in Generations to come, and here∣by the present thoughts of many shall be confounded: but if thou dost harden thy eart against God; and live cruelly, and neglect his Cause, and despise his Name  Honour, and seek thy own renown, and oppress the Just in thee and without thee, and suffer the Poor to groan under the Cruelty and Burden of Oppres∣sing Men and Laws in thy Government, without relief from thee, and go on  Authority, as some evil men before thee, then shalt thou not pros∣, but the Lord shall bring thee down, and lay his Hand of Judgment upon thee; and thy Name shall be a Reproach to the Saints forever, and the hea∣vy  of Vengeance shall be upon thee, and pursue thee more then any before thee; and the Lord will deliver his People by another way: and this is not in Flattery and Feignedness to thee; but as the Lord lives, our God shall  to pass in his day, and thou shalt be the Witness. Wherefore O man, seek the Face of the Lord, and enquire diligently of him, and hear his Word, that thy Soul may live; and feel a measure of his Spirit in thee, to lead thee into all Truth, and set his Presence before thy Eyes alwayes, to direct thy steps, that he may bless thee with Power, Wis∣, Authority and Dominion, to perform the Duty of thy Place faithful∣ towards the Lord and all Men, as he requireth of thee: And if thou  kest the Kingdom of God, and its Righteousness, and the Reconci∣liation between the Lord and thee, and comst to feel the Elect Seed of God raised up over all the contrary in thee, and Transgression, and thy own Will and Affections, and that which is of the Flesh in thee, judged and condem∣ned by the Word in the Heart, which maketh the immortal Soul to live, and e refred in God, and the Heir of the Promise of God born in ; and hereby shalt thou have an Assurance and Hope of Life Eternal, to rest in perfect Peace with God when this World is no more, but passed away ith thee; and also, in this present time, Wisdom, and Valour, and true Nobility shall be added to thee; and the Spirit of Power and Dominion, to ke Men and Nations be afraid, and fear; and all Evil Men, and such   the hurt of thee and thy Government, ll be blasted, and confound∣; and all Good Men be encouraged, and made strong, and the whole Na∣ kept in Peace and Unity; and the Truth and Peace of God shall here∣ ourish amongst us, to the Honour of the Eternal God, and to thy Re∣, if thou rulest and governest for him, and by his Spirit, and Au∣thority. And we are truly sensible of the great Charge of this Place, and also of the multitude of Perplexities and Dangers to thy self, occurring and happening thereby; Dangers from open Enemies, by their Malice and cruel Plots; and Dangers from thy pretended Friends, and they of thy own House, by secret Surmngs; Dangers in Martial and Civil Affairs in this Nation, and abroad: so that we certainly believe, Nothing, save only the Wisdom of God and his Power, can preserve thee, and carry thee to go through, and faithfully fulfil so great a Place, and to discharge it truly in the Sight of God, and Just Men; neither mayest thou be defended and preserved by any other Means,
from the wills and plots and envy of evil men, who may watch for evil against thee, to destroy the and blot out thy Name, and thy Father's Posterity out of the Land. Wherefore take hee to thy self, and fear God, that he may bless thee; for this is a subtil and crafty Generation, and the Nations are politick, and the In∣habitants thereof are wise and deceitful, over whom thou art set, and with whom thou hast to deal: Therefore beware of men; for many may seek after thy hurt, and some may flatter thee, and shew seeming great respect unto thee, and profess great Service of Love to thee in the Nations, and in thy Family, for a season, till their own Ends of Advantage be accomplished, and may in the very time hatch Evil against, and secretly invent to uncover thy Nakedness, and betray thee; for many men are Treacherous: but thou receiving a Measure of the Wisdom of God, it will guide thee over all such, and thou wilt see into the hearts and spirits of men; and to discern between Love Unfeigned, which will seek thy good, and not self, and that Love which is feigned,, which will flatter thee, and blind thy Judgment, and lead thee in∣to Snares; and such as will the least flatter thee, will be the most true to thee: So beware, and let not vain Flatteries, and Proud Ambitious and ungodly Self-seeking Men, nor Drunkards, nor Covetous, nor Politick and Deceitful men and spirits have any place in thy Heart, nor in thy House, nor in Places of Authority and Trust in thy Government; for such men will be a Snare unto thee, and a Dishonour to thee, and the cause of God's Wrath and Curse against thy Person, Family, and whole Nations; for such men God will not bless, nor thee nor the Government for their sakes; and this thou wilt find tr one day. Therefore chuse unto thee such men as fear God, who are Just, and Humble, and Upright-hearted, who are Sincere and Faithful to the Lord, who have the Wisdom of God, and true nobility of Spirit, in Righteousness and Simplicity, free from the Prophaneness of this evil World; let such be thy Companions, to wait upon thy Person, and to Govern and Rule in thy Fami∣ly and Nations; and let such be put in Trust, who will not be Treacherous; for such are Blessed, and will be a Blessing to thee and the whole Government: And we know, that the Lord gives respect and regard to the Upright, that fear his Name, and such he will accomplish his Work by, to thy Renown, and the Peace and Happiness of the Nations; more then to Craft and Policy, and the Wisdom and Subtilty of this World; for thereby the Lord will never fulfil his Work, nor prosper a Ruler, nor his People; and if thy Strength and Defence be there, and not in the Lord, and his pure Wisdom only, thou canst not prosper; but the Nations and Men will over-reach thee, and beguile thee, and thou canst not be Happy, nor thy Government be kept in Peace: but a little measure of the Fear, and Power, and Wisdom of the Lord God from Heaven in thy Heart, and amongst such as are thy Councello to guide you and govern you, will be of more value and worth unto thee,  thy Place and Condition, then all Worldly Policy, and Wisdom, and Craft, which with God is not regarded, nor of him ever blessed. And if thou deny▪ est the Lord, and Righteous Men; and chusest thy own way, and this World's Wisdom, that's from below, then thy Trust and Strength shall pierce thee, and make thee feeble, and of all others thy state will be the most miserable, if tho be given into the policy and deceits of treacherous men; so be wise, and seek the Lord, that he may be thy trust, and put not confidence in vain man, whose heart is deceitful, and desperately wicked. And as concerning the condition of these Nations, they are in a broken state, much divided, and diverse in Judgments, and far out of good Order; for there is much Corruption and Abuse in all Orders and Places of men, and much to be purged out and judged, both in Magistracy and Ministry, before Righteousness, Peace and Truth, Union, Joy and Faithfulness can embrace one another, amongst the Inhabitants of the Nations; for both are in a Di∣version
and Degeneration from what they were at the first ordained of God, and this I could clearly manifest unto thee; for the Nations are but newly come out of Popery, having put off but part of the Dress of that polluted Whore, and the Garments of Professions in Religion yet smell thereof, as not being throughly purged from her abominable Idolatries and Superstitions, as thou mayst see when the Lord opens thy eye to view the present state of all things. As for Magistracy, It was ordained of God to be a Dread, and Terror and Limit to all Evil-doers, and to be a Defence and Praise to all that do well; to condemn the Guilty, and to justifie the Guiltless; but the Exercise thereof at this day in these Nations is degenerated, and some that are in Authority are greatly corrupted, and regard not the Just and Pure Law of God, to judge on∣ly thereby; but oppress the Poor by Injustice, and subvert the good Laws of God and Men to a wrong End and Use, abusing Authority, and turning the Sword against the Just, whereby true Judgment is turned backward, and the Innocent made unjustly to suffer for Righteousness sake, through the Corrupti∣on of men in Authority; and didst thou but know what we know in this parti∣cular, it would pierce thy heart; Why? It is frequent amongst some of the Judges and Magistrates, To commit a Man to Prison, and impose some great Fine up∣on him, d to cast him into a Dungeon, or Hole, among Thieves and Murderers, for a long season, for no other Offence, or Breach of any Law, but because he cannot put off his Hat  th, and respect their Persons, by bowing the H or Knee: And many others, that fear God, and for Conscience sake cannot Swear upon a Book, by kissing it, and laying hand upon it, because Christ saith, Swear not at all; though they deny not to speak and do the Truth in all things, as in the Presence of God and all men: and many others, that because they are moved to cry against Sin, and declare against the Iniquities of the Times in Teachers, Rulers and People, that highly a∣bound, perhaps in a Market, or Steeple-house, or High-way, or other Places, as thy are moved of God: and many others, because for Conscience sake they cannot pay Tythes, nor give Money and Wages to maintain a Priest, or false Teacher, that they receive no profit by; or to maintain a Steeple-house, where the world worships in vain Traditions, and not in the Spirit and Power of God: and many have been ta∣ken out of peaceable Meetings, where they were waiting upon the Lord, and soe out of their Inns and Friends Houses; and many have been taken on the way, tra∣velling about their lawful Occasions; and some from their Callings and Labours; and for these causes, through the envy of wicked men, and without any just Convicti∣on of the Breach of any Law, or any lawful Tryal, or Examination, have Hundreds of just men being wholy Innocent, been sent to Prison, and laid many Moneths, and some for Years, or whipt, or put in the Stocks, and grievously abused by cruel Exe∣cutioners of wicked mens envy and injustice; and upon such grounds only, and for such causes mentioned, and without the transgression of any just Law, have and do at this day many Hundreds of faithful Subjects suffer hard and cruel things, long and sort prisonment, and cruel and sharp Whipping, and Stocking, and unjust Banishment out of Towns and Cities; yea, Friend, its hard to be expressed, and large to be de∣clared, how many of the Lord's Servants do, and have suffered great Inju∣stice in these Nations, through the abuse of good Government, and Dege∣neration of Magistracy, from its perfect state and place, whereunto it was Ordained of God in the Beginning. And moreover, Great have been the Abuses, by Striking, and Beating, and Haling, and Kickings, and Re∣vilings, and Reproaching, whereby many have suffered Unrighteously, and not relieved nor defended by such in Authority as ought to have done it, nei∣ther the Evil-Doers at all corrected and punished as they ought to have been, though known to men in Power; and thus it is happened to us in our Age, Well-Doers are punished as Transgressors, and Evil-Doers go free; and thus its manifest, Magistracy and Governors, Rulers and Laws, are greatly de∣generated and subverted from what they ought to be according as the Lord ordained them; for all this may be proved particularly; so that the Nations are
out of good Order, and the state of government and rule degenerated, and men in Authority and Places of Trust corrupted, not being in their own hearts ruled by the Spirit of the Lord, and therefore they cannot rule for him among men justly and righteously, as he requires: And also, so great hath been the Degeneration of Go∣vernment in these Nations of late years, That many faithful and just Men that have been in great Places of Trust, both in Martial and Civil Affairs, through the Envy and Evil-surmising of others, have been turned out of all Place & Power, & not suffered to give their Iudgment amongst men; but been cast off, as unprofitable, though no Evil could be charged against them; whereby the Lord hath been offended▪ But all things and places, of men must be new moulded, and corrected, and purged, and regenerated, that true Judgment may flourish, and Righteousness and Truth prosper, as in the Be∣ginning; and this will the Lord suddenly bring to pass by his own Power; and if thou opposest it, thou shalt not prosper, but be cut off, and taken out of the way: For the Spirit of the Lord hath been provoked to Wrath, because of these things, and his Anger is kindled against the Nations; and he hath overthrown, and yet will once more overthrow, till he comes, whose Right it is to Rule, whose shall be the Government and Kingdom, and all his Enemies shall be slain. And as for the publick Ministry, as now it is in its present estate, we cer∣tainly know, and testifie from the Lord unto thee, and to the whole Nations, that it is not the same Ministry of Christ which the Apostles had, nor by the same Pow∣er and Spirit; but is wholy degenerated in Call, in Practice, and in Maintenance, and in all things, from what the Ministry of Christ was in the dayes of the true Churches, before the Apostacy: and it is, as now it stands, in degeneration, not of God, nor in the Power and Spirit of Christ Jesus, nor hath it the same End and Effects as the Ministry of Christ once had; but its tasted and tainted with the Spirit of Antichist, which long hath ruled in the World, and its become a grievous Oppression in the Nations; and people are not converted, nor turned to God from their evil wayes, but remain unprofited: and to say no more of it, though much I might say, what I affirm of it I may prove by the Scriptures against the wisest of them before thee, if thou pleasest, viz. That as now the Ministry stands, it is not perfectly the same Ministry the Apostles had, but is degenerated from what the Mi∣nistry of Christ was in the dayes of the Apostles and true Churches, before the Apostacy; and if ever God toucheth thy heart, thou wilt see it so; when the Spirit of Christ is chief Judge in thee, thou wilt witness this to be true; and then may not thy Power uphold any thing which is contrary to God, when Government is pur∣ged, and made pure from all its present Degeneration. Again, There are many and divers sort of Sects, and Gatherings of People, and Professions in Reliigion of several contrary Judgments, and Opinions & Worships in these Nations; and these People, over whom thou art set to rule, are divers, and divided in their Wayes, and Minds, and Professions of Religion; some look∣ing for, and seeking after Christ, in such a manner; and others after another manner; all crying, Loe here is Christ, and thus he will come; and loe he is there, and so will he appear; and some are inventing and supposing such a Government to be best, and others contrary to that; and many are (as) distracted in their thoughts, not knowing what to seek, or what to look after; some are for such a Govern∣ment and Religion, and others for another; and peradventure each one of these may seek to thee for Protection against such as oppose them, commending and justifying their own Way, and Sect, and Form, and Religion against all others, and craving Laws to maintain themselves, and their Sect; and to stop and limit all other Ways, as Heresie, because differing from them; and they will each of them turn and rest the Scriptures from the mind of the Spirit that gave them forth, to prove their own Opinions and Professions to be right, against all others; but now thou mayst know, that the Scriptures were given forth by the one Spirit of God, and is the Testimony of one Truth, of one Saviour, of one true Worship, and one only true Religion, and not many and diverse Wayes, and them that are of divers Judgments, and Worships and Religions, and yet all plead Proof
from the Scriptures for what they profess and practice: all such pervert the Scriptures, and wrest them, who are thus divided and unsettled in Religion; and they shew, that none of them have the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, which Spirit leads into all Truth, and in it is the true Worship of God, and the true Profession and Practice of true Religion, and that Spirit only understands its own words in Scripture; but all these divers Sects, and Heaps of People that are divided in Worship, and about Religion, have not the Spirit of God, that gave forth Scriptures, to lead them into all Truth, and guide them in the perfect Way, and pure Religion, which the Apostles and Churches of Christ were in, in their dayes; but all these many Sects, that are thus divided, are risen up since the days of the Apostles, and are of another spirit, and of a false Religion. And as for such called Ministers, they will be hurrying about thee, and flattering thee with fair and crafty words, and smooth Petitions and Requests, for Protection and Esta∣blishment from thee, and for large Maintenance, and Stipends and Tythes; and possibly they may complain to thee against such as cannot give them Hre and Tythes, but may reprove their Evil, and Covetousness, and Wickedness; begging for Laws against such, and crying out against Error & Herisie, because some may be mov'd to cry against their Deceits & Oppressions; and for the like causes they will run about thee, and seek their own Advantage; and this we know, their nature and spirit is such, and hath been for many Ages. But now Friend, Do thou stand in God's Authority; out of, and over all such Teachers and Sects, and come not under any of them that have the Form of God∣liness, but want the Power, who are in the Apostacy, from the Life and pure Re∣ligion, that the Apostles were in; nor believe them not that shall say, Lo Christ is rt, or, Lo he is there; or, Who shall ascend to fetch him from without? or, When shall be come from far to save his People? Go not thou after any of these, but he arken to the Word of God in thy heart, and know that Christ is within thee, else thou art reprobate; neither do thou take in hand to exalt any one of these Sects, or some of them above others; neither defend & maintain any of them against others of them, nor tollerate not one of them above another; for if thou dost, it will betray thee, and the Nations Peace, and set all spirits on Fire about thee; and while one is pleased, and may pray for thee, others will be vexed against thee, and curse thee: wherefore be not troubled about these things, nor cumber not thy self about Religion, how to establish it; for it is God's Hand only to esta∣blish his Worship and Religion, it belongs to him, as he will, and not as man by his Policy and Wisdom; but stand free from them all, and neither establish any, nor persute any Sect whatsoever, but let them all have their couse and season,; they will fall and perish of themselves, and the Good Old Way, and Truth, and the pure Religion, only will remain; and let them cry one against another, and rebuke one another, and meddle not thou with that, but only let thy Laws and Authority preserve mens Persons and Estates from the Wrong one of another, that all men may live peaceably under thee, and no man wrong his Neighbour's Person or Estate; and that's only thy Place, to rule in outward Af∣fairs, but not to Rule over any mans Conscience, to compel him to such a Wor∣ship, or to limit from such a Worship in Religion, that belongs not to thee, but to the Lord, who alone will be the Ruler, and Guide, and Exerciser of his Peo∣ple's Consciences; and if thou dost meddle therein, thou shalt not prosper, nor be blessed in thy Deed: So leave the establishing of Religion to the Lord, and let all these Sects manifest, if any of them have the Spirit and Power of God in them, and with them, and let them shew their Weapons of the Spirit; for only such as have the Power and Spirit of God in them will overcome, and such will be increased and grow; and thou nor none can hinder: and such that want the Power and Spirit of God in and with them, may flourish in their Form for a while, but they will be blasted and wither, and its in vain for thee, or any, to uphold such, or endeavour to establish them; but if thou meddlest on these ac∣counts it will undo thee, and confound thee; therefore be wise, and know what
the Lord requires of thee perfectly; for if thou leavest that undone which God requires, then shalt thou be condemned; and if thou dost that which he requires not, then shalt thou not be free. And this is written in Love to thee, to inform thy mind, how to walk towards the Lord, and the People over whom he hath set thee. And as for the maintaining of Ministers, Let that alone also, and be not trou∣bled about it; for it was ever the false Prophets and Deceivers that preached for Hire, and went after Gifts and Rewards, and sought Money and Gifts of peo∣ple; and they that do the same now, were never sent of God, nor are they such as shall convert people to God; for who are true Ministers of Christ, will not seek to thee, nor to men for Wages, nor Tythes, nor Money, but live of the Go∣spel, and not compel great sums of Money from people, to maintain them in their Families in Pride, in Fulness, and Idleness; such things are great Oppressions in this Nation, and a horrible filthy thing in the Sight of God, and because there∣of will the Lord's Judgments come upon the Land: If thou wert but rightly sen∣sible what casting into Goals, and what suing at Law of poor People, and what spoiling Peoples Goods by Restraint, and all for and about Tythes, and Priests Wages; it would make thee admire the Wickedness of that Generation; but do thou let them alone, for they do shame themselves, and undo themselves, and lose the Hearts of all good People by their own doings; and stand over them all in God's Authority, and know a measure of the Spirit of God in thy own heart, and thereby thou wilt discern, and try and judge of the spirits of all men, and their Religion; and the Spirit will lead thee in the pure Religion, to worship God in Spirit and in Truth; So let not thy mind be cumbred at all about esta∣blishing Religion, nor about maintaining the Ministers; but be faithful to what the Lord requires of thee, and learn his Will, and do it, and then thou wilt be Blessed and Honoured in this world, and in the World to come. And Friend, Know thou that the Lord is doing of a great Work in these Na∣tions, he is raising up a Seed to serve him and to worship him aright, and the God of Heaven is setting up a Kingdom over all the kingdoms of the World, and he hath a Controversie with all sorts of people, in as much as Corruption and Degeneration is entred amongst all, and all must be purged of all Orders of men, and the Evil cast out; the Work of the Lord is Great and Mighty, and he re∣quires no help of thee, nor any man whatsoever; for his own Arm will bring it to pass; yet he would not have thee to gain-say his Work, and strive against it, and seek to quench what the Lord is bringing forth, if thou dost it, then shalt thou be condemned, and the Lord will speedily execute his Judgments, and Remove thee, and overthrow thy Power and Authority into Destruction; wherefore be passive in this matter, and look thou at the Lord, and protect and defend mens Persons and Estates from Wrong; but meddle not with their opinions and profes∣sions in Religions, to exalt any of them, nor yet to persecute them. And thus Friend, according as it lay upon me from the Lord, I have written this unto thee in dear and pure Love, God is Witness, and I have cleared my Conscience to thee thus far; and if thou fall by thy own Transgression, it will lie upon thy self; I have warned thee, and I am clear; and if thy Fall comes, re∣member thou wast advised.

To the Protector and his Council. THE Lord God will shortly make you know, that we are his People, though we be accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter; yet our King of Righteousness will break you to pieces, if you harden your Hearts, and Repent not: And seeing that Love will not draw thee, neither the Gentle Leadings of our God have any place in you; yet Judgment shall awaken you, and his heavy Hand of Indignation shall lie upon your Cousciences, and you will be scatterred and distracted to pieces. E B. This was written in White-Hall, in the Tenth Moneth, 1658. to Richard and his Council. For the Parliament. YE that sit in Counsel, that are assembled for the Nations Good, hear ye the Word of the Lord God, which is towards you all; Rememember the Cause of God, and of his People; remember the Groanings of the Poor, and give ear to the Cry of the Oppressed, and relieve the Guiltless Sufferers, and break the Bonds of Iniquity, and let the Oppressed go free; do this, lest you perish: And remember the Old Good Cause, that is decayed, and hath long been laid waste; let it be once more revived in the Nations, that God may bless you; Remember the first Engagement, which was for Freedom, and suffer not the Exercise of pure Conscience to be trodden down by Oppressors; but seek ye, seek ye the Glory of the Lord, and the Safety of his People, and the Freedom of such as are oppressed; and be not ye Oppressors; nor Adders to the Sufferings of the Innocent; make no Laws to limit the Lord, nor his Spi∣rit, nor his People, but make such of no effect, lest ye be confounded like as with a Whirle-wind, by the Breath of the Almighty: I am the Lord, and my Name is dreadful to all Flesh; mine Arm is stretched forth over the Nations, and I will scatter them at my Pleasure; I kill, and I make alive; I break down, and I build up; fear ye me, and tremble at my Presence; bow before me, and have my Name in Reverence, and my People in Safety, and let them be free from all Oppressions and Tyranny, lest I correct you with the Rod of my Judgments, saith the Lord: For I will rule Nations with an Iron Rod, and the Governments shall be mine through the Kingdoms of the World, and my People shall inheri the Possessions; I will beat the Mountains to Powder, and strike Terror in the Hearts of the Mighty; and I will Judge among the Judges, and Rule amongst the Rulers of the Earth, who are but Dust and Ashes before me; therefore do ye the thing that pleaseth me, and have my Cause and my People's Cause in respect amongst you; and be ye low and humble in my Sight, lest I wound you, and you never be healed, lest I scatter you, and you never be gathered, I am the Lord that doth whatsoever he will, Dreadful and Mighty is my Name in the Earth, and my People are my Inheritance, wherein I delight; spare them, and afflict them not, that I may spare you, and not destroy you; and take you Counsel at my Spirit, and at my Servants, that you may prosper; and hurt not the Innocent, nor touch my Anointed Ones, lest I come suddenly upon you, saith the Lord, and break you to pieces; for I will make you know, that my People are mine, and beloved of me, and that I care for them, and will Fight for them, and revenge their Cause, and deliver them from the hands of their
Enemies speedily; this ye shall know when my Vengeance is extended forth to all my Enemies, and upon all such as do oppress my People, and are Spoilers of my pleasant Heritage; and now am I arisen, saith the Lord. Edw. Burroughs, This was written to the Parliament, which began to sit in the Eleaventh Moneth, 1658. which Richard Cromwell Dissolved in the Second Moneth, 1659. To Richard Cromwel and to Henry Cromwel. FRIENDS, YET once more hath the Lord given me somewhat to say unto you, in Love to your immortal Souls; You had a glorious Day of Visitation, and ma∣ny precious Warnings from the Mouth of the Lord, by his Servants, but you rejected the Counsel of the Lord against your own Souls, and made no account of the Servants of the Lord, which were sent unto you; but caused them and suf∣fered them to be persecuted by your Power, and they were made a Spoil and a Prey to their Enemies all your dayes; and you sought your selves, and your own Honour, and you were exalted in Pride and Vain-glory, and forgot God, who raised you up from a low Estate, and you had no respect to the Cause of his Peo∣ple, and therefore is this justly come to pass upon you from the Hand of the Lord; not that I rejoyce in it, and glory over you because of it, only I tell you what is justly happened unto you, that ye may learn the Lora's just Iudgments in these things, like as formerly I warned you of it; for it could not otherwise be, but that the Lord would avenge the Cause of his People upon their Persecutors, and the Inju∣stice done unto them upon you, in whose Name and Power it was acted; for, in every Generation he hath had respect unto his People's Cause, and did avenge their Cause in his season: And this I well remember, I was once moved to speak in the Name of the Lord unto your Father, That these things that came to pass in his days, that Cruelty and Oppression of the Lord's People, would be recompenced, and repented of in his Children's dayes: For I saw, that the Cruelty and Injustice that was done in his Name upon the People of God, could not escape un punished in a Genera∣tion; and it is now come to pass in a measure, and will be more and more, even for his Transgressions and your own: for all of you had a Day and a Time, wherein you might have done something for the Lord, and for his People; and you had a Price put into your hands, that you might have improved to the Lord's Glory, and to your own Renown, to have been a Blessing unto your selves, and to the People of God in these Nations; but your Day is over, and Night is come up∣on it, and your Price is taken from you, and given to others, and you cannot now work nor act on the Lords behalf, as once you might have done; and you have sought honour to your selves, and you reap Reproach; and because you have despised the Counsel of the Lord, therefore the snare hath caught you, which was laid for others: These things I say unto you in pitty for you, rather then in boasting over you; neither do I commend that spirit which acteth in too much severity to∣wards you, which upraids you, rather then seeks to amend you, that is not my way: For your Father served the Lord in his Generation, and was once the In∣strument in his Hand, to the accomplishing of good things, till that an ambitious spirit got power over him, and betrayed him, and the Work was lost which God called him unto. And as for these that are now in Power, if they shall tread in your steps, and shall not relieve the Oppressed, much more then any before them shall they be overthrown, and brought into Contempt. And as for you, Come into the Fear of the Lord God that your Iniquities may be pardoned;
and seek Peace with God, and Reconciliation, and seek after the Kingdom that edures forever; and while ye have time, seek after a Crown Immortal, and wait to know that which will make you Heirs of that Inheritance which never fades away: the Light in your own Consciences, which Christ hath enlighten∣ed you with, which lets you see Sin, and convinceth you of your Evil Deeds; that Light in you must you own to be your Teacher, and must become subject unto it in all things, or else you have no part in the Kingdom of God; and cease from your lying Prophets, who have flattered you in your Iniquities, and de∣ceived your Souls, and cryed Peace unto you and Safety; and said, You should Prosper, and they have hardened your Hearts, and been a Snare to you, till the Lord's Anger is broken forth against you, and they found Lyars. So now con∣sider, and do not alwayes reject Love; but and if you do, I am clear, and your Iniquities will be upon your own Heads; and though rejected by you, yet a Friend to your Souls, whom the Lord hath made often to warn you; and hap∣py had you been, if you had or can now prize the Day of your Visitation. Edward Burroughs. This was delivered to them in the Fifth Moneth, 1659.
TO THE PARLIAMENT Of the Common-Wealth OF ENGLAND, The present Authority of these Nations, Assembled at WESTMINSTER. A Presentation, by a faithful Friend to the Nations, in the Name, and by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, King of Righteonsness and Peace; That you may take off Oppres∣sion, and free the People from all their Cruel Bonds, that have been imposed upon their Bodies, Estates and Consci∣ences, in the dayes of the Reign of Antichrist; that Truth, Justice and Righteousness may come nigh unto us, and the Kingdom of the Son of God set up among us; that you and we may at last be free Subjects of Christs' King∣dom, where Righteousness, Truth and Peace may run down, and be established in the Earth for evermore. FRIEND, IT is acknowledged, that the Lord God (who rules over all in the King∣doms of Men) hath done Great and Honourable Things by you, and with the Face of your Authority in your dayes; and since your first ap∣pearing on the Throne, Mighty Things have been brought to pass, in our Na∣tions, by the Hand of the Lord; insomuch that many Mountains have been abased, and many sturdy Oaks have been cut down, and many cruel Laws have been made void; and even the Way of the Lord, and the Way of the coming of his Kingdom, hath seemed to be prepared: For the kingdom of Antichrist, and the Beast, and the Whore (the false Church) hath in many things recei∣ved a mortal Wound in this Nation; and there hath been divers times the fair Blossoms of the Glorious Appearance of Truth, Righteousness and Peace; and there have been many fair Promises and Pretences, made by many of you,
like as if the Kingdom of Jesus had been at our Door, ready to have entred our Nations, whereby many good Hopes we have had, to have been made a per∣fect free People ere this day, from the Chains of Antichrist and the Whore (the' false Church) and from every Branch thereof; and that we might have sitten together in Peace and Unity, and in Freedom from all the Opressions of our Enemies. But Alas, alas, This Glorious Work of Reformation hath bin interrupted be∣fore our eye, and the precious Buds and good Appearance of Glorious Fruits have been withered and blasted in our sight; so that our good Hopes have perished, and our Freedom hath been intercepted through the Evil-dealing of many un∣faithful men; so that Antichrist's kingdom hath not been utterly rooted out, nor the oppressive Laws of the Whore (the false Church) wholy broken down, but the rather have seemed to be revived again; and the Kingdom of the Son of God hath been warred against, and Truth, Righteousness and just Judgment hath been kept out of the Throne, and the Lamb, and his Army, and Follow∣ers have been opposed by open and secret Rebellion; so that though there hath been appearances of good Things now and then, yet ever and anon Clouds and Darkness have overshaddowed the Nations again, and the good Hopes of Faithful People have been driven backwards, and Reformation stopped, and your own Vows, Promises, and Pretences have remained unfulfilled, and we are yet an Oppressed People: and the Cause of this hath been from some un∣faithful men, that have neglected the good Work of the Lord, once intrusted with them; and have sought themselves, and their own Honours and Interests, and have sitten down at Ease and Rest in the Flesh, glorying in the Spoil of their Enemies, and thereby have they become unfaithful and unprofitable in carrying on the Lord's Work: for some have been of a sincere Mind for a season, and made a good Progress towards the attaining a Kingdom of Righteousness, and the removing of all Oppressions; yet when they have begun to seek themselves in this World, and to take unto themselves the Ho∣nours, and Titles, and possessions of their Enemies (whom the Lord cast out before them) and so have become guilty of their Enemies Sins, then they have been choaked, and the good Work of the Lord by them could not prosper, but it hath fallen in their hands even because of their Apostacy, whom the Lord hath removed in his Wrath, which to you all may be Examples, that ye follow not their steps: For, for these Causes, I tell you, hath the True Reformation been turned backward, and the Work of the Lord remained unfinished, in∣somuch that Oppression, Injustice and Tyranny yet remains upon the People; and Ten Thousand lie groaning under the Yoak and Bondage of Antichrist, and of the Whore (the false Church) in Persons, Estates and Consciences; and are ready to depart out of all good Hope and Confidence, That they shall never see, through you, the finishing of that long since begun good Work of Perfect Reformation, and Free∣dom from all Oppressions. And amongst the many Great Oppressions and Cruel Burdens, yet remaining in our Nation, there is at this day one particular Op∣pression abounding, under which Thousands of the free People of the Lord, & of these Nations, lie unjustly suffering in their Bodies, Estates and Conscinces (to wit) This way of forced Maintenance of the Ministry, by Tythes, and Money, and Yearly Stipends; which many are violently forced to pay, through Oppression, and con∣trary to Equity; and because hereof is God not well-pleased with you, but his Wrath is kindled already; for the Cry of the Unjustly Afflicted under this one Op∣pression hath entred into his Ear, and he will be avenged speedily, even because of the Oppression of his People in this very particular, who cannot out of a Good Conscience pay Tythes, or Money, or any other thing, contrary to Equity, to the maintaining of this Mini∣stry, and these Ministers, which they receive no benefit by, neither are under their Ministry. And forasmuch as this way of maintaining Ministers and Ministry by Force is wholy Antichristian, and of the Whore (the false Church) and never was in the
true Churches of Christ, in the Apostles dayes; neither did ever Christ, or his Apostles, give Institution or Example for such way of Maintenance to Christ's Mi∣nisters: but being that this way of forced Maintenance, by Tythes, and Money, and Yearly-Stipends, is come up long since the Apostles dayes; and is the very Institu∣tion of the false Church of Rome, and was first practized by her Authority in our Nation; and by the same Spirit, at this day, this Oppression remaineth amongst us: and likewise it is wholy unreasonable, That one sort of people should be compelled to maintain anothers Ministers, whom they do not hear, nor receive their Ministry: And also, this way of maintenance is one of the greatest Oppressions in our Nation, and many Hundreds of my Brethren have suffered great Oppression thereby, some the loss of Estates, and many the loss of their Liberties, & some the loss of their Lives also; insomuch that this Oppression is fully ripe to be cut down, and removed out of our Land. Wherefore it lies upon me from the Lord, to request it of you, and to lay it up∣on you, as being the present Authority, that have Power to do it; That you spee∣dily order the removing of this Oppression of forced Maintenance to Ministers out of the Nation, and that no man henceforth be compelled or forced to maintain Ministers and Ministry, by Tythes, or Money, or otherwise; but that every man be left free, to give what, and how much, as he pleaseth, to what Minister as he will; only if any do hire a Minister, and promise so much, then it is Equity, that he that is hired have the benefit of the Law, to receive what he is promised, by force, if he cannot freely: But let not any people be forced by your Law to hire Ministers, neither one sort to maintain another peoples Minister; but let every sort of people live under what Ministry, and hear whom they please, and also maintain their own Ministers, that labour for them: and this is reasonable, and would content all the Faithful People; for it is wholy unequal, that any people should be forced and compelled to mantain another peo∣ples Minister, which doth no work for them; and it is also wholy inconsistent with the good Government of a Common-wealth, and absolute contrary to Christian-Liberty, and is a very Chain of Antichrist upon the good People; and the main Cause of Heart-burnings, and Strifes, and Envyings among Subjects; and one of the chief Props of Deceivers and false Ministers, that covet to run after great Benefices, and care not for Souls; and also, the God of Heaven is vexed with this Abomination; and it is certain, that you and these Nations shall never be established in true and perfect Peace and Unity, while this Oppression remaineth, nor till that in all things Conscience be let free to the Exercise of the Spirit of God. Wherefore I am come to your door on the behalf of the Lord, & all his People, and I cry, & ten thousand with me (in Spirit) of the free People of your Nation, Let this Unreasonable Oppressive and Antichristian Practice, of forcing Maintenance to Ministers, be speedily removed out of our Land, and let the Persons, Estates and Conscion∣ces of your faithful Friends be freed from this cruel Burden, that they have long born by your and their very Enemies: And also I lay it upon you, that you clear and free your selves in all things from the false Church, and be not Servants to her; drink not her Cup of Fornications, neither in any thing carry the Whore: and here∣by should that long born and heavy Yoak of Antichrist be removed, that hath laid upon the good People's Persons, Estates and Consciences; and false Ministers, that run for Hire, and not to win Souls (who are Oppressors) should hereby be limitted; and the Faithful Ministers of Christ, who are sent of him, would be the more encouraged to minister freely, who have received freely; and this would be the way to bring Blessings and Peace amongst us, and to rejoyce the Hearts of the Righteous, and to stop the spirit of Oppression; and hereby you would be made Honourable, and the Lord himself glorified, and his People a free People: So that for these Causes it is upon me to demand it of you, that you remove the Oppression aforesaid, of forcing Maintenance for Ministers and leave every sort of people free, to maintain their own Ministers, as the Lord shall lead them.
For this was the Way in the true Churches, The Ministers' of Christ did eat of the Milk of the Flock which they kept, and of the Fruit of the Vineyard which they  planted, Freely given them; and they reaped carnal things where they sowed Spiritual, yet as a Free Gift unto them, and not by Force, nor as a Debt: for this way of forcing Maintenance was never in beeing among the true Churches; but is of the false Church, both in its Original, and in its standing to this day, and out of her Cup (who hath made Nations drunk) hath our Nation drunk this Abo∣mintion and Oppression; and it is the remainder, and one of the strongest parts of the Whore of Rome, yet left in England, and it is full time to be removed clean away from us, and if you do it, then shall we have cause to believe, that you intend well to the Nations, and our long decayed Hopes concerning you will be again revived, and our Faith will be encreased, that you will yet suffer Righ∣teousness and Mercy to flourish, if you take off every Oppression, and make the People free; but if you do it not, but will be the Imposers of Unrighteous things upon the People under you, and will carry the Whore, and yet drink her Cup, and compel others to drink it, Then the Lord will break you to pieces, and bring Freedom to this Nation some other way; and you, and they, and the Beast, and the Whore, and your Op∣pressious, shall all fall together, and sink as a Stone into the Sea, and your Remembrance shall be blotted out, and perpetually perish: and these are the Words of the Lord God unto you, wherefore that you may live in true Honour, and not Perish in per∣petual Shame; and that the Lord may bless you, and not make you a Curse, and that the Lord's People may pray for you, and not against you. I say, consider in the Fear of God, and with a willing Mind grant this my Desire; and in so doing, you fulfil the Will of the Lord, and thereby be established over all your Enemies. Many things more on the Lord's behalf I have to demand of you, but this for present; from a Lover of Righteousness, and a Friend to this Nation, London, the 12th of the 7th Moneth, 1659.

A MESSAGE TO THE Present Rulers OF ENGLAND, VVhether Committy of Safety (so called) Council of Officers, or Others whatsoever. Delivered unto them by an Ambassadour from the only right Heir of the Government, whose Right alone it is to Rule: And by special Authority and Commission from him, this is sent unto them, that they may hear, and fear, and learn Wisdom, and may deliver up the proper Right of the only King unto him, that they may be blessed; but on the contrary dependeth their DESTRUCTION. THese things were upon me to deliver, even by Speech and word of Mouth, to the present Men in Power; that they might be warned, lest they Perish: But no way being made for me so to do, I have written what was upon me, even as short as possibly I could, and in as little compass as might be; having hinted at things which might more largely been spoken to. And I order this to be Printed, and given to their particular hands with speed. FRIENDS, MY Master is a High, and Mighty, and Powerful Prince, and very Honourable; and Fear, Reverence, Respect and Subjection be∣longs to him alone, from you and all Mankind; he is Wise, and Un∣derstanding, and of great Strength; and his Dominion is from Everlasting to Everlasting; and he can do whatsoever he will in Heaven and Earth; for he
rules with his Iron Rod over the world; and whatsoever he saith, it is done; for his Word is an Everlasting Command; If he saith to a man, Live, it is so; if he saith to a man, Dye, it cometh to pass; and if he give Peace to a Man or a Nation, none can make War; and if he make War with a Person, or in a Nation, no man is able to make Peace: For why? he hath all Power in his Hand, and to him all Judgment and Authority is given; he is the Son of the Living God, the Everlasting Creator; he was, and is, and is to come; his Eye be∣holdeth all things, and his Arm compasseth Heaven and Earth; and what his Purpo is, he hath alwayes, and will ever bring it to pass: if he set up Rulers, they must Rule; and if he pull them down, none can hinder: whom he will, he Honoureth; and if it be his Pleasure, he bringeth men to Shame: if he break a Nation down, none can build it up; and if he confound Powers and Au∣thorities in the Kingdoms of men, they all fall, as withered Grass before him: ehold ye men! He is so Great and Mighty, and of so great Authority, that whatsoever he saith, it is done; and whatsoever he willeth, it cometh to pass; and none is able to resist him, and overcome his Power, when his Pleasure is to accomplish a Work: by him all things are that be, and all things live that have Life, and through him all things move, and of his Fulness every Creature in Heaven and Earth receive. And this, my Master, is altogether Honourable in Birth, and otherwise; and altogether Mighty in all his Works; he is Just and Merciful, full of Goodness, Righteousness and Truth; all Vertue dwells in him; and his Judgement and Mercy, his Authority and Meekness, and his Wrath and his Love, they are Companions: And what are ye before him? or, How shall ye be able to resist him, or to turn backward what his Purpose is con∣cerning you, and this Nation? for ye have no Beeing nor Breath without him. Behold ye men! ye are verily as the Dust before the Wind, so are ye to him, soon blown away, and your Place not found; as the Grass before the Mower, so are ye before him, soon cut down, and withered, and your Beauty utterly ex∣tinguished; as a Potters Vessel under an Iron Rod, even so are you to him, he can immediately break you, never to be bound up; as a Drop to the Fountain, so are you to him, soon dryed up, and made nothing: Wherefore ye Men, ye Mortal Creatures, ye Ignorant Persons, Sons of a Transgressor, ye Dust and Ashes; for thus you are in comparison of him, this Mighty Prince; hearken to his Message, which cometh to you from him; Hear and Fear, and be not Stout∣hearted against the Lord God, that is about to speak unto you. As for this little Island of England, wherein your present Place and Beeing is; It is an Island which the Lord hath shewed great Favour unto, in Ages past, and in this present Time; and I must tell you, he hath a Purpose of Love to∣wards it, and to Honour it in the view of the World, though through great Tribulations; and he hath an intent of great Good unto it: For he hath a Seed, a precious Seed in it, scattered abroad, and he hath a People that fear his Name, and have walked in his Wayes, and he hath made them, and elected them, and what they are, it is by him; that he may dwell among them, and have the whole Government over them all; yea he hath a speedy Purpose verily concerning this Nation, and he will purifie it in Judgment, and refine its Inhabitants through the Fire of Tribulations, that it may be pleasant to him, and fit to do his Will: He hath a purpose to work some great thing in it, I must tell you, as he hath said unto me so to do; He will have his Name exalted and reveren∣ced in this Island, and his Terror shall be sent out of it through the World, and his Branch from it shall spread over the Earth; he doth purpose in his season to take it into his own hand, and to sway the Government thereof with his own Scepter, and to set up Righteousness alone, and to overthrow all Oppressions and Oppressors; and the Kingdoms of this World must become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ.
True it is, Such hath been the coming to pass of Time, and of Things, for many Ages by past, that my Master hath been as it were banished from the Nation, and hath not been suffered to enjoy his Right; but hath been expelled, even as it were by the force of Satan and Antichrist, who hath long usurped Authority over the Inhabirants of this Nation: and in my Master's absence, Lamentable Injustice, Cruelty, Unmercifulness, Tyranny and Oppression, hath been ex∣ercised upon the Inhabitants; and the poor Creatures have been held in great Slavery by their Rulers, that have ruled by the Dragon's power, and been kept in great Blindness and Ignorance, and under great Oppression, both in Body and Spirit, by Antichristian Teachers, for this many Years, even while the great King hath been absent, and as it were gone into a far Country; even all this time hath Antichrist and the Devil ruled and reigned, and hath made and ex∣ecuted Oppressing and Tyrannical Laws and Decrees, both in Church and State; and all the Nation hath been out of right Order, and laid waste and barren of good Fruit, and it hath been as a Wilderness by reason hereof: and men that have ruled for many years, have not ruled singly by my Master's Au∣thority, but by another power, though not without the knowledge of my Lord, neither as though he had not Power to have done otherwise; but for his own Pleasure he hath suffered it thus to be, and let men go on to rule and govern in their own Wills, and after their own Lusts; and people have walked wickedly towards him, and towards one another; and all this he hath suffered, not as if he gave Toleration for it; for his Messengers now and then, and his Witness in peoples Consciences, have been reproving their Ungodly wayes, and he hath often shewed his dislike, by divers Wayes and Tokens, and many Judgments, and strange Overturning, to the way and proceeding of both Rulers, Prophets and Teachers of this Nation; but yet they have gone on against his Mind, and contrary to his Will, notwithstanding his Reproofs and Judgments, not that he had not Power to have executed his Pleasure in Wrath upon them, and to have destroyed them altogether, and have made the Nation a Heap, and as nothing long before this day; for Power was in his Hand to have done it: But he hath been Long-suffering, and of great Patience, and born all things, and taken the Injustice, and Cruelty, and Wickedness, and Idolatry, and all Unrighteousness, that hath abounded in the Nation, upon himself, and suffe∣red under it, and born it for its season, while woful and lamentable Oppres∣sions have been practised in Civil State even Hellish Laws, and Devilish Execu∣tors of them; Merciless Tyrants have born the Scepter, and reigned for many years over the Inhabitants, and in Church and State has bin Hainous Idolatry and Superstitious Vanities committed in a high nature and measure, and even all Men, and States of Men, and Orders of Men of every degree have been abo∣minably corrupted in the Sight of my Lord, even from the Price to the Beggar, even Rulers and Subjects, Teachers and People, Judges and Prophets; they have been corrupted both in heart and hand, and they have dealt falsly and wickedly towards him, and towards one another, even to the great Dis∣pleasure and Vexation of him and his blessed Spirit, and to the high Provo∣cation of him to their own Destruction, if his Long-Suffering had not pre∣vailed; and all this while he hath laid as it were asleep, and at rest in him∣self: and he hath left men to try them, what they will do, and he hath gives them a Day; many Kings and Rulers he hath let them have a little time, to see how they would use it, but they have abused it, and not ruled for him, nor ac∣complished his Work, nor fulfilled his Will; but acted even in defiance of him, and of his Power, and to his great Dishonour. Alack! I must be plain with you; My Lord hath been utterly exiled, and greatly dishonoured, and highly provoked and vexed by reason of such proceed∣ings, as have been in this Nation for this many years, through the Cor∣ruption of all sorts of Men in Place and Power, who have not ruled for him,
but for the Devil, to their own corrupted Ends; only he hath suffered men to go onin their▪ course for a season; some as it were, appearing on the Stage for a time, and suddenly cast down again for their Iniquities sake; and his Hand hath been in all these things, though very privately and secertly, not known and discerned by the Sons of Men, yet hath he ruled over the Kingdoms of Men, and pulled down one, and set up another. And to for bear the several Actings and Proceedings, of many by-passed Ages, and to come to this Generation, and to speak of things that have happened within these few years, and of the changing and overturning that hath happened in this Nation; such was the Cruelty, Tyranny, Oppression and Idolatry, both in Church and Civil State, that the people of this Nation were held under, in the dayes of Papal-Power; such, I say, was the exceeding heighth of Cruelty and Tyranny of that time, that not any that Feared or Reverenced my Lord, in any measure, could scarce live, or have a Beeing in the Nation; even against every man, that did but in∣line towards him, and desire the Knowledge of his Wayes, Hell's Mouth was opened against them, and they were swallowed up, and many of their Lives taken from the Earth, by the hellish power that had in that day usurped Autho∣rity in this Island; and when thus it was, then he looked down from Heaven, and his bowels of compassion were opened, for the sake of the oppressed People that desired after him, in so much that he broke, and threw down the power of their Oppressors in some measure, as it stood in Papall Authority, and when the iniquity of that power was filled up, he took vengeance upon it; and I must tell you, it was he that brought it about, even the destroying of that Power in this Nation, and freeing the Nation from it, though the men that were instruments in the cause were not his Servants, otherwise then as Nebuchadnezzar served him, for he hath a secret way to have a service from the wicked, and such is his Power, that he can turn the wickedness of the wicked to his glory, and he can make a Rod to whipp his Adversaries, and burn it when he hath done, and he ath often destroyed one wickedness by another. Well, But to leave that, though he did in some measure free the Nation from much Tyranny and Cruelty, in the casting out Popish Authority; yet a lack! the Nation in a few years was near as much violated by Injustice and Cruelty, under the succeeding Power, as ever it was once under the Papal-Power; though before there had been some small Reformation, and Change in outward Appea∣rance, though little in ground and Nature; yet Oppression, and Idolatry, and Superstition in Church and State, and all Prophaneness and Wickedness among people, was grown so high, like as it had been under the Papal Power before; and all that desired after the Lord, and were weary of Iniquity, and of the then present Oppressions and Idolatries, were Persecuted, and Slain, and destroyed, and Injustice and Cruelty exercised upon them, even almos to to the rooting out of Righteousness, and to the grieving of the Lord's Spirit: Well then, because of the cry of the People, and the Oppression of the Na∣tion under that Authority, my Lord looked down again, and even for his Name's sake, and for his Seed's sake, he had compassion on this Nation, to set it free, and to break off its Oppressions; and in a great measure he did deliver the people of this Nation in many things, and there was a part of Reformati∣on wrought, and much pretended and looked for; and all this came to pass through him, and my Lord did accomplish it, however the Instruments by which he wrought proved deceitful, and became Oppressors, as others before them; and though there was in this Nation a day of great Troubles, and Wars, and Contention, and great Strife, and the wasting of much Blood, and earthly Treasure; and none of these things, I must tell you, fell without the ordering of my Master's Hand; yet so it was, and came to pass, that after this Nation was restored to Peace, though much Unrighteousness and Injustice was remo∣ved, yet there was much also left behind; and men that he had used as Instru∣ment in his Hand, in a good Work, and to whom he had given Wisdom and
Understanding, and appeared in much Mercy and in great Deliverance; yet they even turned to seek themselves, and became corrupted in the Spoils of their E∣nemies, and when Peace and Plenty abounded the Lord was forgotten again, and then the Land fell under Oppressors, and began again to cry out for Free∣dom, even when other Horns of the first Beast sprang up, and went on each of them after his Fellow; and though one Horn hath striven to break another, yet after one hath been cast down, another hath risen, and made an Image to the first, and ruled and reigned by the same spirit and authority, derived from the Dragon's power, in Cruelty and Oppression, and made Laws, and executed them to the Dishonour of the Lord, and to the great Oppression of his People, and to the filling of this Island with Injustice and Cruelty, even from one Ge∣neration to another, until this day: and thus up and down have Times and Sea∣sons been altered, Powers and Authority changed and altered, Statutes, Laws and Decrees changeable and alterable; for as the Iniquity of one Power was filled up▪ that was cast down, and another had its Day, till the measure of the first was also filled up, that he might partake of the same Iudgements. And in all these Overturn∣ings, breakings-down and Overthrowings, the very Hand of my Lord hath been, though secretly, and not discerned, yet his Power hath brought about, and suf∣fered all these things to come to pass; and who shall charge him with Injustice? or, who shall say, What hast thou done? or, Why hast thou done it? For, as I have said, He is a High and Mighty Prince, and can do whatsoever he will; and he is the Supream Power and Authority, which rules and reigns in and over all the King∣doms of Men. And what though he hath used wicked men, as an Instrument, to ac∣complish his Work, and made the Wicked his Rod, and even brought it to pass, that one Wickedness should destroy another, and one Oppressor break down another, and the Kingdom of Antichrist confound it self; yet what of all these things? All Flesh must be silent before him, and all People, and the whole Earth must be subject unto him; for the Government and Dominion over Heaven and Earth is his, and all Power and Dominion belongeth to him alone, and all Judgment is in his Hand, to bring to pass whatsoever he will, and by whomsoever, as he pleaseth. But now, my Friends, Though I would not he tedious to you, yet must I tell you the Truth, and faithfully deliver the Lord's Message unto you; and as con∣cerning this last Overturning, there was something of the Hand of my Lord in it; and he can, and will bring forth his own Work and Praise by it, and it shall be for the Good of all his People, that wait upon him, though there was much Ambition and corrupted Ends in the Instruments, and neither part were per∣fectly single to the Lord in their proceedings; but their work was tasted with the False Idolatrous spirit of Self-seeking: Yet notwithstanding, the Lord may bring forth his Government, and his pleasant Plant, through and be∣yond all this, even out of another Root, which yet appears not among either of them; and Righteousness may arise in the Nation, contrary to both of them, out of another Stem, and he will set up his Kingdom; and in the mean time, leave one Potsherd of the Earth to break another. And as for you, that now sit on the Throne, and bear Rule, whether Commit∣ty Is meant here, chiefly, the new Com∣mittee of Safety (so called.) of Safety (so called) chiefly, though it is not without my Master; for he hath the knowledge of it, at least; yet you are not the only men of his choice, truly called of him to the Place of Government, neither is your Government the Government of the Lamb, neither must it be forever established by him; its Foundation is not Blessed, nor can its Building be prosperous: For why? Alas, it is but another Horn of that fourth Beast, that hath been made to rule over the World, and upon the Earth for many Generations, and it is but hitherto a very little refined from the last, and is of the last, even as the Eighth was of the Seventh, spo∣ken of by that Servant, Rev. 17. 11. and it may also make War with the Lamb and his Followers for a little season, and it may have a small measure of Injustice and Persecution to bring forth in the Land, even till the Words of
God be fulfilled, and his Kingdom be fully come; the way of which is but yet preparing by all these Overturnings: and this your present Government ori∣ginally is leavened with the spirit of the old Dragon, that hath killed the Saints, and drunk their Blood, and how should the Lord establish it? Nay, your King∣d may prove but small and little, and full of Uproars and Troubles, and little  and Satisfaction and Establishment in it to your selves, nor the People under you;  Confusion will attend it, and Fears will compass it about: Though this I must tell you, as you are men, You have your Day of Tryal, what you will do, as many ers have had before you; and something you may and ought to do, if but to make the Whore (the false Church) more naked, and to scourge her, more then some others have done; and indeed my Lord requires something more of you (as such) to do, then others before you could do; and you have a Price  into your hands, which you may improve to the Lord's Honour, and to the Nations Good, and to your own Happiness; which if you be faithful to the Lord, to do what he requires of you, and if you become meek and humble men, and r his Name, and deny your selves, and not seek your own Honours, nor y rthly Advantage to your selves; if you do thus, then my Lord will shew Mercy to you, and you shall not suddenly fall before your Enemies, though many may  up against you; but your dayes shall be lenghened, and the Purpose of  d may be turned to your longer continuance, and not to your suddn Dion; and if you walk in this Way, and Rule only for the Lord, then   be hoaoured as men, if not as an Authority, and you and the Nation  in Peace, and the force of the wickd shall be turned backward, and  shall not suddenly fall And the late sundry Overturnings in this Nation y be Examples to you, that you follow t the steps of those that God hath  , lest you come to the same end of Confusion and Misery: For, as con∣ing that Assembly of Men, that last sate on the Throne, something was do by them in their day and time, and in both their Assemblings, in some things they served my Lord, and they were a Rod in his Hand to smite his Ene∣mies; yet they were not faithful to the End; till all his Enemies were destroyed▪ but rather joyned themselves to fight against the Lord and his People, and were ing on towards the way of Oppression and Persecution; and it was time for the Lord to remove them, and to lay them aside, as an empty Vessel, some∣time useful; and to break them as a Rod, some time of service to be a Scourge upo his Enemies▪ and when the Day of their▪ Tryal was over, which God ge unto them, being any longer (for present) unfit Instruments for his Hand, then he cast them into the Fire; and this his Purpose came to pass upon them: so that they and the whole Nation may be contented, and yield themselves subject to what he hath done concerning them; for they being entring into the very same srit of Wickedness, of Oppression and Persecution, which the Lord had once reproved ough them, and cast out by them; then was a Rd raised up against them, even as they had been against others, and they were dealt withal as they had done to ers; and this was in the Justice of my Lord's Hand; And what hath Mortal M to question his Proceedings? And though some of you (present Rulers) be look∣ed upon as great Traytors and Tyrants in your dealing towards them; and doubt∣less the men of that part will seek Vengeance against you, even by precing and , and they will curse you in the Name of their God, and seek continually yo destruction, as such as have taken away part of their strength, and cast down their ; but alas! all this is nothing; for the Lord doth not account as men: For these things must needs thus come to pass, for the furtherance of the Kingdom and Government of Iesus Christ, that it may arise through all; and if you were but faith∣ful to what the Lord requires of you, in your proceedings, what you have done to them should not be reckoned on account against you, neither by God, nor good Men. But and if you of the Army be alwayes Treacherous and Diso∣edient towards him, and abuse your Power, and dis-regard your Price,
that God hath given you, and trifle away your Hour about Places of Honour, and such self-seeking matters, and the Cause of God be neglected by you, and his People continued Oppressed Sufferers under you, as they have long been; Even then shall you be cast aside with shameful Disgrace, and the heavy Hand of the Lord shall be upon you in Iudgment, and you shall be smitten more then any before y; your Estates shall not be spared from the Spoiler, nor your Souls from the Pit, nor y Persons from the Violence of Men, no, nor your Necks from the Axe: for if you be unfaithful, and continually Treacherous to the Cause of God, then shall you be left to the Will of your Enemies, and they shall charge Treachery and Treason upon you, and your Persons and Estates shall be given for a Prey to your Enemies; and you shall  deliver your selves, neither will the Lord deliver you from the Execution of Merciless Men; for my Lord shall leave the Cruel-hearted to plead with you. Wherefore that you may be warned, I advise you to be faithful, let not the Cause of God fall, nor the Cause of his Enemies prosper before you; for there is no other way whereby you can be preserved, nor no other Defence shall you ever find from the Wrath of the Lord, and from the Fury of you Devouring Enemies, then your Faithfulness in God's Cause; and therefore relieve the Oppressed, and take off all Oppressions, break down all unjust Laws, and set all People free from unjust Burdens, and let all Oppressions cease, both in Church and Civil State; and even all Oppressive Laws, and Unjust Judges, and Evil Men in Power, let all this be removed, and the Nation clean quitted and dis∣charged even from all Men and Laws whatsoever, that have held under Oppres∣sion the Persons, Estates and Consciences of the Good People of this Land; and let the Nation be corrected, and all Orders and Places of men, and Laws, and Decrees be purified; for this my Lord, the Great King, requireth, and he will suddenly have it brought to pass in the Nation, if not by you, then con∣trary to you, and to your utter Destruction: and this is the very substce of my Message to you, that my Master hath given me to say unto you; and on his behalf I am come to claim of you my Master's long lost Right; let him have his Right, from which he hath long been banished, I demand it of you, all ye whatsoever, that seem to bear rule in the Nation; I charge you in his Name, let him have his Title and Prerogative, let him be Lord and King wholy in his own Kingdom, let him have the Exercise of his People's Consciences by his own Spirit in all things related to his Worship and Service, and let him have the full Authority by his Spirit in all things pertaining to Church, and Ministry, and Faith and Religion; and let his Spirit have the alone Authority to perswade and diswade People from or to such or such Ministry, Worship and Practices of Religion; and let all forced Maintenance to Ministers, and Tythes, be speedily taken away; and let all Laws and Decrees whatsoever, made and practized in the days of Antichrist upon the Bodies, Estates and Consciences of the People, in Oppression and Unjustness about Church, and Worship and Religion, be ut∣terly repealed, and made void, and never more be in force in this Nation: But let my Lord be sole Ruler and Governour, and have the full Authority in his own Kingdom, in all things whatsoever pertaining thereunto; and let no man henceforth hereafter be intrusted with the Liberties of the Members of Christ's Kingdom, as they are such, nor to judge over them in any matters of Faith and Worship, but give that Right and Priviledge wholy unto the Spirit of Jesus Christ; for unto him onely it pertaineth, to be whole Judge, and to have full Power in his own Kingdom, and until you give him the Right, and deliver up unto him his own Kingdom, and the Exercise of Peoples Consciences in all things about RELIGION, you shall never Prosper, nor none that cometh after you, that shall in any measure abridge my Master of his proper RIGHT, from which he hath long been Banished, as I have said; and till his Right be given him, in the case aforesaid, He will dash one man against another, and none shall ever be established, but
Horn after Horn shall be broken, and one Power after another brought into Csion. And therefore, ye men, Do not strive with him in this matter, but yield unto  the Exercise of your own Consciences by his Spirit in you, and let him do  to all others, even as ye hope to prosper, and upon the Penalty of his sore Dleasure upon you in this World, and in the World to come; and let J Men, and Righteous Men, and Meek Men, and Men that have the Fear and Wisdom of God in them, without Exceptation of Birth, or otherwise;  such men have the Power and Judgment committed to them, to determine in things between Man and Man. Down with all the false-hearted Flatterers, that  ruled for Man, and not for God, and for themselves, and not for the good of the People; cast all such out from among you; for the Good among you is choaked by them: Down with all that Judge for Rewards; and away with  Hireling Rulers, that execute the Law for Money, and will not plead  Cause of the Poor without great Fees: And down with all that will not  places of Trust, without so large Stipends; away with all these things out of the Land; for they are hainous Oppressions unto men, and great Abo∣ons in the Sight of God, and the Land hath long groaned under the wight and burden of these things, and the Earth is weary of them, and my Lord iers their utter Dissolution, as being Iniquities fully ripe, and having the gil of so much Cruelty, Injustice and Oppression lying upon the Nation because hereof, therefore is the Lord's season to destroy them, and remove them out of the Land; which if you he the Instruments in such a Work, it will be your greatest Crown, and your perpetual Honour; for the Lord's Purpose is  y or other to cleanse the Land of all these, and other Oppression what∣soever, that the People of this Land may be a free People, from all the heavy Y of Antichrist, which have long sorely pressed them down; and the Pur∣pose of the Lord is, to break the Yoaks of Oppression and Tyranny, from off the Necks of this People; and therefore it is that he overturneth, yea, and will overturn all Men and Authorities that shall oppose his Work, and none shall be  to stand before him; for the Presence of my Lord is more dreadful to a Nati∣on, when he shews himself in Wrath, then any Multitude of Armed Men: and Wo is unto you, if you be found opposing of him; and if you seek to stop his Work, you shall not cumber the Earth very long, nor oppress the Nations ma∣ . Wherefore consider, Cursed will you be, if you be unfaithful in what  have to do on the Lord's behalf; for your Hour passeth ever, that is alotted you, and will be suddenly expired, never to be recalled, and then you cannot work. And whereas there is a great Cry about Ministry, For sending forth, and Main∣ng, and Encouraging a Godly Ministry, as you say. Now to this I do answer on my Lord's behalf, and I must tell you plainly; As for a true Godly Ministry, truly called and snt of God, such a Ministry and such Miisters you can never be able to hinder; but the Lord will send them out, taining them and preserving them, whether you will or no; and while you are bling your selves about such a matter, you are but meddling with things above your Line, and out of your Jurisdiction, while you act in such a case;  it belongs to his Goverment, to send out Ministers, whom, and as he will,   maintain them and defend them according to his own Pleasure, and all this without you; for such Ministers, truly called thereunto, and sent of the Lord, will not seek to you to be sent forth, or maintained by you, they will not be beholding to you in such a case; but even without you, and contrary to you must they be sent out, and maintained: So that the Lord will have a Ministry in this Nation purely of his own, and not of Man, nor by Man, and such a Ministry you shall not be able to hinder. And I must tell you plainly, As for these men, called Ministers, in this Nation, the way of their setting up, and sending forth; and the way of their Main∣tenance,
and the way of their standing and Defence, and in every particular of their being such, they are the greatest and most woful Oppression in the Na∣tion, even the most Abominable and unjust Cruelties and Tyrannies is acted through them, as any other thing in the Nation; and they are (as such afore∣said) the woful Cause of the Nations Groaning under Merciless Dealing; and there is upon their account the Guilt of Blood, Injustice and Oppression lying upon this Nation; their Inqiuities, their Iniquities cry for Vengeance upon their own heads; for they are full, they are full, and the measure thereof is near finished, and God's Eternal Vengeance is their next Reward, from the Eternal God. What shall I say of them, but this? The Earth is oppressed by them, the Inhabi∣tants groan under them, and the Righteous God is vexed through them, and they are the very men of high Indignation and fierce Wrath, and all their Practices (as such) are the Fewel of his Anger, to be consumed by the Fire of his Jea∣lousie; the Nation is weary, and its Inhabitants, and the Lord is weary because of these men: And is this the Ministry cryed up by you as Godly, and Pi &c? Are these the men that the Nation must be forced to maintain in their Pride and Idolatry? Is this the Ministry that must be Encouraged? Well, if these be the men, and this the Ministry which must be established and encouraged by you, in so doing you shall never prosper, but thereby gain the Displeasure of the Al∣mighty unto you, to bring a Curse upon all your doings, even because hereof; for I must tell you, the Hand of my Lord is against them; and whosoever shall seek to defend them, shall not prosper in their doings, because their Oppressions, Cru∣elties, Deceit and Abominations are nigh finished and fulfilled: wherefore take ed unto your selves, for this is my Master's Advice unto you; Let this Ministry alone, and joyn not your selves to Baal, lest you perish, neither take part with Antichrist any longer, neither be ye Fighters against the Lamb and his Kingdom; but free the Na∣tion, and let all its Inhabitants be freed from the cruel Tasks and Yoaks of such Men, and such a Ministry, as aforesaid; uphold it not against the Lord; for if you do, you shall never be established; and this is from the Mouth of my Lord unto you. And last of all, My Master hath a People in this Nation, even a suffering Peo∣ple, that have born the Burden of the Cruelty, and Injustice, and Wickedness both of Rulers and Teachers, who have as it were trodden them down, and made them a very Prey to their Devouring Mouthes; the very Cry of their Sufferings have reached unto Heaven, and the very sound thereof your Ears have heard: And this People are greatly beloved, and my Lord will assuredly ho∣nour them, and his Hand shall be continued to preserve them and defend them against all their Enemies whatsoever; and he doth reserve them to himself, and for a glori∣ous Work, that he hath to do by them; and he hath formed them for himself, and they cannot joyn with any of the Horns of the great Beast, neither can a Place of Honour pervert them from their perfect Way: but my Lord, he com∣passeth them about on every side, and hath kept them in the midst of Tryals, Reproaches and Sufferings, and covered them in the Heat, and in the Storm, till his Pleasure is to make further use of them; they are His, and not their Own; and they must fulfil His Will, and none besides; and they lie at Rest in Him, while Mountains are overturned, and while one Potsherd of the Earth breaks another; and this must be even till the appointed Time: And to say no more of them, though much more might be said, They are had in Remembrance before the Lord, to do with them even for his own Glory, and for this Nation's per∣petual Good, and to the Authority of the Most High, through them, shall Kings of the Earth, and Nations of the World bow and tremble; wherefore ye men, touch them not, neither do ye afflict them, even as you hope to prosper; remember their Cause, and suffer it not alwayes to be rejected, as it hath long been, but keep your selves free from the Injustice and Cruelty of them that have gone before you, who have been Merciless, and Oppressors of that People, even till my Lord hath confounded them, and brought them into Confusion;
for there is the weight of Blood, of Tyranny and Oppression lying upon the Nation in that People's Cause, and my Lord will revenge them in his Season; and though they are not weary of their Sufferings, but are in the Patience which beareth all things, yet the Nation can never be happy, nor its Government ever blessed, while this People are held in Bondage; and their Sufferings are deeply considered of the Lord, and the Season thereof is expiring towards an ; ad when this cometh to pass, then Wo unto the kingdom of Antichrist, and to the Whore and false Prophet, even when their strength is dryed up, by which they have made War against the Lamb, and his Followers; yea, Wo unto them, Great Fearfulness shall be upon all the World when the King of that People Reigns upon the Earth, and the time is at hand; blessed is the Man that wait  it, and blessed is he that is not offended in his Coming, but is prepar  receive him in his Appearing, which suddenly cometh upon all the World. And thus I have told the Lord's present Message unto you, which I received from him, and thus far I am clear; and whether you accept it, or reject it, my Peace and Reward is forever with him; who am a Subject of his Kingdom, and a Frie to this Nation, however otherwise judged by ignorant Men.

To the PRESENT DISTRACTED AND Broken Nation OF ENGLAND, And to all her INHABITANTS: A Presentation and Declaration from the Seed of God, and from the People called Quakers; with their Sense and Knowledge published, concerning the present Divisions and Confusions come to pass in the Land; with Mourning and Lamentation over it because of its Breaches, and the Causes thereof laid down, and discovered. And also, Good Counsel and Advice held forth, how Peace and Unity may be restored, and how the present Troubles may be Removed. OH! poor distressed Nation, and full of Troubles; How art thou bro∣ken and divided? How hath Divisions and Distractions compassed thee about, and entred into thy Bowels? And how are thy Inhabi∣tants and thy People divided, even to hatred one against another? and how are they filled, as with Mischief, one towards another, even as it were thirsting for the Blood of one another? Oh! How are thy Rulers and thy Subjects, thy Great Men and thy Poor, confounded amongst themselves? And how is the Wisdom of thy Wise men turned into Folly, and their Union into present Contention? and how do they seek the Overthrow one of another? and how do they lie in wait to be avenged one against another? And how are the Hearts of many filled with Envy, Contention and Revenge; and Love, Peace and Unity are far away; Meekness, Patience, and Long-suffering, which ought to be among thy People, seem to stand afar off? And oh Nation! this is the Day of thy Trouble, and the beginning of thy Sorrows. And forasmuch as it hath pleased the Lord God Almighty, to bring, and suf∣fer things thus to be brought to pass, as if he would make our Nation a Heap,
and suffer Destruction upon it; and having suffered the Rulers and Great Men to overcome and break down one another, and to rend and tear one another from o the Throne, pulling down others, and setting up themselves, even through their Ambition and Vain-glory, and for corrupted Ends to themselves, where∣by this our Nation is brought into present Confusion; and many are begotten, through these hings, into Fury, Heart-burnings and Maliciousness, as if men were ready to devour each one his Neighbour and their▪ Brother about Govern∣ment and Rue, being greatly divided and distracted in this matter; some cry∣ing up one way of Religion and Church, and Civil Government, and some crying up another way; being each one sort of People seeking themselves, and the prosperity of their own Interests, and to have their own desires accomplish∣ed; but few seeking the Lord, and to advance him in Truth and Righteousness: And because of this, there is no Establishment in the Earth, but Strife, and Contention, and Heart-burnings in the Bowels of the Nation, and great want of True Love, True Unity, and True Peace, and all the contrary doth abound among the people; because of which the Nation is subject to present Misery, even to Blood-shed and Murders, and liable also to greater Judgments, which may also come upon it because of these things; all which we have deeply consi∣dered th Mourning, and with Breakings of Heart, on the behalf of the Na∣tion, the Land of our Nativity▪ We have seen, we have seen the Cause of thy Distractions to be the Sins of thy Rulers and People; and we have seen the ef∣fect of them to be doleful and miserable unto thee, except the Hand of the Lord turn it backward. And oh! How do we Mourn and Laent, to see the Out▪ goings of Men▪ and the present Condition of the People and Rulers, in this the Day of their Trouble? Alas! they do not behave themselves towards the Lord that his Judgments may be turned away, they do not seek him in Truth and Righte∣ousness, they do not turn unto him with all their Hearts, neither do they trem∣ble at his Word; but they the rather reject his Counsel, and despise his Visitati∣on, and they seek themselves, and exalt their own Horn, and love the Honour of this World, and their hearts are hardened, and the great men seem to be utter∣ly insensible of what the Lord is a doing; but seek great things for themselves, and each one rejoying of another's Fall, and glorying in their Advantages one over another; one sort being first down, and another sort comes up, boasting themselves over the Fall of their Enemies, and not knowing that their time also is but very short. And thus is our poor Nation tossed to and fro, through the Ambition of men, who even make a Prey upon the poor peoples Persons and Treasure for their own corrupted Ends; and thy Rulers have not had respect unto the Counsel of the Lord, but seem to refuse the Way of Peace, and even add Fewel to the Fire of God's Wrath, by heaping up one Transgression upon another, and they receive not the Instructions of the Almighty. Behold, Oh Nation! Great Trouble is upon thee, and the Men that should Rule thee, and which have pretended to Govern thee, they do not walk in the Way of thy Peace, neither do they bring healing to thee. These things we have considered, and thus we Lament over thee, and over thy present State; Oh Nation! how art thou like an ungirded Vessel, that is ready to fall one piece from another? and how art thou like a Body without a Head, and all thy Ioynts out of order? and what Confusion art thou fallen into, which is thy present state, and art even as a Widdow without a Husband, and art even left comfortless unto this day, and ready to devour thy self through the Envy that lodgeth in thy own Bowels? Though thou hast had Kings over thee, and chosen thee Parliaments, and set up Protectors, and Committees and Councils have been created in thee, to have been as a Defence upon thee, and to have born the Scepter of thy Go∣vernment; but alas! all these have left thee, and thou art now as alone, and
left comfortless, even as a Widow unto this day, and the Staff of thy hand hath pierced thee, and thy strength and confidence hath betrayed thee, and them whom thou hast chosen have wrought no deliverance at all in thee, even the men that thou thoughtest should have healed thee, they have made thy wound more incura∣ble, and they in whom thou hast reposed trust, they have been deceitfull and treacherous in thee; for many have sought themselves, and who should be the greatest, and they have trisfled away many precious hours in vain contentions about Government, what it should be, and who should govern, while as no good thing hath been effected by them; but in the mean time of their delayes, and while they have been making themselves rich with the Nations Treasure, and loved this worlds perishing honor, and vain titles, the Nation hath starved for want of mer∣cy and just judgment, and the cause of its necessity hath been forgotten, and mer∣cy and truth, and the freedom of the people neglected, and the Cause of the Fa∣therless, Widow and Stranger, and the Cause of the afflicted people have they not respected: Oh Nation, the men that have sitten on thy Throne, they have left thee groaning under great Oppressions, wounded with the Spirit of Tyranny yet un-cast out, and thy people are yet unhealed, but the breach hath been made wi∣der, even by that Spirit which hath possessed thy Parliaments, thy Protectors, thy Councils, thy Committees, who hath proved Physitians of no value, but have bin the increasers of thy grief, and even because of their iniquities; and the sin of their Ambition and Oppression hath the Lord dealt thus with them, and suffered them to dash one another in pieces; and through Judgment unto themselves and thee, Oh Nation, are they at present ceased from thee, and thou art left alone, and without a Deliverer in the Earth, full of Troubles and Distractions: Oh that thou wouldst now look unto the Lord, and seek him in Righteousness, that he may heal thee; for there is none of all them that do pretend to rule thee, that do rightly proceed in the way of thy Deliverance, they do not apply healing Balm unto thy Wound, they rather add unto the cause of thy Sorrow, then remove it from thee; their hearts are not aright before the Lord, and how then should they prosper in their doings. All these things have we viewed, and pittied the condition of our Nation, and thus we do declare the very cause of these things that are come to pass in thee is in that, oh Nation, thou hast sinned, thou hast sinned, and the cry of thy Iniquities is come up before the Lord, even the sins of thy Rulers and thy People is the Cause of God's Displeasure against thee, and he is provoked through their Transgressions; in thee is found the Blood of the Innocent, in thee is found the Murder of Souls, in thee is found Treachery against God, and Hypocrisie & Dis∣simulation with God and men; in thee is found Pride & Oppression, Whoredom and Drunkenness, Stealing and Murder; in thee is found the very burden of Ini∣quity, & the full measure of Transgression, even the transgression of God's whole Law; deceit is found in thee, & unsoundness of heart, & unconstancy in all good things; multitude of hypocritical Fastings, Prayers and Services in thee is found; even de∣stroying Sins of all sorts do abound, and thou hast provoked the Lord God by thy Abominations: thy Rulers have been Oppressors, thy Teachers Deceivers of Souls, and thy People are froward and perverse against the Lord; in thee is found the men that judge for Rewards, and the Priests that preach for Hire, and the Prophets that divine for Money; thy Sins are like Israel's of old for number and greatness, and thou hast lost God's Favour, and gained his Fury by thy own doings, and thou art the very cause of this Misery, and hast brought it upon thy self; and because thou art departed from the Living God by thy Transgression, therefore hath he confounded thee, and turned thy Wisdom into Folly; and he is departed from thee, and out of thy Councils, and men are left to the counsels of their own hearts, and as it were ready to destroy one another, Ruler against Ru∣ler, and Neighbour and Friend full of strife one against another; and this is hap∣pened unto thee as a Judgment for thy Iniquities, who hast also nelected a glori∣rious Day of Visitation; thy Rulers and Inhabitants have been warned, and the
Cry of Repentance hath been sounded towards them all by a despised people, but warning hath not been regarded, but the word of the Lord rejected by thy Ru∣lers and People; and lo, what wisdom is there in them? not so much wisdom from God as can preserve them; but it may be just with the Lord to suffer them to drink the blood one of another, even because they have sinned against God, and rejected his counsel, therefore is this come to pass in the Nation; for hadst thou, o Nation, walked in the Light of the Lord, it had been better with thee; had eve∣ry one obeyed the Light in his own Conscience; and had every one sought the Lord, and not himself; had thy Rulers ruled for God, and had thy people been ruled of God, then this day had not been a day of Trouble, but it had been a day of Joy; and Sorrow and Anguish had been removed far from thee, and blessings had filled thy Habitations. And now whereas many wise men have been advising and consulting the peace of this our Nation, and they have given in their counsel for removing these Troubles, yet Peace and Unity seems to be far away, and though they have sought Peace for this Nation, yet they have not walked in the perfect way thereof; for innocency, truth, and simplicity have bin wanting, which God only will bless, and by flatteries and deceits, and the pollicy and wisdom of this World have they thought to make up thy breach, but it cannot be; for in the way of that proceeding will not the Lord be found in a needful time, and his presence hath been want∣ing in their counsels, and therefore the fruit of peace is not yet grown up, this we have seen, and therefore thus we do declare. O Nation, the inward cause of thy destractions must be removed, even thy iniquities must be forsaken, and thy transgressions repented of; thou must forsake thy former wayes and doings that are not right; thou must leave off thy hypocrisies and flatteries with God and men; thou must repent thee of thy profaneness, and of thy profession also; thy sin and thy righteousness must thou put away, which are both Abominations unto God; thou must cease to do evil, and learn to do well, and thou must be uncovered of thy sheeps cloathing, thy large profession of Religion, and the multitude of thy Prayers and Sermons, and the number of thy oblations and offerings, these things have not been pleasant unto the Lord from thee, but because hereof is he the rather provoked against thee, and thou must be stripped of thy filthy garments, and set as in the day that thou wast born, before thou canst be cloathed with di∣vine righteousness: and O Nation, thou must be changed, not in name onely, but in nature; thou must be converted, that the wrath of the Lord may be turned back from thee; every inhabitant in thee must become a fighter against the evil in his own heart, and the plague thereof must be sought out and removed; the sin must be forsaken that judgement may cease, and every one must cease to provoke the Lord, and no longer vex his Spirit within them; and every one must love the Light of Christ in his own conscience, and become a follower of it, that will lead him out of all sin; and every man must put off his Transgressions, and forsake him∣self, and lay down the enmity, and cast it out of his heart that he hath against persons, and he must war against the Enemies of his own Soul, and the Enemies of his  House must be ain, even his own Lusts, and even the evil Affections of his own heart must he become an Enemy unto; and every man must deny the false Teachers and Deceivers, and must come to be taught of the Lord, every one must turn to him, and come into his Covenant, and hear his Word, and obey his Voice, and become humble and meek, and must tremble at the Word of the Lord, aad must become upright and innocent. And O Nation, If it were thus with thee, then shouldst thou be a happy Peo∣ple; if thou dost these things, then shall all thy Breaches be healed, and thy Sorrows be turned into Joy, and the Lord shall cease to smite thee, and his Anger shall be turned clean away. This is our Counsel unto thee, Remove thy Iniquities by Repentance, be converted to the Lord, and he shall heal thee, and his Love shall be shed abroad; Peace, Plenty and Satisfaction, Unity and Concord shall be unto all thy Inhabitants, and the Lord himself shall be thy
King, thy Judge and thy Law-giver: he will judge thee with equity, and not with Oppression; he will teach thee in the perfect way, and thou shalt not err, he will defend thee from all thy Enemies: Oh Nation, if thou do these things, even turn to the Lord with all thy heart, that he may walk in thee, and dwell in thee, then should thy light break out of obscurity, and the dew of Mercies shall fall upon thee, and it should be unto thee as a Morning without Clouds, and thou shouldest be refreshed after all thy sorrow; the Nation should be happy, and the people blessed, and the Government of Peace and Truth should be esta∣blished, never to be confounded any more. And thus thy Iniquities being removed, the Plague should cease, and the cause of destruction being taken away, no fruit thereof should appear; where∣fore let men cease to hatch Mischief one against another, and to seek vengeance one of another, and let them seek with all speed and sincerity to get victory over their own sins, and vengeance may be taken upon their own transgressions; and this is our Councel for the healing of our Nations breach, and for turning away the Anger of the Lord. But and if, O Nation, thou continuest in thy perversness, and in transgressions which the Lord hates; and if thou wilt not turn to him that smites thee, and love his Rod that corrects thee, but wilt always grieve the Spirit of the Lord, and be obstinate & stout-hearted against the Lord, and his re∣proofs; and if thou wilt continue in thy accustomed sins, then shall the reward thereof be upon thee, even breach upon breach, and one Judgment upon another; and Mercy shall be with-holden from thee, and the Dew shall not fall upon thee, but thou shalt be as a barren Heath, and thou shalt be given up to consume thy self in mischief, and in thy heart-burnings one towards another; if thou wilt set up Rulers of thy own proud and ambitious men, and will not chuse the Lord to Rule over thee, but reject him and his People, then shall thy Breach never be healed by the Men whom thou chusest, but through them shall thy Breach be more desperate, and thy Wound be made more incurable; and if thou wilt set up Teachers that teach for filthy Lucre, and Prophets that divine for Money, and Priests that preach for Hire, and will not receive the Covenant of the Lord, and him to be thy Teacher by his Spirit, then shalt thou err in thy ways, and stumble and fall, and never know perfect Peace with God, nor one with another; but as thou lovest Oppression and Deceit, and walkest in Transgression, so shall it be unto thee, and thou must eat the Fruit of thy own doings, Misery upon Miseries shall be upon thee, and thus shalt not see the Face of the Almighty to refresh thee: Wherefore, O Nation! consi∣der, before the Night comes upon thee, when no way will be found by thee to be dilivered; for in the middst of thy Confusions God is a working; he hath a Work to bring forth, which shall be a Work of great Mercy and Deliverance, or of Sorrow and of great Judgment, even to the whole Land. And as for us, we hereby declare unto thee, We are not thy Enemies, we seek not thy hurt, nor do we desire Vengeance upon our Enemies, we seek not thy Destruction; but we desire thy Repentance, that thou mayst be healed: we have not the spirit of Mischief and Rebellion in our hearts towards thee, neither are we for one Party or another, nor do we side with one sort against another, neither do we joyn our selves to this sort or the other, nor do we war against any by carnal Weapons, neither shall we ever provoke the Nation against us, otherwise then by our Righteous and Holy Walking; and we do declare, that we are not for Men nor Names, nor shall we joyn with this or that sort of men, but as they act Righteousness alone; nor any thing that yet appears, can we fully embrace or rejoyce in; for they are all corrupted in their ways, and that cursed spirit of Self-seeking seems to be the Rule of, and to leaven their principal Acti∣ons; and we rather yet chuse to suffer by all, as for a long time we have done al∣reapy, then to lose our Integrity and Innocency, by joyning to any in their unjust ways; for we reject all Places of corrupted Honour, and we are yet kept free. It is true, we are a People gathered of the Lord into one Spirit, and though a Peo∣ple little in Account, and very low in Reputation, and greatly reproached, and
suffering People by all sorts of men, yet we are a people loved of the Lord, and his Presence is among us, and his Dread filleth our hearts; and though we are ed as a cast-out people, yet are we dreadful unto the Wicked, and must be their Fear; for we have chosen the Son of God to be our King, and he hath chosen us to be his People; whose Kingdom is not of this World, neither is his Warfare with carnal Weapons, neither is his Victory by the murdering and killing of mens Persons; but we are given up to bear and suffer all things for his Name's sake; and our present Glory and Renown therein stands till the ap∣pointed time of our Deliverance, without the Arm of Flesh, or any multitude of an Host of men; this we declare: And oh Nation, though we have born thy Reproaches these many years, and have passed under the Rod of thy wicked Ru∣s and People, and have been afflicted through their Hard-heartedness, though we never have provoked thee otherwise, then by our Well doing; and though Per∣, Imprisonments, Whippings, Banishments, and all hard things have been out Portion from thee, yet this hath been for Righteousness sake, and not for any Evil-doing; and we have born all these things in much Patience; and we are not now provoked against thee, to seek thy Hurt, or to work E∣vil is thee; and though thou hast smitten us, yet would we have thee to be healed; and though thou hast sought to destroy us, yet would we have thee to Repent, and be saved: and we are at this day thy Mourners, and are afflicted for thee in our hearts, even because thou hast provoked the Lord against thee, though we do rejoyce in the Judgments which smites thee, yet we mourn for thee who hath deserved such wofull Stripes, and also because thou refusest the Way of Peace, and countest them that reprove thee even thy Enemies, and hardnest thy heart against God's Instructions, and counteth his free-born people thy Bond∣slaves, who hath not any large Portion, nor great places of honour in this Na∣tion, nor any thing to glory in from thee but Sufferings, Afflictions and Tribu∣lations: Where is the place in this Nation that we have not been reproached? In what Street have we not been reviled? And in what Prison have we not been unjustly imprisoned? And among what sort of people have not we been hated? And what one of thy Judges & Rulers can clear themselves before the Lord from the guilt of our unjust Sufferings? O Nation, our Portion in thee for these many  hath been thy cruel reproaches; our greatest place of honour in thee hath been under thy cruel Oppressions, and these things, and the guilt thereof will God charge upon thee, and reward thee for, one time or other; yet notwithstand∣ing all this, our present desires for thee are good, and not evil, that thou mayst be saved, and not destroyed; healed, and not wounded unrecoverably; and we would not add unto thy grief by any just provocation, through any evil towards thee; neither would we work offence in thee, further then what thou takest for Righteousness sake, and for the exercise of our pure Conscience. And though there hath been in this Nation divers and sundry overturnings of  days, and some have been turned out, and others brought into place, each one sort of them crying against the evil of another, and promising to accomplish such and such good things in this Nation; yet alas, what is there effected unto this day? What Freedom and true Liberty to Subjects more then was many years ago? What Oppressions taken off from the people? what establishment in Govern∣ment? Alas, not any of these things are accomplish'd, neither see we a right thing prded, & rightly prosecuted by any party yet appearing; but the cause hard∣ly yet appears carryed on by any among them, which can be said of it, This is of the Lord, and is perfectly right, and the Lord will prosper it: for the most of the men that have yet appeared on the Throne, they have rejected the Word of the Lord, and his Counsel; and what Wisdom is there in them? only the Policy, and Subtilty and Wisdom of this World, wherein they build, but the Lord throweth  even before it be finished? and they consult therein, and the Lord dasheth to ; they set up, but he pulls down, because they want his Spirit and Wis∣dom, and his Authority amongst them; and they are as the Potsherds of the
Earth, that the Iron Rod must break in pieces. And this we declare, The Men (yet) seem not to appear in all these parties which are worthy to handle the Lord's Scep∣ter, and to be Crowned with the Honour of Authority in his Government; but even this Part) and the other Party seems to be unworthy to Rule for the Lord; for they appear to be choaked with the Honour of this World, and corrupted thereby, and uncapable of re∣ceiving that Anointing that Men must have that shall truly Rule for God: And though many in our dayes, that have ruled over us, have promised great Things to the Nation, yet we see all hitherto have wanted Power to perform, and have not been blessed with the Presence of the Lord, so as this Nation hath not been heal∣ed and redeemed by them; and we are utterly out of all Hopes of this Party or the other Party, of this Man or that Man, to bring Salvation unto this Nation, from all its Bonds and Oppressions; for we know, whatsoever men profess to do, yet they cannot perform any good Thing, nor Rule for God in our Nation, till that themselves be reformed and ruled by him, and have the Spirit of God pour∣red upon them for such a Work: And this we declare, Till that a man, or men, be ruled of the Lord, they can never rightly rule for him, nor bring Deliver once and Freedom to an oppressed Nation; though men may and have promised much, yet their Fruit is but little; and thou, O Nation, hast long been deceived by such men, who have flattered thee with the multitude of fair words, and promised thee deliverance: and hereby mightest thou learn Wisdom, O England, never more to rest under the sha∣dow of such men; make no more a Mountain to cover thy self; rest no more un∣der the shadow of dead Trees, that want the Vertue of God; but now look at the Living God, and wait for that King of Righteousness and Peace, whose Right alone i s to Rule; for he alone can bring Salvation to thee, he alone can heal thy Breaches, even Iesus Christ, whose coming is at the Door: and in the mean time, O Nation, while he is absent, thou art dry, and barren, and empty, thou art tossed and shaken, and thou art tossed and perplexed, and canst not be rightly comforted; for men shall not be a Rest unto thee, but one after another shall they be overturned; for it is the Lord alone, and under his Government shall People find Rest and Freedom from all Oppres∣sion: For, What is a King? and what is a Parliament? what is a Protector? and what is a Council, or any other sort of men, while the Presence of the Lord is not with them, and while his Spirit and Authority is wanting to them? What can any of these bring forth? none of all these whatsoever, if the Lord be not chief in them and amongst them, and his Counsel their only Guide, shall be any other∣wise unto this Nation, then as a broken Reed to lean upon, and no more then a Shaddow, which shall not save the people from the heat, nor from the storm; this we know, and this we declare in the Name of the Lord. And we are not for Names, nor Men, nor Titles of Government, nor are we for this Party, nor against the other, because of its Name and Pretence; but we are for Iustice and Mercy, and Trust and Peace, and true Freedom, that these may be exalted in our Nation; and that Good∣ness, Righteousness, Meekness, Temperance, Peace and Unity with God, and one with ano∣ther, that these things may abound, and be brought forth aboundantly: such a Govern∣ment are we seeking and waiting for, wherein Truth and Righteousness, Mercy and Iustice, Unity and Love, and all the Fruits of Holiness may abound; and all the con∣trary be removed, cast out, and limitted: And we are not for such and such Names and Titles of Government, that promise fair things, and perform nothing; but if a Council, if a Parliament, if any one Man, or a number of Men whatsoever, shall have the Spirit of the Lord poured on him or them, and shall be anointed of the Lord for such an End and Use, to Govern this Nation, under such only shall the Nation be happy, and enjoy Rest from such men fitted of the Lord, and called by him; and under such a Government of Truth and Righteousness shalt thou O Nation, enjoy Rest from all thy Travels; and under such a Government shall the Righteous rejoyce, and the whole Land sing for Joy of Heart, when Tyranny and Oppression shall be clean removed, Strife and Contention and Self-seeking utter∣ly abandoned, and when Peace and Truth flows forth as a Stream, and the Lord alone rules in thy Rulers, and he the Principal amongst them; and under such
men, and such a Government only, and not under any other, shalt thou, O Na∣tion, be happy, and thy people a free People. Wherefore, O Nation, when wilt thou begin to look to the Lord? when wilt thou begin to set up Him, and not man? when wilt thou mind his Power and Pre∣sence in and through men, more then any men themselves? when shall it once be, O ye people of our Nation, that ye will seek after him, to be the principal and chief Power among you? Oh! let your eye be turned to the Lord alone, that he may deliver you, and bring Salvation and Freedom; and look no more at men, but only as they are in him, guided by his Spirit, & only expect good from men as they are guided by the Lord; and then shall you not ever any more be deceived, as long you have been with Parliaments, with Councils, with Armies, nor any others; for, in these have you trusted, and not in the Lord; from these have you expected great Things without him, whenas, alas! what shall men accomplish? or, what can they bring forth while they reject the Counsel of the Lord, and his Word, as hitherto they have done? and therefore hath he broke them, and con∣founded them; yea, and he will break them and crush them under his Rod, even till they come to learn his Judgments, and know him the alone Power, and give Honour to him that doth whatsoever he will; and he will overthrow it once and again, even till he comes, whose Right it is to Rule, and he is at work in this his Day; and because of Iniquities doth he visit with Tribulation, and through great Tribulation, and overturning of Men and Powers, will he advance his own King∣dom and Government; and the end of all these things shall bring forth his Glory; and men that will not honour him, by dealing Righteously in their Day upon Earth, they must honour him in their destruction at their Latter-end; and let not men glory one over another, while some are put down, and others set up; but let them all know, they have but each sort their hour, and their end will come even as others: for an everlasting Kingdom and Government will God setup, that must rule over all, and this is the hope of a poor dispised people, though for present hated of all, and sought to be destroyed by all, yet our Souls are anchored and staid even in the sure Promises of our God, in this the day of the Nations trouble; and though we are poor, and rejected of all, and have nothing to glory in among any party or sort of people, but even in our Reproaches and Sufferings which we sustain from all, yet have we perfect rest in God, and satisfaction over all these distracti∣ons, we know him in whom we have believed, and we trust in the shadow of his Wing, and we are not of a doubting heart concerning what can come, or whom∣soever do rule, for this we know, though all seek after our blood, yet he can deli∣ver us if he will; we know him that can do all things, and if he save none can de∣stroy, if he bless none can curse; him we know, and in him we rest, and we give our power in all things to him, & not unto mortal man whose breath is in his nostrils, who must perish as the dung; we cannot be afraid of their horror, nor can we be drawn by their love, but we trust in his Name, and under his defence shall we be saved; we give our power to him, to be defended and preserved by him alone, and we are well content with our Sufferings, and murmur not, our Sufferings are our present Crown; but yet, Wo unto that Authority which maketh us to suffer, and wo  the men upon whom God shall charge the guilt of our Oppressions; and wo unto that Spirit that is found acting against Gods Anointed: Behold ye Mountains of the Earth, behold ye Rulers, and ye People, the Lord hath blessed his People, and every Tongue that riseth up in witness against them shall be condemned, and every Weapon that is formed against them shall be broken; this is our hope in this gloomy day, and the hope of a Kingdom of Righteousness and Peace which must be set up, is our refresh∣ment in this day of trouble; and let not our Enemies glory over us, forthough we be very poor, yet shall we be made rich, and though we have no carnal weapon, yet shall we conquer; and thus have we declared our selves in much plainness and sincerity to our Nation whom we love, and whose present condition we pitty and and lament over, and we are Friends to an appearance of good, that may come forth in Truth and Sincerity, and as Righteousness do appear in any, we are ready to
joyn with it in our Prayers and Desires, yea, and otherwise; even that which hath the Image of our God upon it, whenever it shall appear, we shall rejoyce there∣in, and be glad to see it prosper: For, for the establishing of Righteousness in the Earth have we laboured; and it cannot be charged upon us, That we have sided with one or another; for we have beheld all hitherto out of the Right Way, as we have said; but we truly seek the general Good of our Nation: and though we are accounted so and so, yet we have not lost true Reason nor Understanding; but we well know what is wrong, and what would be right, even in way of Government; but the time appears not to be yet, when Innocency and Simplicity of Heart can be embraced; for men are yet too wise in their own wisdom, and cannot receive the Counsel of the Lord, that they may prosper, and therefore are they, and must they be confounded amongst themselves, and dashed one against another, till they learn the Way of Righ∣teousness and Truth. The substance of this was given forth the Twentieth Day of the Tenth Moneth, 1659. being moved of the Lord by his Spirit thereunto, through Edward Burroughs.
A PRESENTATION TO LONDON. Being an Answer to the Young-Men and Appren∣tices; returned to some part of their Petition and Address, directed by them to the Mayor, Alder∣men and Common-Council Assembled: And this is directed to them, for their better Information; and to the Citizens of London, for their better Satisfaction, if the Lord shall so work upon their Hearts, as to bring them to Moderation and the Spirit of Meekness, fit for his INSTRUCTIONS. WHereas you say, It hath pleased the God, and only Wise God, for yours and the Nation's Crying-Sins, to manifest his Displeasure for many years together against these Nations; and yet, you say, this Honou∣rable City hath been no great Sharers in the Calamity, which your Brethren in other parts have suffered, &c. Answer, Friends, its very true, because of yours and the Nations Crying-Sins the Lord's Displeasure is against you and the Nation, and his Judgments bang over your City, and the Nation, even because of your Crying-Sins: O! the Pride, the Hypocrisie, and Double-dealing, and Wantonness, and all other, the abominable Wickedness which abounds among you, which are your Sins, which indeed is the Cause of God's Displeasure against you and the Nation, which he will shew one way or other upon you; for Iniquity is full: But seeing that your Sins have provoked the Lord, is it not now time to come to Humility, and Repentance, and to forsake your Sins, that the Displeasure of the Lord may be turned from you? or, Is it a time for you to be envious, and to seek Revenge upon Men, and to make Insurrections, and Tults, and Bloodsheds, and so to add Sin unto your Sins? Its not a time for you to pro∣ceed thus; for hereby you will gain God's Displeasure more unto you, and not turn his Wrath away. And its true, this City hath been wonderfully preserved from the Miseries and Calamities, which have come upon some in this Nati∣on; and therefore, its time for you to answer the Lord's Love unto you, by Meekness, and Fear, and Righteousness; and not to abuse his Mercies, by op∣posing the Work of the Lord, and setting your selves to fight as against him in his Proceedings; though the time is at hand, even because of your own mul∣tiplyed Iniquities, when you may bring Calamity and Misery upon this City, and it may partake of the Nation's Tribulations and Sorrows.
And then you complain of the general decay of Trading: But what can you attribute that unto, but to your Sins also? For there hath been so much Dou∣ble dealing, Deceit and Wickedness in the way of your Trading, that it is just with the Lord to turn your former Mercies into a present Judgment in that re∣spect; but in this case you ought to be contented, and to be still, and not to murmur against God, nor against any others in the Nation; but the rather to Repent, that the Wrath may be turned from you. And whereas you seem to make an Appeal to your Lord Mayor, Aldermen; Common-Council-Men of this City; as if they should be Instruments for the settling of the Three Nations, and for the removing of the Troubles, and for the Peace of the Church, &c. Answ. Alas my Friends! These Troubles, Distractions and Miseries that are approached, and which further may ensue, is the Fruit and Effect of yours and the Nations Sins; and cannot be removed nor remitted, but as you and the Nation repenteth, and turneth from your Sins; so that you take a wrong course to remove the Judgments of the Lord from you and this Nation: for its cer∣tain, That Repentance from sin, that removes the Judgment for sin; and its not adding one sin to another; neither is it in the hand of those to whom you do appeal, to remove the Judgments of the Lord; for what are they but Mortal Men, like your selves, and Transgressors with your selves, and have a part in the Sins acted by you, and must have a part in the same Judgments, though you stir them up to improve themselves and their Tallent for the Peace of the Church, as you say; whenas, alas! its Jesus Christ only that must keep his Church in Peace, by his good Spirit; and not Mortal Men, with Mortal Weapons: Though you say, The Discharge of their Trust may make these Nations Happy, or leave them Miserable. To which I say, If they be faithful to their Trust, then they will keep your City in Peace, and doubtless they would be blessed therein; but yet the Happiness of these Nations dependeth not upon them, nor upon what they can do; for while many are supposing that they improve their Trust, its possible they may be persecuting Righteousness under the Name of Heresie, and persecuting Christ in his People under the Name of a Deceiver & false Prophet; this hath often come to pass in this City and Nation, men have improved their Power and Places to the Dishonour of God, and the persecuting Christ in his Members, while as they have been thinking they have been punishing Sin, Heresie and Error; and in such cases some have improved their Tallents not truly for God, but rather against him. But whereas you say, You humbly present, That the Priviledges of the Gospel, the Faithful Preaching and Dispencing of God's Holy Word and Sacraments, with the Labour of so many of his Faithful Servants in the Ministry; and you humbly desire the Ministry may be Countenanced and Encouraged, the Universities upheld and main∣tained, &c. Answ. Alas my Friends! What do you think concerning the Lord God? Surely you have low Thoughts of him, and little Belief in him; Do not you think he will maintain the Priviledges of the Gospel, and the faithful Preach∣ing and Dispensing of his Word, and his faithful Ministry without you: Do you think that he hath forgotten to be Gratious, or that his Power is insuffici∣ent to maintain his own Cause, and to uphold the Rights and Priviledges of his own Kingdom? Do you think that he hath need of you, or a Multitude of wild and heady Men and Youth to fight in his Cause, to uphold his Gospel, and Ministry, and Ministers? Alas! no, you are deceived in this matter; for his own Arm shall do all this, and he will do it without you, and not be beholding to you in this matter: His Gospel, nor the Priviledges of it, shall not fall; the true Ministry, the Preaching and Dispensing of God's Word and Ordinan∣ces shall not perish, though you be silent; for the Lord by his own Power will maintain and carry on these things, and all others belonging to his Kingdom,
without the help of Mortal Men, or without the help of the Arm of Flesh: so that you may put up your Swords, and be still in this matter, and leave it to God, who is sufficient for these things, without a multitude of men, or without the Arm of Flesh: For I must tell you, that the faithful Teachers of God's Word, and the faithful Ministry, desire not your help to prosecute their Cause, and the Cause of the Gospel; but they trust to the Lord to be maintained, countenanced and encouraged by him alone, who is sufficient in that cause; though its true, the false Ministers, and the antichristian Teachers through all Christendom, for many Generations, they have sought unto the Arm of flesh to set them up, to maintain and defend them, and their Gospel, and false Church; thus it is through the Popes Dominion, and among some Protestants also; they cry unto the Magi∣strates, unto the Kings, and Parliaments, for the making cruel Laws to defend them; and to the rude world they cry, Help us, and save us, and defend us, by fight∣ing with Carnal Weapons, for Heresies, and Errors, and such like: and they stand in their Ministry, in their Call to it, and Maintenance of it, and defence in it by the Arm of flesh, and their Church is upheld thereby also: but this is but Antichrists way, and these are Antichrists Ministers, and his false Church hereby is defended in the World; and this shews, that the Weapon of the Spirit of God is wanted by them, which the Apostles had; and its very doubtful, O ye Apprentices of London, that your Ministers have prayed you, and preached you into such a work, as that you should stand up to maintain them, and fight for them and their church, against such that do oppose them; but I must tell you, if their Defence be not in another hand, then in yours, they are like to come to perpetual ruin, and their Gospel, and their Teaching, and their Sacraments, & their Church cannot stand, if they have not the Lord's Help more then yours. And as for the Universities, which you contend for; alas! many of you are ignorant concerning them, and what Abomination is committed among them; oh! if you knew but the Pro∣phaneness, and Ungodliness and Ill-education that is among them, it would turn your zeal for them backwards: and its not from humane Studies that the faithful Mi∣nisters of Christ come; but who are so indeed, are made so by the Gift of God's E∣ternal Spirit, both in this Age, and in Ages past. So that, O ye Apprentices, Be still, be still, and do not ruin your selves and your City, by Rage, and Fury, and Disor∣ders, upon such a Proceeding; for your ground of Quarrel is not perfectly good, nor your Endeavour in the Cause aforesaid well accepted with the Lord. But if your Quarrel be upon the account, or about the matter of Church and Ministry, leave that to the Lord, and to your Ministers, that they may de∣fend themselves, their Church, and Ordinances and Worship by the Spirit of God, if they have it; for that is the Weapon of Ministry, Church and Gos∣pel-Warfare; and not Carnal Weapons, nor the multitude of an Host of Men: Let your Ministers come forth in the best authority of spirit that they have, and plead the cause of their Worship, and Gospel and Ministry, like Christians, and not like Iews and Heathens; for they use Carnal Weapons, killing and mur∣dering about Church and Religion; that is the Papists Practice, and not the Practice of the Saints: So that ye Apprentices, seeing you state your Quarrel against the Army, upon the account of Church and Ministry, my Advice is to you, Proceed no further upon that ground; but give your Trust to the Lord, for the maintaining of all things related to his own Kingdom. But the Cry is, Those Sectaries, those Sectaries, away with them: Your Trouble seems to be con∣cerning them, lest they prevail; but wherefore are you troubled in this mat∣ter, like as if you knew not that what the Lord purposeth must come to pass? who are of God, will stand, this you need not doubt; and who are not, will come to nought; and its vain for Mortal Man to oppose the Lord's Purpose: but this was the Cry in dayes past. How did the Bishops and Prelates in their dayes cry against the Non-confor∣mists, as Hereticks, and such like, even as the Ministers now cry against Secta∣ries?
But consider, how did the Bishops proceed, but in being the chief Cause themselves of raising War against the then Non-conformists, thinking thereby to have smitten them all? but you know it proved otherwise; and as they thought to do unto others, so was it done unto them; which thing may be an Example to you: For as they thought to have destroyed the then called Puritans, in like manner were themselves destroyed; and this may possibly fall upon you: There∣fore consider; for I tell you, as an equal man between you and them, that there is more Sincerity towards God, and Fear of his Name, in some of them called Sectarians, then there is amongst you, and your Ministers; though I do not here justifie the Sectarians (so called) in all things, neither do I in every thing condemn your Ministers; but this I say, and do know, If that you and your Mi∣nisters raise a War against those called Sectarians, the effect thereof will prove your own Sorrow, and their Advantage: So this is my Advice to you, rest and be still, and that will prove your own Peace and Happiness. Therefore take heed, and beware; lest ye oppose and gain-say the Work and Power of God, which his purpose is to bring to pass in this his Day, who is setting up his King∣dom in the midst of Tribulations, that comes upon men. The second Particular humbly desired by you is, The Freedom and Priviledges of Parliaments, as being the Great Charter of the People, which you account very dear un∣to you, and by which you hope to see (you say) a Settlement in Church and State; and you humbly conceive that to be the probable means to establish the true Protestant Religion, reform the Laws, secure the Liberties, promote Learning, &c. Answ. Now Friends, do but truly consider, and with a humble Mind, what the Work of the Lord hath been in these Nations for divers years, and how he hath proceeded to overthrow, and overturn Powers and Authorities, Princes and Rulers, and made them of no account before him; and though the Instru∣ments which God hath used in that matter, in plucking down Men and Powers, have been as much corrupted as those that have been overturned; and whenas the measure of Iniquity in one was filled up, the Lord threw that Power down even as it were by the Iniquity of another; and because of the Oppressions of Rulers a∣mongst us, the Nation hath groaned, and been left without a Comforter from any man, and could not repose Confidence in its Princes and Rulers; and this was, that the Nation might look unto the Lord, and that through him they might be saved, and expect healing from him alone; and in all these Overturnings you need not fear, but the Hand of the Lord hath been in them, and his Arm hath suffered, and even brought these things to pass; and therefore why should you murmer against God, & be unsatisfied in what he hath done? for its he alone, and not another, that must settle a happy and lasting Peace both in Church and State, and he that must establish true Religion, and reform the Laws, and secure our Li∣berties, and preserve our Lives, and encourage all Vertue; it is the Lord that will do all these things for this Nation, and its not any other in whose Hand the Salvation of a Person or a Nation is; and how he shall do this, and by what means, leave that to the Lord, limit him not to or from any thing; for, if the Nation can be but patient and still, he will bring to pass these things in his day and season. Wherefore O Nation and City, Be still, be still, and be patient under the Hand of God, which is upon you; combine not Mischief one against another, nor desire the overthrow one of another; but be still, be still, this is the Word of the Lord to you, be at quiet in your spirits, and wait upon the Lord, to receive what he brings forth: For O ye Ap∣prentices and Young-Men of London, your rude proceedings in these causes will but destroy your selves, and your City, if you proceed any further; for what is a mul∣titude of men, but as Bryers and Thornes in battel before the Lord? if he purpose a Work, you cannot prevent it; and if he prevent a Work, its vain for you to endea∣vour it; these things are in the Hand of the Lord, and Nations are unto him as Clay in the hand of a Potter: but now I do not speak as your Enemy; for I love your City, & wish it well. Alack! neither will I justifie the Army, nor the men that you oppose in
opposition to you; for their ways are corrupted I know, and their own Ends they seek; and they are for Condemnation, some of them; and their Iniqui∣ties are fully ripe, and God will bring them down; but yet, let you them alone, the Lord will deal with them, and he can execute his Judgement with his own Hand without you; and if you can be but quiet for a little season, it will make for your Peace hereafter; but if your spirits rage and swell, you may work Misery unto your selves, and to your City; but you cannot redeem it from Misery. So do no talk of the Church, as if you would Fight to uphold it, leave that to the Lord; for Christ will look to that, to Govern it, and Preserve it out of all, and from all its Enemies, and it belongs not unto you; but that which the Lord requires of you, is Patience and Submission to his Will, and to be still, till he appears with Salvation and Deliverance to this City and Nation, to deli∣ver them from all Oppression, and Oppressors; whose Coming is at hand, and blessed are all they who are found in Patience at his Coming.

TO THE Present Assembly, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER: The Consideration of a Servant of the Lord upon the Present State of Affairs; presented unto you for to read and consider, as Informations unto you concerning pre∣sent Proceedings in this Nation. FRIENDS, ALL these Overturnings, and almost wonderful Changings, that do come to pass in this Nation, they are all effected through the Justice of the Lord's Hand, and his Hand and Power is in and over all these things; and it all Particulars which have happened since your first appearing on the Throne were accompted, what hath come to pass but hath been accomplished and suffered to be by the hand of the Lord? But particularly, of the present state of things, and this last Interruption which happened unto you; Was it not a just Reproof upon you from the Lord, though effected in Ambition, and by corrupted Instruments? For have you not promised great things unto this Nation, in mat∣ters of Freedom and Liberty? But what have you done? Even left this Nation travelling under great and sore Vexations, and undelivered from the Bondage of Oppres∣sions; though you have had time oftentimes put into your hands, wherein you might have done good things for the Lord, and for this Nation, and Righteous∣ness might have been established amongst you, and in the Nation; but you neg∣lected many precious dayes, and effected not many good things: It would be large to instance the particular Oppressions that yet remain almost upon all sorts of peo∣ple in this Land, which might have been removed long ere this day, had you bin faithful to God: But because from day to day you have been rather careless, and ser∣ved your selves more then the Lord, therefore hath he suffered you to be interrupted once and again, and reproved by a Generation of men, as unfaithful as your selves. Well, But to pass all this, though much may be said, you are now again at the stern of Government, and on the Throne, and I dare not but say it is of and by the Lord, and that he hath done it, contrary to the expectations of many; and what his End is in it remains with him; but I am sure one Cause is, that you may exe∣cute part of his Wrath upon that Treacherous Generation of Hypocritical and De∣ceitful men (some of the Army I mean) some of whom have been deceitful to God, and treacherous to the Nation, and who have been fearful Hypocrites by a shew of Religion more then others, and have mocked God as it were, and his People. I need not say to you, how that many of them were raised up from a low Estate; and instead of servnig the Nation, became their Lords and Oppressors; they have a∣bused
the Lord's Mercy to them, and exalted themselves, and became as great Op∣pressors, and as grievous to the Nation, as ever they were that went before them; and some of them took the very Titles and Estates of their Enemies, and followed their evil spirit also, though the Lord was Long-suffering to them, and gave them a day, and put opportunity into their hands, wherein they might have done good: but they also neglected to serve God, and the Nations, to serve themselves; and be∣cause of the Ambition and Pride of some of them, the Lord suffered them to make this last Interruption upon you, which was great Treachery in mans account, that thereby their measure might be filled up, and that he might give you occasion a∣gainst them, and suffer you to be filled with Indignation towards them, to break them to pieces: And what you do to some of them, in casting them out, and af∣flicting them, you are but God's Executioners therein; you are the Executioners of his Anger, in what you do to them; and who shall prevent you, or forbid you to go on? for they have long enough dissembled with the Nation, in professing more then others, and doing less; and their Downfall is now come. And God hath look∣ed upon you to be hard-hearted and cruel enough, and very fit Executioners of Vengeance upon such men, as I have mentioned. But now concerning you, and your present state, as you are in present Place and Power, I have something to say to you; Though they are fallen, and you yet stand, and you have a little time after them; but this I say, do not glory over their Fall, neither glory as though you should stand forever; for they were not greater Sinners then you are, neither are you one whit more Righteous then some of them; but you are as sure to fall, as they are fallen, with no less measure of Dis∣honour and Affliction then is come upon them; and you are in your last Hour; and I dare not say, that God expects much more from you, then for the End a∣foresaid (viz.) To be the Executioners of Iustice upon men as sinful as your selves: So do not glory over them that are fallen; but know, that your time also is but short, and your Fall may prove to your Destruction, and theirs may prove to make them better, and refine them: And if God hath chosen you to execute some part of his Wrath upon them, for their Wickedness, he will doubtless find Instruments to ex∣ecute his Wrath upon you, else he will do it with his own Hand; for he purpo∣seth not to spare you; for your Sins cry as loud as any other People, and the Op∣pressions are as great under you, as under them whom you condemn. And I de∣sire, if there be any good men amongst you, that such who are wise may consider, and mind the Hand of the Lord in and through all these things that are come to pass; for God is working as well as you, he is seeking to set up a Kingdom as well as you, and his Government and yours cannot stand together; and he will make you know, that he is stronger, and his Government of more force, and your kingdom cannot stand in place with his. Therefore oh that you would take heed! oh that you would be wise, if so be some of you may be spared! and be not too zealous in your way, nor too furious in your proceedings, do but to others as you intend to receive from others, and from the Lord; and go not beyond your Commi∣sion; for a Permission at least you have from God, even to scourge Hypocrites, and to be a Judgment upon that Hypocritical seeming Religious Generation of men aforesaid, which have many a time as it were mocked God, & pretended love to him with their Lips, when their Hearts have yearned after Self-honour, and Treasures of this world; I say, your present hour and permission is for this end, but not to persecute the people of the Lord, nor to destroy God's Heritage; but if you shall extend your Power unto such a work, and if you do persecute the In∣nocent without cause, and make war against the Lamb & his Followers, and make Laws, and execute them to the oppression of the Saints of the Most High, then you go beyond your Commission; for God hath not called you unto this, but to be Instrument in another Cause. And the Children of Zion, they trust in the Living God, & fear not the terror of mighty men, neither can they be afraid at the roar∣ing of the Sea, nor at the present threatning of the Heathen; for God is with them.
And I say to you, The Servant of the Lord hath pondered and considered all these proceedings, and viewed the present state of things at this day, and there is no Vision from God unto you of Peace and Comfort, nor of a happy and last∣ing Government, as you now stand: If any Prophet shall divine this unto you, he speaks what he hath not from the Lord, but the Vision of his own Heart, and he deceives you and himself; for you are not established upon a right Foundati∣on, neither are you acted by a right Spirit, which can truly Govern for God; but the Spirit of Wrath and Fury is put into you, for the work which you are called. And I know not how to warn you, that you do not persecute the People of God; For why? It may be you must fill up your measure of Wickedness there∣by that God may break you perpetually; yet the less will be your Judgment, if you do it not; but and if you do it, the Lord will take occasion against you, to wound you, and you shall never be healed; and as you do afflict others, so, and much more shall it be done unto you from the Lord. Wherefore consider what I have said; for this is the Vision of the Almighty unto you, that shall not go unfulfil∣led: And what you do, you must do it quickly; for your time is short and your Power will God subdue; and his Kingdom and Power will he speedily exalt over your heads, and make you and the Nations know, that he is God, and that all Power is with him, and that he can do whatsoever he will; and it is his Right alone to reign, and his Childrens Portion to possess the Kingdom with him. Let the whole Earth, and all the Powers thereof, Bow and Tremble before him: let not your Hearts be stout and rebellious against him; for he can grind you to Powder, and sink you into Confusion and Misery, as a Stone into the Sea. This was directed for the hands of the Speaker in Parliament, and accor∣dingly was given to William Lenthel, being inclosed to him with these Line following. Friend, THE inclosed I do commend unto thee, for to present unto the House, and to endea∣vour sincerely the reading of it in your Assembly; for it is of special Concernment to you all: and in the Name of the Lord, and by his Spirit, I do charge thee not to be neg∣ligent in this matter, as though it were not of worth to you; and I do lay it upon thee, as a Work of Righteousness and Truth, to be done by thee. as thou wilt answer the contrary in the dreadful Day of God, when the King of Righteousness shall judge thee and all Mankind. Edw. Buroughs. The 24th of the 11th Moneth, 1659.
AN ANSWER TO A DECLARATION Of the People called Anabaptists, In and about the CITY of LONDON. VVherein their VVeakness and Ignorance is Dis∣covered under their own Hands to the City and Nation, as hereby may appear. FRIENDS, WHereas your Declaration consisteth of five Particulars, four of which are not of so much concernment to me to answer; but as for one of them, for the Nation's sake, and for the Truth's sake; and that you may be reproved, even you the Heads, and principal Men of your Congregations; and because you are such, under whose hands your De∣claration passeth, therefore in that consideration, with many others, this I return as an Answer to you, and to the City and Nation, in pursuit of yours, that hath proceeded from a Heart of Unbelief, and unto Evil and Malicious In∣tents against a Despised People, whom the Lord hath owned, and will own, though you and the whole World do reject them. And whereas you say, You are Mis-represented to the Nation, that you do Coun∣tenance the People called Quakers in their irregular Practice: And to clear your selves, you say, It is well known to all, there are none more opposit to their irregular Practices then we are (say you) nor are there any that they have exprest more Contra∣diction to then against us; though their Provocation therein hath not put us on a desire (say you) of depriving them of their Iust Liberty, while they live Morrally Honest, and peaceable in the Nation, &c. Answer, Oh ye Heads and principal Men, and ye chief Pastors, Elders and Members (so called) of Churches! What have ye done? and wherefore have you thus proceeded? Why have ye renounced an Innocent People that never did you harm, nor ever gave any Offence unto you, saving in crying against the deadness of your Forms, and Traditions, and seeming Religious Practices, and reproving Evil in you? Alas for you! (ye accounted Wise-men) Do you
judge any Advantage will be unto your selves in this thing? or, Do you think to work a Disadvantage unto us by your Renouncing and Denial of us? I must tell you, We are not troubled hereat for our own sakes, neither is any part of our Hope or Confidence concerning you made void; for we never looked upon some of you to be otherwise then our Enemies in your hearts. Oh ye Hypocrites! whom God will judge because of your Hypocrisie, who now as much as in you lies (if it were in your power) you would leave us to the Mercilesness of Cruel Men, you would save your selves, and leave us to the Mer∣cy of the Devil; but though you renounce us, yet the Lord hath owned us, and will own us to your grief: And what are you become our Accusers? Are you become Chargers of us with irregular Practice? Are you endeavouring to make us more odious in the Eyes of Wicked Men, then we are, for Righteous∣ness sake? But wherefore have ye done this? Is it to save your selves from Re∣proaches? Have you therefore Reproached us, and have you sought to make us Vile, that your selves might appear free? And have you thought to gain the Fa∣vour of the Wicked, and to make a Peace with your Enemies, by reviling of us unto them? Is this your End, Oh ye Dissemblers! to Reproach us to the Nation and City behind our backs? You Church-Members (so called) and Teachers, and Pastors and principal Men, that would save your selves, and gra∣tifie the Devil, and joyn in Union with the Wicked, and make your selves Friends with them, by Slandering and Renouncing the Peaceable People, who are more so then your selves, and none of them guilty of Irregularity, as much as some of you; though you would fawn upon the Nation and City by renouncing of us, as if we were Irregular, and so and so; but do you think the Nation and City have not taken notice? or however, hereby they may: What if I say unto them and you, That none of the Quakers ever were so instrumental, by illegal Op∣position, for the turning out of Parliaments, and changing the Government of this Nation into Confusion, like as some of you Anabaptists have been? And this the City and Nation may take notice of the Irregularity of some of your selves, who have been instrumental, even by illegal Opposition, and perfect Tyranny in mens account, and Treachery also, to the turning out Parlia∣ments, and thereby wronging the Nation for their own Advantages; so that the practice of some of you hath been more unlawful, and contrary to Law, then ours hath been, and the City and Nation may take notice of it; as your De∣claration is to them, so is this my Answer, Never any Quaker (so called) in War-like posture, hath stood in Defiance, and been Instruments to turn out peo∣ples lawful Representatives: Did not some of your Brethren, even of the Anabaptists, take Commission from the late Parliament, and no less then Vow∣ing Fidility to them, and yet presently rose in Opposition to them, and turn∣ed them out of doors? And was not this Treachery and Hypocrisie, and Irre∣gularity? And can the Nation charge any of them called Quakers with any such Work? No, they cannot; but some of the Anabaptists they may, even with this and other the like illegal dealing: And more I might instance, and not charge you behind your backs, as you have falsly done of us; but I may affirm to your faces, and justly prove these, and such things upon you. But why have you not named what irregular Practice the Quakers are guilty of? I charge you, you Subscribers against us, and Accusers of us, to prove your Accusation; I say, I charge you before the Lord, and this whole Nation and City, to prove your Accusation, and to instance what particular Practices, performed and owned amongst us, either in relation to just Government in Church or State, that are irregular, and you shall have a Reply; though you say, There are none more opposit to our irregular Practice then you are. Oh! how fain would you flatter and fawn upon our Enemies, to make peace with the Devil? how would you creep by Craft, and joyn into a League with our and your Enemies? and how fain would you be at peace with them, and
leave us even to their Mercilesness, if it were in your power? have we ever dealt thus by you? Have we ever sought to render you Rebels and Traitors to the Nation, as in effect you have done to us? Have we ever sought Occasions against you, and to present you to the Nation as vile as we could, for to save our selves, and leave you to the will of your Enemies? this have you done to us, and we leave you to be rewarded even by the Lord, who will never renounce us, nor cast us out, though you do in such a time as this, a time of Confusion and Distraction, wherein, if the Lord did not appear to be our Defence more then men, we should be swallowed up of our Enemies: And must you, even a seperate People, Members, Pastors and Ministers of Churches (so called) re∣nounce us at this season, on purpose to have us destroyed so much as you may? Well, we have not dealt so with you, neither do we desire to uncover your Na∣kedness to the Nation; you had not had thus much, if you had not been the oc∣casion of it your selves; and surely what you have done in this particular, some of your own Members will not accept it from you with thanks to you; but I shall say more to you when I have under all your hands the particular Pra∣ctices, which you charge to be irregular. And though there hath been and is Contradictions between us and you in matters of Religion, and difference in particular Practices about Church, and Mi∣nisters, & Orders, &c. Yet what is this? this was amongst our selves, though here∣of you have no reason to boast, as of any Victory that you have obtained over us in any such Controversie, neither hath the Spirit of God so appeared in that Authority among you, as that you have gained any from us to you, but ra∣ther the contrary; but what of these Contentions? we have never so con∣tended with you, as that we have hated your Persons, or sought to betray you into the hands of devouring Mouthes, the Lord is our Witness in this, though you have done contrary (even sought to betray our Persons in this your work) and I must tell you, Dishonestly and Undiscreetly have you done in this matter, who never could unto this day, in any Contest between us about Religious Mat∣ters, convince us of Error or irregular Practices, though now you have accu∣sed us to the whole Nation, and not as in a way of Debate about Religion, but as in matter of State Irregularity; whereby plainly appears, that you seek to betray us, even our Persons into the hands of our Merciless Enemies; and you would make Peace with them, and deliver us into their Merciless hands; and thereby shew hatred, not unto us as upon the account of Religion only, but even Hatred to our Persons, and have accused us as of Personal Irregularity; and so have not shewed Love to our Persons, but rather sought our Destructi∣on: Oh, ye Wicked Men! to whose charge God shall lay this Iniquity of Trea∣chery and Unfaithful Dealing to us, even as with Brethren, which is the most deceitful Iniquity. And alas for you! What, are your Desires of depriving us of our just Liber∣ty? God shall give us Liberty, and from him we shall enjoy it whether you will or no; and for our just Liberty we shall not be beholding to you, though I must tell you, if our Liberty were in your power, it is greatly to be doubted, and even your own dealing in this your Declaration gives occasion for it, that our Liberty would be enslaved, if it were in your hands; but we bless the Lord, it is in his Hand, and not in yours: for so much of Treachery towards us has here appeared, even in giving us up (so much as in you is) to the will of our Ene∣mies, and the spirit is in you which would betray Brethren, that for the time to come we can never trust you; but we do not give our Power to you, to en∣joy our Liberty from you, nor ever shall. And if we walk Morrally Honest and Peaceable in the Nation, it is more then you do in this matter; for this your pra∣ctice is not morrally honest, in accusing of us behind our backs to the Nation and City, and Authorities thereof of Irregularity, &c. though, as I have said, ne∣ver any of us had so great a hand by open opposition, tending to make War in the Nation, as some of you in some things I might instance, even for their sakes to
whom you yove accused us; and that we are more peaceable then some of your selves, the Nation and City knows: Have we thrust our selves into Arms, and sought Offices, and Places and Commands, as some of you have? Have ever any of us appear'd in Arms against Parliament and Nation, as some of you? Have we given the City or the Nation, by any visible Appearance, to fear a War from us, as you have done? Let the Nation and City, and the Witness in all mens Consci∣ences judge; so that we are known to be peaceable, as much, or more then your selves; for we have never sought to you to take up Arms with us, as some among you have sought to others; which may demonstrate, that we are as peaceable in the Nation, if not more then you; and so you needed not to have premised such a thing on our behalf. And thus I have in short returned your secret Trea∣chery upon your own heads, and answered that same part of your Declaration, wherein I and the Truth, and the whole Flock of God was any way concerned; and as for the rest of your Declaration I will not seek occasion against it, though in some other things also therein exprest, I might search out your hearts, and dis∣cover the rottenness of them: And where you say, You declare Magistracy to be an Ordinance, &c. might not I tell the Nation and City, That you are not content with Magistracy, except of your own Sect? and might not I say, Why were not you contented with that Assembly of men that last sate? and wherefore was it that you, even some of you Anabaptists, were the chief Instruments, with Swords in your hands, to dissolve them? and so were Instruments in bringing the Nation into present Confusion. And whereas you speak of the publick Ministers of the Nation, You are far from endeavouring to destroy them (say you) and it is your Duty to stand by them, and pre∣serve them from all Violence and Injury, &c. To which I answer, What are you about to make a League and a Covenant with Antichrist? Have you for these many years been opposing them in words, and are you now recanting of what you have done, when you are sensible of a Danger upon you? and will you now bind your selves to stand by them, and preserve them from all Injury, and even as they are Ministers too? But let me ask you, Do you look upon them to be Ministers of Christ, or of Antichrist? If true Ministers of Christ, wherefore do you oppose them, & cry against them in your Pulpits, & have formerly your selves, and some of your Brethren yet do publickly oppose them both by word & writing? Oh, ye Hypocrites! But if they are Ministers of Anti∣christ, then how is it that you will stand by them and preserve them as such, and would bind it upon them as their Duty to stand by, and preserve you? Is not this a League with Hell and Death? Are you turned backwards into Love and Affection towards them again, and so lost your former Principles? And is your Zeal quite grown cold, or are you now only Flattering and Daubing with the Ministers, because you see Danger from them, while you seek but greater Ad∣vantage against them? They may indeed tell you, They look upon you as not De∣stroyers of their Wayes and Practices, neither to ease the Nation from any Burden, which they have laid upon it: For it is manifest, though you deny them in some particu∣lars, some of you; yet you can cry against that in some of them, and yet up∣hold the same thing; I may lawfully instance, that some of your Brethren, some in this Nation, and some in Ireland, take, or have lately taken Tythes for Preach∣ing, and have Yearly Stipends, and so much by the Year out of the States Trea∣sure for Preaching, One Hundred Pound, Two Hundred Pound, and Three Hundred Pound a piece by the year; which indeed doth shew that you are not intending to destroy their oppressing and abominable practices; but the rather, that you would turn them out of great Places and Benefices, and turn your selves in: Oh Deceit and Wickedness! which I am forced to lay open upon this Oc∣casion, of your own just Provocation hereunto. And as for their preserving you, and you them, against such as do oppose you; they may easily joyn with you in this, if they could hope in your Faithfulness; for some of you, and your Members, have shewed as much Enmity, have been open Persecutors, even as they and their Members have been; and your Members have been sending the
People of God to Prison, and persecuting them, even as the common Priests of the Nation; and you appear to be guided by the same spirit in many things; and if they be Antichristian in their wayes and practices, its sure that you are not of Christ, because you are like unto them in Nature. And in that you say, You would have none tollerated in their Religion that deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God; but you would tollerate Episcopacy, Presbytery, or a inted Form, &c. (say you.) To which I say, I know that spirit that you are of, if it had its full authority would tollerate none but your selves; for your spirit in nature differs not from the spirit of the Church of Rome: And what are you now for tollerating Episco∣pacy, who were once your selves (in your Zeal for God, when your sincerity was not darkned, nor your hearts so much corrupted through Places of Ho∣nour, and through such things, as now they are) Instruments to the pulling down of Episcopacy? and will you now tollerate it again, and help to set it up, and build what you have destroyed, as if you recanted of what you had done? but plainly shewing that you are not of the same Spirit that once you were of; but have lost Sincerity, and can embrace Idolatry; for once ye were the men that did oppose it, and did violently help to pull it down; but now you are for tolleration. Oh! unconstant men, this is to you, not herein discove∣ring my Judgement in the case, and if Episcopacy, why may not Popery be tol∣lerated? seeing they are one and the self same in ground and nature, and not much different in appearance, and you may agree to tollerate a stinted Form in others, because your selves are in a stinted Form also; for what is yours else but a form, crying up your water and bread and wine, and differing from the World onely in these outward things, when as the City and Nation knows you are men as covetous, as worldly minded, as ambitious, as self-seeking of honour and places as any others in the Nation; and your Religion appears to be a stinted Form as much as others; Alas poor men, you have discovered your hearts in your Declaration, and according to the corruption thereof I cannot but answer you; and there are some that deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and say they are the Words of God, and a Declaration, and a Treatise of what the Saints believed and enjoyed; and Christ is the Word of God, that may in time to come be tollerated in their Religion in this Nation, though you have renounced them: but while they are owned and regarded of the Lord, they respect not your love nor hatred, who are mortal men, and your breath in your nostrils, and must fall and perish as the dung in all your beauty, and your profession of Religi∣on, before the coming of the Son of God. And in your Post-script you say, you have under you hands sent forth your Declaration in behalf of your selves, and others of your Iudgement; but I must tell you, I do believe there are some even of those called Anabaptists which will reject your work, and to them my answer is not, for I spare them: but to you fearful Hypocrites in a time of danger, that have in this juncture of time renounced us without ground or reason in the Sight of God, but for your , as if you would gain the favour of the Nation and City by denial of s, and looking upon your selves to be reproached because of us, when as you are a Company of unworthy men, even unworthy of our reproaches, and to escape them have denied us, as seeming to clear your selves; but you are de∣ceived in this matter, and it shall turn to work against you in the Nation, and in the City; for we have a more surer witness in their Consciences, even in the Consciences of all people, that we are of God, then you have; for take but away your outward water, and Bread and Wine, and some few outward Practices, and what do you differ from the worst sort of men in the Nation? for doth not Pride and Hypocrisie, and Self-Love, and Covetousness, and the love of this World abound amongst you, as much as amongst any others? the Witness in Peoples Consciences knows it, which shall be a Witness for us, and against you. You may indeed have gained League with the worst sort of men in
the Nation, but you have not gained the sincerity in people, and while we have that on our side to witness for us, take you the rude multitude, for we are not dis∣couraged at all concerning this thing, but the rather do glory in the Lord though we be denied of all, for though men forsake us, yet the Lord careth for us, and your own doing shall return upon your own heads: and thus much is sufficient to the substance of your Declaration, and if I receive any reply, I shall expect it under the hands of you all, that I may further search, and discover you unto your selves, and to the Nation. And whereas there is a Manuscript goes abroad, consisting of five particu∣lars, which is said that it was delivered in to the Committee of Safety, as Advice and Counsel to them, but who the Authors of it are is something uncertain; but certain it is, that some of the called Independant Ministers and Pastors were the chief Promoters of it; and in the Copy which was delivered to my hands it is said, These five Particulars were the result of a little Synod, made up of Presby∣terians, Independants and Anabaptists; but whether it is so or no, I leave that, and would say something to some of the Particulars, and even to the Committee of Safety, and Officers of the Army, and all others of the Nation, for their bet∣ter information then the same Paper describeth to them. The third Particular consisteth about the Magistrates Power in matters of Faith and Worship, and the Authors say, Though they greatly prize Christian Li∣berty, yet they profess utter dislike and abhorrency of an Universal tolleration, as being con∣trary to the mind of God in his Word. Answ. It appears the Authors are lovers of themselves, and prizers of their own Liberty, but not of the Liberty of others, but do utterly dislike and ber the tolleration of others, which may indeed be more righteous then them∣selves, and this is no less then the very Principle of the Whore of Rome, which Promotes her own Liberty and makes others Slaves, and ahhor, tollera∣tion to any but themselves; and they plead Scriptures as well as you for proof of their Religion, and they will say all that differs from them are contra∣ry to the Scriptures, even as you say, when as there is very little better foun∣dation in the Scriptures for your Religion then there is for theirs; and it is doubtful to many what Religion this day extant is perfectly according to the Scriptures; but yet thus much may be said, That Church, and that Religion which are not in the same Spirit as gave forth the Scriptures, are not accor∣ding unto the Scriptures; and he that can distinguish of this, and who it is that hath the same Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, is only able to judge what Religion is according to the Scriptures: But can the Authors shew plainly out of the Scriptures, that their Religion is only according thereunto, and all others the contrary? and until they prove this; why may not the Rulers, that are of may be in this Nation, give Tolleration unto other sorts of People, as well as to the Independants, the supposed Authors of this Paper. The fourth Particular consisteth concerning Tythes, and say they, The taking away of Tythes for Maintenance of Ministers, until as full a Maintenance be as equally se∣cured, and as equally settled, tends very much to the Destruction of the Ministry, and Prea∣ching of the Gospel in these Nations. Answ. Alas for you, poor ignorant Creatures, ye foolish men, that seems to have no understanding of the Ministry and Gospel of Christ; Do you in∣deed think that the true Ministry of Christ, and the Preaching of the Gos∣pel depends upon Maintenance by Tythes? Oh, ye Robbers of God, who have secretly dishonoured him in your hearts, and publickly disgraced him as much as in you lyes to the Nation, as if he were not able to save his Ministry, and the Preaching of his Gospel from destruction, if Tithes be taken away; Surely, you err in your Judgements, and have no acquaintance with God, nor with his Ministry nor Gospel, who have thus dishonoured him in setting up that Maintenance by the forcible and unjust oppression of Tythes
to be the preserving of Ministry and Gospel, and as if Tythes were the uphold ing of Ministry and Gospel; and you have thus falsly and wickedly measured God, his Ministry and Gospel by the wickedness of your own hearts, who seem to be indeed of those Hirelings that cheat Souls for money, and run for the gift like Balaam, and for the lucre like the evil Beasts, and Slow-bellies; and so I do believe that your false Ministry indeed, and your feigned pretence of preaching the Gospel do depend upon great sums of money, and upon large Maintenances, and we believe that indeed is the chief Reason of your Preaching; and of your Ministry, and it is very possible that your Ministry and Preaching may fall, which is Antichristian, when Tythes and Hire is taken away, which Mi∣nistry dependeth thereupon; but the true Ministry and preaching of the Gospel will God maintain and uphold, though the oppression of Tythes be vanquished; and I hope some of the Rulers of this Nation, and Officers of the Army will not believe your advice; but yet you seem to be willing to renounce Tythes, if you could have as full a Maintenance setled another way; so that however great maintenance comes, you regard not, so you can have that, whether by this way of Oppression, or the other, its your Maintenance you love and follow after, and seek unto the Powers of the Earth for that end; and how equally and legal∣ly Tythes have been setled, which you seem to affirm, let all good People judge; given they were, and setled first in our Nation by the Popes Authority, to be the Maintenance of that Whore's Ministers, and the Laws that gave them, and setled them have been Antichristian and Oppression in the Nation, and there is the guilt of Blood, and of cruel unjust sufferings lying upon this Nation in that very cause of Tythes, and the Hand of the Lord is gone out against it, and against all Contenders for it, and God will redeem the Nation from der it, though you be putting your strength to uphold it through your hypo∣critical Prayers, and Preaching, and Flatteries with God and man. The fifth particular is, these Authors desire, that countenance be not given unto, nor trust reposed in the hands of Quakers, being persons of such Principles that are distructive to the Gospel, and inconsistent with peace and civil society. Answ. Here your wickedness and the malice of your hearts is let forth against the dispised People for their righteousness sake; and this spirit of yours would not only discountenance them, but destroy them from the face of the Earth, if it were in your Hands, and you are worse then Baalam ever was, and far more blind then he; for you are as it were seeking inchantments against the People of God for Money, and you see not the goodly tents of Iacob, as he did, nor the People that are altogether blessed; Oh! ye envious persons that are even a preparing as much as in you is the destruction of a peaceable People, and that would keep them in slavery under you, and you would have the counte∣nance of the powers of the Earth, but they must not, and you would Mono∣polize all the places of trust for advantage to your selves, and you would hard∣ly allow the People of God a place on the Ground; Oh! ye sinful Hypocrites and Flatterers and Slanderers of the just; but what need you have made such pre∣paration against them? do they seek places of honour among you? do they de∣light in great places among men? do they love to be great in this World? nay their Kingdom is from above, and they reject the countenanance of the Be Authority, and they reject any confidence that the Dragon and unjust po can repose in them, and you need not have been afraid in this matter, and thereupon slandered us, and have back-bited us to the powers of the Earth, what do you fear? even the thing which you fear will God in a judgement bring upon you, and there is a Government to be set up in this Nation, even that which is of the Lamb; and your Antichristian Monarchy the Beast with all his Heads and Horns shall fall to the Ground, and the Lord may bring your fear upon you to your utter confusion, though you are making de∣fences all that you can for your selves and your Kingdom; and this seems to be y wherein every mans heart is tryed, and every man and sort of People is
pouring, forth the Maliciousness of their Hearts against the poor People in scorn called Quakers; What say the Papists and Episcopal men? Quakers are  New Sect, and Deceivers, &c. And what say the Presbyterians and the Independan of them? Oh! they are Seducers, they are Witches, they are false Prophets, they are Vagabonds, not worthy of Countenance, &c. nor any Place of Trust in the Nation, &c. What say the Anabaptists of them? O! they are Blasphemers, and Hereticks, and Irregular Persons, and distructive to Gospel, &c. This and such like is the Cry of these, and all sorts of people, against a poor despised People, whom the Eternal God hath made dreadful unto them all, who shall be a Rod in his Hand, to break them and confound them, and utterly to destroy their Antichristian king∣dom; for they are beloved of the Lord, though hated of all men, and though the whole Body of the Beast and Antichrist, and every Horn of his head do set themselves to War against the Lamb and his Followers; and though all these sorts of people mentioned, and some others, do at this day pour out their Fury and Malice against this People, yet shall they not be confounded, for their Trust is in the Living God; and as sure as the Lord lives, The Fear that People have of the Prosperity of this People shall come upon them; and without Weapon, or Arm of Flesh, or the Multitude of an Host of Men, will their God dash their Ene∣mies to pieces. And all ye Sects whatsoever, that are risen in Opposition against us; what do we regard your Fury and Madness against us? What do we fear your Reviling, you uncircumcised Philistines? We mock at your Terror, and we reject your Strength as the Strength of a Straw; we despise your Authority, which is not of God, as the Authority of so many Bryars and Thornes; we can glory over you in the Lord; What are you? and from whence did you come? is not Babylon your City? and is not the great Whore your Mother, and the Mo∣ther of Harlots your Nurse? and what is your growth, but even like the Grass of a Summer's growth, that's soon cut down and withered; and like the Leaf of a Summer Tree, that utterly perisheth in Winter? The Mighty Day of the Lord is at your Door, Confusion is begun amongst you, and the Sword of one may destroy another, and the Strength of one shall tear another, and the Rem∣nant that is left shall be destroyed, and we must overcome them without Sword or Carnal Weapon, and this shall come to pass in a day; and the Eye that is yet blind shall see it, and the Child that is yet undelivered shall be a Conqueror over the Beast, and over his Image, and over all your false Sects, and over eve∣ry Horn that is risen up against the Lamb and his Followers; the time of the Lamb's Kingdom is at hand. Behold, behold, ye Mountains of the Earth, The Sentence of Eternal Vengeance will pass upon you; ye Hypocritical Professors, ye Pastors, Elders, Members and Ministers of Churches (so called) the Decree of the, Almighty is coming out against you; you have provoked him by your Wickedness towards him and his People, even to the Destruction of your own selves: wherefore Tremble before the Lord; for his Dread, and the weight of his Hand, shall be upon your Consciences. Oh Nation, mourn over thy iniquities which have provoked God against thee, and if men turn not unto him, his sore Judgment will be upon thee: we are not for this Party, or the other, neither do we justifie one side in oppositi∣on to another; for we see the Earth is corrupted, and all sorts of men that are this day striving one sort against another, are in a wrong way, and in a wrong spirit; and we cannot side with any of them, but we rather mourn over the Nati∣on, who is torn in pieces by the ambitious spirit of her pretended Rulers; and we desire the repentance of all, and not the destruction of any, and we are for Gods part, and not for men.

AN ANSWER TO THE Great Cry, The QUAKERS will soon FALL. A Great Cry in the World hath been by many people of all sorts; As for the Quakers, they will soon fall, and come to nothing; they will stand but for a while, as other Sects have done before them; For many Sects that have de a great stir for a time, they have come to nought, and so will these; they will fall and e to nought in a Year or two, or the like; and they will forsake this Way: And this, Noise and Stir about them will come to an end, and they will have a Fall. And thus, and after this manner do the People of the World Cry, and say one to another. To this I answer, O ye Fools and Blind, that thus do judge and say! ye are ignorant and sottish Children, and know not the Way of the Lord nor his Judgments; neither do ye know his Secrets, nor have entred into his Counsel; who told you thus, or by what spirit have you received it? and do ye not speak as ye would have it? and because you would have it so, do ye not therefore speak it? Ye Fools and Blind, whose Hearts are hardened, I tell you nay, your words shall never come to pass; but you, and all our Enemies, shall be found Lyars, and as you say of others, so shall it come to pass upon your selves; and that which you desire for others, it shall fall upon your own heads. Again, I tell you nay, we shall not fall, nor be decreased, nor come to ght; but the Truth shall stand forever, and we shall be encreased through the World, and shall be the Renowned People of the whole Earth: For we are of them whom the Lord is gathering from off the barren Mountains, and out of the Mouthes of all dumb Shepherds, whom the Lord will feed and keep, as the Sheep of his own Pasture; over whom the Seed of David, Christ, the Heir of Heaven and Earth is chief Shepherd; and he is set over us, and he rules in Equity and Righteousness. And them we are spoken of, Ezekiel 34. which are the Sheep of God's Pasture; and the Lord hath sought us out even as a Shep∣herd his Sheep; and we shall not fall, as ye suppose. And we are them spoken of in the Revelations, whom the Lord is bringing through great Tribulations, and making us white in the Blood of the Lamb, and redeeming us through his Sufferings. And we are of that Numberless Number spoken of, which shall stand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion; for we are of the Seed which is com∣ing up out of Egypt, and shall replenish the whole Earth: And ye Fools and Blind will be deceived, and the Imaginations of your hearts will come to no∣thing: and its you that will fall, and come to nothing; and not we, whom the Lord is bringing up out of the Apostacy, which you all are in, and all Nations are in since the dayes of the Apostles. And we are not any of all those Sects and false Churches, that have been on foot for many Ages; for its true, they have risen
and fallen, come up and gone down one after another, and made a stir and a noise for a while, and then withered, and come to nought, and dyed away of them∣selves; and this is because their Foundation has not been Christ, the Rock of Ages; nor none of them have been his true Church, his Spouse, elected to him; for if they had, they could not have been prevailed against, nor fallen, as they have done; nor they have not been the true Church, which is the Ground and Pillar of Truth; for they have wither'd and come to nothing, and risen and fallen one after another in a few years time; and they could not stand long any of them, but must needs wither and be confounded, and one consume another, and be eaten up one of another; for they have risen out of the Pit that hath had no bottom, and into that have they and must they all sink down again; and they have caused the world to wonder after them for a little season, but being not upon the Foundation, they could not remain; for they have all come out of the Pit, & go into Perdition, & have risen one out of another, and been destroyed one of another: and though some of them have made war one with another, and some of them hated the Whore, yet have they given their power to the Beast, and the Beast rose out of the Pit, which had no bottom, without Foun∣dation; and the Beast, and all these Sects, that have given their power to him, go into Perdition with him, and its not possible that they should remain long, but fall, and come to nothing, because Christ hath not been their Foundation: but as I have said, We are not any of all these, that give their power to the Beast, but are of them that stand with the Lamb upon Moun Sion, that are redeemed unto God out of every Sect, and out of Kindreds and Multitudes; and we are of them that have overcome the Beast, and his Image, and the number of his name, who are them that follow the Lamb whither so∣ever he goes; who cannot be overcome nor fall, because greater is he that is in us, then he that is in the World; and he overcomes the world, and he is our Rock and Foundation, and we cannot be moved; but he keeps us, & we may not fall, nor come to nought, as our Enemies do falsly suppose and speak, as they would have it; but let them be at rest, for we shall grow, and spring, and be encreased into a numberless Number, which shall stand upon the Sea of Glass, with the Harps of God in our hands, singing Praises and Glory to the Lord God for evermore. What though the Woman has been fled into the Wilderness, and we, her Seed, made war against, and slain? and what though we be accounted as Sheep for the slaughter, and killed all the day long? And what though some that are convinced, and come to the Faith of Christ in measure? what though some such do turn from the Truth, into the evil world again, and deny the Lord and his People, and their latte-end be worse then their beginning, & the unclean spirit possess them seven fold more then at the first? and, what though the evil eye doth see this, & the Wicked do herein rejoyce, and take occasion from such things to say, They will fall, they will fall, and people turn from them again? O ye Fools and Blind! notwithstand∣ing all this, Truth shall prosper, and such as are faithful shall never be ashamed, nor never fall; but the Lord will overcome, and the Woman shall return, and shall receive her Seed to life again, which shall be as the Stars for multitude; and your desires and conceivings shall be confounded. And what though you say, They cannot stand long, for the Powers of the Earth, and all the Rulers are against them, and Parliaments they will make Laws to suppress them: Nay, ye Fools and Blind, all this will not prevail; for the Lord has broken, and will break all that shall op∣pose his Kingdom, which he is setting up amongst us, of whose Government and Dominion there shall be no end, nor no falling, but it shall be encreased forever and ever, and Powers nor Dominions of the Earth shall not prevail; but all that which they do against us, turneth to our Increase, and their own Overthrow and Confusion, while they think to suppress us; and all what they can do, and what you may suppose, it is all nothing, and will come to nothing; for the Lord hath spoken it: his Seed shall grow, and his People shall replenish the Nations; and in time it will be manifest whose we are, and how we shall be increased; and in the mean time, we bear all things in Patience, knowing assuredly, that the Lord is with us, and that none upon the Earth may prevail against us; and this shall all our Enemies know in the Lord's Season. E. B.
A DISCOVERY Of some part of the War between the Kingdom of the Lamb, And the KINGDOM of ANTI-CHRIST: Held forth in this Account of several Disputes and Queries, between a Minister of Christ (really so) and one that hath the Name of a Minister, but is proved to be a Minister and Member of Antichrist by evident Testimonies. And is a short Account of the Covetousness, Ignorance, En∣vy, and the Fruits of Darkness brought forth by C. Fowler, a pro∣fessed Minister in Reading. And here all may see (in some measure) the difference between Christ and Antichrist, and their Authority and Weapons; and also the Fruits and Effects of each of them are made manifest. To the Reader, Friend, THE chief occasion of this being sent abroad to publique view, is to the people of Reading most particularly, but yet more general unto all, and though that it be chiefly unto a particular Place, and against a particular Person, to wit, Ch. Fowler, one that hath the Name of a Minister of Christ in Reading, whose Folly, and Weakness and Ignorance is herein discovered; yet it hath partly rela∣tion to the whole Ministry of the Nation; and all men that do not shut their eyes may see and behold something of that great Opposition, that is at this day between the Kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of Antichrist: and I have no other end in publishing of this, but for the satisfaction of them that desire it, and for the general good of all; and if Christopher Fowler shall see himself justly reproved, and repet, it may prove of good to him also; and I am not a man of Strife, for if he and his Brethren had not first challenged us to Disputes, I had not had this Occasi∣on th to proceed now; and in what I have done, I refer it to the Iust Witness of God in the honest People in Reading, and to all elsewhere. FOrasmuch as great hath been the Debate for these divers years of late, be∣tween the Lamb and his Followers, and Antichrist and his Followers; and the one of them hath been opposing the other in their own Power and Authority; and great is the Debate at this day between these two Kingdoms,
which is endeavouring the Overthrow one of the other; and all the strength and power of Antichrist is put forth in Defence of his kingdom, by Perse∣cution, Injustice, False-Imprisonments, Beatings, and Whippings, and Spoi∣ling of Goods and Persons, and Railings, Accusings, Slanderings, Reproach∣ings; by these wayes and proceedings doth Antichrist strive at this day, for the upholding and maintaining his own cause and kingdom; and by this means and these Weapons mentioned, doth he seek to defend himself, his Church, and Ministry, and Ordinances; these are his Weapons and Armour, by which he opposeth and fighteth against the Lamb and his Followers, whom the Lord hath raised up for this end; and they have within these few years, more then ever for many Generations, made an Invation and Inroad upon Antichrist, his king∣dom and government, and the great City Babylon; and the Seige is raised, that hath long been laid against the Holy Seed; and the great City Babylon is taken, her Walls are scaled, and her Gates broken, and her Strength defeated, and her Merchants spoiled of their goodly Treasure; for the Day of the Lord is come, and the holy Seed is he leading out of the spiritual Sodom and Egypt; and My∣stery Babylon the Great hath God remembred for her Iniquities, and her Cruel∣ties and Mercilesness, and all her Abominations will God avenge upon her head; and this doth come to pass, and not by the multitude of an Host of men, nor yet by humane Policy and Wisdom, nor yet by carnal Weapons, nor by Goals, nor Prifons, nor Persecutions, these are not the Lamb's Weapons, but these are Antichrist's and the Dragon's Armour and Weapons, which he makes War by, against the Lamb and his Followers, even at this day in every Nati∣on: But the Lamb's Weapons are Truth, Patience, Long-suffering, Meekness and down-right Sincerity of Heart and Tongue; and by these things shall An∣tichrist be slain, and these Weapons shall Conquer his kingdom; Love shall over∣come Hatred, Meekness shall overcome Wrath, Truth shall overcome Deceit and Falshood, and God shall overcome the Devil. But more particularly, Great hath been the Opposition and Debate made one against the other; and the Battel between Christ and Antichrist hath prin∣cipally been held forth between the Ministers of the Church of England on An∣tichrist's part, and the People called Quakers on the other part; no man in the Nation can be so Ignorant how the Controversie hath depended betwixt these two, and what Weapons they have used the one against the other; and also, it is in part known the Success of them both; and how the one of them (to wit) the Ministers (so called) have had on their part the strength of Men, the Ma∣gistrates Power, the Rude Multitude, and Humane Craft, and the Serpent's Policy, not any of these things have been wanting to them; but yet, a little Seed hath sprung up in the Nation on the other part, unexpected by many, which hath had Sincerity and Truth in it, and the Lord hath been with it, and he hath blessed it, though but little and very small in its beginning, yet it is prospered into a Kingdom; for God's Might and his Authority dwelleth in it, before whom all Nations of the Earth must Fear and Tremble. But yet more particularly, my present Occasion of demonstrating these things are as followeth; and the Engagement that lies upon me hereunto, is not out of any Personal Enmity, that I have against any; but my Intent is, For the Discovery of the Truth, that men may imbrace it; and for the laying open the Deceits of Antichrist, and his Kingdom, that men may come out of Babylon, and may not partake of her Sins, nor of her Plagues: and this matter now in hand chiefly concerns the people of the Town of Reading for their Satisfacti∣on, concerning the Wayes, Practices, Doctrines, and Proceedings of Chri∣stopher Fowler, one of their Ministers, with whom I have been joyned in oppo∣sion two several times in dispute with him, and the third time was appointed for our meeting upon Discourse, as hereafter is related; but he not appear∣ing at the time and place according to appointment; and he notwithstand∣ing yet continues in opposition to, and Reproaching of the Truth of the
Gospel, which I profess and contend for; therefore upon this account do I thus egage with him, and not for Centention sake, but for the open vindication of Truth and Righteousness, and sound Faith and Doctrine, held forth by us, and opposed and gain▪ said by him. The first opposition that fell out between him and me, was at a meeting chal∣lenged by himself, in that Town about the ninth Month, in the year 1657▪ and I shall at present forbear his detestable and Abominable Practices and Spches against me and the Truth, at that Meeting; for indeed the remembrance of it is much passed from me, but many in that Town may well remember to  day, how he hooted and clapped his hands in the Palpit, as if he had been Hnting on a Mountain; and also his ungodly speeches, and revilings to∣wards me, as calling me Dog, and Villain, and such like names; and when some of his own people reproved him for such words, he said; The worst words he had in his Mouth was to good for me; and indeed such was his carriages, and words towards me, at that time, far off civility, and not like a sober Heathen, much less like a Christian or Minister of Christ; and here follows what was written to him, and to the Major, and whole Town, and sent the next Morning after the dispute, which is some account of that dayes proceeding; and finding a Copy of it by me, I thought meet here to in∣fert it. Friends, Rulers, Priests, and People of Reading. A Few words to clear my Conscience to you all in the sight of God, I send among you, occasioned by this dayes Meeting; ye people be asham∣ed of your Priests; and ye Priests be ye ashamed of your People; and all of you together, cover your Lips, and hide your Faces, and be ashamed of your Profession in Religion, or to make mention of the Name of the Lord in that nature in which you stand; whose Lightness, and Foolishness, and Rude∣ness, and Wickedness exceeds some others; yea, many with whom I have ad to do in Disputes, you excel in unreasonableness in words and Behavi∣our, manifesting your selves some of you not to be Civil Men, much less Christians; and this very day much of your Vanity, Bruitishness, and Un∣vility appeared to your shame, in the Sight of all Just and Sober Men, and to your condemnation in the Sight of God; who takes notice of your wicked∣ness, and unseemly behaviour, which you may call to mind and remember, that you may repent of your ungodly words, and cruel speeches, and rude bruit∣ish gestures, which appeared in you without any Fear of God, to your shame be it spoken; and like Priests, like People, all out of the way, in folly and vanity, erring through Lightness, and Wantonness, not knowing the Scrip∣tures, nor the Power of God, but perverters of the one, and despifers of the other; the sin of the Priest will be charged upon the People, because you love to have those things so, and uphold him in his wickedness; and the sin of the peo∣ple will be charged upon the Priests, who through Lyes and Lightness cause you to err, and profits them not at all; but is a blind Leader of ye blind People, till both fall into the Ditch together, who close your Eyes that you may not see, and shut your Ears lest you should Hear, and harden your Hearts that you may not understand; and your Destruction is of your selves, and your Blood is upon your own Heads, who scorns to be repro∣ved, and despiseth the Way of the Lord, and will not receive his Truth in the Love of it, that you may be saved; but is a blind, willful, and stiff-necked people; some of you who have hearts, and cannot understand: Is these the fruits of your long Profession, Railing, Mocking, Scorning, Laughing, Hoo∣ting; Foolish and Vain Words, Nick-naming, and Reproaching? these
things abounds openly among you to your shame, especially at such a time, when Meekness, and Soberness, and Moderation, had much better be∣come you, to have been brought forth by you; your Priests, exceeding the rest in vileness, and some of your Rulers hardly being clear: remember your work, and call to mind your words, and ways, and let shame cover your heads, from the highest to the lowest of you; and thou proud wild reproachful profes∣se Minister, cease thy vain presumptious boastings against the Innocent; and now when thou puts off thy armor, if thou hast gotten a victory, glory; or rather hide thy face for shame, and stop thy mouth in the dust, whose Lightness, and Wild∣ness, hath super-abounded some of thy fellows, who may be ashamed of thee in thy words and behaviour, whereby thou art sufficiently proved to be one that was never sent of God, if we had no other testimony: Thy proud presumptions boast against the Quakers, was with soberness and in the Fear of the Lord answered, to thy shame in the sight of all such, whose hearts are not al∣together hardned, and given up to believe Lies, and to do Wickedness, that they may be damned that believe not the Truth: and first, as to the manner of the dispute on his part, were his Railing Envious Reproachful un∣savory filthy words, of God, or of the Devil? with much impudency many times uttered in the discourse; as Villain, Sirrah, Wretch, Blasphemer, Rogue, and such like lying words of Bitterness, more like the words of a brawling Drunkard, then for a Minister of Christ, and were his booting, laugh∣sing, and clapping his hands, and rude and unseemly gestures, and behavi∣our, of God, or of the Devil? more like in appearance to a Stage-player, then to a Minister of Christ, to his shame I mention it; consider and answer these things, and let that of God in your Consciences judge, to which I stand to be approved in meekness, and he to be reproved and condemned in his filthiness and bruitishness, in the Sight of God; may not you who own∣ed him in that discourse, be ashamed of him in these his words and actions, which appeared? who boastingly gave a Challenge to dispute of the things of God, and then to mannage it in Rudeness and Wildness, without any Fear of God, in Lying and Slandring; and at the end, when things came to the head for Tryal, to run away, and not to stand to the end, though several times he was charged to it; I appeal for Answer to the Light of Christ in all your Consciences; not like a Minister of Christ in any measure he appeared, but as one that knows not the Living God, nor his Law, and Fear, nor Judgements; and an unfit fellow upon tryal I found him, to dispute the Precious things of God, and through some Nations I have hardly met with a worse, which caused me to be the more silent then otherwise I would, for I chosed rather to be accounted a fool by silence, then to offend the Just Law of God, by giving holy things to Dogs, or casting Pearls before Swine, in which nature he and some of you appeared, who fasly Slandered the Innocent with the name of Jesuite, and such like, crying away with him; with Bitter and Cruel words and gestures, pushing with your hands, and crying a Prison were the fittest, or such like; even like unto your fore-Fathers the Pharisees, who persecuted Christ under the account of themselves being righteous, and he a blasphemer, and they laid snares for him to entrap him in his works, as you did; who when I would not answer according to your provoking, that you might ensnare me, would hardly suffer me to answer any thing, to clear and defend to the Truth, against the boast of the Wicked; but by Hooting, and Laugh∣ing, and Clapping of Hands, and Foolish Jeastings, and unreasonable Rude∣ness, prevented me from speaking, and them that would have heard from hearing, as much as you could, even as bruit Beasts or Heathens, and not like civil people, much less like godly Christians; nor like such as would, or could so∣berly debate the Truth of God to edification, and truly may I say I fought with Beasts at Reading, after the manner of men; but all was to make your selves, and your pretended Minister manifest, and all could not be so blind, but
might understand his wayes and words, not to be guided by the Spirit of God, but by the spirit of the Devil; who is the Father of such Works and Con∣, as was brought forth by him in the Meeting, in many uncivil actions, and reproachful words of envy. And also as to the matter of dispute on his pt managed, was but a vain contention, boastingly uttered without the Fear of the Lord, in a proud presumptious spirit, and a Snare laid in the mid'st of his Questions, and Arguments to entrap the Just, but in vain was the Snare  in the sight of the Bird, and I chose rather to appear a Fool to your wisdom, then to be made a prey upon by you, and caught in your deep∣laid Snare; for we are learned to be as wise as Serpents; and deeply did he and se of you fall into the Snare of Confusion, and Wickedness, and False Doctrines, as would have been laid open, if he had durst to have staid, or you to have heard. The Principal Question was, whether the Scriptures are the Word of God? which he affirmed, but could not prove by plain Scripture; to which much might have been answered, and said, if patience, or any moderation had ruled over your despiteful spirits; but because I could not (to satisfy your wills, and to fulfil your purpose) answer, yea or nay, and thereby make my self a Transgressor; Therefore, hardly would you suffer me to say any thing, in any manner of arguing, but by wickedness endeavoured to stop my Mouth; My answer was, and is, the Scriptures (the Writings) which are one, are but a declaration and witness of the Word of God; which Word was in the beginning, and endures for ever; as Iohn and Peter testifies; and the Scriptures (which are Writings) were not in the beginning, but be∣gan to be written by Moses many hundred years after the beginning; Therefore, the Scriptures, which were not in the beginning, are not the Word of God, which Word was in the beginning; further the Scripture saith, the Worlds e made and framed by the Word of God; but the Scriptures made not the Worlds; therefore the Scriptures are not the Word of God, which as the Scrip∣e it self saith, made the Worlds; many such like witnesses might be alledg∣ed from the Scriptures, to prove the Scriptures are not the Word God,  a Declaration (of the Word of God) and cannot endure for ever; then  said he would prove the Scriptures should endure for ever, but could not bring any plain Scriptures, as I demanded of him to prove the assertion; but went about in Logick to prove it, and could prove no more, then that the truth written of in the Scripture should endure for ever; which thing I never did, or shall deny, and so needed not to be contended against by any sober men; but unreasonable men, who have not Faith, will say any thing for Ad∣vantage to themselves, and Disadvantage to the Truth, which they are set to oppose. And he instanced, and said, It is written, Christ is God Blessed forever;  then shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart; and said, this should endure fer: To which I answered, That which is written of only shall endure forever; but the Scriptures and Writings should not endure forever. And further instanced, God was written, and was Scripture, and should not endure ever, though God should endure forever, and he could not be written nor ained in a Book: and through your Vanity in Scorning, and Hooting,  Unreasonableness, according to your own purpose, lest your Deceiver ld be made manifest, you prevented me, and would not suffer me to speak, in what much more I had to say in this particular: and I observed that in all the Questions and Arguments against me were hatched secretly a Snare to  me into Suffering; and to this purpose some of you said wickedly; I ld presently dispute my self into Prison: and further he instanced, Thou  r thy Father and thy Mother, it is so written; and said he, This is a Command of God, and the Word of God, and shall endure for ever, with presumptuous boasts, and scornfull invented terms, not beseeming any , much less a Minister; and that he could prove this to be the Word of God against all the Quakers in the World, and against all the Fiends in Hell,
and against all the Jesuits at Rome, or filthly words to this purpose, and much I de∣sired moderation from you, with diligence to hear my defence; and thereupon many times desired the Mayor, who was present to command silence, but I could hardly obtain any from you, you were so generally rude, and rash, and un∣reasonable; and to him I replyed, that to honour Father and Mother in the Lord, was a Command of God, and the Word of God, and should endure for ever; but Luke's Writings (the Scripture) were but a Declaration of this Com∣mand, and not the Command it self, nor the Word of God, and would perish, and not endure for ever; and bid you read Luke 1. 1. There Luke calls his Writings, which are Scripture, a Declaration, and much more might I have spoken to this thing, if I had been yoaked against a reasonable man, or if the Auditors had been but civil; but you could not endure to hear, but said, I sub∣tilly insinuated into their People; and thereupon several times some of you spake to the Mayor to dismiss the people, I think, lest your Hirelings should be discovered, and your Wickedness reproved; and thus the thing came near an end, he not being able to prove by any Scripture, or right Argument, the Scripture to be the Word of God, which shall endure for ever, but must if his, and your eye ever be opened, confess to what I held forth, that onely that which is written of in the Scripture, or which the Scriptures declare of shall endure for ever, to be the Word of God, and not the Scripture or Writings; then presumtuously he said, prove him if I could, to be a false Prophet; to which I answered, (and desired much your moderation, but could not obtain it, as though you had set your selves to be rude and vain) to prove a false Prophet was either by Conversation, or Doctrine, or both, and by his Fruits he was known; to preach for Hire, and to divine for Money is fruits and signs of a false Prophet, as the Scripture testified; which should be my rule to try him by, if he durst stand to it, and they that preached for hire were false Prophets; and he preached for hire, and there∣fore was a false Prophet according to the Scripture rule; then he said, he preached not for hire, yet he had hire for preaching; a poor shift to cover the Devils Deceits, but it will not hide his Shame; and it was proved that he preached for hire to all, but such who stopped their Ears; and it was manifest in his face, that he sued some at the Law which would not pay him Tythes: And then I asked him to give any Examples from the Ministers of Christ, where ever they took Tythes, or sued Men at the Law who would not pay them Wages; but to this he gave no answer at all, and thereby he was proved to be a false Prophet, and a Deceiver; and much more might have been said, as to this, to prove him and his Generation to be false Prophets, as may be done at any time; but such was the unreasonableness at this passage, that you were nigh to lay violent hands upon me, some of you; and lest your Deceiver should be made manifest, you would not suffer me to speak what I had to say, but cried, Away with me: And tell me any of you, when he preached any year or time, at this Town, when he had no hire? and therefore he is a Hireling, because he preacheth not without it, but for it, and so is a false Prophet; and he being, I judge, sorely afraid lest he should be discovered, went out of his Pulpit door two or three times, till I called him back again, and charged him to stay if he was a man, and I would prove him to be a preacher of false Doctrine, who in my hearing said, The Scripture was the Foun∣dation of Foundations; but when he heard this he ran away, and fled like a Hireling, and would not stay; and I was, and am ready in the Presence of God, and any sober men, to prove this to be false Doctrine, and of the Devil, and him to be no Minister of Christ, who holds it forth. And all you sober minded men may be ashamed of him, who managed his work with so much wickedness and im∣pudency while he staid; and when it came to the very trial then he run away, and would not stand, though I desired him; hereby did his guilt appear is flying the tryal; and this is the substance of the Business, though not
every particular word; and I have gathered it up to send you and him, that when you see it, and consider and read what you have done, you may be ashamed of him, and of your own unreasonableness: And further, He is al∣ready proved, and may be more largely hereafter, to be one that God never sent, both by Conversation and Doctrine, and no Minister of Jesus Christ; and not only in the House, but when we were come forth, such was your Vio∣lence to the stopping of us, when we were pasting, and had not the Mayor pre∣vented it, our Suffering from some of you had been more then it was: let the Fear of God strike you, and let his Light search Wicked and Ungodly Hearts, and repent of your doings, and cease to do Evil, and turn from your Deceiver, if you love your own Souls; and learn the Way of Righteousness and Peace, which you have not yet known; for in the broad way you are, and the end of it will be unto your everlasting Destruction. And to you this is a Warning, and a Visitation from the Lord, by a Lover of your Souls, who is true, though by you called and counted a Deceiver; and this in Love to your Souls is sent unto you. E. B. Here also followeth certain Queries to Christopher Fowler the same time, to which he never yet could give any Sober Answer, therefore I here insert them, that he may yet give his Answer. Christopher Fowler, SEeing thou art a man so irrational, and so unsober to speak, and fairly to debate things in Discourse, and thy Auditory so rude and inhumane in Be∣haviour, and words; therefore to thee these few Queries I propound, to try thee, whether thou wilt shew the spirit of a Man by writing, more then by speaking; seeing therein I have tryed thee, to be more like a Wild Inhumaine Creature, than a Sober and Upright Christian. Seeing the Scripture saith, the Word of God was in the Beginning, and the World was framed by it, and it shall endure forever, hence I query of thee, I. Whether the Scriptures be the very Word of God, yea, or nay? Seeing the Scriptures were not in the Beginning, neither was the World fra∣med by them, neither can they endure forever, hence I query of thee, II. Whether the very Word of God be Scripture, yea, or nay? Seeing it is confessed, that which is written of, and declared of, in the Scrip∣tures, is the Word of God, and the Truth, which shall endure forever, hence Iquery of thee, III. Whether the Scriptures (the Writings) and the Thing or Subject declared and written of, are not two distinct things (so as one may have the one and not the other) yea,  nay? Seeing God, and his Word, Will and Mind is Eternal, Infinite and Endless, hence I query of thee, if thou hast an Understanding answer, IV. Whether God, his Word, Will and Mind, is, or can be contained or holden in Scriptures and Writings, or but only part of the Declaration of him, of his Word, Will and Mind, yea, or nay? Seeing such were false Prophets, which preached for Hire, and divined for Money, and sought for Gain from their Quarter, hence I query of thee, V. Whether by this Rule art not thou proved a false Prophet, who preachest for Hire, and takest Hire for Preaching, and hast a Quarter (reading of some part of it) from which thou seekest Gain? answer in Plainness.
Seeing every Tree is known by its Fruit, as Christ saith, hence I query, VI. Whether by this rule, thou that bringst forth the same fruits as the false Prophets did viz. Lies, Lightness, Pride, Covetousness, and false accusing, art not the same Tree, viz. a false Prophet? Seeing they were false Prophets, who ran and were not sent, and did not profit them, the people at all; but clothed themselves with the Wool, and pre∣pared War against them that put not into their Mouths, &c. hence I query of thee, VII. Whether by this rule thou art not proved a False Prophet, who canst not prove that thou art sent of God, neither are the people profitted by thee; but are rude, and wanton, and wicked; and thou preparest war against them that put not into thy mouth, by suing them at law for Tithes, &c? Seeing Scorning, Lying, Slandering, Envy, Hatred, Lightness, &c. with much more of which thou art guilty, are the fruits of the flesh, and of the Divel; hence I query of thee, VIII. Whether by this rule art thou not proved to be no Minister of Christ, but of the Devil, and a Servant to him; and a Liver to the Flesh, and not in the Spirit, in whom these Fruits of Darkness, and of the Flesh are abounding? Seeing the Scripture saith, the Word of God was in the beginning, and Christ Jesus is the Foundation, and no other can be laid; hence I query of thee, IX. Whether by this rule thou art not proved a Deceiver, and thy Doctrine false, and Error, and contrary to Scripture; who said, the Scriptures are the Word of God, (which were not in the Beginning) and said, that the Scriptures (which are not Christ) are the Foundation of Foundations? and whether this Doctrine of thine doth not de∣ny Christ, and so art proved to be Antichrist? answer according to Truth. Seeing thou confessest thou hast Hire for Preaching, yet sayst, thou preachest not for Hire; hence I query of thee, X. Whether any of the People of Reading would give thee so much a Year if thou didst not preach to them? and if no then whether they do not give thee so much, and thou re∣ceive it, because thou Preachest unto them? or, did they give thee so much before thou preachest? or will they give thee any when thou dost cease to preach to them? try them when thou wilt, and prove thy self a true Prophet, by Preaching some years and re∣ceiving nothing; and till then I charge thee to be a false Prophet. Seeing the Ministry which Christ Jesus sent by the Apostles, did bring people that they needed no man to teach them, but as the anointing within them; hence I query of thee, XI. Whether by this rule thy Ministry is proved not to be of Christ Iesus, nor thou sent of him, by which none can come to this condition, that they need no man to teach them, (produce any one if thou canst) and so a Ministry of Anti-christ, and thou of the Divel. Seeing they that abide not in the Doctrine of Christ, have not God; hence I query of thee, XII. Whether by this rule thou art not proved to be without Christ, and without God, who abides not in Christ's Doctrine; but are called of men Master, and stand Pray∣ing in the Synagogue, and hast the chief Seat in the Assembly, and contrary to Christ's Command? Answer these Queries with the Spirit of Soberness, if thou hast it; and shew thy self a man, if thou hast the Heart of a man; and Repent of thy Wickedness, and own thy Condemnation upon thy Former Words and Works. I am a Friend unto thy Soul, but a witness against thy Deceits. E. B.
And after which time, for the space of two years, I had no Communication with Christopher Fowler, till this last nineth Moneth, at a place called East-Hsted, where a Meeting of Dispute was appointed, and challenged by some of his Brethren, at which place again I met with this my Adversary, where we had some hours Discourse, and many particulars of False Doctrine fell from Christopher Fowler's mouth, some few of which hereafter follow. First, one of his brethren in his prayer before the dispute, prayed to God to forgive them the Atheism that were in their hearts of him and his Brethrens. Answer, now an Atheist is one that denies God, and Atheism is denying of God, according to common reputation, Atheism is so taken; so that how shall such a Generation of men bring people to the Knowledge of God by their Ministry? or how should they ever convert people, to profit them, who yet in their own Hearts denyed God, as the man acknowledged in his prayer be∣fore the Lord, and many witnesses? the Poor People of England had thought that the Spirit of God had been in your Hearts, but now we know that you deny God in your Hearts, and you have confessed it to your own shame: are you Ministers of Christ, and yet denies God in your hearts; and in whose hearts lodges Atheism? Oh! let not people be deceived by you, but repent, ye that know not God, but with your Mouthes confess him, and with your hearts do deny him. Christopher Fowler also affirmed, that day, That the Scriptures are the Glorious ever∣lasing Foundation of Foundations. Answ. And hereby it is made manifest that he hath totally denyed Christ, and so proved with his brother, confest in his prayer, that indeed Atheism is in their Hearts; and so he hath denyed Christ, whom the Scriptures say is the Foundation, and no other Foundation can any man lay, and upon him were the Saints builded in their Faith, and all their Practices of Religion; for he is the corner Stone, as it is Written: and thus he hath dishonoured Christ, in setting the Scriptures above him, and taking the Honour from him, and gi∣ving it to the Scriptures; and I shall leave this his Doctrine to be considered, with a query, to these people of his Church in Reading, whether he is worth hear∣ing, or giving Money to for preaching, that holds forth such Doctrine? and whether it is possible he should bring them to Christ, who hath in effect deni∣ed him to be the Foundation, and held forth, that the Scriptures are the glori∣ous everlasting Foundation of Foundations: Much I need not say to uncover the error of suc a Doctrine. Again he affirmed, That a man at one and the same time might be a Minister of Christ, and a Deceiver. Answ. And here all may see the weakness and Ignorance of this strange Para∣dox, and indeed which is contrary to the Scriptures, which saith, No man can serve two Masters: and its very certain, that he that serves the Devil, doth ot serve Christ at the same time; and he that serves Christ doth not serve the Devil; and so his Doctrine is Antichristian, which would make People be∣lieve, that though they serve the Devil, yet they are the Servants of God; and this is as much as he hath said, that one may be a Minister of Christ, and yet a Deceiver; now a Deceiver is one that follows the Spirit of the Devil, and a Minister of Christ is one that followes the Spirit of Christ, and these two Spirits are contrary, and not both ruling in one man at one time: But then to help the matter, he said, a man might serve Christ in Office, but not in Love: to which my answer was, let him say, whether he and the Priests of England did serve Christ by way of Office, or Love, both, or either, and I should prove the contrary; but that we prosecuted no further: Some other things were affirmed by him that day, not now remembred. He said, That Christ was a Sinner, from this Argument laid down by him; all that dies e Sinners, Christ died, therefore, &c. These, and such things he held forth
all that day, besides the unsoberness of his words, and carriages towards me, who called me a Dog divers times, and did use very ridiculous jestures and words towards me, even to his own shame in the sight of many people; and the people of that County do yet well remember his unchristian-like proceedings; and were ashamed of him; but at last went his way, and all his brethen, and I was left among the people; and I need not now mention for many, even themselves know it, what loss and disadvantage they sustained that day; and Gods loving Truth was advanced, and the advantage of it that was obtained on the Lords behalf; but I being not yet as it were wholly satisfied, but would endeavour further to the laying open deceit, and to invade Antichrists king∣dom; the next morning after the dispute it was upon me to write forth, and to send him this paper of Propositions following: whereunto is annexed his Answer. C. Fowler: FRiend, seeing thou art so high in thy spirit against us, and against the truth which we profess, and from time to time dost open thy Mouth so wide in Justification of thy self, and thy Practices, and in false charges against us; and though we have had divers Meetings, and the differences between us alwayes appeared greater and greater; therefore this I propound unto thee, Whether thou wilt give another Meeting of open dispute for the tryal of thee, and thy wayes, and of us, and the truths which we hold forth, for the satisfaction of the people? and these things following I propound, as the subject matter worthy to be handled, which may discover thee, and us, to the satisfaction of all that desires in that case. First, What be the evident signes and tokens of a Wolf in sheeps clothing? and whether thou, or we, in the sight of the people, and of the Lord God can clear our selves, to be clear and free, from the marks and signs of such afore∣said? Secondly, Whether wilt thou stand to be tried in thy Ministry, in thy Call to it, Practice in it, and Maintenance of it, by and according to the Scriptures of the old and new Testament? and wilt thou admit of tryal of thy Church, and Wor∣ship, and Ministry thereby? and this being done, we do engage to suffer the like tryal in any part, and every part of our Religion. Thirdly, Whether there be any other Foundation of Faith, &c. for the people of God at this day, then Jesus Christ onely, and alone? and whether he was not the Foundation to the Fathers before the Scriptures were written? and whe∣ther he that layes or preaches any other Foundation, doth not dishonor Christ, and speak contrary to the Scriptures? These things with some others, which we may have occasion to speak of, are we willing to discourse with thee, for the further clearing of the truth, and lay∣ing open dece; for yesterday I had much more to have spoken to thee, hadst thou not go o hastily away: so if thou art willing to joyn in discourse wh me again int place and hour, either this day, or to morow, for my oc∣casions wll admit of either of these two days; always provided that we may have all modetion, and may proceed in meekness like men, and not like Raylers, as thou appearedst yesterday to thy own shame. An answer hereof we do expect with speed; and we are Friends to all that love Righteousness. E. B. Thomas C
THe original of this was delivered to the hands of C. Fowler in Reading, the next morning after the dispute at East-Hamsted, and being given to him at his Steeple-house-door, when he was comming out from his worship, he would have given them again to the Messenger, after he had it in his hand, and open∣ed it, but not being taken, he said he would burn it: and thus people may see, that though he cryed against us as Deceivers behind our backs, yet he is one of them dumb Dogs that cannot bark, nor fright us away, if we were such as he saith of us. And here all sober people may understand the temper of this my Adversary, and I shall leave them to judge of the proceedings between him and me; but yet though he denies to meet me, yet when I was passed out of the Country, becaused the following paper to be fixed upon the Steeple-house-door at East-Hsted, where the dispute was drawn up by him, and set there as a hidious vapour, to enchant the minds of people; it may be, not supposing that ever it should have come to publique view, as now it is like to do, to his shame. A true Charge in ten particulars against the people called QUAKERS 1. THey that pernitiously deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, are Hereticks and Blasphemers: But those called Quakers do thus deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God; therefore they are Hereticks and Blasphemers. 2. They that deny the Scriptures to be the Foundation of Faith, and Rule of Life, they are Hereticks and Blasphemers: But the Quakers do this; therefore they are Hereticks and Blasphemers. 3. They that do not own the Lord Iesus Christ to be God by Nature, are horrible Blas∣phemers: But those called Quakers, do not own the Lord Iesus Christ to be God by Na∣re; therefore they are Blasphemers. 4. They that say the good works of the Saints are meritorious of Eternal Life, are Hereticks, and Papists of the worst sort: But the Quakers say so; therefore they are Hereticks, and Papists. 5. They that deny the Ordinance of Water-Baptism, and the Administration of the Lord's-Supper, they are Antichristian Hereticks: But the Quakers do this; therefore the Quakers are Antichristian Heretick. 6. They that deny the sin of Infants are Pelagian Hereticks: But the Quakers deny the Sin of Infants; therefore they are Pelagian Hereticks. 7. They that deny the Resurrection of this Body, are Hereticks: But the Quakers de∣ny this; therefore they are Hereticks. 8. They that deny the Christian Sabbath, are very erroneous: But the Quakers do this; therefore they are very erroneous. 9. They that quarrel at, and deride the singing of David's Psalms, calling them the de of Hopkins, and Sternhold, the Kings Fidlers, they are foo ignorant and Pne in that: But the Quakers do this; therefore they are fooli ignorant, and Prphane in this. 10. They that publikely charge the Office and Call of Ministers with Lyes▪ and Calum∣, they are Railers and Slanderers: But the people called Quakers do this; therefore the people called Quakers, are Railers and Slanderers. These things through the Lord I am able to justifie, and if I do not, I shall be contented to be called a Deceiver: Let them chuse their own time as soon as they please; in witness whereof I have set to my hand, this twenty sixth of November, 1659. Christopher Fowler.
And according to providence, this paper coming to my hands, though its be∣lieved without any purpose in him, to which I did return my Answer, as to an∣swer his Challenge, and neither time nor place being mentioned by him but both left to us to appoint, I did appoint Reading for the plate, and nominated a certain day r the time, and he had gh a week, notice from me, and the time appoint∣ed I went to Rding to attend the Service, but when I came there, I understood that be would not meet me according to his own Proposals and Agreement, but nominated another place, and another time, which was supposed by me and others o e but a present evacting of the er? whereupon his denial to meet me at the time and plac appointed by me, this following Letter I sent unto him. C Fo, WHereas a Challenge of hine (to us called Quakers, for a Dispute upon ten Particulars) was set upon the Steeple-house door, at East Hamsted, and leaving it to us to appoint time and place, I did appoint, Reading for the place, and the fourth day of this week, called Wednesday, the 21th. of this moneth, for the time; and in order to proceed (upon the Particulars in dispute with thee, the place and me aboveid) I ordered my occasions so as to attend upon the Service the said time, but I being come into the Town this night, do per∣ceive, that thou art not content with the place and time, though they were left to our appointing in thy Challenge, but hast appointed another place and time, upon some feeble Reasons which thou givest, which I might shew the weakness of, and might upon many better reasons say, that Reading is the only place seasona∣ble to dispute at; or if thou be indeed a true Minister of Christ, the people of this Town best deserve to know it, by hearing it to be so; and if thou art a De∣ceiver, the people of this Town had the most need of any others to know it, by hearing thee disproved: So upon this place I have pitched, and cannot now change my resolution, nor alter neither time nor place, by me before-mentioned, my occasion will not admit me to it. Therefore I thought good to write to thee, to know for certain under thy hand, whether you will give a meeting or not in this Town, the fourth day next, as aforesaid; if not, this matter must yet remain as it stands between us, till a more clear opportunity; for I cannot be at Oking the day mentioned by thee, because my service is already determined for that day, and for some other reasons also in my own breast: Let me have a plain an∣swer from thee, that I may dispose of my self is the Lord guides me for his ser∣vice. This is all for present I do desire, who am a Friend to all that love the Lord. Reading the 19th of the 10th Moneth, 1659 E. Burroughs. But to this Letter his Answer was, he would not meet me at Reading, for there was no need of Dispute there; and therefore it is my present work at this time, for to answer his ten Particulars in writing, and to make them pub∣lick to ll, that all may judge of this matter. And indeed, but that for these te particulrs Charges, and that truth may be clear from those Charges in his ten Particulars, I believe I had not thus proceeded in this publick manner; but be∣cause e ceaseth not to speak evil of the Truth, and yet will not come forth fairly to Tryal, neither will answer me any Queries in publick, but keeps a secret revi∣ling and reproaching; therefore do I thus proceed. Answer to the first Position: Thy Major and thy Minor are both lame, and both false, and thy so conclusion falls, to the Ground; for the Quakers do not pernitiously deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, but they in sincerity say, that Christ is the Word of God, Io. 1. 1. Rev. 19. 13. and the Scriptures are the Words of God, and a Declaration, and a Treatise, and this Testimony is accord∣ing to the Scriptures, Luke 1. 1: Acts 1. And it is not Heresie nor Blasphemy to deny the Scriptures (to wit, the writings) to be the Word of God, but the truth
written of, and those things declared of in the Scriptures,  he Word of God, and not the writings, which are Scriptures, But this i the  to before, m so I pass it. Answer to the second Position: Thy Major Position is uly , and not grounded upon any part of the Scriptures, so that the Ni, and the Conclu∣ are both denied and cast out: for a man my sy, That Chris e Foun∣dation of Faith, and the Spirit of God is the Rule of Life; for thus the Scrip∣tures say: and a man may lawfull; deny the Scriptures to be the Foundation of Fa, and Rule of Life, and neither be Heretick nor Blasphemer: was the Apo∣e a Blasphemer and a Heretick, who said, No other Foundation could be laid, but th which was laid already, which was Christ? And was he a Heretick and a Blas∣phemer, that said, The Sons of God were led by the Spirit of God, and exhorted to walk y the Rule of the Spirit? and are the Quakars, Blasphemers and Heretis, who old forth, that Truth the Apostles held forth; and who walk by the Spirit, w according, and not contrary to the Scriptures? O tho Perverter of the right way of God, who hast falsly accused the Innocent in thy illiterate Logick. Answer to the third Position: In this thou hast falsly accused; but yet let us csider thy words; There was a Nature in that Ma Iesus Christ; that was born of te gin, that was subject to cold, heat, thirst and hunger, and subject to be tempted of the Devil; and this nature was not God, whose nature is Infinite, Eternal Unmeasurable, me sbject to hunger nor thirst, nor to heat and cold, nor subject to temptations; so that a man may say lawfully, and be no Blasphemer, that there was a Nature in him which was ot God, and yet the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him too; and he is the Everlasting Father, and the Father is in him, and he in the Father: and thus by a sound interpretation of the Word, (God by Nature) thy Major, and Minor, and Conclusion, are all made void. Answer to the fourth: The good works of the Saints are wrought in God, and by his Spirit, and its God that works in them to will and to do, and all such Works are worthy Works, glorious Works and blessed Works, even unto Eternal Life, as the Scripture saith, Glory, Honour and Peace be unto every man that orketh good, Rom. 2. 7, 10. And no man by Faith without Works is justified; for Faith without Works is dead, and a dead Faith doth not justifie: This is our Faith, and the Faith which the Apostles were of; and we are neither He∣reticks nor Papists no more then were the Apostles: and thy argument is vain, and falls to the ground, and hath no weight in it unto sober Minds, though Self-righ∣teousness is altogether Abomination to the Lord, and justifieth not any man. Answer to the fifth Position: A man may deny the Sprinkling of Infants, and the administration of Bread and Wine, as is held forth in your Assemblies, and be neither Antichristian, nor a Heretick; for the Institution of sprinkling Infants, and administring of Bread and Wine among unconverted people was never or∣dained of God, nor practised amongst the Apostles; if thou sayst it was, prove it out of the Scriptures, or else stop thy Mouth; and to deny such Ordinances and Practices, which God never commanded, nor the Saints of forer Ages ever practiced, is not Antichristian nor Heresie; but thu; do the Qakers, and tfore they are not Antichristian nor Hereticks upon this accomp and t thy Position is not worth any thing, for the end proposed by thee; but thy Weakness and Folly is made manifest, and thy idolatous Prctices, so much pled for by thee, are denied and opposed by the Spirit of the Lord. Answer to the sixth Position: As for the sin of Infants, we do not say, That In∣fants in general, that is to say, every particular Infant that is  hath been horn into the World, has Sin; for some were fillen with the holy Ghost, and some were ctified from their Mother Womb; and what Sin had such? And the Scriptre speaks, That the Unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Beliving H ese   Cildr unclean, but now are they holy: And what sin had these. So that y ma∣ is proved defective, and so thy minor and thy conclusion is worth nothing, though as to the general part we do believe, there is a nature whereby all are Children of Wrath, in Degeneration.
Answer to the seventh: This is a false Accusation, thy minor Proposition, and is a Lye; and so thy Conclusion is utterly false. Answer to the eighth: As for the Christian-Sabbath, we do not deny that, for Christ is the Saints Rest; and the Seventh day of the Week is the Iews Sabboth, and not the Christian-Sabbath; and so this is but a false Accusation, as the rest. And as for the first day of the Week, which you observe for Sab∣both, you have neither binding Example, nor express Command in Scripture for that practice. Answer to the ninth: As for the singing of David's Psalms in Rhime and Meeter, and in the Custom as practised amongst you, we do utterly deny to be any Ordinance of God, or any part of his Worship, though you say it is; yet we never had other proof of you then Tradition of time, and long Custom; and by this you would seem to plead the practice to be a Duty: But this satis∣fies not us, though we do not quarrel nor deride at your practice in this par∣ticular; (as thou groundst thy Argument) but this we do, we freely give our Testimony against your practice from time to time, in the Fear and Power of the Lord, yet not as quarrelling and deriding after the Flesh; though we do say, they were composed in Rhime and Meeter by Sternhold, and Hopkins, and others, which were Musitioners to the Queen; and in this we say true, and are neither ignorant, foolish, nor prophane, as thou sayst; and we give wit∣ness against such your practice to be Antichristian, and you Deceivers of the People thereby: so hereby is thy Conclusion made void, and a place is brought in for another; They that act such things, and observe such pra∣ctices, in pretence of Honour and Worship to God, which is not com∣manded nor instituted of God, nor which his Spirits leads unto, They are Idolaters, and their Worship, and their Practice is Abomination unto the Lord: But thus do the Ministers and People of the Church of England; and therefore the Ministers and People of the Church of England are Idolaters, and their Practices Abomination unto the Lord. Answer to the tenth: Thy minor Proposition I do deny; for we do not charge the Office and Call of the Ministers of the Church of England with Lies and Calumnies; but this we say, their Office, and their Call is not from the Lord, nor by the Authority of his Spirit; neither is their Office and Call ac∣cording to the Scriptures, but it is different and contrary both to the Spirit of God, and the Scriptures, and is not from Heaven, but rather from the Whore of Rome. And though we do affirm these things concerning the Ministry of England, yet we do not charge it with Lyes and Calumnies, but we speak the Truth in righteousness: And what would C. Fowler and his Brethren have said of the true Prophets, that called the Priests and Watchmen of Israel, (that were made by Divine Institution, which the Office and Call of England's Ministry never was) that called them blind Watchmen, and greedy dumb Dogs, and devourers of Souls? Might not they have said to the true Prophets, you charge the Office and Call of the Priests of the Lord with Lyes and Slanders? And this is like the case between us and the Priests of England: And did not Christ call the chief Priests Serpents, Vipers and Hypocrites, and those Priests were in their Office, and Call of Gods Institution; but might not they have said, that he charged the Office and Call of the Priesthood with Calumnies, &c. and the case is the same with us; and it is accounted no sin by the Lord, for us to give our witness against the Wayes and Practices of the Priests of England, and utterly to deny both its Office and Call; for they that do profess their Office and Call to be of God, and from him, and yet can give no true Testimony thereof, by the Spirit of God, and according to the Scrip∣tures, such are deceived, and Deceivers of others; but such are the Priests of England, and therefore, &c. And thus I have returned Answer to his Ten Propositions, and laid down some others in their place, his being confounded; and I must leave it to
be judged of by the Witness in every mans Conscience, whether he hath not shewed his madness and folly in his matter, and in the way of his proceedings; as for the matter he charges us withal, its wholy invalid, as for the end pro∣poed by h, and we account of his Work, as but the malice of an Antichri∣stian spirit: And as for his proceedings, they are inconsistent with a Minister of Christ, for him and his Brethren to fly from me at his Dispute at East-Ham∣sted, as before mentioned, as being not able to defend their Cause; this he and they did, as many in that Country knows: d then for him the next morning, when I did invite him to meet again upon sober reasons, which he also denied, and refused to meet me any more; and yet afterwards, when I was gone out of the Country, to go and hatch such mischief in his mind, as to invent ten such rain Arguments, and cause them to be set up on the Steeple-house-door, o purpose to villifie and reproach the Innocent People of God; this was his Wickedness, as all upright men may see: And further, for him to challenge to dispute these Particulars, and leave time and place to our appoint∣ing; which when time and place was appointed, sutable and equitable on all parts; and yet for him to refuse to meet at that time and place, this was his fdy and madness, as understanding men may discern: And further, for him yet to rail behind our backs against us in his Pulpit, and to charge us, as if we refused to meet him; this is his hypocrisie, and the deceitfulness of his heart, whereby he thinks to keep the People in blindness; but the Light is now arising in the Hearts of People, whereby such Deceits and Deceivers are fully disco∣vered, and they cannot now be hid. And though for many Ages Deceivers, and false Prophets, have hid them∣selves under the Profession of Ministers, and fine names; yet the Day of the Lord is dawned, which hath made them fully manifest, and now their Sheeps cloathing will not hide them, though they cover themselves therewith, and have deceived the World thereby, and these Babylons Merchants, they have made great gain upon people, and traded with the Souls of men, and Souls have been murdered, even for dishonest gain; but the Plagues of God is com∣ing upon the Earth, which the Whore, the false Church hath corrupted through her Sorceries and Witchcrafts; and as she hath done unto others, in causing them to drink her Cup of Abominations, and false Principles, Doctrines and Practices, which the Beast and his Power hath imposed upon the Nations, and Nations have been made drunk thereby; and in particular, this C. Fowler, with whom I am now dealing, is made manifest to be one of these Merchants of Ba∣bylon, who hath made Merchandize of people for gain to himself, and such are his covetous cursed Practices, having a heart exercised with Covetousness and Oppression, as is well known in the Town of Reading; as for instance. First, It was charged upon him, and confessed by him, that he sued at Law twelve poor men of Reading, for the Tythe of their Turnips, and with much ma∣lice and greediness did prosecute the twelve poor men, and put himself and them to great Charges and Trouble; onely he confessed he took but twenty Nobles of them, and thought he did favourably with them. Now this was ac∣knowledged by his own Mouth, which is a clear demonstration of the Co∣veousness and Oppression of this man, and that he is a grinder of the faces of the Poor, and exceeds in Unmercifulness and Cruelty, the very worst of the false Prophets that ever we read of in Scripture. Oh! abominable Pra∣ctice, which shames Christianity, and the Profession of Christ, that ever such a Fellow should have the name of a Gospel-Minister, and that ever people should be so blind, as to receive this man for a Messenger of God, who hath a heart filled with such cursed grinding Practices, who is in the way of Balaam, and exceeding him in covetousness. Secondly, He said, he did not Preach for Hire; but confessed, that he had Hire for Preaching.
Answ. With this kind of foolish Paradox he would deceive and blind the peo∣ple, for if he have hire for Preaching (for) sheweth a reason, and it is the same, he hath hire, because he preacheth; that is the reason wherefore he hath hire, and so he is a hireling: And it may easily be proved, that he will not preach, if he have not so much Money, Tythes, or such things, and his own example be∣fore-mentioned, in suing at Law twelve poor men, for the very Tythes of Turnips in the Garden, doth demonstrate him sufficiently to be a hireling, as also a third particular; which is, He demanded Money of a certain man is Reading, for marrying the said man, when as the man was married by another; yet notwithstanding the said Fowler forced the said man to give him seven shillings and six pence, because he pretend∣ed he was a man of his Parish (to wit) within his quarter, where he seeks his gain. Answ. And thus it is fully manifest more and more, that he is one that seeks for his gain from his quarter, and is a compleat man in the very nature and steps of the false Prophets of Israel, whose example he doth follow, and not the example of any of the Ministers of Jesus Christ. Was not this a piece of griping covete∣ousness, to demand Money of the man which he married not? Oh abominable! What, wouldst thou have Wages without any work? this is a degree beyond preaching for hire, to claim and receive Money of a man, having no manner of due, nor title thereunto: Well, people cannot be so blind, but they must needs see thy folly, wickedness and covetousness. Fourthly, Christopher Fowler at a certain time did give a poor Minister, so cal∣led, five shillings; and afterwards there happened to be a Collection for the poor Irish, and he snatched five shillings of that Money away which was gathered, and said, he gave five shillings a while ago to a poor Minister, This was his pretence, and thus he defrauded the poor Irish people. Answ. Was not this also a foul covetous Practise, and hypocrisie too, in pre∣tending to give a poor man some Money, and afterwards, as it were, to rob others to pay himself? Here is a double iniquity, and unmeasurable covetous∣ness, which the Lord will judge: And the like of this manner of greediness is seldom to be found so foul, and so extream deceitful and covetous: But all these things are but a further testimony of his naughtiness; and this I do in order, that all men may beware and take heed of the mouthes of Wolves in Sheeps cloath∣ing, which tears the flocks, and devoures both souls and bodies of men, such a one as this man, with which I am now dealing; let all men beware of him, least they become his prey. Fifthly, Another covetous Practise of Christopher Fowlers was, he sold one Load of Straw twice, and the man that bought it first, did sue him at Law, and it was prosecuted, and Fowler was Cast, to his great shame; and this the people of Read∣ing very well knows. Answ. Nothing need be said, as to discover the wickedness and covetousness of this Practise, the worst of men seldom ever is found in such a Practise: Is not this an unfit person to mention the Name of Christ, or to take it into his mouth? Oh deceitful man I who art unfit to be called a Christian, much less a Minister of Christ: These, and divers others such like covetous Practises is C. F. highly guilty of, as many good people very well knows. Divers other things I could mention, but these for present are sufficient, for the end that they are produced, which is to lay Christopher Fowlers wickedness upon him, that he may feel the weight of it upon his conscience, and that all sober people may be warned of such men, that they have not to do with them. But however, if Chrisiopher Fowler shall answer my Queries propounded to him, and shall seek to clear himself from what I have said, he shall hear further from me; however in the mean time, let him stop his boasting, and vaunting, and vapouring Challenges, till he hath answered what is charged against him in this Book.
But and if Christopher Fowler doth go on with his railing Accusations, and presumptuous boasts against us, then let him appoint any time that he shall please, and in the Lord's Power I shall engage, that he shall be met at what time he will appoint, in any place in Reading. Reading I do appoint for the place, let him appoint what time he please for to dispute of any such thing or things as we may agree upon at our meeting: And though he is unwilling to dispute in Reading, yet there is no other place so sutable as that Town is, for many reasons, as may be shewed; and I suppose justly, that his unwillingness to dispute at Reading, ariseth, lest he should be discovered among his own Hearers, and therefore would evade the matter, by seeming to be wil∣ling to dispute at other places, which is not so sutable, nor yet so reasonable; but if he will at Reading, let him appoint time at his pleasure, and he shall be an∣swered, if God permit. Now C. Fowler, hold up thy hand; Guilty, or not Guilty; whether a Mini∣ster of Christ, or a Deceiver? come to the Bar, and receive the Sentence, thou that hast long been accounted by some as an Oracle; thy glory is fallen, and thou art brought into contempt: How have they been deceived, that have look∣ed upon thee as an Oracle? thy Language is sentenced to be of Bablon; and the Beast false Prophet must be taken alive, and cast into the Lake of Burning: The Day of the Lord is come. E. B.
A 1660 RETURN TO THE MINISTERS OF LONDON, BY Way of Answer to their Seasonable Exhortation, (so called) directed to their Congregations. With sober Reproof sent unto them, because of their se∣cret Smitings against the dispised People called Quakers, whom they have secretly reproached in their said Exhortation. And this is written for the better Information of them and their particular Congregations, and that Truth may he exalted, and Deceit and Iniquity may Bow and Tremble. 1. FOrasmuch as you the Ministers in and about London, have sent forth a Seasonable Exhortation (as you call it) to the people of your Congrega∣tions, which I have seen, read, and considered, and do find something therein worthy of Answer; for the end that People may be satisfied concern∣ing things doubtfull, which are in controversie this day among many; for it is well known the Controversie hath been long, and is grown very high between us and you, concerning Church, Ministry, and Religion; and divers things in your Exhortation are doubtfull unto many; and that all doubts may be removed, if possible, therefore I do return what follows, as an answer unto you. Whereas you say, You are not ignorant of the prejudices and prepositions, wherewith the carnal World is leavened, concerning you Calling, Office, and Doctrines; and what Clamors; and fiery Contentions abound for them every where that pleads Christ's Cause in the Gates, &c. Answ. As for your Calling, Office, and Doctrine, there is much to be said against them, in and by the Spirit of the Lord; for your Calling and Office, is not accor∣ding to the Example of Scriptures, though the Calling and Office of Ministers of the Gospel hath Example in the Scripture, yet as you are called into your Office, that is not according, but rather contrary to the Scriptures: And as for your Doctrine, it is in some things unsound also. Now as for Seasonable Exhor∣tations of Ministers to People, I do acknowledge, that it is a Duty which ought to be done, but how seasonable and sound your Exhortations are, that remains to be tried; and it is not onely the carnal World, as you speak, that are doubtfull concerning your Calling and Office, but it the best of the people, whose eyes the Lord is opening, to see and behold the false immitations of the Calling and Office of Ministers, as you have stood for many Generations; and it is true,
them that pleads Christs Cause, they are cryed out upon, and contended with, but this fully belongs not to you, though you apply it to your selves, but it pertains more to others, for the World speaks well of you, as it use to do of false Prophets. And you say, We the Ministers of the Gospel in the City of London, do with ear∣ess exhort the people of this City, to awaken, as out of Sleep, and to lay to heart, the great dangers that threatens you, which you represent under a threefold considera∣tion. 1 The fear of the return of Popery. 2 The distracted estate of Religion amongst us. 3 Other symptomes of Gods wrath hanging over your Heads. Answ. That you are Ministers of the Gospel, this is doubtful unto many, and many more testimonies might be given to the contrary, then can be given for it. But this is not the present debate, and therefore no more of it. And what, is the people of your Congregations yet asleep? Have not you a∣wakened them in so many years time? Have you been preaching over them, and taking their Money so long, and are they yet to awaken, as out of Sleep? Will not the blame of this, and the condemnation of it fall upon you their Watch-men, who hath not yet awakened them? And may not they say that you have dealt un∣justly by them, who are left as asleep under all your preaching, and are yet un∣sensible of the danger that threatens them? Oh Friends! will you consider, and your people with you, what you have been preaching, and what they have been hearing for so long a time, seeing you now acknowledge they are yet asleep, and unawakened. Now as to the first of your considerations, The fear of the return of Popery, for which you lay down divers things to make the people believe it: First, The union of foreign Popish-Powers: Secondly, The vast numbers (say you) of Popish Emissaries and Jesuites that swarms amongst you: Thirdly, The vending and printing of so many Po∣pish Books every year, &c. Answ. As for Popery, I know it is Idolatry, and their Church and Worship, and every part thereof abomination to the Lord, and the spirit that leads them is not the Spirit of Jesus; and as for Popery, it was never yet truly cleansed out of the Nation, but there hath been, and are great remainders yet standing, which may indeed easily recover its former strength: For is not the most part of the worship of the Church of England made up of such things, as was first in∣stituted and practised amongst the Papists, witness, the making Ministers by natural learning, at Schools and Colledges, and their maintenance by Tythes, and yearly Stipends, and their way of Parochial settlements, are not all these things Papistical? and witness sprinkling Infants, calling it the Baptism into the Visible Church, and witness the singing of Davids Psalms, as now they are sung among you; these things for the most part are of Popish institution, and ma∣ny other things also pertaining to your Church, Religion, and Ministry, so that Popery was never clean cast out of the Nation, though the Lord hath wound∣ed it, yet there is the remainder of it yet standing in great force, so that while Tythes are pleaded for by you, and those things practised by you, it may in∣deed be feared, the return of Popery, seeing you stick so fast in those Practises which were of Popish institution, and the cause of fear lies at your Door, and upon your selves principally, and if there be vast numbers of Popish Priests and Jesuites swarming amongst you, if you be Ministers of Christ, why do you not discover Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, and fright them away? Why do you not lift yp your Spiritual Weapons, (if you have them) as the Apostles did? whose Weapons were powerful and mighty through God; and who shall bear the blame but you, if Wolves in Sheeps cloathing tear your Flocks? that is a sign you are lazy idle Shepherds, and that your want the Power and Authority of God, and when the Powers of the Earth fails you, and your
carnal Weapons are all broken, then you are like to be overcome with the swarm∣ing of Popish Priests and Jesuites, if there be any such among you look you to it, for I know not any, and if you know any by name, and where they are, you ought by your Law to discover them. Now (you say) they are acting under the disguise of Sectaries, and subtilly insinuating many of their Doctrines, as teaching Iustification by Inherent Righteousness; Perfection,  lawfulness in joyning in your Ordinances, and nullity of your Ministry, &c. Answ. Now these that you call Sectaries, may truly plead against you, against your Church, Worship, Ministry & Practises, upon good grounds; & as for Justi∣fication by Inherent Righteousness, it is a Doctrine of the Church of Christ, that the Saints witnessed Christ, and his Righteousness within them, and that none are justified by any righteousness without them, but who witness Christ revealed in them; for all are Reprobate; that do not witness Christ in them, 2 Cor. 13. 5. And as for Perfection, that is the Doctrine of the Gospel, and of Christ; for the Apostles spake wisdom to them that were perfect, 1 Cor. 2. 6. and Christ commanded them to be perfect, Mat. 5. who never commanded impos∣sibilities. You might better have charged these Doctrines upon the Apostles, then upon the Papists; and as for joyning to your Ordinances, there is many that fears God who are not Papists, that for good conscience sake cannot joyn to your Ordinances, nor own your Ministry, neither in its Call, Practise, nor Mainte∣nance; and if these things were in dispute, I should shew you, according to Scrip∣ture, that it is not lawful for the Saints of God, to joyn themselves to your Ordi∣nances, nor own your Ministry; but it is lawful for them both to deny your Ordi∣nances and Ministry in their present standing; and as for printing and vending so many Popist Books, as you say; Oh it had been your wisdom to have mention∣ed, the Books by name, that all might have known which were Popish Books; but because your Charge is general, I cannot answer particularly, either to clear or to condemn, except you had mentioned in particular, which you ought to have done, rather then to have slandered in the dark. Your fourth reason, whereby you would make your people believe, that there is fear of the return of Popery, is, That the whole body almost of Popery is published by Secta∣ries, especially Quakers; and you say, you cannot but observe a ready co-incidency with Papists in their Opinions, &c. Answ. As for the Quakers, which you have long opposed by Prisons, Goals, and Persecutions, and your carnal Weapons, and now also charge great things upon them, to make them odious to the people. Alas, do you not know that they are blessed of the Lord? Is there never a man among you sixty one Priests, so wise as Balaam was, he saw there was no Inchantment against Israel, nor durst he curse whom God had blessed; but however, they have born with patience (and they do therein continue) all that you have caused to be acted, and all that you have spoken against them, and your words and works against them shall be your own burthen in the day of the Lord, and shall sink you into misery, who hath made the innocent people, the people of your malice and fury; but God is with them, I need say nothing: and why have you not particularly instanced what particular part of Popery they do publish? Why will you charge in secret, and prove nothing in particular? therefore I do charge you to mention, what particular things they do publish which is Popery, and not the truths of the Gos∣pel, and then you shall have a further answer. Your fifth reason is, Jesuitical designs, and you mention the Protestant Uni∣versities, and the impoverishing, and disgracing, and overthrowing a goodly learned Ministry, &c. Answ. As for the Universities, thousands are satisfied concerning them, that they are of Popish institution, and are not the Fountains of Divinity, as they have been falsly called; for its possible I could give large testimonies of the wickedness of the educations which is there in those places, and how little
good they learn, and how much evil: but you have stated the Cause wrong; for the plucking down the Universities would rather seem to be the removing part of Popery, then to be the way to let in Popery: And as for a godly Ministry, that is truly godly, and truly learned; alas! there is no fear of impoverishing, disgracing, and overthrowing of that, for that is alwayes poor, and low, and contemptible to the World, and so it must be; and it is Antichrist's Ministers that fears to be made poor, and that their Tythes and Stipends should be made less; and it is they that fear to be overthrown, and not the Ministers of Christ; for the Ministers of Christ are out of all such fears, because their standing and falling depends not upon earthly powers, but are builded upon the Rock of Ages, and cannot be overthrown. Your sixth Ground is, Tolleration for Popery is publickly pleaded for in Print, &c. Answ. That Popery is Idolatry, and the Church of Rome a false Church, that I have said, and I hope shall never renounce it, but shall alwayes give Te∣stimony, until death, against the Church of Rome; but I must tell you plainly, it is not my judgment, that the Papists ought to be burned for their Religion; or if a Jesuite be taken in England, I would have him so tollerated, that he should not have his life taken away by inhumane cruelty, not for Religion sake, except something can be charged upon him, besides matters of his Religion, or Conscience: This is my judgment, that both the Papists and you are Antichri∣stian (in this) in that you kill each other, when they take one of your Mini∣sters, and you theirs, to destroy each other; this is not of God, but of the Dragon's power in both, and there ought to be more tolleration in both, that lives may be spared; and you ought to conquer with spiritual Weapons, if that you have them, and not to kill and murder persons, but to judge Spirits. That is contrary to Scripture, and the Apostles Example, to destroy mens lives for Religion sake: And why may not the Papists have tolleration, in matters concerning God, as well as others? So those that plead for their Tolleration up∣on this account, that they may be converted from sin, and not destroyed in their sin, this is no Error, that their lives may be spared; but to plead for their tol∣leration, as the right Religion, this is sin. And thus your sixth Ground, where∣fore you fear the return of Popery is answered. Now I come to the second consideration, which is, The present distracted estate of Religion, which you say is evidenced in divers particulars: First, your division in civil and spiritual things, so that the wonted love and communion in holy Duties is inter∣rupted, strangeness and distances fomented, censures and hard Opinions of each others en∣tertained, &c. Answ. Here is your Error, for true Religion is not distracted nor divided in it self, but it is one in unity and peace, and so are all they that are in it, their hearts being united by the Spirit of the Lord in their Faith, Practice, and Worship, and in all things pertaining to their Religion: Its true, there is di∣straction amongst all the false Sects and Churches upon the Earth, and it must be so, Babylon is divided, and confounded in it self, and one part of it against ano∣ther; so the distractions is amongst your selves, among Papists, Prelates, Pref∣byters, and the rest, tearing and rending one another about Church-Worship and Religion; all like Wolves in Sheep's clothing, biting one another, being divided in civil and spiritual things; one crying for this, and another for the other way of Government in Church and State; and you are out of the true love, and true communion in holy Duties, and interrupts one another; and what one faith is right, another saith is wrong: and all this is in Babylon, among your selves, and none of it among them that are in the true Religion, and in true Church-Union, who are gathered by the Spirit of the Lord. Your second Evidence of the distracted estate of Religion (as you say) is, the many horrid and hideous Errors, which for some years past have abounded amongst us, against the Authority of Scriptures, the Deity of Christ, the holy Ghost,
Trinity of Persons, Immortallity of Souls, Doctrines of Repentance, Humiliation, San∣ctification, Resurrection from the Dead, the Eternal recompence of Heaven and Hell; yea, divers Sects encreasing every day in numbers, power, and malice, and under the name of Quakers, Ranters, Seekers, &c. oppgning the received Doctrine, and un∣questionable interest of Christ Iesus amongst us. Answ. That many horrid Errors have abounded amongst you, that is very true, as in many particulars might be instanced: But why do you maliciously charge the Quakers with opposing the Interest of Christ Jesus? The Lord shall judge you in his Day, when he makes it appear to all the World, that those whom you charge with the contrary, are the very Friends of Christ's In∣terest, and have been patient Sufferrers for his Name sake, under the wicked∣ness of your Generation; and as for the Ranters, Seekers, and others, whom you have reckoned up together with the Quakers, it is well known that we are in opposition in spirit unto all these, and have given large testimony in the Fear of God against them; though it is certain, that there is many as upright and sincere men towards God among these Sects you have mentioned, as any of your Congregations; and though in some things they are condemna∣ble, yet in some things they are as justifiable as you are, before the Lord: And what the Seekers, Ranters, Familists, and the rest mentioned by you do hold, as in these things you have charged them with, I will leave that, for I am not now pleading their cause, but the Cause of God and his People, whom you in scorn call Quakers: and though you have joyned them in Accusation with others, yet I must separate them from others in my Answer, and must tell you in the fear of the Lord, that you have belyed them, and falsly accused them, out of your malicious hearts; for they do not deny the Authority of the Scrip∣tures, but gives that authority to them, which the Spirit of God that gave them forth hath formerly given; neither do they deny the Deity of Christ, but do say, In him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead; neither do they deny the holy Spirit, nor the Father, Son and Spirit, but say there are three, and these three are one; but as for your Trinity of Persons, that is language beside the the Scriptures: and we do affirm the Soul is Immortal: and as for the Doctrines of Repentance, Humiliation, Sanctification, Resurrection from the Dead, the eter∣nal Recompence of Heaven and Hell; these Doctrines are publickly held forth by them in words, and also in practice, more then by your selves▪ therefore with what face you could charge them with the denial of these things, it is al∣most wonderfull; and there are thousands of your Congregations that are and have been sometimes hearing in your City, that shall bear witness against your Accusations, and give Evidence that they have heard them whom you call Quakers, give faithfull witness of, and for all these things which you charge them with denial of: Do you think that your Congregations are all so blind as to receive for truth what you have herein spoken; nay I must tell you, some of them are offended with you because hereof. First, in that you have reckoned the Quakers with Ranters, and others, be∣tween whom there is absolute opposition, and not agreement, neither in Do∣ctrine nor Practice. Secondly, That you should charge the Quakers with such things as they are altogether clear of, and known to be so by many; but this is, that your folly and weakness might appear; and as you speak of encreasing every day in num∣ber power, and malice, some part of this is true; for the Lord doth encrease his People daily in number and power, by his Spirit, but not in Malice, and that is your torment, the encrease of the Quakers, which as they have begun to encrease, so the Lord will continue them, and you, nor mortal men shall not be able to hinder; neither the Magistrates Persecution, nor the Ministers Instigation thereunto, though you have joyned hand in hand against them; for the Lord is with his People, and his Authority and Power is thei Defence, and they are not in empty Forms (as you say) but in the Power
of Godliness; and as for your Ordinances and Ministry, of which you speak, something I have said to it already, and more I shall say to it hereafter. Your third Evidence is, The odious Scandals of those that profess themselves to be the People of God, as their self-seeking, their unparallell'd breach of all civil and sa∣cred Oathes; whereby the Mouth of Iniquity is opened, and the reverence of Religion abated, so that to us (say you) there appears no visible way of repairing the credit of strict profession, but by a severe punishment of Professors, &c. Answ. It is true, many that do profess themselves the people of God, but are not, but by their lives and practices gives odious Scandals, and are Self∣seeking, as you say; but upon whom the guilt of this may be truly charged, that remains to be sought out; doubtless it lies as near your doors as any others; for is not your pride and oppression by taking Tythes, suing people at Law for Wages, and casting them in Prison, because for good Conscience sake they cannot pay you, your seeking for your gain from your Quarter, and your ta∣king great sums of Money, and preaching for hire, taking so much yearly, are not these odious scandals, and very self-seeking practices which you are guilty of, while you pretend publick good? as for Breaches of Oaths and Covenants, I wish you to search your own hearts, for that Iniquity doth lie as near your Generation as any others; witness that you and your Brethren have from time to time engaged to such and such things: As first, Did not you en∣gage for the Government to be without King and House of Lords? And did not you then cry up the Protector, contrary to your Engagements, and now cry up another? And thus it is very evident, that the guilt of breach of Oathes and Covenants lies near unto your selves, which indeed opens the Mouth of Iniquity; for the very Cavaliers and Prelates say, you were once strict in your Way, but now you have struck hands with them, and are now your selves doing that which you cried out against in them: And thousands in this Nation is abated in their affections from your Church, and Ministry, as know∣ing them to be upon a false Foundation, and to be of Babylon, and not of the Heavenly Ierusalem: And what do you mean by severe punishment of Pro∣fessors? Do you mean to set up Ecclesiastical Laws again, and that all must be forced to your Church, Way, and Religion? Is it in your hearts to drive the Nation by force; and if they will not, to punish them with Fire and Fagot, and Prisons? If this be your meaning, as may justly be supposed it is, the Lord deliver the Nation from you; this is not the way to gain the credit of Religion, but the further you go on in this way, as you have formerly walked in, the more will your Profession and Religion stink in the Nostrils of all good men▪ Your fourth Evidence is, Immensity and bounless liberty permitted, assumed, and freely practised by many, to Write, Print, and Publish all manner of Blasphemies and Opinions, &c. the sad and wofull effects thereof appears in many, some being in Apo∣stacy, others in luke-warmness, and much decay in the Power of godliness, &c. Answ. As I have acknowledged  there are without doubt many Errors, Blas∣phemies, and false Opinions extant in this Nation, both Written, Published, and Maintained, but upon whom, and what sort of men this can truely be charged, this is very doubtfull to many; and your Charge being onely ge∣neral, no particular Answer can well be given, onely it appears, you would have none to Write, Print or Publish, but your selves, or by your consent; and you would tye the Nation up in the bondage of your own Spirits; and you would be the onely Judges of Blasphemies and Errors; but that we allow not; for Enemies must not be Judges; and it is very possible such is your Darkness, that you may call Truth Error, and Error Truth in some particulars; but if you shall instance any particular Doctrines, Blasphemies, Errors, and Opini∣ons, published and maintained, in my next I shall freely give my witness, against them, if they be really so, and against the people that holds them, as well as your selves, and more particularly I cannot now say; and there is indeed wofull and sad effects of Errors brought forth in this Nation, and many
are in the Apostacy from the truth, and in the luke-warmness also, and the power of Godliness is decayed, and they have the Form, and holds that without the Power: your selves may do well, and your Congregations also, to search your own hearts, by the Spirit of the Lord in this case, that the guilty may see, and turn unto the Lord, that his wrath come not upon them. Your fifth Evidence is, Sabbath Prophanation, both in Opinion and Practice, grown to a greater height than ever formerly; the Iews Sabbath cryed up, instead of the Christian; Shops opened upon the Lords day; yea, some working the works of their ordinary callings, in knitting, and sowing of Garments in our Assemblies, even in the Pulpits, in the time of Gods publick Worship, &c. Answ. This remains doubtful to many, what the true Sabbath is, and whether the Lord doth require of this Generation the observing one day above another, and if so, what day it is that he requires the observing of; as for the 7th day of the week, we know that the Lord commanded the Iewes to keep as a Sabbath, and to rest, But that was never commanded to the Gentiles; and as for the first day of the week, which is called the Christians Sabbath, that is doubtful to ma∣ny, whether God commands and requires the observation of that day by the Gentile believers, yea, or nay, seeing that there is neither command nor bind∣ing example for it, throughout the Scriptures; if there be, any I do desire that you would shew it in your next; and by what authority, whether from men, or from Heaven, the first day of the week is now kept by you, as your Sabbath; for really many are doubtful in this case, and you would do very well, if you have a command from God, or example from his Servants in former Ages, to discover so much unto the people; And as for your calling it the Lords-day, it is certain every day is his, and not one day more then another; and as for Shops opening, and such things as you mention, though every one that do such things, may not be justified in the doing of it, yet such a thing in it self may be justified, if the Spirit of the Lord moves unto it, and who shall limit the Lord? And why may not others labour in their ordinary callings that day, as well as you in your ordinary callings? I mean, your ordinary calling of preach∣ing; that is an ordinary calling, it is certain, because you deny any extrordi∣nary calling in these days, and so I only query this, why others may not follow their ordinary callings as well as you? for it hath been affirmed very lately by some, that preaching was a trade and a function for men to get a living by, and we do not question but there are many now in this Nation, called Ministers, that do preach for that end, and would cease to preach, if Mony and Tithes were ceased to be given them: I speak this of some, not of all, which doth demonstrate, that the way of your preaching, is an ordinary calling; which you labour in, on your Sabbath-day. Your sixth Evidence, is the pouring out by many, of a Sects, with a full mouth, all manner of obloquy and contempt upon Ministry, and Ministers of the Gospel, openly interrupting them in the exercise of their Duty, whereby they are discouraged in their Work, while they are represented under the notion of Baals Priests, Gehazaes, Pulpit∣ed Divines, distributers of Sundayes Doles, Simonions, Decimating Clergy, com∣mon Incendiaries, &c. Answ. It is certain, that the true Ministry, and Ministers of the Gospel were in all Ages, and now are contemned and despised, and all manner of evil spoken against them for the Name of Christ: but whether you are those true Ministers of the Gospel, and your Ministry the true Ministry sent of Christ, this is doubtful to many; and by many particulars which might be instanced, the contrary doth appear: The Ministers of Christ in the dayes of the Apostles, they never com∣plained of being interrupted; for they were haled before Rulers, and com∣manded to preach no more in that Name, and yet they were not discouraged thereby in their work; nor when they were called Movers of Sedition, and Deceivers, and such reproachfull names, they regarded not these things: but as for you, you seem to be troubled that any should speak to you, or ask you
Question, or exhort you to repent, if any out of good Conscience query with you, concerning your Practice and Doctrine, and if any exhort to Good, and cry against Evil amongst you, this you call interrupting of you in your Mi∣nisterial Duty, and to Prison, Houses of Correction, and to Whips and Stocks must such go, which was never the Apostles Practice, never was any sent to Prison for opposing of them. And what if the Ministers of England be called Hirelings, and false Prophets, and greedy dumb Dogs? the practice of some of them doth prove it that they are so; these things you must bear, as coming deserved∣ly, and not unjustly upon you; for the Servants of the Lord in all Ages ever cried against Deceivers and false Prophets, and called them Deceivers, and gree∣dy dumb Dogs, and Serpents, and Vipers, and Evil Beasts, and Slow-Bellies; these names and tearms did Christ, the Apostles and Prophets use unto such, as are some of the Ministry of this Nation, and not with Revilings and Reproachings, but with the Spirit of Authority from God, that reproves the Wickedness of Prophets, Teachers and People: And tell me, Have not some of you sued men at Law, and cast them into Prison in this City, because they would not give you Money, and Tythes and Hire, though such as have not heard you, nor receiv'd you as Ministers, nor received any thing from you, and such as you did never any Work for, have you sought Wages from, and caused them to be impri∣soned that would not give you? And tell me in good earnest, Can any less be said of such, who thus walk, but that they are insatiable Hirelings, and as bad as Beal's Priests, and even Cheaters, and greedy dumb Dogs? let the Witness in your own Consciences answer, and you shall have a Reply. Now I come to your third Particular, which are other Causes and Symptoms of God's Wrath hanging over your heads; the frequent disappointment from time to time of all Hopes of coming to any settlement in Government in the Nation, occasioned by strange Confusions, which is a clear Evidence that God hath in Displeasure darkened our Eyes, and hid Counsel from us (say you.) Answ. It is very true, that from time to time of late dayes the Lord hath disappointed the purposes of men, even concerning settling of Government, and there have been almost strange Confusions in Changes; But to what can this be attributed? Have not your sins been as great a Cause of it, as any others? And have not you and your Generation been the Counsellors in all these Matters? Were not some of you, or your Brethren, in Oliver's dayes, and in Richard's dayes, and in the Army's dayes, and in the Parliaments dayes, and are not you and your Brethren busie at this day in ordering a Settlement in Government in this Nation? But the Lord hath hitherto disappointed you, and them that you have counselled, and he hath broken you into Confusion and Distraction, and turned back even the proceedings of Rulers and Teach∣ers; and the spirit of deep Sleep and of Slumber is poured upon you all, and the Vision of these things is as a sealed Book unto you, even because of God's dis∣pleasure against you. And in that you say, Your Eyes are darkened, and Counsel is hid from you: In that you say true, though to your own shame, And what trust can be put in such Watchmen? What Confidence can be placed by your people in you, whenas you acknowledge, that your Eyes are darkened, and Counsel is hid from you? The Scriptures mentioned by you do prove there was darkness upon the Land; but Isaiah doth not say, nor David, that Coun∣sel was hid from them, or that their Eyes were darkened, neither did ever the Apostles say so; but witnessed, That the Lord was their Light, and in him their Eyes were opened, and Counsel was revealed to them. Secondly, you say, This sadly presages of Unchurching the Nation, or the De∣parting of the Glory of God from you. Answ. By Unchurching the Nation I suppose you mean, making the Church no Church; which if this can be done, then the Gates of Hell may prevail against the Church, contrary to the words of Christ, who said, The Gates of H should not prevail: But I must tell you, The Nation of England, as to the
general part of it, hath been long, and yet is unchurched, that is, ungather∣ed by the Eternal Spirit, into the true Fellowship in the Body of Christ; for the Night of Apostacy and Darkness hath been over the World since the Apo∣stles dayes, and over this Nation in particular, and your Churches have been no true Churches, nor the people under your Ministry truly joyned and united in true Church-Order, and under true Church-Government; though I do not say but that there are Thousands of sincere People, that love the Lord, yet re∣maining among you: And the Day of the Lord is appearing, which will con∣found the Whore, the false Church, which hath been set up in this Nation, and through the World; and Assemblies, which have had the Name of the Churches of Christ, will be found to be otherwise in the Judgment of the Lord; and all the false Ordinances, Practices and Ministers must be thrown down, that the Glory of the Lord may again appear. Further, You seem to charge your selves, With leaving your first Love and for∣mer Zeal for the Truth and worship of God, but the present Coldness and Indifferency in the things of God, together with your Barrenness and unanswerable walking to the Gospel of Christ, &c. (say you.) Answ. Though to your own shame, yet do I believe this is truly acknowledg∣ed, that you have lost your first Love and Zeal which once was in you, in the dayes when you were persecuted under the Bishops, you were full of Love and Zeal for the Truth and Worship of God, according as it was made manifest; and then you were sufferers your selves, but now you are Causers of others to suffer; and there is indeed much Coldness, and Dryness and Barrenness amongst you, and your People; I do truly desire you may repent you thereof, that if so be the Lord may heal you: and your Walking indeed is Unanswerable to the Gospel of Christ (to wit) Your taking of Tythes, and so much by the year for Preaching, and su∣ing people at the Law that will not give you Wages, though you do no Work for them; these, with many other things which you practice, is an unanswerable Walking to the Go∣spel of Christ; and seeing you have confessed your sins in some measure, Repent, and sin no more, that your Iniquities may be blotted out. Again, You complain of the prevalency of Atheism, and doting upon Error, End∣less separations, Common Ignorance, Unbelief, Prophaneness, the Prejudice against wholsom Doctrine, and all Order of Discipline in the Church, and many other Confusions are upon us, &c. (say you.) Answ. Alas! so it is; but where is the Blame? Oh you Watch-men! should not you have better preserved your Flocks? should not you have fed them with Living Food? should not you have been Examples of Righteousness and Truth unto them? and should not you have nourished them with Knowledge and Un∣derstanding? But because the Shepherds have been lazy and idle, and fed them∣selves, and not their Flocks; but the Shepherds have rul'd over their Flocks with Force and Cruelty, and their Ministry and Preaching hath been a very Burden and Oppression upon the People, and therefore it is that their Flocks are divi∣ded into many Sects and Separations, and great Confusions are in your Assem∣blies, and among you, even the sin of the people in some measure will be charged upon you their Teachers, whose Flocks are run into Errors and A∣theisms, and despise wholesome Doctrine, and are out of true Order and Church-Discipline, even in the Traditions of Men: Therefore, oh that you Ministers would consider! and that you would learn more Wisdom, and that your people would come to receive the Spirit of the Lord into their Hearts, whereby they may be led into all Truth, and into the Covenant of God, where there is no Unbelief, Ignorance, Prophaneness nor Confusion; but Peace, Love and Unity altogether; and if you and they did come into this, you might be happy, and the Judgments of the Lord would be removed.
Now I come to some Particulars, which you do promise for your selves; First, That you will use all holy Endeavours to keep Cod and his Truth among you. Secondly, That you will be more diligent in watching over your Flocks. Third∣ly, That you shall endeavour the Establishment of your Congregations against Po∣pish Delusions. To all which I Answer, You must first make clean your own hearts, and you must first Repent of your own Iniquities, before you can heal others; and you must first learn Obedience to God in your own hearts, before you can truly instruct others therein: And indeed, there is need enough for you to mourn before the Lord, and to fast, and to confess your Sins (as you say) for the Lord has been long departed from you, and his Pre∣sence from your Assemblies, and that is the Cause of Deadness and Dryness and Barrenness among the people, because God's Presence is wanting among you; and you had indeed need to be more diligent in watching over your Flocks; for you have been negligent therein, and have fed your selves, and not them; and you have sought theirs, and not them, its partly evident, and it is time for you now to amend, and to put away the Evil of your Doings: but first, before you dis∣pence the Word to others, you must feel the Word in your own Hearts, to be as a Fire and as a Hammer in you; and you must know another Foundation for Ministers than you have long stood upon, even the Lord Jesus Christ must be your Foundation; and you must cease to Preach for Hire, and to Divine for Money, and then should it be better with you, and your Flocks would have comfort in you, if you had received freely from the Lord, and ministred freely to them; but while you do it for Ends to your selves, they can have no good Hopes nor Confidence in you. And whereas you exhort your Congregations in divers Particulars: First, To take heed of false Teachers, trying their spirits, and holding fast that which is good, especially to beware of Popish Insinuations, &c. (say you.) Ans. Your Exhortation is good in it self; but you should have demonstra∣ted more plainly how false Teachers should be known, comparing their Fruits now with what they were in the dayes of old, when the Scriptures were written; and that had been a good way to have discovered false Teachers: That Mat. 16. mentioned by you, bids them beware of the Leaven of the Pharisees; and Christ said, They were such as were called of men Master, stood Praying in the Synagogues, loved uppermost Rooms at Feasts, went in long Robes; and of such Christ bids beware, and of such now the People in London are to beware, where-ever they are; for such as do these things are in the steps of the Scribes and Pharisees, which Christ cryed Wo against: and the true Prophets cryed against such in their days as preached for Hire, and that sought for their Gain from their Quar∣ter; and such you ought to cry against now, as seek for their Gain from their Quarter, except the guilt of these things in your selves stops your Mouthes from crying against them in others: and the Apostles cryed
against such as went for Gifts and Rewards, such as taught for Filthy Lucre, and such as made Merchandize of People for Gain for them∣selves; such the Apostles and Christ declared against, and such you ought to declare against: But the People of your Congregations may say, Who are such now? and, Where are they? That I leave to their Con∣sciences to judge, who they be, and where they are now, and whether there be any of them in this City now, and in the Nation, that are cal∣led of men Master, and love uppermost Rooms at Feasts, and that preach for Hire and Money, for Gifts and Rewards, seek for their Gain from their Quarter, teach for filthy Lucre and Gain; who are found in these things now, such are false Teachers, who ought to be taken heed of: I shall not now say, it is any of you; but I shall leave it to you, and to your Peoples Consciences, to whom your Exhortation is. And as I have said before, let all Popish Inventions and Popery be first cast out of this Nation, and then, if you joyn with us against it, through the Spi∣rit of the Lord we will endeavour the keeping of it out, and that it shall no more enter in amongst us into this Nation. And you say, That your Knowledge here, and all other Graces here are im∣perfect. To which I say, Then you are imperfect Saints, imperfect Ministers; But what do you mean by here? I suppose that you mean upon Earth: Now there are none of the Graces of God that are imperfect; but the Grace of God is perfect in it self, and the Spirit of God is perfect, and every Gift of God is perfect, as say the Scriptures. Now that you should say the Graces of God are imperfect, this is Error, even abomi∣nable Error, and you shew unsoundness in Judgment even in the things of God, and hath belyed the Graces and Gift of God, which in their measure are perfect. And thus I have looked over your Exhortation, and thus I have re∣turned to you again, not but that I know it is the Duty of Christ's Mi∣nisters to exhort their Flocks, and that Exhortation in it self is good; but when I find where Lyes and false Accusations are against the Qua∣kers, whom I dearly love and own, upon that account, and not other∣wise have I engaged with you; and what I have done, it is not rendring Evil for Evil; but rather to reprove your Evil, and to undeceive your Congregations, who might otherwise take all for true that you have said, if it were not reproved. Again, You exhort your Congregations, That they manifest Sincerity, not only by hatred of Error, but by a Love of the Truth, &c. Answ. Sincerity of Heart is indeed precious, especially where the Spirit of the Lord is the rule of Judgment, and doth mannage that Sin∣cerity; but where a false spirit rules in the Judgment, the Sincerity is often betrayed into a Zeal against the Truth, and against the Wayes of the Lord, rather than otherwise: and thus it was with the Iews, whose Sincerity (through their Error of Judgment) was turned into Zeal and Bitterness against Christ: And thus it is to be feared it is with many in your Congregations, who may have a Zeal without Know∣ledge,
and be short of true Discerning between what is Truth and what is Error; I speak not this of all, but of some; for its no small thing to discern between Truth and Error, especially in this day, wherein there are so many Ways and Professions of Church-Ministry and Worship, and yet all professing the Scriptures are their Rule of Faith Worship and Pra∣ctice; and seeing that all Sects do profess Proof from Scripture for what they hold forth; what Ground have the people to believe you more than others, or others more than you? for where people receive Doctrine or Religion by Report from others, without the Evidence of the Spirit of God in their own Hearts, this is not receiving of the Truth unto Eternal Life: wherefore I exhort your Congregations, That every one amongst them may wait upon the Lord, to have a feeling and discerning in their own hearts, and that each one may be led and taught o the Spirit of God, which leads into all Truth, that they may deny all false Ministers and false Worships, and may worship God in Spirit and Truth, though the ministration of his own Spirit in their Hearts and Consci∣ences, and thereby will they discern between Truth and Error, and will love the one, and hate the other. Thirdly, You exhort, That they keep themselves unspotted from the pre∣vailing Corruptions of these back-sliding Times, &c. Answ. Concerning the Times many are ignorant; but this is cer∣tain at the present Time wherein we are, is the Lord disquieting of men, and its the latter dayes of Antichist's Raign and Government, that hath been in full Power and Authority for many Generations; and Babylon, that great City, her Ruin is threatned, because of her Abo∣minations, that have been many and great; for the whole Earth hath been corrupted (as its written) and now the Call of the Lord is, That every man come out of Babylon, and deliver himself, that he may not partake of their Plagues; and happy are they that are made clean & unspotted from their Sins, that they may not be found covered with her Garments; for the Day of the Lord is come, and coming upon Babylon, and all Back-sliders from God and his Wayes: Now Babylon is that great City, which hath ruled over the Kings of the Earth; and in her hath the Blood of Souls, and of all just Men been found. Fourthly, You exhort, To endeavour a Healing of those sad Breaches and Divisions, which have been amongst you, &c. Answ. Now the sad Breaches and Divisions, which are indeed at present in this Nation, cannot be healed, but as the Cause and Ground thereof be removed, which is the Sins of Rulers, Teachers and People; and this is the Cause wherefore the Lord hath brought Distraction amongst them. Oh what Ambition and Self-seeking hath been among the Rulers! What judging for Gifts and Rewards! What neglect of Mercy and Judgment amongst them! And oh how have they oppressed the Poor, and trodden down the needy! and because hereof is the Righ∣teous God vexed: And oh what Covetousness and Greediness of Gain re the Teachers guilty of! How do they Preach for Hire, and Divine
for Money! How have they unreasonably caused men to be imprison∣ed, and their Goods to be spoiled for Wages, and Tythes and Hire! Oh, how hath Covetousness, and Idolatry and Superstition abounded amongst the Teachers in this Nation! Oh, abominable have been their Sins, their Oppressions and Self-seekings! and because of these things hath the Lord brought Distractions amongst People; and the Sins of Rulers and People cry for Vengeance from the Lord: and till these Iniquities be removed by Repentance, and forsaken, the Fruit and Effect thereof shall never cease; but Breach upon Breach will the Lord make, till the Rulers and Priests repent them of their Iniquities, God's Hand will be upon them both in Judgment: and for their sakes that divine for Money, and preach for Hire, and judge for Rewards, will the Lord make the Nation as Heaps, and as a Ploughed Field. There∣fore let all people Repent of their Iniquities, and return to the Light of Christ in their own Consciences, and become Followers of the Lamb; and this is the perfect Way of healing of all Breaches, inward∣ly and outwardly. Fifthly, You exhort, To be diligent in the Spiritual and Conscientious Per∣formances of Family-Duties, &c. Answ. Men must first be awakened and enlivened unto God, before they can act for God in Holy Duties; and as for Duties, performed in pretence unto God traditionally, and without the Teachings of the Spirit of God, is but Idolatry; and the Nation is weary of such a Re∣ligion, which they have received and held traditionally; for thereby the Soul Immortal cannot be nourished unto Eternal Life: and while you teach Duties towards God by that Rule, while you teach Praying, Singing, Repeating, Catechizing, by Tradition and Immitation, with∣out the Leadings of the Spirit of Christ in them, you do but teach Ido∣latry, as long hath been taught in the Christian Nations: the doing and performing such and such things, as Christian-Duties and Practices, and the Forcing and Compelling of doing such things upon People in the unregenerate state and unconverted nature, this Religion, and such Performances of Duties, have been of Babylon and of Antichrist, and a Cheat upon Peoples Souls, whereby many have been murdered and slain in that great City; and the Form of Godliness without the Pow∣er hath been practiced while Duties have been performed unto God, without the Teachings of the Spirit of God; and such, their Consci∣ences are blinded, and the Lord abhors their Sacrifices: And people must first come to feel the Word of God in their Hearts to regenerate them, before they can perform any acceptable thing to God; and therefore do not teach People to be Hypocrites, do not teach them such and such Performances in the corrupt Nature, without the Teachings of the Spirit of God in their own particulars; for if you do, you make them but two fold more the Children of the Devil; and such Duties, performed in that nature, shall not cover nor hide from the Wrath of the Lord, which is coming upon all Hypocrites.
Sixthly, You exhort, That they would cause their Children and Servants to submit to Catechizings, and train them up in the reverence of Godly Ministry, &c. Answ. It may be enquired into what you mean by cause them to submit; how cause them? by Force and Imposition upon their Consciences, by outward ex∣ternal personal Punishments or Threats? Is this your Meaning? Will you set up Religion by Violence? And must Children and Servants be compell'd by Re∣straint and Force? This is not the right Way to promote Religion and the Wor∣ship of God, nor to make Children and Servants truly Religious; it was the Beast, that received power from the Dragon, that caused all to worship, both Small and Great, Children and Servants; and this causing to worship was in the time of the Apostacy, when the true Church was fled into the Wilderness; and all the time ever since have Nations been caused and compelled to such and such perfor∣mances and practices of Religion and Worship, and such causing I am jealous your Meaning is, whereby you would force and compel such manner of Wor∣ship and Practices upon people. And what do you mean by Godly Ministry? Will you admit of just Tryal, according to the Scriptures, whether yours be that Godly Ministry, or no? for all sorts of Christians, Papists and Protestants, and all others, they will say, That they are in the right Way, and their Ministry is the Godly Ministry; but the fruits of many prove the contrary; and we cannot be∣lieve that yours is the Godly Ministry, except you will prove it to us, by, and ac∣cording to the Scriptures. Now it is certain, That the Ministry of the Apostles was the true Godly Mi∣nistry; and if yours agree with theirs, then we will confess, That yours is the true Godly Ministry. Therefore tell us plainly, do you agree with them in your Call, and in your Maintenance, and in your Practices, and in your Fruits and Effects, in your lives and Conversations, and in your Doctrines? Are you justly according to, and do you agree with the Apostles in all these things? shall we lay you to the Line, that you may be judged? This is but as a hint at things, whereby you might justly be tryed; for if you agree not with the Apostles, in these cases mentioned, then it is evident, that your Ministry is not the true Godly Ministry; but hereafter we may have a bet∣ter occasion to try you. And thus the principal part of your Exhortation is answered, and if you can, receive it in Love. TO all you Sixty One Teachers in London, under whose hands your Ex∣hortation passeth, this I say to you in the Fear of the Lord God, Oh ye Men! consider, and let it enter into your hearts; the Day of the Lord is at hand upon you, and an Account of your Stewardship must you give, and his Reward must you have whom you have served, and you must reap the Fruit of what you have sown: Oh look upon your Flocks, and see what a condition they are in! Oh what Pride and Vain-glory is abounding amongst them! Oh how doth Wickedness spring forth from them! Are they like unto Sheep of Christ's Fold? or, Are not they appearing outwardly Christians, when as the evil nature is uncut down in them? Oh what Wickedness abounds in this City! What Double-dealing and Dissimulation? What Lying, and Swearing, and Drunkenness? Oh, high are all the Fruits of the Flesh grown amongst your Flocks! Your Vineyards are not dressed as they ought to be, there are aboun∣dance of corrupt Trees and fruitless Branches, which cumber the Ground: Oh! it makes the Heart of the Righteous sad to walk in the Streets, and to view the Abominations that are daily brought forth by a people professing Scriptures, Church, Ministry and Christ.
Oh! it burdens the Just, and grieves the Righteous Soul to consider how high Iniquity is grown among the Sheep of your Pastures, whom ye should have fed with Knowledge, and converted unto the Fear of the Lord, had you been Messengers sent of God: the very Iews and Heathens they blaspheme against Christ, through the Abominations brought forth among Christians, that have the Name to live, but are dead: Oh! let it enter into your Hearts, and smite you, that your many years Ministry should have so little effect; for your Vineyard is like untilled Ground, unploughed and unbroken up: Oh! there is much Hard-heartedness amongst your People, and their Hearts go after Covetousness, even while they profess God with their Lips: Oh! the Righ∣teous mourn in secret to see the Prophanness, the Scornings and Reproaches that are brought forth in your City: And Oh the Idolatry that aboundeth! let it repent you that you have been so sloathful, and never more seek the Fleece, but seek the Flock that's gone astray from the Lord, who is the true Shepherd, whose Voice hath not been obeyed; and many Pastors have destroyed the Vineyard, and many Shepherds have fed themselves, and not the Flock: Oh consider! the Day of the Lord is at hand, and he will visit with his Rod: You and your Flocks pre∣pare to meet the Lord; for his Kingdom is nigh to come, which will be a terri∣ble Day to all the Workers of Iniquity. And as for this your Exhortation, I say, As for Exhortation in it self, Mini∣sters ought to exhort their Flocks; so such a thing in it self I do commend, and not oppose; but when I had read and seriously considered the Aim and Intent of your spirits in your Exhortation, I found it secretly, and in a measure open∣ly opposing, and striking at, and secretly smiting the People of the Lord, whom you have Reproached by the name of Quakers, who are dear to the Lord, and he careth for them, though you see no Beauty in them, but account them altogether vile; and in as much as you lifted up your hands against them, upon that account was it upon my spirit to return something in Answer, for the In∣formation of many, that they might be Undeceived, and not in Envy to∣wards any, but in Love to all, to both you and your People, and you have occasioned this upon your selves, though you are reproved: And not as a man of Strife or Contention have I proceeded, but as one that desireth the further Manifestation of Truth, and that no false Accusation may rest upon it, which you have secretly brought forth, with which the Lord is not well∣pleased, that you should set your selves in Opposition against his People; and if any of you shall receive a just Reproof, and repent, it may prove to you an Advantage or much Good; and be not so Proud as to say in your hearts, What at thou, weak man, that reprovest us? or, Wherefore art thou so bold thus to deal with us? but rather fall under just Reproof, for in Uprightness of Heart have I proceeded towards you, and not in mine own, but in the Will of the Father. And oh that your Flocks would also consider, among whom there are ma∣ny that are zealous in their way! Oh that their Zeal and Judgments were guided by the Spirit of the Lord, then should it be well with them! Oh that they would be meek and humble, and learn the Fear of the Lord! Oh that every one of them would consider, and turn from their Iniquities, and become Followers of Jesus Christ, then should the Glory of the Lord be revealed unto them, and Peace, and Truth and Righteousness should be unto them, and their Families, and their City; if they would come into Covenant with God, and be taught of him, and be exercised by his Law in their Hearts. then should the Countenance of the Lord be upon them, and then should they discern between Truth and Error, between the Ministers of Christ and Deceivers. Oh! there is a Pitty for many poor souls, which are zealous in their way of Re∣ligion, without Knowledge; and they think they do God good service, while yet their Consciences are not exercised by the Spirit of the Lord; but a false spirit
that rules and leads, and may hold the Truth in unrighteousness, and they know not but that they do well: Oh that such would consider, and not be hasty in any thing, to perform or profess Religion in their degenerate estate, but that they would come to know the Regeneration, and the renewing of their minds by the holy spirit, and that the Immortal Birth might be born in them, even the Birth of the Spirit, which is Heir of God: Oh that that might live and rule in them, then should they be Heirs of God, and Citizens of the New-Ierusalem! And oh ye People of London! lay it to heart, you must be born again, or else you can never enter into Gods Kingdom, you must be changed in nature, and must be crucified to this world, that you may live unto God; this must you come unto, or else you have no part nor portion in Eternal Life; and your Duties and Performances in your Forms of Religion they cannot save you, not justifie you; all your Preaching, Praying, Singing, and all your Duties whatsoever, they are all nothing, till you come to know changing and renewing inwardly, and do witness the Seed of God raised up in you, and the head of the Serpent bruised in you by the Seed of the Woman; this must you come to witness, that your Souls may live. Oh that you would consider! be not so zealous against that which you may call Heresie and Schism, for while you err in judgment, you may soon speak evil of Truth, and persecute it under the name of Error; many have wofully faln into that Snare, and brought sorrow upon themselves thereby: The wise Iews, even the chief Priests, Scribes and Pharisees, they were as confident in their Way, as you can be, and yet they erred in judgment, and would not receive Christ, but persecuted him under the very name of a Deceiver; and thus it is possible for many to do in this Age: What though you have Christ's words, and the Apostles words; yet if you have not the Spirit of Christ, that was in the Apostles, you know nothing rightly of the Scriptures, neither can you under∣stand them, nor have Salvation by them; for you must know Christ in you, your hope of glory, else you are Reprobates, and shut out of the Kingdom of God: And search the Scriptures, and see if they do not witness this: Do not they say, Christ is in you, except you be Reprobates? and do not they say, The Law of God is written in the heart, and the Spirit of God is put in the inward part? And do not they say, That Christ hath lightned every man that comes into the World with the true Light? And do not they say, that the Apostle exhorts people to hearken to the Word of God in their hearts, and to be followers of the Spirit of God that was in their hearts? And do not the Scriptures say, That it was the Light that shined in the heart, that gave the knowledge of God unto the Saints? Search the Scriptures, and see whether these things be so: and must not men be born again of the Immortal Seed? Oh con∣sider! and let not these Doctrines seem new unto you, neither reject them, though they come unto you in weak appearance, not with words of mens wisdom, but in Simplicity, and in sincerity, and in the Power of God: And search the Scrip∣tures whether these things be so; were not they false Prophets, That preached for hire, and divined for money, and sought for their gain from their Quarter? were not such Deceivers in the true Prophets time, and them that preached for filthy lucre, and for money, and for gifts and rewards? were not such false Brethren, and false Apostles? search the Scriptures whether these things be so; for the day of trial is now come, wherein all must be searched, and that Religion, and Wor∣ship, and Ministry, which is not according to the Scriptures, which was given forth by the Spirit of God, let that Religion, Worship, Church, and Ministry be utterly condemned of the Lord, and all his People; and let such Ministers as cannot prove their Call, their Maintenances and Practices, to be according to Scriptures, let such Ministers be confounded, and silenced for ever; and come to try this matter when you will. For whereas you cry out against us, as if we were Deniers of Scriptures, as if we were Enemies to Church, and godly Mi∣nistry, and Religion, and as if we were Deceivers, Hereticks, Papists, &c. But I say unto you, these things have you never yet justly proved against us, but rather accused us behind our backs, to make us odious among people; and
though for divers years together we have been publick, yet when did ever any of you Ministers seek by lawfull means to convert us, or shew us our Errors, if we were as you say of us; oh, it had been your time to have sought our con∣version! and not to have Persecuted, to have sent to Prisons, Houses of Cor∣rection, and by such Weapons of any outward force and cruelty have you dealt with us, and not in meekness, and by the Spirit of the Lord, as Ministers of Christ ought to do; but have cried to the Magistrates to defend you and your your Church, and Worship, being unable, as it were, by the Authority of God's Spirit to defend your selves: Therefore I say unto you now, lay down your Carnal Weapons, and come out in the Spirit of Meekness, and come out in the Au∣thority of God's Spirit; if you have it, convince us thereby; if we be in an evil way, as you say, let us hear your soundest Arguments by the Spirit of God, and according to the Scriptures, to prove those things which you say of us; prove it by evident Arguments, that we deny Scriptures, and that we are Here∣ticks, and that we are Papists: I challenge you all in the Name of the Lord, even all you Ministers of London, let us hear your sound Reasons openly in the spirit of Meekness; and do not back-bite nor slander in the dark; and let us not be bawled against by your rude Members, as often we have been, even in the spirit of wickedness: but come out you Ministers, we are willing to be tried accord∣ing to the Scriptures, and by the Spirit of God in our Religion, and in every part of it; and if you be the same, then come forth in the spirit of Meekness, like Ministers of Christ, and lay down your Carnal Weapons, and let us have fair dealing openly, that Truth may be manifested publickly, and Error may be discovered; and let us not envy one anothers persons, and seek to destroy one anothers lives; but let us seek to destroy the evil in one another, that men might be saved; and this would be a Christian-like way; we would hear what you have to charge against our Religion, by sound Arguments in Meekness, that we may answer it, and then we will charge something upon your Ministry, Church, Religion and Worship, and we will prove what we say against you, according to the Scriptures; and we will not impose our Religion upon you, by the force of outward Powers, and outward Laws, neither would we have you force your Re∣ligion, Ministry and Church upon us, by such means, but we will leave the effect of all thing to the Spirit of God; and come out when you will in such a way as this, and this would satisfie thousands; and let Meekness, and the Fear of God be amongst you, and this is the way to exalt Religion: and we would think it a happiness, more then otherwise, to be joyned in sober debate and dispute against you, that you and we, in your Religion, Church, and Ministry, and in ours also, might be tried according to the Scriptures, that all may be satisfied who are doubtful, and may hear you Principles and our Principles discussed, in the pre∣sence of the People, who may judge by the Light and Witness in their own Consciences, for to that in all we do appeal; and in such a proceeding, come forth when you will; lay down your Carnal Weapons, and take the Weapons of of the Spirit, and come to the trial, for the Day of the Lord is approaching upon all the World.

The FOURTH General Epistle To all the SAINTS: Being a Visitation of the Fathers Love, unto the whole Flock of Cod, who are called and gathered into the spiritual Kingdom of Righteousness and Peace: To be read in all the Assemblies of them, that meet together to worship the Father in the Spirit and Truth, in the silence of all Flesh. Dearly Beloved, WHom the Father hath called and chosen into the Election of Eter∣nal Salvation, and who have handled, and tasted, and felt of the Judgments and Mercies of the Lord; and amongst whom the God of Heaven and Earth hath appeared in his Spirit, and in his Power, which  gotten you into the Heirship of the heavenly Kingdom. Oh Friends! our Kingdom and Victory is not of this World, nor earthly, but from above, and spiritual; wherein we have Peace and Comfort, endless and everlasting, which the World knows not of; I say unto you all that know these things, Live in the Peace, and Victory, and Kingdom which is invisible, and mind the things, as your greatest Treasure, that pertain to that Kingdom, even the weighty matters of it, which a eternal and infinite; and that every one of you may feel and enjoy a Portion in that Kingdom: Oh! it is precious for a people to be Subjects of the heavenly Kingdom, and for a man to have an as∣surance of Life and Peace in God, and to be an Heir of that Kingdom that fa∣deth not away, and to have his name written in the Record of Life; and blessed is every one whose Hope and Confidence, and Peace and Assurance is in the living God, and whose Soul resteth under the Government of the Almighty, and who knows him to be Judge, King, and Lawgiver in all things; and this is the Kingdom that is heavenly, and is altogether blessed; for Peace, and Truth, and Righteousness, and all Vertue is enjoyed in it for evermore. Now Friends, you must all be subjected in all things under the Power of the Lord God, and unto his will, and he must work in you to will and to do; for in this is true Rest and Peace unto the Soul, where the Will of the Father is done and suffered in all things, and not the Will of man, which worketh sor∣row to the Creature, and not peace, in the obedience to it, and where it rules; and that must be subjected in you, even in every Word, Work, and Mo∣tion, unto the eternal Power, that you may die, and Christ may live; and in this you will have union and fellowship in spirit with the Lord God, and he alone will be your trust and confidence, and your glory, if he live in you, and walk in you, and then you are his People, and he is your God. And Friends are to mind this, even Peace, and Union, and Fellowship with the Lord, and the comfort of his Presence, which is the onely happiness of the Creature, even the enjoyment of him that is invisible, who is God infinite over all, to whom mortal eye cannot approach, neither can the mortal mind him apprehend, but in his own Life manifested in mortal Flesh, and by the mea∣sure
of his own Spirit that dwells in us is he seen, felt, preceived, and enjoy∣ed of us; so mind the Immortal Life begotten of the Father in you, that that may live in you, even the Heir of God, which is his Image and likeness, for in that alone is Covenant with God made and kept, and in it is the Fathers pre∣sence enjoyed, and he Worshipped without respect of time, place, or visible thing; and if that live in you, then yo in that will live unto God, in all that which is answerable unto him; and your words and works will be accepted of him, and well-pleasing to him, even because it is him that worketh in you to will and to do all good things, and he alone exalted in you, and you subject∣ed, and the Maker is become the Husband, and you married unto him; and he lives in Power, and Rule, and Command, and you liv In subjecti unto him, and in fulfilling his Will in what he guideth in, by his Holy Spiri; And this life is very precious. Oh Friends! live in it, and dwell in it always, and then your Joy and Peace will be with you over all this World, and you will be Comforted, whe Fear and Terrour comes upon all men; for the Lord God whom we serve nd wor∣ship in the Spirit, will cause his Enemies to know his Power; and that he doth and can do whatsoever he will, and will smite his Enemies, and wound them in their Consciences; for all Power, Dominion, and Authority is with him, he is mighty to save, and mighty to destroy, and his Reward is to every one ac∣cording to their deeds; and this is the God whom we fear and worship, and all Flesh must bow before him, when he shews his presence; though men  high and lifted up, and go on in Rebellion against him without fear, yet th hand of the Lord will be upon the, and he shall smite them with the od of his mouth: Wherefore all Friends, have respect unto the Lord in your  in all things that you do, and in all things that cometh to pass, for that is ed in a people; and they shall prosper, their Souls shall be nourished, and their lives refreshed with the Mercies of the Lord, even all they that do wai up∣on the Lord, and have respect unto him and his Eternal Power, which doth and suffereth all things that be; In which Power you must dwell and walk, and feel it in your hearts, and it will be your Armour and Defence in all things, and it will carry you through all that which worketh contrary. And it is very pretious to be Armed with the Armour of God, in the Day of Temptations and Tryals, that you may not be overcome of the wicked, nor spoiled of the Heavenly Inheritance. Oh Frinds! put on strength, that you may stand, and never be moved from the hope of Eternal Life, and feel the renewing of your inward man, even the increase and growth of the Immortal Life in you, that you may live in that unto the Lord God, and Covenant with him may be preserved, whereby, you may be a praise and a glory to him in your Ge∣neration in the sight of the whole World, even all you who have tasted of the Pre∣sence and Power of the Lord, and who have known his Mercies and Judgements, and been acquainted with him, that you may be kept faithful unto the end, and not be subverted by the wicked one, nor drawn from the Obedience to the Truth, nor loose your Crown of Immortality, neither by the flattery nor terrour of the ungodly, but that you live in the Dominion of Immortal Life, which keeps above all Mortal Temptations and Mortal Terrour, and gives Au∣thority over all: And this Life is blessed, where the Glory and Peace of this World, and the Troubles and Sorrows of it also, are seen over, and felt beyond, and nothing of it can move the Heart, nor disquiet the Spirit, nor work any Se∣paration from the Fathers Love; and in the Seed of God, where it lives above mortal, is this enioyed by us and all the Faithful: But if the mans part live above the Seed of God, that, will be drawn aside by the love or by the terrour of this World, for that is changable, and the evil one hath a part in it; so that part is to be kept in subjection in you, under the Seed of God, & it must bear the Cros of Christ always, else you will be overcome of the wicked; for in that part (the m part) which is of this World, the Devil hath somthing, a place to receive im, & pt
to obey him; but in the Seed of God he hath nothing, neither place nor part: And so Friends live in the Seed of God, for in that is your Victory and hea∣venly Dominion, and also your Election and Assurance for ever, even in the second Birth, begotten of the Father; for that is the Heir of God, and there∣i doth man inherit Eternal Life, and Rest and Peace to his Soul, and therein is Blegs and Peace, and Life inwardly and outwardly, and all fulness is en∣joyed; where the Lord is the Teacher, the Father, the Shepherd, the Master the King and Judge; and is become to us the all in all, and the Kingdom deli∣ve  him, and all subjected under him, even God with us, the Substance of   d of all, and all the contrary put under, even the Lion and the Lamb   together, and man lives in Peace, according to the Promise; and the Mountain of the Lords House is established on the top of all, in which no∣thing can destroy or hurt the pure Life; but Life is in Dominion over all, and  is swallowed up of it. Oh Friends! this is the mark that is before you, press on towards it, that you may obtain the final end of all your Travel and Waiting, of your Obedi∣ce and Suffering, and the end of your Hope and Patience, and the very end of the Messge sent of God, and delivered to you by us: The end of all is this, Th you may dwell in God, and he in you, and be gathered up to him, to be ever with ; and that he may be your all in all, and you may be to him an honour and praise ghout the World in your Generation; even he your onely God, and you his onely . Friends, certain it is, that the Way of Life, and Peace, and of Salvation is mde manifest unto you, and you know wherein everlasting Peace and Re∣conciliation with God standeth; and you also know, what the cause is of all trole, and sorrow, and condemnation; the Lord hath opened many Hearts, and given unto many a good Understanding: And seeing you know this, live in the Way of Peace, and escape the other, that you may not come into con∣demnation; for it is a fearfull thing to fall into the Condemnation and Wrath of the Almighty. And for this cause, That men should be saved from Wrath, and have Peac with God, the Message of Life and Salvation hath the Lord sent abroad plentifully in this Nation, and you have received it, and believed the Re∣port, though many have rejected it to their Destruction, whose Judgment will be upon them; but you have tasted, handled, and flt of the Word of eternal Life, by which the Lord hath wounded you, and healed you again; and many hath he slain, and made them alive, even through his Word and Power, which hath entred into many hearts, which killeth the Enmity, and quicken∣th the Seed, and which breaketh off from all the World's followship, both in Transgressions, and Righteousness, and makes all void, all Covenants with Death and Hell, and marrieth unto the Lamb; and the Marriage of the Lamb is cme unto many, even unto all in whom his innocent and heavenly Na∣re is begotten and brought forth; for this is of his Flesh, and of his Bone;  here is his Wife that hath made her self ready, and is prepared for the Bridegroom; and blessed are ye, if ye know thes things, and are Witnesses of th, even the Marriage of the Lamb, and the making ready of his Elected in you,  the receiving and quickening of his Flesh, and of his Bone; for this is the  unto whom he is joyned, that hath put away all other Lovers, and loveth the Lord with all the Heart, and with all the Soul, who is clothed with perfect Beaty and Innocency, and covered with divine Righteousness, in which there is no Spot, being delivered out of the Wilderness, and freed from her mourn∣g state, and is no more separated from her Husband; but she again quick∣t into Life, and adorned with Beauty, and married to the Lamb, to live with him or evermore. Oh Friends! wait upon the Lord, that ye may possess these things; for to kow th, and be in them, is everlasting Treasure and Riches; the Possession of them are Riches to the Poor, Bread to the Hungry, and Clothing to the
Naked, and Life to the Dead: And if ye know these things, lay them up in your hearts, as your most precious Treasure, and let none spoil you of it; And if ye are married unto the Lamb, then are you the True and onely Church, even his Body and living Members of it; for such onely are the True Church, that are married to Christ, and United to him in his own nature; and all such are false Churches, and are even of the great Whore, that hath taken upon them the name of Churches of Christ, but were never lawfully married unto him, and such are deceived, and Deceivers of others with the very Name of Christ, calling themselves by the Name of his Church, while they are in the nature con∣trary to him, nor they ever lawfully married unto him; and this is the great Whore who commits lewdness though Nations, in all false worships and Idola∣trous Practices and Ordinances, and in her false Ministry, and false Doctrines; and she was set up in Nations, by the force of cruel and violent Laws, and men, and is upheld by Oppression and Injustice at this day; and yet all this she doth under the Name of Holy Church, and useth the Name of Christ, as if she were his Wife, and yet hath other Lovers; and by such means hath this great Whore deceived the World: But now the Day of the Lord is come upon her, and the hour of her Judgement is at hand, and all that have taken pleae with her, shall mourn and bitterly lament, because of her Judgements which cometh in a day; but we are delivered from her Judgements, because the Lord hath called us from her abominations; and we can no more drink her Cup of false Do∣ctrines and Practices, all which are Idolatry, and to be Judged of the Lord, though she should drink our Blood, as she hath done the Saints before us; But I say, the Lord hath led us out of this Babylon, He hath delivered us from this great City, and made us Spiritually free from its abominations and Idolatries, though not outwardly free from her oppressions and cruelties: And though this great City hath Ruled over the Kings and great men of the earth, and subjected many Nations through its wickedness and violence; yet certainly its ruin is near to come, Else my Hope is lost, my Life is smitten, and the Lord hath not spoken by me: And the Lord will Reward this false woman, this false Church, that hath deceived the Nations, even according to her deeds, as she hath done to others, so shall others do to her, measure for measure; and much more might we say concerning her, but the Lord hath opened our eyes, and we see her abominations, and she cannot deceive us: And this is the loving kindness of the Lord unto us, for which he is worthy to be praised by us, for evermore. And in that ye have received the Truth, and do know the Truth, live in it, and walk in it in all faithfulness; and be not fearful and unbelieving, as though the Lord were not with you, though ye suffer much for his Names sake; for he is not wanting unto that man that doth fear his Name, and that walks in his Way; but for the deliverance of all such will he appear, he will free the oppressed, and the afflicted people he will save, even by his out-stretched Arm: Wherefore let our eye be unto the Lord in all estates and conditions, whether of sufferings or otherwise, for from him Sal∣vation cometh, and not from the Mountains of the Earth; and keep your Mea∣tings in your several places, and be faithful in all things, that your Consci∣ences may be kept void of offences, both towards God and men, that no diso∣bedience nor load of iniquity may be upon you, but that in the sight of God, you may feel clearness and freedom of Soul and Spirit, from the burden of all transgression, that you may know the Remission of all sin, and all iniquity may be blotted out, and no guilt of transgression may lie upon you, but you may enjoy Peace in your Consciences, in the Sanctification and Justification of the new man; and this is the heavenly Life, even upon Earth: And when you are met together in the Name and Power of the Lord, mind his presence amongst you, for that is life, and will make your Meetings profitable and full of Vertue to your Souls, and the Lord will instruct you in all that which is good, and Christ will be your Minister of Peace and Comfort, and his Spirit will ld
you into all Truth, and by his Word, even the speech of God in your hearts, you will be quickned in Spirit, and your strength and Peace in God will be renewed day by day; and walk in all Wisdom, and in the fear of the Lord one towards another, and towards all people, that your Righteous and innocent life, and your Holy Wayes and Works of Truth, may have Evidence in the hearts of your Enemies, that you are of God, by the shining forth of your light be∣fore them; and that the Devil, nor all your Enemies may have ought against you, saving concerning your God, and the Worship of him, and the matters per∣taining to good Conscience; and then if any suffer afflictions and tribulation by wicked men, if it be for Righteousness sake, and concerning the Law of your God, and the matters of his Kingdom; in such suffering the Lord will be with you, and not forsake you, but he will give you Dominion, and carry you through it all in Patience and Faith, which gives you Victory over all Enemies; And no∣thing shall come to you, nor happen on you in the anger of God, but all afflicti∣ons shall be turned to your Comfort, and by Persecutions and Tribulations the Lord will but try you, and not destroy you, you being delivered from his wrath, and from that which is the Cause of it: And therefore Friends, it being much upon my Spirit, I do lay it upon you, to be mindful in this very thing, that you walk in all Wisdom, so that your Enemies have nothing against you, to cause you to suffer for, but onely for Truth, and Righteousness sake, and concerning the Law and Worship of your God; and then if the wicked one take occasion against you, to inflict his wrath upon you by wicked men, because of the exercises of your Consciences towards God, thereby shall the Lord take oc∣casion against your Enemies, to destroy them in his season, and he will deliver you; and for this Cause doth the Lord plead with the wicked in his wrath, even because of the unjust sufferings of his People, for that alwayes drew down the wrath of the Lord upon Nations, and Rulers; and for this Cause hath many been destroyed; and in our sufferings must be filled up the measure of the iniqui∣ties, both of Rulers and people in this Nation, that the Lord may over-turn them with his hand, when their measure of oppression is finished, and the bur∣den of its guilt falls upon them. Therefore let us have Patience towards all men in all Conditions, and Faith towards God at all times, for therein is our Armour of Defence, and our Wea∣pons to resist all our Enemies, and giving up into the Eternal Will of the Father, whether in Life or Death, in Tribulations or in Rejoycing, and giving our Power wholly to the Lord, and nor unto any other, knowing, That not one Hair of our Head can fall without him, whose Power is over all, and through ll: So that if we Live, it may be unto him alone; and if we suffer, and dye, it may be for him, and herein Peace shall be with us, in whatsoever cometh to pass upon us, if we can receive all things as from the hand of the Lord; and Live in the feeling of that Power, which doth all things, or suffereth all things to be done. And blessed is he that is not offended in Christ, who cannot be offended in him, nor separated from him by Principalities, nor Powers of Darkness, nor Death, nor Life of any thing: And in this growth was the Apostle, which the same is to be waited for, blessed is he that obtaines it; for that which takes of∣fence against Christ, is of the same with that which gives it; for all offences a∣gainst him, ariseth from the corrupted nature which knows him not, and that which receiveth any offence against him, is the same which knows him not; Yea, though an offence may be justly given, yet that in which the offence takes place, knows not the Father not the Son: And Christ said offences should come, but woe unto him by whom they come, and woe unto that which stumbles and flls through offences. Therefore every one is to minde, the certain evidence of the Spirit of God, and of the Truth and Way of Salvation in his own heart, and being perswaded concerning the Way of Salvation, by the Spirit of God, at Spirit will judge every offence that is given, and not embrace it;
and that Spirit which judges and casts out, that which gave offence against God, in that Spirit may a man be preserved above all offences, so as nothing can se∣parate him from the love of God; but though this offence, or the other, what∣soever may arise, yet such a one feels and possesses the Mercy, Love and Peace from God in his own spirit, and such a one lives in the heavenly Life, and cannot make the evil example of another an occasion of iniquity to himself, but he rather hears and fears, and keeps in more diligence and respect to the fear and presence of God in his own heart, yet he covers not the offence that is gi∣ven in it self, but with a Spirit of judgment treads it down, and walks over it; and this is the right Way for a man of God to walk in; and that Spirit is not right before the Lord, nor that heart which takes unto it self an occasion to stumble at, or deny the Power and Mercy of the Lord, because another may abuse them: But if one be from the Spirit of God in their own hearts, their mind unsetled upon that, and unseasoned with that, then the offences enter, and works darkness and prejudice in the mind, and the wrong part being up, it receives all things to a wrong end, and it abuses Gods Mercies, and also wants the Authority to pass Judgment upon offences, and because hereof is a man undone; for prejudice will eat out the good, and destroy Simplicity, and wound the Soul, and bring men into Death and bitterness of spirit: Therefore this is to all Friends, that you may be kept in the Spirit of Judgment, which will not receive an offence into the wrong part, but will Judge all offences in themselves, and hereby all will be preserved, and Truth must travel through all his enemies, and blessed is he that is kept faithful to the end, in the Power of the Lord God, that Reigns over, and Judgeth the Power of Darkness in every ap∣pearance of it, Inwardly and Outwardly. And as concerning the times and seasons, and the present Confusions and Distractions that is amongst men, much might be spoken; but certainly the end of all these things, shall be turned for good unto us, and unto all that do abide in Faith and Patience unto the end; and though the present times be of an hea∣vy countenance towards us, like as if we should be swallowed up through the roaring of the Sea, and because wickedness doth abound by the spirit that now is exalted; yet in this let us respect the Lord, for certain it is, that Times and Seasons are in his Hand, to change them at his pleasure, and to take them from one, and give them to another when he will; the day is his, and the Victory is in his Hand: Oh! let not mortal men glory against him, mans time is but for a moment, and it is our Blessedness and Peace to be still, to be still; And to have a Respect to the Lord through all these overturnings; And though the spirit that now is, be wicked and abounding in iniquity, yet the Lord will limit its way: And as for the men that now are in Power, it is very Just with the Lord, to let them have their Day, even to try them what they will do, ma∣ny others before those have had also their Day, that have promised great things, as to Liberty and Freedom of the Nation, even much more than these; but they abused times and seasons, and opportunities, and were deceitful towards God and Man, and sought themselves more than the good of others, and there∣fore are they justly under reproach and sufferings, even for their disobedience sake, who would not give ear to the Cry of our oppressions, though they were called unto, but made our Yoaks more heavy, and our Tasks more great, though the Lord looked for better things from them, yet they were rebellious till they were sunk into Confusion; and we yet stand, and they are fallen, that thought to destroy us. And this spirit, and these men who now are, which once the other had power over, is now justly set in Power over them: And all this is accomplished, in the Justice of the Lord's Hand, and therefore, Why should we murmur against God? or say, Why hast thou done it? But let us travel in Patience through all the Oppressions, and in the Power of the Lord, we shall work through them, as through others heretofore, even till the Lord deliver us: For this Spirit that now is, must Rule, until the pleasure of the Lord
be fulfilled concerning it; May not the Lord do something through it, unworthy of a better spirit to be imployed in? God hath vessels of dishonour; And the King of Assyria and Nebuchadnezzar must serve his pleasure, when he will use them: And therefore no man at present is found able to divert the Authority of it; for it seems right unto the Lord, that it have its season, if not in love to it, yet in his wrath, that its measure of wickedness may be filled up in this oc∣casion given unto it, that the Lord may destroy it; for though it have all Power to Rule, and to subdue that which riseth against it; yet this is not, because the Lord is on its side, but thus he suffers it, for a Rod to correct others, that have been unfaithful, even till the Lord correct it also with his Judgements. And the purpose of the Lord is to prove the men, if so be some of them may learn Righteousness and be saved, though some of them want the shew of Religion, which others have had; yet God hath not left himself without witness in them: And the Lord may be nigh to some of them, if he smite, they must be wounded; let us walk in Wisdom and Innocency towards them, and be faithful towards the Lord concerning them, and leave them to him. And as for all the confusions, and distractions, and rumors of Wars, what are they to us? What have we to do with them? and wherein are we concerned in these things? is not our Kingdom of another World, Even that of peace and righteousness? and hath not the Lord called us, and chosen us into the possessi∣on of that Inheritance, wherein strife, and enmity dwelleth not? Yea, he hath broken down that part in us that is related thereunto, and being dead in that Nature of Strife, Bloodshed, and Wars, how can we live in strife and contention in the World, or have fellowship with any therein? And can we have pleasure in the confusion and distraction amongst men, or joyn in any thing with them, if so be we are quickened in the new life to God, which is a life of love and peace, and free from such things? and if we are crucified in the life to this World, out of which all these confusions and strife doth arise, how can we live therein? and therefore these things are nothing to us, neither are we of one party, or against another, to oppose any by rebellion, or plottings against them, in enmity, and striving with them by Carnal Weapons: nor to destroy any mens lives, though our Enemies: so we War not for any, nor against any, for the matters of this Worlds Kingdom. But our Kingdom is inward, and our Weapons are spiritual, and our victo∣ry and peace, is not of this World: And our War is against souls enemies, and against the powers of darkness, even by the Sword of the Spirit, which God hath given us, and called us to war therewith, to convert people from sin and death, and from the very occasion of wars and contentions about the things that are earthly; and this is our calling and work at this day; and these things all the Children of the Lord are to mind, and to keep over the spirit of this World in all people, which all this enmity, strife, and confusion that is up amongst men, lodgeth in, and out of it ariseth; for these things are the fruits of the spirit of this evil and sinful World, and the fruits of the Spirit of God are of another nature, even Peace and meekness towards all, and not enmity towards any, in which Spirit let us live and walk, admonishing all hereunto, and Pray∣ing for our enemies, and not hating them, but doing good for evil, and not rendring evil for evil; but being meek and humble, merciful and patient to∣wards all: and this is the true Christian life learned of Christ, and this life is blessed in this World, and in the World to come; and them that live here are redeemed out of the World, wherein is Troubles and Confusion, Wars and Strifes: But let us not heed any of these things, for they Rise and Fall in their season, and are brought forth & effected in the changable and erring spirit, which worketh not the honour of God, but is in the dishonour to him; And Friends, let us be a people separate from all that live therein, waiting for the deliverance of the holy seed, in all: and believing, that through all these things the Lord will set up his Kingdom; and thus it must come to pass, BABYLON MUST
FALL WITH A GREAT NOISE; for in strife and confusion was She builded, and therein hath She long stood, and thereby must She fall; and Tribulations must come upon the Earth, that People may learn to fear the Lord through his Judgements: And he will speedily do great things in the World, which cannot be believed by many, if it were told them; for Hell and Death must be destroyed, and both the Beast and the Whore must be taken alive, and cast into the Lake of the anger of God: But blessed are they that do wait upon the Lord, and rest under his shadow, and wait in his Counsel, and re∣ceive his Instructions; they shall see the marvellous works of his hand; but the wicked and unbelieving shall be turned into darkness, and shall not see the countenance of the Lord to refresh them, but their sorrow shall be in∣creased. And as for me, If I were no more, this is the Testimony of my Love unto the Seed of God, through these Nations, who am a Companion to all that travel after Truth and Righteousness, and that seek the Lord in their hearts that he may Rule; and these things were upon me, to send amongst the Flock of God, to be read in all your Meetings.

A VISITATION AND Presentation of Love Unto the KING, and those call'd ROYALLISTS: Consisting of I. An Answer to several Queries proposed to the People (called Quakers) from a (supposed) Royallist. II. An Objection answered, concerning the Kings Supremacy. III. An Epistle directed to the King, and those that go under the Name of Royallists. IV. Certain Queries returned to them (called Royallists) to answer. An Answer to divers Queries subscribed thus, To the Quakers some Queries is sent to be answered, that all People may know your Spirit, and the temper of it, and your Iudgment concerning the Times and Seasons; and sub∣scribed, let your Answer be directed, Tradite hanc Amico Regis. AS concerning the Quakers, that are scornfully so called, We are at this day, and have been ever since we were a People, a poor de∣spised and contemptible People, in the eye of this World, and deep Sufferers under the Injustice, and Cruelties, and Oppressions both of Rulers Teachers and People, and we have been a prey to the Wicked, and trodden down under the feet of Ambitious men, that have been in power in this Nation, and have Ruled in force and cruelty over us, and this hath been ever since the Lord raised us up to be a People, though we have not been offensive to any just Law, or Government, or to any sort of People, otherwise then that we have given our Witness against Sin and wickedness in all People; but we have not been Oppressors of others, neither have we envied the persons of any, but in all good Conscience have we walked towards all men, doing no otherwise to any, then we would be done unto; and this is the very Law we walk by towards all men, desiting the good of all, and that all may come to Repentance and be Saved; and what we are as unto the Lord, if I should declare, it could not be believed by many: But we are his People, and he hath chosen us, and he is our God, and we have believed in him, and walked with him in the uprightness of heart; and we have this Testimony in our own hearts, if we die it is for him, and if we live it is to him; and though we have been, and may be clouded with the Reproaches and Persecutions of an Uncircumcised Generation, yet in the Lord's Season it shall be manifest even to the World, and to our very Enemies, that we are his
People and chosen of him, and he in the midst of us, whom we serve and worship in Spirit, in Truth, and in Righteousness; and this shall be manifest in the day of the Lord, and in the mean time we are willing to bear, and to suffer all things that is put upon us, for the Name of the Lords sake. Query 1. Whether you, or any of you that pretend to Inspiration and Revelation, did foresee, or was it revealed to you, that ever Charles Stua should be proclaimed King  Reign in England, ever anymore? or whether or no any of you did believe it, or could have believed it by your great Faith which you profess, if it had been told you long ago? Answ. As for the Proclaiming of Charles Stuart King, to reign in England, it was not improbable unto our Faith, neither is it contrary to that which some of us hath seen; for we know that God respects neither persons nor names, but doth give the Kingdoms of this World to whomsoever he will; and thus much was said, as See G. Fox his Paper directed to the Parlia∣ment and Army so cal∣led. may be seen in a Book, called, Good Counsel and Advice rejected, (and divers other Papers) &c. p. 17. In a Letter to Oliver Cromwel, it is said concerning you that are commonly called Cavaliers; But what and if, for and because of thy Wicked in the sight of God, he should, raise them up, and make them Instruments in his Hand to ac∣complish his wrath upon thee, even like as he made thee once his Instrument to overthrow them, &c. And here the thing was believed to be possible, that the Lord might raise you up again for his pleasure, to fulfil his Will, because of the wickedness of the Army and Nation; and it is now come to pass, even as it was seen and be∣lieved. And also it was expressed in a Letter, written in the 10th Mon. 1659. concern∣ning them that were your Enemies, and that were at first raised against you; The very same spirit of Pride, and Oppression, and Idolatry is entred into them, (meaning your Enemies) and now lives in them in as high a measure as ever it lived amongst you; and ir Iniquities are well nigh finished, and the Lord will one way or other correct & reprove them, and they shall be dealt with in like manner, as they have dealt with you; for they were no more then a Rod in the Hands of the Lord for a season, and they must also be broken and cast into the Fire; and whether the Lord may ever may make use of you to reprove them, as he did of them to reprove you, this I determine not; but leave it to him who can do what∣soever he will, by what Instrument he pleaseth: It is true you have made many Attempts to be revenged upon them, but you have not hitherto prospered; but could you be humbled, and come into the meek Spirit of the Lord, then might you prosper, but hitherto the Lord hath alwayes defeated you, and bowed you down under a People as unworthy as others, but their time will come to an end: And submit unto the Will of the Lord in what is come to pass, and seek not vengeance to your selves, and then the Lord will avenge your Cause, for the Iniquities of your Adversaries are ripe, &c. And Charles Stuart must either be converted to God, and ruled by him, or else he can never rightly rule for God in this Nati∣on; though this I believe, it is not impossible but that he may be a Rod upon them that once smote him, and their Oppressions and Ambitions may receive a check through him, &c. These things were written in a Letter to all the people of your part, long be∣fore there was any visible appearance, of that which is now come to pass: where∣by it doth appear that these things in a great measure were foreseen and prophe∣sied of, and it was believed as a thing very possible, that thus it might be as is al∣ready come to pass: And as for Visions, they are for an appointed time, there is a time to see, and a time to speak what is seen; and revealed things belong to us, and when we declare them then you may take notice of it; but it was verily believed as a thing possible, that such a thing would be, and also by the Proceedings and Transactions as they have fallen out; for your very Enemies have so acted and proceeded as to destroy themselves, and to bring you in over their heads, though they little intended the thing, yet the effect of their proceedings could hard∣ly prove otherwise then to destroy themselves, and make room for you, and these things I observed; And also thus far we did fore-see, and it was revealed to us, and
believed by my of us fully, and we did often Prophesie it, that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth would destroy and bring down the Government, and Authority as they have stood in this Nation for divers years, and that he would bring Iudgment upon the Rulers, and up∣on many of the Teachers, and People of this Nation, because of their oppressions and unfaith∣fulness, and treachery, and hypocrisie, and wickedness, which abounded amongst them, which we have felt and seen, and been sensible of; and we have often given our witness against them, because of their guiltiness in their sinful ways; Oh it hath been loathsome unto the Lord, even the Oppressions and treacheries of the Rulers! Oh how hath Cruelty and In∣justice abounded in their Government! and their hypocrisie hath been evident in our ight in many Particulars, and even in that they have cryed against and over∣thrown King and Kingly Government, charging them with oppression and cruelty, and pretended to ease the people in a better way of Government, when as though Go∣vernors and Names, and Titles of Government, were changed and altered, yet oppression ceased not, neither was injustice forsaken, nor was the heavy yoaks of great bondage removed: but the rather these things were increased upon many good people in these Nati∣s, and herein was the unfaithfulness, and treachery of the Rulers very great in the sight of God, and their Government unjust and unequal, wherefore the Lord hath been provoked against them to confound them, and overturn them, and we have often told it them, and also the hypocrisie and deceits, and sinfulness of Teach∣ers, we have seen and testified against, and our witness to them both is and will be found true, and Gods justice will be fulfilled upon them both; and these things we have observed, even the heinous guilt of sin against God in both Rulers and Teachers, and the abo∣tions that have been committed both in Civil, and Church Government (so called) also, and many people have lov'd to have these things so, and we have been sensible how the Lord hath been provoked to overthrow the Governors of this Nation because hereof; and this we have foreseen & Prophesied of, even that Iudgment and Confusion would come upon the Government, the Rulers, and the Teachers; but particularly when and after what manner, judgment and overthrow should come upon them, was left to the Lord, who hath brought to pass his own will according to Justice, and it may prove to be a just Judgment from the Lord, upon the Unfaithful and Treacherous, and Unjust Rulers, and Teachers, and People which I have mentioned, and the Lord may justly avenge himself upon them who have abused his Mercies, and not improved his Deliverance to his glory, but preverted the end wherefore they were at first raised up; I say the Lord may justly be avenged of them by this means, of this mans coming in, and he may be in the hand of the Lord a very smiting Rod to correct and rebuke, and may be a heavy Judgment upon many in this Nation, even from that cause, and for that end as before I have expressed. Quer. 2. Whether you, or any of you, do adjudge is Reasonable and Equitable, that e should come and inherit the Nations of which he is born the right Heir? Or whether or  it is just or unjust to God and men, that he would Reign King over these Nation? If you walk and judge by the Law of God which is Equal, then judge of this whether he hath been kept out this many Years, and now is brought in again Reasonably and Iustly, or Un∣justly and contrary to Reason? Answ. That he should come in, is Reasonable and Equitable, because through the purpose of the Lord, his coming in is accomplished, who effecteth nothing but what is Equal and Reasonable, and there is cause in God sufficient where∣fore it should thus be, and there is Sufficient cause and Reason appearing to us in this matter; and upon the very account as laid down in my Answer to the first Query, it is Equal as in the Lord, that he should be restored who hath been removed and cast out by such as have pretended to Govern and Rule better than he, but have ruled in Oppression and Injustice, and not answered the cause wherefore he was cast out; and that he should come in to be a Scourge upon these, this is just, and in this particular doth lye the Reason and Equity of his coming in to inherit this Nation. And as for Reigning justly over this Nation, that may better be answered when we have had experience of his Reign, for if he
Reign and Rule in Truth and Righteousness, in Mercy and in Justice, and by and according to the Just Law of God; if thus he Reign, then he Reigneth just∣ly, and it is just to God and men that he should Reign, and this the Law of God which is Equal, judgeth, by which we walk in all things, and do judge of all things: And as for his being kept out this many years, we do judge that the hand of the Lord is in these matters, and they were done and suffered to be done by him, in which he will be glorified; yet, thus far I say, they that have kept him out, in pretence that they would Rule better than he, and yet have ruled in Oppression and Injustice, as much more (may be) then he would have done, they have dealed unjustly and contrary to reason, both to him, and much more to the People of these Nations, while they have made and had new Names and Titles of Government and Governors, but have continued the old oppres∣sions, and not releived the oppressed according to their own vows and promises, which they have broken, and it is but just they should be punished for it; but if he render not evil for evil, he doth well. Quer. 3. Whether or no ye can judge that his Reign and Government shall be blessed to himself, and these Nations, or the contrary? Or whether shall Peace or Trouble be in the Land in his days? And shall his days be many, or shall his time be short; if this be re∣vealed to you let us know? Answ. We do judge that his Reign and Government may be blessed to him∣self and these Nations, or not blessed; and peace may be in the Land, or trou∣ble in his dayes; and his time may be long, or it may be short; according as he walketh in the fear of the Lord, or as he walketh wickedly, and according as his Reign and Government is in Righteousness, Mercy, and Truth, or in Oppression and Injustice, accordingly do I judge may he be blessed, and may have Peace, and long dayes, or the contrary, if he walk in the way which brings contrary effects: and we take not upon us to judge any thing before the time, but as thorow time he discovers himself, so we may judge of him, (for we de∣sire well for him and all men) th e my so Reign and Govern as to be a bles∣sing to himself and these Nations, that Peace may be in his dayes, and his Time may be happy: And this we certainly know that there is an eternal God, who is over all, and that can do whatsoever he will, even set up and pull down whom∣soever he will, and though his strength now be great, and his number very ma∣ny, yet there is an Eternal God above all, who is mighty to save, and mighty to destroy, and if he please not God in his ways, and in his Reign, but be an Oppres∣sor, and walk in evil wayes, we certainly believe he cannot be blessed, nor have Peace, nor long time, but the Lord may bring to pass the contrary; for as the Scriptures say, it is by him that Kings Reign, & he makes Kings blessed or misera∣ble, the Scriptures gives much evidence concerning the good and the bad Kings of Israel, they that were good men and Ruled well, they were blessed and had long dayes, and people were happy under them; and to the Kings that were Idolaters and Oppressors, and walked in wickedness, and vexed the Lord, it was contrary; for the Lord cut them off, and destroyed them, and delivered the oppressed; and God is the same now as he was then, as powerful to save the Righteous, and as mighty to destroy the wicked; and we rather desire that he may follow the example of the good Kings of Israel, that the good effects may follow, and that he may not follow the evil example of Tyrants and Oppressors: But and if he do, the effect and reward will certainly be upon him, and the Lord will rebuke him, and this we know by the Spirit of the Lord. Quer. 4. Whether may be justly forgive, or avenge himself, of his and his Father's Enemies; and if he do avenge, whether or no can that be called persecution? and if any, or many suffer death, or otherwise on that account because they destroyed his Father, and sought to destroy him also; do such suffer for righteousness and good conscience or no? if some of you suffer, for that cause shall you have Peace with God in it, or is it for the name of Christ, as ye often say? Answ. He may justly in the sight of God forgive his, and his Father Enemies,
and he will be the more blessed if he do it; for it is a happy thing to forgive Enemies, and it is Christ's Doctrine also to forgive Enemies, and it would be a good report unto him among his Friends, and it would win his Enemies, or be a good means towards it, if he do forgive all Enemies, and it will be a good begin∣ning of his Government to remit Offences; though yet in his heart he may be perswaded, that he and his Father have been much injured, yet, I say, justly he  forgive all in the sight of God, and also in the sight of men, as many wayes may appear; even in asmuch as his Father and he did flee to the Sword, to determine their Controversie in this Nation, and the Sword went against them, and did determine the controversie even against them; and that whereby they thought to stand, they did fall, and that which they chused for their defence, did destroy them; and who then shall they blame for that which befel them, seeing the Sword destroyed them, But this is not meant of the King's Death. which themselves did chuse, and thought thereby to stand, but it determined the Controversie against them; and if you cannot own it, as that the Hand of the Lord went against you in Battel, yet you must confess that the fortune of War (as some call it) went against you; and must such now suffer because hereof? nay, they ought not, but may rather be spared by the King: and inasmuch as he is restored again without blood or loss of lives, it may be very just for him not to take away any mens lives, but it will be more just to pass by all old things; and if he have a deliverance, let him turn it into the praise of the Ld in holiness, & not into the shedding of blood in the way of a fierce revenge; and let him leave it to the Lord to avenge himself upon such as have been his Enemies, and upon such as ve cast out King and Kingly Government, and pretended to a better Government,  to Govern more Righteously, and yet have been Oppressors, and not answered their pretences pretences and engagements, but broken them and acted contrary, by their Unfaithful∣ness and Hypocrisie; and in that doth lie the justness of punishment if it come up∣on them, and if they be punished with death, or otherwise; if they suffer on that account, I say, because they destroyed Kingly Goverment in Name and Title, and pretended better things, and to Govern better, and did not make Refor∣mation, but were Oppressors, as I hav  Suffering for that cause cannot be called Persecution, nor is it for good Conscience, nor Righteousness sake that such do Suffer: But none of us can Suffer for that cause, as not being guilty thereof, as in the Answer to the next Query I shall have full occasion to shew you; but and if we Suffer in your Government, it is for the Name of Christ, and we shall have Peace with God in it, because nothing can be charg∣ed against us in this Capacity as we now stand, and in this State into which we are now gathered and changed; not in any matter of Action or Rebellion a∣gainst him nor his Father, nor any thing but concerning the Law and Worship of our God, and the matters of his Kingdom, and our pure Consciences; and if upon this account we are made to suffer by him, and for this cause, the reward will be Sad and Heavy upon him in the day of the Lord: And if any that are now amongst us, were any way engaged in the Parliament Service in the Wars, it was not in Rebellion against him or his Father, as that we sought their de∣struction as men, but upon Sober and Reasonable Principles, and not for cor∣rupted ends, nor to get Honour and Riches to our selves, as some others might do, who went in the War for self-ends, and continued in action after the cause (which was once engaged for) was utterly lost, as we have long seen it; and that principle which some time led some in action to oppose Oppression, and seek after Reformation, we never have nor shall deny, but that Principle is still justified, though we are now better informed than once we were: for though we do now more than ever oppose Oppression, and seek after Reformation, yet we do it not in that way of outward Waring, and Fighting with Carnal Weapons, and Swords; and YOU, and the KING ought to put a difference (both in their guilt and suffering) between such as some time acted in the Wars against you, in and upon Sober and Reasonable Principles, and that did not make themselves Rich and High in this World through your Sufferings; and be∣tween
such as have acted against you for self ends, and have insulted over you, and have made themselves Great and Rich in this World, thorow your Afflicti∣ons and Sufferings; for they who have walked in that way, and are hereof guil∣ty, they have not acted Righteously, nor walked in good Conscience; and if such Suffer by you for that cause, it cannot be called Persecution, nor is it for the Name of Christ, nor can such have Peace with God: But we being clear from the sin of such, we cannot suffer as such, but if we suffer by you it is Perse∣cution, and our sufferings will be upon you. Quer. 5. Whether the great Afflictions and Sufferings sustained by him these divers years, from the Subjects of his own Nation, and the guilt thereof, do lie upon all the Sub∣jects in general? Or whether upon any, or some particular Sects and Sorts of People? (many which now are arisen) and if upon any particular Sect and Sort, who are such more then others? distinguish them from others, and clear your selves if you can from th guilt of his Sufferings. Answ. As for the Afflictions and Sufferings sustained by him, so far as they were just and righteous Judgments from God, because of Iniquity, can no man be charged with, but that is on God's account, who was pleased to chastize with Afflictions and Sufferings, and no man can be blamed with Injustice for that Affliction which cometh from the Hand of God, upon whom Injustice may not be charged by any one whatsoever; and so far as his Sufferings were unjust, the guilt thereof doth not lie upon all the Subjects in general, nor upon every particular sort of People alike, but upon some more then others, and such are easie to be distinguished from others, if it be considered who they are that first raised the War in this Nation against the King; and who was it that first preached and prayed up the War, and prosecuted it against his Father? And who is it that cast out the Bishops and Prelates from their Places, and took their Revenues and Benefices, and are become men as corrupted, as covetous, and self∣seeking, as proud and ambitious, as unjust Persecutors as ever the men were which they cast out? and the guilt is partly upon such who cast out others in pretence of Reformation, but did it no A who is it that hath gotten great Estates in this Nation, and Worldly Honour, and raised themselves from nothing by the Wars, and by your Suffering, and became ambitious and insulting over others, though they first began the War in this Nation, and pretended great Reformation in the Civil State, as well as the other had done in Church State? And who got the Estates and Titles of their Enemies, and pretended to free this Nation from all Oppressions, but have not done it, but have continued the old Oppressions, and have been striving among themselves who should Rule, and who should be great, but have not Ruled for God, nor in Justice and Equity, though they first Warred against the King, and carryed it on, and removed the King and Lords, and that Goverment, and all this in pretence of Ruling bet∣ter, and in a better Government, and yet kept not Engagements, nor Promises made in that case? Upon such is the guilt of the Suffering of the King, so far as his Sufferings are unjust, even upon Hypocrites, who have walked in these steps, who as I have said, first made war against the King, and got great Estates, and quite forgotten the cause once pretended by them, and now in flattery, Cries up King and Kingly Government again, though this many years they have seemed to be opposite against it; upon such as these may the guilt aforesaid in measure be charged: And though there are risen many Sects and Sorts of People since the beginning of the Wars, yet in the beginning there was but one sort that were in a capacity to raise and prosecute War against the King; and upon such there is guilt to be charged in the sight of God, who have foregone their Principles, and been deceitful both to God and men: And as for Us who are called Quakers, we are clear from the guilt of all his Sufferings, and in the present Capacity wherein we now stand, and under the actings of that Spirit which now we are of, we have no part in the guilt of these Iniquities; we have not cast out others, and taken their places of great Benefices, neither have we made war with carnal Weapons against any, never since we were a People,
(mark) neither have we broken Oaths and Engagements, nor promised free∣dom and deliverance, and for self-ends, and Earthly Riches betrayed, as o∣thers have done, what we pretended to; and in many particulars it doth appear, that we are clear from his Sufferings; for we have been a Suffering People, as well as they, by the same Spirit which caused them to suffer, which hath been much more Cruel, Wicked, and Unjust towards us, than it hath been towards them, though our Persecution hath been in another manner; but what they have done against us we can freely forgive them, and we would have you to follow the same example; and if you could accuse them in many things, so could we; but this is not a time to accuse one another, but to forgive one ano∣ther, and so to overcome your Enemies, or else you will appear in the same Spi∣rit, that so he that condemns them cannot justifie you, though we do condemn as well as you, them that have pretended Reformation, and Wared against you upon that account, and when they had gotten victory did not reform, but become Oppressors themselves as well as others, and became Cruel to∣wards others, that would not say and do as they; and for this Cause the Lord hath brought them down, and may justly suffer others to deal with them as they have dealt with others; yet notwithstanding I must still say, and it is my judgment, that there was very great Oppressions and Vexations under the Go∣vernment of the late King, and Bishops under his power, which the Lord was offended with, and many good People Oppressed by, for which cause the Lord might and did justly raise up some to oppose, and strive against Oppressions and Injustice, and to intend and press after Reformation in all things; and that Prin∣ciple of Sincerity which God did raise in many in the beginning of the Wars, which in some things acted them forth, and carryed them on in opposing Op∣pressions, and pressing after Reformation, this Principle I can never deny, but acknowledge to it, though many soon lost it, and became Self-seekers, forget∣ting and foregoing the Cause pretended to, having lost Sincerity, and became corrupted in their way, and Injustice and Oppression abounded by them, and be∣cause hereof are they condemned in the sight of the Lord, and not by me Justi∣fied, because they have lost Sincerity, and turned the War, and all the Proceed∣ings into Self-seeking; and therefore is God provoked against them, though had they continued in their Integrity, and had really performed what some time they pretended, and had forsaken all Sin, it had not been thus with them, neither had this guilt been upon them, which now they are like to be accounta∣ble for: And this is my Judgment concerning these things. Quer. 6. Whether or no he may iustly (think ye) and with more safety to himself, and happiness to the Kingdoms, Tollerate and Allow LIBERTY of CONSCI∣ENCE, (so called) to all the many Sects and sorts of People, and Worshippers that are now in beeing in these Nations? Or whether he may Tollerate some, and not all? Or whether he may Tollerate none, but reduce the Government of the Church into the way of Bishops and Prelates, as it was in his Father's dayes? Which of these may he do justly, and with more safety to himself, and happiness to his Government and King∣doms? Answ. We do believe he may and ought justly, and with most safety to him∣self, and happiness to the Kingdoms, Tollerate and Allow free LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE in all the Matters of Faith and Worship towards God; for LIBERTY in exercise of CONSCIENCE, in the Matters of God's Kingdom, is a very precious thing to the Lord, and very dear in his sight, and he is tender of it; and I do stedfastly believe, he will not bless the Rulers of this Nation, that shall deny (to the People of this Nation) and oppose LIBER∣TY of CONSCIENCE in the exercise of Faith and Worship towards God; for I do know it is not given of God to any Earthly King or Ruler whatsoever, to exercise. Lordship over the Consciences of People in the Matters of Faith and Worship, and the things pertaining to Gods Kingdom; for Kings and Rulers,
are but to Rule over men in a Nation, in the Matters between one man and an∣other, in outward things and worldly affairs; and therein only men ought to Rule in Equity over a Nation, or City, or Country; and Magistracy in this state, and for such an end is Gods Ordinance appointed of him, for the preser∣ving of peace and good order among men in outward things; and it is a privi∣ledge of the Crown of Christ's Spiritual Kingdom, to be Lord and Ruler over and in mens Consciences, in Faith and Worship, and all the Matters of his Kingdom, even as and according to his pleasure, and as his Spirit leads and guides, for and if any man shall assume to prescribe God a way how he must be Worshipped, and shall limit his Spirit from this, or to the other way of Religion, and think to be Lord in mens Consciences in religious Matters, such are but Usurpers, and are not well-pleasing to the Lord (in such their way and Govern∣ment) if they oppress mens Consciences, by limiting from, or compelling to any such way of Worship or kind of Religion; neither are they Ordained to Rule among men for that end, not to be King and Judge, and Law-giver in Heavenly and spiritual Matters; and this ought not CHARLES (the King) to do  but and if he do it, and will not let Christ alone be the Head over his Church, it cannot be with safety to himself, nor happiness to the King∣doms,  justly in the sight of God, but it will work contrary effects: And he may and ought to Tollerate and Allow Liberty of Conscience in the mat∣ters of God's Kingdom, to all sorts of People and Worshippers, that are  this Nation; and let him mind God's Wisdom, how to keep the Nations in peace and good order, in all outward and civil Affairs, between man and man, and between one sort of People and another, that none destroy each others persons or estates, nor be Oppressors one of another in outward and earthly Matters, and that is the place and priviledge of a just King and Ruler upon Earth; and to leave Faith and Worship, and Duty towards God, as every one is perswaded in their own Consciences is the right Way; whether they will read the Common-Prayer, or Preach and Pray after the order of the Directory, or otherwise; Or whether they will meet in silence without words; and let all these enjoy their way of Religion and Worship in outward peace, and not kill one another about their Religion, Worship, Church and Ministry, nor imprison and persecute one another about these things; but let them all be preserved as men, living in peace one with another in all outward relations, and yielding Subjection to good Laws which concern their outward man, and their peace and well-being, as Subjects of a Nation; but there ought to be no Law of Bondage and Force, nor violent Impositions by any man concern∣ing Religion; for the Lord alone is sufficient to give Prescriptions and Laws to his People, how he may be served and worshipped; and this is the way of good Government in this Nation, that only the outward man in outward things be Governed, and all Matters of Conscience in spiritual things be left un∣to God, that his Spirit may therein onely rule and have the preheminence; and if the King do Rule thus, he may be more blessed; and in that this Nation hath his word for LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE, it is expected; for because this hath been wanting, (to wit) the allowance of LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE in spiritual Matters, because of this, have been much strife, and contention, and heart-burnings in the Nation, while some Sects of People have been tollerated and upheld, and others persecuted for their Religi∣on-sake by Law; and this was one of the chief causes wherefore the Presbyteri∣ans (so called) first raised War against the Bishops, even because they could not be tollerated, but were persecuted, while the other were guarded and defended by Law; and this was a great cause of enmity, which if the Presbyte∣rians (so called) could have had Liberty and Tolleration at that day, for their Worship and Faith, it is possible the War against the Bishops had not so far proceeded; though when they had gotten Victory, they were no less furions towards the Bishops to destroy them, than the other had been once against them;
and this arose by reason of persecuting for Conscience sake, because all had not Liberty in the exercise of Spiritual things, which if the King had declared it at day Equal Liberty to both, in Matters of their Faith and Religion, and yet ruled over both in outward affairs, and had Authority over the Persons and Estates in Matters not related in Spiritual Worship, but left them therein free, and in their Religion; by such means the War might have been stopped, and not proceeded so far as it did, and into such destruction; and this being now well considered, may be an Example to prevent the like hereafter: So that  y, it cannot be for his safety, nor for the good of the Kingdoms, to Tol∣lerate some sorts of People, and Religions, and Persecute others, for that will be the very cause of strife among men, it will provoke one sort to destroy an∣other, and it will provoke the Lord God against the King and his Government, to destroy them both; Therefore to reduce the Government of the Church into the State, as it stood under the Bishops in his Fathers dayes, and to prohibit all others that may differ in Judgment from that, this is not the way for Peace and happiness in these Nations, nor the way that will be blessed to the Government; neither can the Bishops and Prelates justly themselves desire it, that only they and their Church-Government, should be Imposed and Tol∣lerated, and all besides Prohibited; for this is not doing to others as they would be done unto; and I may hope that their suffering this divers years, may have taught them the worth of Liberty to themselves, and so, that they will allow to others (if it be in their power) the same which they have desired themselves, in their time of suffering; and they having tasted of some Subjection in Adversity, they know the better how to behave themselves in time of prosperity; and they may compare others with their own state, and may judge that others will as much desire Liberty, and from as good Principles, i their Worship and Faith, as themselves would have enjoyed it in times past; and they may have learned to be good to others in that case, for which them∣selves have suffered, and not cause others to suffer for that thing about which themselves have suffered: And I do conclude, that he may justly and with more safty and happiness to his Government, Tollerate and Allow LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE in the Exercise of Faith and Worship towards God, in all spiritual Matters, even to all sorts of People in this Nation, and let him de∣fend their Persons and Estates, from the wrong one of another, by wholsome Law; and let each sort defend themselves in their Faith and Worship, in their Church and Ministry, by their soundest Arguments, and the best spiritual wea∣pons they have; and thus should it be blessed to the Government: And what∣soever sort or sect of People are not contented with this, that is to say, to Allow the same Liberty to others in Faith and Worship, which they do de∣sire themselves, are not worthy themselves to be allowed Liberty unto; and this every reasonable man may judge. Quer. 7. Lastly, what is your Iudgement; (if ye dae declare it) concern∣ing the Times and Seasons, and the present motions of them? And what are your Observations of the present proceedings? Are the present Times and seasons, and the proceedings and transactions in Mercy, or in Iudgment to the King, and his Subiects? If in Mercy, to whom is it Mercy? And if in Iudgment, who are they to whom these things are so? If ye be not faint-hearted declare your minds, now in your last dayes (as many think) for many say, that your ruin is nigh come; and if it be not so, many are deceived? Answ. Yes, we dare declare our judgment concerning the Times and seasons, for we have received the Judgment of Truth in our Spirits, and never have been, nor are we afraid to declare the Truth, so far as Truth is necessary to be declared; and we say the times and seasons are in the hand of the Lord, and the motions of them are very swift; and the Lord gives to whom, and takes from whom, (times and seasons) as he pleaseth, even as it were in an instant oth the Lord give, and change, and alter, Times, Authorities, and things;
and mortal man ought not to glory in Times or Seasons, as if they were cer∣tain and unchangeable to him; for behold the Motions of Times flyeth away, and Seasons removeth their course, and the most confident of men have no cer∣tainty thereof, and that because they are in the hand of the Lord that turneth them about, and often contrary to mens will and pleasure; and therefore,  every man be good in his Time, and fulfil she Will of the Lord in his Season, before Ti and Season be no more, but removed from them. And as for our Observations, they are very many of the present Proceedings and Transactions: First, we do observe, that there is not any thing of all these Transactions that are come to pass, but there is a secret hand of the Lord God, through them, and in them; either doing of them, or suffering of them to be done; and either as the cause by secret purpose, or as the means of their accom∣plishment; it is not without him that these things cometh to pass, but his Eye and his Hand is over them, and that man is only blessed which hath respect unto him in all these things, that he may do or suffer for the Lord, and that he may not rebel against him, in what is brought to pass by him. Secondly, we observe how that the Lord hath given unto many men a Day and a Time, and tried them what they would do for him, and whether they would rule in Righteousness, and in Equity, but many have proved deceitfull, and not answered to the Lord what he expected from them; and therefore the Lord hath confounded them in their Counsels, and suffered them to clash one against another, and made them overthrow one another; and one self-seeking man hath been the ruin of another (as bad as himself) and even many by their own proceedings have prepared a rod and judgment even for themselves, and through their blindness of heart, which they have been given up to, because of their wickedness, they have destroyed themselves, and given their very Enemies advantage over them to afflict them, and this we have observed of present Proceedings. Thirdly, We observe that there is a rude prophane spirit, highly abounding thoughout this Nation, that brings forth much bad fruit, as drunkenness and wickedness in a great measure, which may justly provoke the Lord to wrath and indignation against the Land, if it be not forsaken, though it be lifted up in this wonderful rudeness in a pretence of glorying on the behalf of the King, and his Government; yet it vexeth the Lord and it works Sorrow in the hearts of many Sober People who are pondering what the End of this Government may be, that is thus rude and prophane in its beginning, saying in their hearts, how shall the Lord bless these proceedings, and make the end of them happy, which are thus void of the fear of God in the first part of them; and if a stop be not put, and a limitation upon the Spirit, it will provoke the Lord to work sudden de∣struction, and overthrow the Nation. Fourthly, We observe, that many Hypocrites and double-minded men, are afraid, and terror hath Surprized them, who have taken the profession of such or such a Religion, on them for a Cloak and hath been in the shew of Righte∣ousness for earthly ends, such are afraid, and their ends are frustrated, and they are turned into confusion and a prophane Spirit abounding over their Hypocrisie, and such will deny their Principles, and their Faith, and will fawn and flatter to save themselves, and this is abominable; but men that have been and are upright and sincere towards God in their way, they are not afraid, but are confident in the Lord, and are given up in his will, whether to do or suffer for his Name sake, and they have no terror upon them because of any guilt, because they have been upright, in that way which they were perswaded to be right, and such live in a patient and quiet life, and are contented whatsoever comes to pass, because they have the Witness, that they have not followed their Religion for self-ends, nor taken the name of Righteousness for a Cloak, as ma∣ny others have, upon whom this overturning falls very heavy. And these things, with many more the like, we do observe from the present transactions which are faln
out in Mercy to some, and in Judgment to others, even a Judgment upon all that do not fear the Lord, but walk in wickedness, and that have been Hypocrites, and Hard-hearted, and Cruel, and to all that do not repent of their sins, these things, and the end of them, are, and shall be great Judgments, and shall be turn∣ed into bitterness, even their joy, and rejoycing, into howling, and great La∣mentation, this shall be the end unto all the Ungodly; but unto all that fear the Lord, and depart from Iniquity, even unto such the end of all these things shall be good, even Mercy d Peace, and their Sorrow shall be turned into Ioy. And as for us, we are not faint-hearted, though it be supposed that we are in our last dayes, and as though our ruin were nigh to come; but we believe other∣wise, for we have clearness of Conscience towards God and all men, and walk in Faith and patience, and knowing this assuredly, that if we be persecuted and af∣flicted in Person or Estate, by you that are now in power, yet it is for Righteousness ske, and for the Lords sake, and not for the guilt of any Rebellion against you, that you have, or ever can have to charge upon us, for we cannot be found in these things; for we can neither secretly flatter to make peace with you, neither can we ly rebel against you, or resist you; but as our right from God and you, we claim the LIBERTY of the Exercise OF OUR CONSCIENCES, in the Maters of Faith, and a holy Life towards God, that we may mind the things of God's Kingdom, and may so walk and worship, as to have peace with God in our Consciences, that no burden of Sin and Iniquity may lie upon us, but that we may Live and Die in Peace with God, this is all we claim of you: But and if you will not allow it us, but will persecute us, and seek to destroy us only for our Conscience-sake, and because of our Faith and Religion, if you do make and execute Laws against us, in opposition to the Law of our God, that you may take an occasion against us to destroy us because thereof, then Innocent blood and cruel suffering will be upon you, and the weight of it will  into confussion, when your measure is full; and if you should destroy these vessels, yet our Principles you can never extinguish, but they will live for ever, and enter into other bodies to live, and speak and act through other vessels; for our Principles are standing and unchangeable through Ages, and Generations, and may be clouded but can never be extin∣guished, for every man hath a Light in his Conscience which Christ hath inlightened them withal; which Light reproves Men for sin, and with it they know they should not Lye nor Swear, nor be Drunk, nor deal doubbly, nor walk in any sin: but and if they do these things, and live contrary to the Light in their own Consciences, then they deny Christ and are unbelievers, and they are condemned, and have trouble in their Con∣sciences; but if men do own that Light in their Consciences which doth reprove them for sin, then it leads them to Repentance, and to the forsaking of all sin, and they cease from all Iniquity, and receive Iesus Christ and his blood to cleanse them. And the Light of the Spirit of God leads them into all Truth, to do, and speak the Truth in all things, and then he hath peace with God in his Conscience: And these are some of our Principles, which can never be Subdued by all the Powers of the Earth, though the vessels which now retain these were cut off, yet these Principles are unchangeable in themselves, and can never be extinguished; so that this our Re∣ligion cannot come to ruin, but they that think so, they are indeed deceived, and who∣soever shall seek to destroy that which Gods purpose is to exalt, wo shall be unto them; and as they purpose towards others so shall it come upon them from the Lord in his Day and Season. And thus I have answered the Queries directed to the Quakers, and subscribed, Trite hanc Amico Regis, and I do desire that the Friend of the King, and all his Friends, and he himself, may receive and read over these my Answers, and may con∣sider them in coolness and moderation, for they may be to their Edification if they be Sober minded. I am a Friend unto all men as men and creatures, and a lover of all Souls, and am in Principles and Practises one of them scornfully called, a Quaker. E. B.
An Objection Answered, concerning the Kings Supremacy. ANd whereas it is Objected by some, Whether or no we will be obedient Subject, accepting of him as our Lawful King, and own his Supremacy, and will obey him wil∣lingly or unwillingly, and be Subjects in Conscience, or against our Consciences? Answ. It is our Principle, and hath ever been our Practise, to be obedient Subjects to whatsoever Power or Authority of man, or men, as have been in being over us, either by doing and fulfilling their just Commands, or by suffer∣ing under their Commands which have been unjust, and thus we are perswaded and resolved in the Lord to continue, even to be obedient to the Commands of Men in Authority, which are just, and according to our Consciences; but and if any thing or matter be required of us, and Imposed upon us, which is con∣trary to the Law of God and our Consciences, that we must fulfil by Suffering what∣soever is put upon us by him, or any under him; and so we own him and accept him, as knowing and believing, that he is set to rule in this Nation, not with∣out, but by, and according to the Purpose of the Lord, and that he hath secret∣ly purposed and suffered the accomplishing of these things; and thus we ac∣count that he is CHIEF MAGISTRATE, because these things are effect∣ed through the Lord's Power, who doth whatsoever he will, and we do own that he is set and proclaimed to be the Head and Supream over this Nation, in Civil and Outward Affairs and Matters, and in those things that are related to the outward man; and all his Commands which are just we can willing∣ly be subject unto, even in Conscience, and all hi Commads which are other∣wise, we are willingly and in our Consciences contented in patience to bear what men shall put upon us; and thus we do accept of the King and his Govern∣ment, as he, and it, are according to God, and answerable unto him, if it be so, we are willingly, and in Conscience accepting thereof, and shall be obedient Subjects thereunto; but if it be otherwise, that is to say, if he Rule in Tyran∣ny and Oppression, and his Government be unjust and unrighteous, and con∣trary to God, then we must give our witness against him, and it; yet not so, as by outward opposition, and rebellion, to seek the overthrow of him or the Government by Carnal Weapons; but shall patiently bear, and that for Con∣science sake, all that cruelty, and injustice, and suffering, which can be imposed upon us: And as for owning his Supremacy, if it be meant his Supremacy over the Church, as if he were Head of the Church, and were Supream Law-giver and Iudge, and King in Church-State, as to give and prescribe Law for Worship and Faith, and to pass all Judgement in matters that are Spiritual, and appertaining to Conscience, and about the things of the Kingdom of God; if by his Supremacy this be meant, and intended thus; we cannot own his Supremacy, but must deny it, and we do ascribe Supremacy only to IESUS CHRIST, in, and con∣cerning all these things mentioned, and that he alone is Iudge, and King, and Law-giver in all the matters concerning his own Spiritual Kingdom, and he must prescribe for us Faith and Worship and must be the only Iudge in all cases of Consci∣ence and Spiritual matters, and not Charles Stuart King of England, &c. not any other man upon the Earth; for let it not be understood that we deny his Supre∣macy in opposition to the Pope of Rome, as if we should own the Popes Supremacy over the Church, for that we do not, nor any man upon the Earth, as I have said, but only IESUS CHRIST is principal in that relation, and to him we give the Dominion in all the cases of his own Kingdom; but if owning his Supre∣macy it be intended, whether we will own him to be Head and Ruler, as in the affairs of his Nation, pertaining to mens Persons and Estate, without any relation to the Worship of God, or matters of Conscience, so we own him, as I have before mentioned, and must be Subject for: Conscience-sake in fulfilling all his com∣mands whatsoever, either by doing or suffering; and this is our principle which we are perswaded in, and resolved herein to continue and abide.
To Charles Stuart, who is Proclaimed King, and to all You that are called and known by the Name of Royal-Party and Cavaleirs, and who have Suffered in your Cause, and for your Principles Friends, THe Lord God who is greater than all, that doth whatsoever he will, hath given you a Day, and you are raised up again out of your Suffering State; Oh that you would consider the end of it, and wherefore the Lord hath done, and suffered it to be done; and that you would make right use and improvement unto God and this Nation of this your Deliverance and Promotion; for cer∣tainly there hath been an absolute purpose in the Counsel of the Lord, that these things should be thus, and his hand hath even suffered it to be accomplished, even in a strange and marvellous way, through the confounding of your Ene∣mies, and giving of them up to the folly of their own hearts in their Councils, that they should destroy themselves, and bring in you over their heads, and make you a Mountain, and break down their Mountain, and make it as a low Valley; and certainly these things are in the Justice of the Lord's hand, and it will be well for you if you can consider it, and acknowledge it: You have been a suffering People it is true, for these divers years, and Originally your suffering was partly just as from the Lord; for there was a great measure of In∣iquity and Oppression fulfilled in this Nation on the part of Kings, and your Sins were great against God; wherefore the Lord was Just in bringing Affliction and Tribulation upon you, to humble you, and he might justly raise up others to reprove you, and to subdue you before them for a season; and thus far even be∣cause of your Iniquities which were great in the sight of God, your Sufferings and Afflictions were Just: But as for those, that the Lord made use of in the Execution of your Afflictions, they are not justified in all what they did to∣wards you, but they went beyond (in Violence and Cruelty upon you) what the Lord called them unto; and thereby they brought a great measure of guilt of Injustice and Cruelty upon their own Consciences, in proceeding towards you beyond Justice and Equity: Though some of them might be more sincere and upright in the beginning of these things, when they began to War against you; yet it too well appears that many of them soon lost the Just Cause, and began to have respect to your Estates and Titles of Honour, more than to free the Na∣tion from Oppressions and Vexations, though they pretended much thereun∣to, yet so it was that they became fouly corrupted in their way; and though they Subdued you, yet did they not free the Nation, but became Oppressors themselves no less than others before them, and they possessed your Riches, and Titles, (yea and in great measure Unjustly) and then were exalted in Ambi∣tion and Vain-glory, and began to strive amongst themselves who should be the greatest, and set up this, and the other, and some cryed one way of Govern∣ment, and others another, and they pulled down and set up as they would, and cast down and exalted whom they would; and thus they continued for some years, rowling up and down in Confusion, and yet the Nation under very great Oppression and Vexations, each one crying his Burden was the greatest, while they were exalted in their Pride and Riches, and lived at ease, not remembring the end wherefore they were first raised, nor keeping to sincere Principles, but caused them to suffer deeply that were faithful to the Lord, and walked with him in sincerity; and all this while you were as asleep, and not thought upon by them, as if ever you should call them to an Account; but they thought that their strength was great, and their number many, and therein they gloried,
having no true respect unto the Lord; and because thereof the Lord justly confounded them in their Counsels, when their measure was full, and made them weak as Water; and you are now justly raised up to reprove and correct them, even those that have abused Gods Mercies to them, and that have forgotten God and sought to exalt themselves forever, and had no re∣spect unto the Lord and his People; though these things are not said of them, to upbraid them, nor to kindle your Fury against them, to add Misery upon their Affliction, but they have already been told of their Treachery, and what would come to pass; And Oh, that they could now humble themselves before the Lord, and confess to the justice of this their Affliction; they might yet partake of his Mercy, through great Judgments. And as for you, Oh, that you would consider these things, and by whose purpose you are restored, and from what cause, and for what end it is accom∣plished! Oh that you would mind what your Work now is, and that you would not exceed your permission; for you are raised up for an end, and there is a Work for you to do; Oh that you could do it with respect unto the Lord, it should be the better for you; Oh those men that have long sate as Princes in this Nation, and pretended, and vowed, and promised Reformation in Church and State, but they have not done it as they ought, but as great Oppressions and Injustice, as great Superstitions and Idolatries both in Church and State, were continued and carried on in their dayes, as in dayes before them; Oh how abominable have these things been! (multitude of words might demonstrate) but now their Reproof and judgment is come, and their Fall is just upon them; who should pitty them, or mourn for them, seeing they have deserved all this and much more which has yet happened unto them? as some of them may confess: and those things (their Treachery, Unfaithfulness; and Oppressions I mean) must needs be avenged one way or another; How often hath it been foretold them, yea, it hath been often said unto them, That God would bring them down, and destroy their Power? they have been told, that these things were not right, neither could they escape unavenged; and it now appears as if the day were come: and if you must be their Executioners, and must execute the Wrath upon them, who shall prevent you? or say unto you, stay your Hand? Or rather, who of them that see these things, shall not be patient while you take vengeance for the Lords sake, and for the sake of his People, whom they have long vexed and oppressed? Nay, who of the Lords People shall not say, Let the Lord's Will be done, and his Justice executed up∣on his Enemies? If this be your work that you are called to, must it not go on till it be finished? They have been hard-hearted and Oppressors towards others; and by a hard-hearted People, may not the Lord justly deal with them, and be a Plague unto them in that very manner, that they have sinned against him? for this is usual with the Lord, even to destroy Oppressors by the Wickedness of others; and often he rebukes the Sin of a People, by a People as bad as themselves; he may justly give unto Men from the Hands of others, what they love in their own Hearts: and even as those Men have loved Pride and Ambition over others, and Oppression and Hard-heartedness towards others; even so, and much more may justly be done unto them, and that according to the Will of the Lord; and if this be your Work designed you by the Eternal Hand, who shall prevent you? But yet, Oh that you would consider, and that you would have respect unto the Lord, lest you out-go the end of your Restoration: You would indeed be happy, if you could for∣give your Enemies, if you could reward them Good for their Evil; and you would be happy if you could not exceed the measure of your Permission: be not too hard-hearted towards them, but shew Mercy. And Oh you must take heed lest you cause the Righteous to suffer with the Wicked, and that you cause not the Innocent to Groan and Mourn in your execution of God's purpose upon the Ungodly, you must be aware lest while you punish Offenders, you
smite not them that are free; Oh that you had hearts this to understand, and that you could walk in the path of fulfilling God's pleasure, and not go further, (I mean) though you may be raised to be a Plague upon Hypocrites, and Dis∣obedient and Treacherous men, and to avenge God's Cause and his Peoples; but you are not raised to be Oppressors of the Lord's People, nor to destroy his Heritage, this is not your Work; God hath not called you to destroy and persecute them that fear his Name, and tremble at his Word, though you have power to be avenged on your Enemies: And Oh that your Hearts could understand this, that you might distinguish in your Proceedings, between executing of Justice upon Transgressors, and Persecution for Conscience sake; the one you have to do, but the other is forbidden you of the Lord, and you ought not to do it; for if you persecute any for good Conscience sake, or because they are of such and such an Assembly of People, and worship in such a Way; if you inflict Tribulation upon any because hereof, or because they are such or such in their Profession and Religion, then you persecute for Conscience sake, and you go beyond the End, and by the Path for which you were raised; and if you turn your Hand and Power to persecute for good Conscience-sake, then you divert the End and Purpose of this your Restoration, and the Lord will require it of you, if that you go beyond his Permission and Assignment, and beyond his Pleasure in persecuting his People, and so turn your Power to a wrong Use and End; O then the Lord shall suddenly confound you, and he will find out Instruments that shall fulfil his Wrath, and Justice upon you, as he hath found you fit to execute Wrath upon others; and therefore do not, O do not persecute any for Conscience-sake; if you have nothing against them but concerning their Faith and Worship, and their Religion, do not lay your Hand upon them, nor let them be touched; for if you do, the Lord will take it as a heinous Offence against him, and in this life, or hereafter, he will plague you for it, and you shall not escape unpunished: and therefore I say once more to you, as the advice of your Friend, Let no Man be persecuted for his Faith, and for his Religion-sake, but make a difference between inflict∣ing Wrath upon Offenders that have been Hypocritical and Deceitful, and that have made themselves rich through the ruins of others, and that will bow to any thing, or any kind of Worship for their own ends; and be∣tween such as have a Principle and do stand by it, and are humble and acted in the Principles of Sincerity, and follow that way of Religion which they sup∣pose, and are perswaded is the best, and the rightest; all such ought to have Liberty under you in their Profession, and Faith, and Worship, and ought not to be persecuted while they live peaceable as men with one another, and towards all men; and the God of Heaven requires it of you, and your Standing, or your Fall, the Blessing or the Curse unto you depends hereupon; and this you shall find to be true unto you in the day of God's Righteous Judgments: O therefore be not stout against the Lord, but fear and tremble before him; let his Dread be upon your Spirits, and do not offend him, nor provoke him against you, and this Nation, lest he tear you to pieces, and number you for Destruction, lest he overturn you suddenly, and deface your Glory in its morning: Oh how happy would you be if you would regard the Lord and reverence him; and take him before you, and not go beyond in any thing what his Purpose and Pleasure is, who hath given you this one Day to try you, if so be that any of you shall learn his Fear and turn from your Iniquities, that you may be blessed, and not confounded: Oh therefore consider what the Will and Purpose of the Lord is towards you and wherefore you are raised up, & may fulfil his purpose, and not your own: Oh then this Day should be made happy unto you; but the contrary works. I mean, if you do Oppress, and Persecute, and seek to destroy his Heritage, and rule in Oppression and Tyranny, then the God of Heaven shall cut your Day short, and deliverance he will bring to this poor Na∣tion without you, & even contrary to you, and his hand shall be turned upon you,
and your Mountain though never so great, and high, shall be laid low, and an Infant of the heavenly Birth shall leap over it; and shall say, Where is that lofty Babel that exalted it self against my God? And as for us, we are a very poor contemned and despised People; even since we were a People unto this very day, and have nothing at this present, not heretofore to glory in from any Power that hath ruled: but the Power, Spirit, and Presence of God in our Tribulations, Afflictions, Persecutions and unjust Suf∣ferings; these things have been our Portion, even from all; all have troden upon us in Contempt and Scorn, and accounted us as Sheep for the slaughter, and we have not to glory in any Government that hath been since we were a Peo∣ple; we cannot justifie one or another, but we say, they have all been Op∣pressors, and we have groaned with deep sighs to the Lord under the Burden of their unrighteous Dealing; and herein we assent with you, if you say they have been unjust Men, we say the same; and if you say their Govern∣ment hath been Oppression and Unequal, we say the same; if you say you have suf∣fered Cruelly and Unrighteously by them, we say the same; if you say they have Ru∣led by Will and Force, more then by Law and Equity, we verifie the same; and if you can say you have suffered Afflictions, and Tribulation by them, so have we in another manner, and far more unjustly: Wherefore we cannot justifie them, nor will not plead for them in opposition to you; but we partly believe we may receive as much Equity and good Reason from some of you, as we did from some of them; and thus we have been a suffering People even without cause: And at this day we are threatned by the rage of Men as if we should be cut off and destroyed; but we regard not these things, but do respect the Lord, whom we fear and worship in our Hearts; and if we outwardly perish among them that may perish, yet it is for Righteousness sake, and because of the mat∣ters of God's Kingdom, which we hold; and if you do destroy us for this cause we are clear, and Innocent Blood will be upon you, and the guilt thereof will sink you into misery here, or hereafter. Oh take heed and defile not your selves, nor load your Consciences with our guiltless Sufferings, as many others have done before you, even to their ruin and woful destruction; you are yet in a great measure clear from our Oppressions; we have not much Iniquity yet to charge upon you in our Cause of Afflictions: Oh it will be well for you if you keep your selves clear, the less will be your Judgement, and the better success will you have in you Cause; for Friends, the weight of Innocent Blood it hath a loud cry, and God will hear it; and if you burden your selves with it, it will soon overweigh you: therefore keep clear, and condemn them by your Practises, that have said, they would not persecute for good Conscience sake, but have done it, even contrary to all Pretences and Engagements; and if you who profess not so much in words towards that thing, would do it; how should your Practise condemn their Hypocrisie in the sight of God, Men, and Angels? But however I warn you, and do leave it at your door; and do say unto you, Persecution for Conscience sake, is the crying Sin, which draws down Ven∣geance upon Kings and Governments; be you warned through the fall of others, least confusion come upon you, as it hath come upon many others for that cause: and be not too confident in your way, nor too furious against your Enemies, but remember your breath is in your Nostrils, and he that gave it you can soon take it away And as for you, we have no Enmity towards any of you, nor do we seek the hurt of your Persons, nor can we rise up in Rebellion against you, or seek your Destruction by Craft or Policy; neither indeed can we seek Covenant or League with you by flattery: It is true, you are in Authority over us outward∣ly, and as you are so, we shall yield subjection to you in any of your just Com∣mands; and in all things it is our Principle to obey you, either by doing or suffer∣ing; yet we cannot bow, nor fawn, nor flatter, nor deny our Principles, nor our Religion of which we are perswaded by the Spirit of God in our Consciences,
that it is right and according to God; but I say, we cannot revoke our Principle, neither for advantage to our selves, nor yet to save our lives; you must find us constant, and not changeable as others are, who turn every way for their own advantage, and cry up this or the other, and pray and fight on the behalf of any thing which may make for their advantage, but God is grieved with such Spirits; yet we are otherwise minded, and must only own your Govern∣ment and Authority; as it is just, and brings forth Righteousness, so we can own it, and bow before it; but as otherwise, if it be Unjust and Oppression, we must patiently suffer under it, whatsoever you have power to do; and this is all the Peace we can make with you, or the Engagement that we can bind our selves in towards you, though we cannot but own that this Day is given you, ei∣ther in Mercy, or in Judgement to you; yea, and we cannot but own, that you may be God's Executioners; yea, what if we say, That you may be raised up to avenge our Cause upon our Oppressors, though still we must bear witness against that Wicked, Loose, Prophane Spirit, that lives and abounds in some of you and among you, and works Unrighteousness even to the dishonour of God, throughout this Nation; this Spirit we bear witness against, that it is evil, and brings forth bad effects in every City and Town throughout the Land; where∣by the Lord is provoked against you, and this Nation in an high measure: Oh that you would consider of it while there is time, to be corrected and amended, before it hath brought forth unpardonable Iniquities, which it hastens to fulfil, and draws down Wickedness as with Cords! Oh the Excessiveness in drinking, and other Vanities! Oh what destroying of the good Creatures! It grieves the Hearts of the Righteous, and vexeth the Sober-minded to consi∣der it: and also there is a great deal of Hypocrisie and deceitful-heartedness amongst many; I have considered this thing, and it is a Vexation to the Lord, and cannot but be detestable to you; even in that many contrary to their Principles, Engagements, Promises, and Covenants, do now cry you up for to save themselves, their Lives & Estates who have been deeply engaged against you publickly and privately, and yet now in Hypocrisie are fallen in with you; such their Proceedings are loathsome to God, and your present Cause is no better because of such; though as for some of you, that have stood to your Principle, and suffered for it this long while, in your State, you are more honourable and rather justified. Oh, let the King fear and reverence the eternal God, knowing he is but mortal Man, and his Breath in his Nostrils; and let him keep himself clear from Persecution for Conscience-sake; for that will destroy Kings and Governments, who are guilty thereof: and let him be meek and sober, and take the Lord be∣fore him in all his Proceedings, or else he cannot prospe; his Day, and Time is now present, that God's purpose is to try him, if he Rule in Righteousness and Truth, in Equity and Justice, he may be blessed; But if otherwise he Go∣vern, and walk not in reverence to the Lord, and spare his People; the God of Heaven shall rebuke him, and deliver his People another way. Consider of these things in a sober mind, read them over in meekness. From a Lover of your Souls, E. B. This was written about the middle of the 3d Moneth, called May.
A few Queries I do return to you, for you to consider and answer, re∣lating to the present Affairs and Proceedings in this Nation, even to all you, that are called and known by the Name of Royallists and Cavaliers, that are really so, and have Suffered for that Cause. Quer. 1. TO what do you attribute the first Cause of the advancement of this present Government? And whether or no ye believe, that there was any thing of the Purpose and Hand of the Lord, by intending and bring∣ing these things about, without expectation by you, and contrary to the great strength of your Enemies, who are suddenly of a great and high Mountain, made a low Valley; and you of a low and trodden down Valley, suddenly raised up into a great Mountain? And to what do you attribute this Changing and overturning of Power, and Authority, and Rulers, even them that have been as Princes and Potentates, to be Rebels; and them that have been ac∣counted as Rebels and Traytors, to be Rulers and Governours? I say, To what do you attribute these things, on their first Cause, whether to the Pollicy of some, or to Accident, or to good Fortune (as some call it?) Or whether you believe in your Consciences, that the Lord God by his secret Power hath purposed and suffered the effecting and accomplishing of these things? Quer. 2. And if you believe that there is any thing of the Hand and Pur∣pose of the Lord, in doing, or suffering these trans actions; then wherefore, and for what Cause do you believe hath he done these things? Is it because you are more righteous in the sight of God than they who are cast out before you; and because he loveth you, and hateth them? Or whether it is not because they have proved Treacherous and Deceitful, and not answered unto the Lord what he required of them, but sought themselves, and forgot the Lord, and took your Estates and Titles of Honour upon them, and pretended a better Government, and to govern better than that way of Monarchical Government, but did not, but were Oppressors even as others before them? And is not this the Iust Cause, wherefore the Lord hath suffered these Overturnings? May not we justly (that are neither of you) Attribute this to be the very Cause, wherefore the Lord hath brought them down, and raised up you over them? whereas if they had repented of their Sins, and been faithful to what the Lord required of them, and to what themselves pretended to, and had indeed Governed Iustly and Righteously, and freed the Oppressed, and answered unto the Lord in an equal Government according to his Law; whether may it not be believed, that these things had never thus been brought to pass? Quer. 3. Whether or no you believe that there is a GOD so mighty in Power, and so wise in Counsel and Purpose, that can Turn and Overturn you and your Power, and lay you low even as others, and raise up others who are now as low as you have been for divers years? Whether you believe there is a GOD, that by his Power can effect such a thing, and accomplish it in his Wisdom? And whether do you not believe in your Consciences, that he will do it, if you do not please him and fear his Name, and forsake all Wickedness; and if you be Oppressors and Cruel-hearted as others have been, and do not rule in Righteous∣ness and Equity? And whether you believe not, that the Lord doth watch over you, with his Eye that sees you, and marks all your wayes? Whether do you consider, that the Lord looks for good fruit from you, and that you should free the Land from Oppression? which if you answer not the Will of the Lord
in what he requires; Whether do not you believe, that he is so wise in Counsel, and mighty in Power, that he can and will, whether by Means or without Means, overturn and confound you and your Government? Quer. 4. Whether you believe in your Consciences, and do acknowledge unto God, that there was any thing of his IUSTICE in your late Suffer∣ings for these divers years? Or whether all of them, or no part of that Suffer∣ing, which hath been upon you, were any whit Iust as from the Lord? And whether there was not a great Measure of Iniquity filled up in Monarchical Go∣vernment; and a great Measure of Oppression upon the poor People of this Na∣tion by their Lords and great Men? And whether this Rebuke and Reproof, that you have had in this measure of Suffering, that hath been upon you, was not in some measure Iust as from the Lord; that you might be humbled before him: though it is by me acknowledged, That your Enemies (these I mean) who are now cast out before you, brought great guilt upon themselves, in executing wrath upon you, in that and because they proceeded further, and into more Bitterness, and Cruelty towards you, then they had either Commission or Authority from God; But whether there was not a Iustice as from the Lord in that which partly befel you? And was not his Hand many times against you in Battel, though Number nor Valour was not wanting on your part? yet are not you sensible how by a secret Hand you were often defeated, and Victory given to your Enemies; though the less in Number? And were not these things in the Iustice of the Lord's Hand? Whether do you not believe it, and acknowledge it? Quer. 5. Whether or no you do intend any Reformation from OLD Oppressi∣ons? Or whether you intend to tread in the very steps and to walk in the very Path in every Particular of Government, as it stood and was carried on in the beginning of CHARLES the first his days? And whether you ought not in the sight of God and before him, to consider how to relieve the Oppressed, and break off all cruel Bonds of Injustice, and how a Government may be set up, which may be answerable to the Lord, and not unto your own and other corrupted mens ends? but if you shall do so, Whether do you answer the End, or deny the End, wherefore the Lord hath thus dealt with you, in giving of you this Day unexpected and contrary to all your Enemies? And whether do you not believe, that God hath set you between Good and Evil, between Right and Wrong, be∣tween doing of his Will and the will of the Devil, in the doing and fulfilling one or the other by you, whether doth not depend Happiness and Blessedness upon you, or the Wo and the Curse, your Standing or your Fall, your Renown or your Disho∣nour perpetually? Quer. 6. Whether or on you do not believe in your Consciences, that the Pro∣sperity, and Continuance, and Happiness of this your Government to your selves, the King, and Kingdoms; or the Unhappiness, Overthrow, Misery, and Confusion of the Government it self, the King and these Nations doth not stand and wholly depend upon the Government and Authority, as it proceedeth in Iustice, Righteousness, and Equity, or as it is, and proceedeth contrary, and is, Injustice, Oppression, and Unrighteousness? and if therein it stand, whether do you believe in your Consci∣ences that God shall Bless it, and Prosper it, or he shall Destroy it and Confound it? For is not the Hand of the Lord stretched forth in Mercy or in Iudgment according as Men walk in his Fear, or without his Fear? And whether if your CAUSE be Iust in it self, yet if you walk in Unrighteousness, and Un∣godliness and Oppression, and Cruelty; whether may not you thereby destroy your Cause, and lose it, and provoke the Lord to Anger against you, and your Cause, to confound you and destroy you? and whether you do seriously consider of this? And is it not your Duty so to do? and ought you not to endeavour to stop this Flood of Wickedness that is broken out, which if it be not stopped, may provoke God against you, to overthrow your proceedings? Quer. 7. What is the very End of Rule and Government outward in this World? And for what Cause did God at the first ordain it? whether upon this,
or not, really consider; Was it not that Evil-doers might be punished; and them that did Well might be praised? And was not the outward Law added because of Transgression, and to punish Transgressors; but for the preserving the Peace∣able and Meek who walked in the Law of God; and when the People had for∣gotten God, and his Law in their Hearts, and his Power that executed Judg∣ment and Mercy; Was it not then that the Law outward was added, and com∣mitted into the Hands of Men to execute upon such as regarded not the Law of God in their Hearts? And is not this the very End of Rule and Government and Magistracy, at this very day? Whether ought it to be extended further than only over and concerning the Affairs of the outward Man, to keep that in good order, not to be a Load, and Burden, and Vexation, and Bondage upon a Na∣tion and People; but to suppress that which would load, and burden, and op∣press the Creation and People, that all men may be preserved in their just Right, and not vex and oppress one anothers Persons and Estates? And if your Govern∣ment be not from this Ground and this very end, shall it ever be blessed and happy, either to the Governours or Governed? Quer. 8. What do you believe of, and concerning LIBERTY of CON∣SCIENCE, in all Matters appertaining to the Kingdom of God? Whether ought not you to give the LIBERTY in your Government, that every Man and all sorts of People may believe in God, and Worship God according as he or they shall suppose, and be perswaded in his or their Consciences; provided still, that he and they annoy not, or oppress his or their Neigh∣bours Person or Estate? for if he or they do that, then he and they go out of the true Faith, and breaks the Law of God; and the outward Law is to take hold of him and them: But whether it is not a just Right, and may justly be allowed from you, to all the People of this Nation, to live under what Ministry, and under what Worship, and to go to what Assemblies, as they shall suppose, or be perswaded in their Consciences is the best and rightest? And whether or no it be not GOD's proper Right alone to be Ruler and Lord over mens Consciences, and that he alone should Prescribe, Instruct, and Teach Faith, Worship, and Duty in all things, in the matters of his own King∣dom? And whether God hath committed that Power and Authority, ever since the days of Christ, to any Emperor, King, or other Ruler whatsoever, to be Lord, and to exercise Lord-ship in and over Mens Consciences in the Matters appertaining to God's Kingdom? And whether it is not God's only and alone peculiar Priviledge to be Lord there; and not any Man to impose one upon another in Spiritual Matters? And whether you your selves would be imposed upon in such case? (that is) Whether you would have such a Church Government and Ministry, imposed upon you, upon such or such a Penalty, which you know, or believe, or suppose is not right, nor according to God, nor suiting with your own Consciences? And then how can you with good Conscience in the sight of God, Impose upon others, whenas your selves would not be Imposed upon in such a Case? Quer. 9. Whether or no, If that you cause any to suffer Loss, or to be Afflicted in Person or Estate, for and because of their Conscience-sake (that is) be∣cause they are of such a Faith, and of such a Worship, and of such a Principle in Religious Matters, though different from others and from you; yet if they walk Honestly, and Soberly, and Peaceably as Men, and not Plotting and Contri∣ving any Mischief in the Nation: I say, if you cause any such to suffer upon that account, while you can charge nothing against them, but Matters of Faith and Iudgment, and Opinion in Spiritual things: Again, I say, Whether or no such Suffering is not absolute Persecution, (and Innocent on his or their part that so suffereth any Injustice, Cruelty, Tyranny, and Oppression) on your part that do Inflict? and will not the Lord require it of you, if you bring Innocent blood, and Cruel Sufferings upon your selves? And is not that Innocent blood which is spilt, and Unjust and Cruel Sufferings which are Inflicted upon a Man
or a People, for his and their Conscience, and Religions-sake, when no matter of wrong or evil dealing amongst Men, and in that Relation, is or can be charged upon them? And whether do you not believe, that God will avenge such a Suffering, which is for Conscience-sake, upon the Heads of the Cursers and Inflictors of it in his Day and Season? Quer. 10. Whether or no you have not so much Reason and Conscience in you, as will give you to discern, and cause you to put a difference between such, who have acted and been zealous against you, from corrupt Principles of Self-seeking, and have raised themselves into worldly Honour, and great Estates through your Sufferings and Losses, and have lorded it over you in Ambition; though now such may bow under you, and fawn upon you? I say, Whether will you not, or whether ought you not, to put a difference both in respect of guiltiness in your Cause of Suffering, and in respect of your dealing towards them in Reward, and between such as have formerly acted against you, upon sober reasonable Prin∣ciples, and have not raised themselves to Honour and great Riches, not by your Afflictions, but ceased to act against you, when they perceived the Wickedness, and Injustice, and evil Proceedings of your Enemies? (and many such there are) and whether or no you have not so much Reason and Equity in your Consciences, as to put a difference between such in your proceedings towards them? Quer. 11. What is the truest Honour that can be given to the King, and his Government; and wherein, and in what kind of Words, and Actions, and Practises doth true Honour consist? And whether or no you do believe in your Consciences, that these kind of Practises, as drinking Healths and Bonfires, and this exceeding Lewdness, and Wickedness brought forth in the Nation, by way of Rejoycing for the King, and his Government, be true Honour, and rightly honourable Proceedings, and Practises, to him and his Govern∣ment? Or whether these things and ways be not wofully dishonourable unto you and him, and this whole Nation; and the Cause wherefore the Wrath of God may justly come upon the whole Nation it self, if these things be not speedily repented of, and forsaken? And whether the Life and Practise, and Subjection of an upright QUAKER (so called) whose Principle is to obey all just Commands, and patiently to suffer under all that which is unjust, and that lives in Meekness, and Fear, and Soberness, and Love towards all Men; whether or no such Men, and such Practises, are not more Honourable, and Blessed in the sight of God and Men, than this kind of Rudeness and Wickedness, Sing∣ing, and Drunkenness, Ringing, and Swearing, and hanging Ribbins and Feathers about themselves, and their Horses, and many other things which are said to be done in honour to the King and his Government? But whether there be not a Principle in your Consciences, which doth rather condemn your selves, than justifie you for these things, and rather justifies a Sober Life; and is not that more blessed? Quer. 12. Whether or no all that cry you up, and your Government, do it really, and out of good Conscience, and from Principles of Sincerity? Or whether they are turned to you in Feignedness, and Hypocrisie, and to save their Heads and Estates, which some of them have gotten, even such as have been your Enemies, and Preached, and Prayed, and Fought against you, and now cry you up, and pray for you; but whether can you trust that these will be faithful to you, that thus deny their former Ways, and Religion, and Worship? And whether thus to deny their Principles, their Faith, their Re∣ligion, their former Oaths, and Engagements, is commendable, and Justifiable in the sight of God and you? Or whether a Quaker (so called) that will stand to his Principles, and not deny his Faith, nor Religion, though he suffer for it, nor will bow and bend in Hypocrisie under every sort of Men, is not more justifiable and condemnable in the sight of God and your Consciences also? I say, do not they condemn these Hypocrites, that have fought against you, and
prayed against you, and yet bow under you with deceitful Hearts, in the time of their danger? Quer. 13. Whether or no you do not believe, and know in your Consciences, that the QUAKERS (so called) are a Sober Innocent, and Harmless Peo∣ple, and of an upright Conversation; dealing justly towards all, and such as do not Envy the Persons of any, nor Plot and Project Mischief towards you or any? And whether if you should proceed to persecute, and seek to destroy such a People, concerning whom you have such a witness in your Consciences, Iustify∣ing them as aforesaid, would not be greatly unjust in the Sight of God, and the very Cause, to provoke God to destroy you, and your proceeding, if so be that you persecute them for their Conscience-sake, while they live Soberly and Up∣rightly as men, and injureth no mans Person or Estate by their Religion? Quer. 14. Whether or no you do not believe or may not have just Cause to believe, that your present Proceedings are not, and may not prove to be the very natural Cause of Outward, Visible, external Judgements upon you and the Nati∣on, even Iudgments of Pestilence and Famine? And do not you proceed in the very path hereof? Is not your spending the Creation in such Excessive manner, in Eating and Drinking, and wasting the good Creation after this manner as you do; Whether is not this a natural Cause to bring want and Poverty, and also oppressing your very bodies with Excessiveness in Drunkenness, Inflaming your selves through Excessiveness of Wine and Beer, and through the abounding of uncleanness, and through excesse; and as well Defiling, and Oppressing your very Persons, as wasting the Creation by so doing; Whether this is not a very Na∣tural Cause to bring and beget Pestilence and Famine (besides your provoking the Lord through this means) as being works in themselves hateful and abomi∣nable in his sight, and for which Cause he may justly bring Wrath and Judge∣ments, even Plague and Famine, if there were no other Cause for it? And whe∣ther you ought not seriously to Consider of this thing, and to Turn from these Transgressions, which are Natural Causes of great Judgements, and also pro∣vokes the Lord to hasten and inflict Judgement: Oh that the Sober minded among you would lay this to heart. Consider these Queries in the Spirit of Soberness, for they are worth your re∣garding, and be not high-minded, nor wicked in your way, least the Lord who hath all Power in his hand meet you, and bring you down, and destroy your Cause, which he can do if you provoke him.

TO THE Friends of Christ IN LONDON. DEarly Beloved, and much Respected in the Lord, who are of the Election before the World began, in everlasting Love do I often remember you, and your Remembrance is Pretious and Pleasant to me, even because the Lord hath chosen you, and called you into his marvellous Light, and formed you a People for himself, to shew forth his Praise; and herein I do behold you very often; for I have seen you as a few pleasant Plants, in a great Forest of fruitless Trees; and I have seen you as a speckled Bird among the Birds of the Wilderness, and even as a choice Virgin are you among Har∣lots in that great City, even as a few righteous Persons, whom the Lords re∣gardeth, amongst a Multitude of thousands of ungodly Men; thus have I seen you, and thus doth the Spirit bring you into my remembrance, with earnest desires to the Lord God for you, that you may be preserved through all Times and Seasons, and over all this World, that you may be alwayes unto the Lord as a pleasent Garden, bringing forth Fruits of Acceptation unto him, wherein his Soul may be delighted. Now dear Friends live in the Seed of God, and walk in the Faith which over∣cometh the World, and feel your Election in Christ Jesus, and grow up into it daily, that you may have the Seal of Assurance, of Mercy and Peace, and Favour with the Lord God: and wait that you may receive the Promise of the Father, even of the same eternal Life, the same Spirit, the same Power of the same heavenly Vertue into your Vessels, as was in Christ Jesus, in whom dwelt the fulness of all things, and in us the Fulness is manifest by measure; and this is the everlasting Comforter, that will abide with you for ever, even the Appearance of Christ Jesus in Spirit (God with us) and the knowledge of him, as he was before Abraham: and this Life Immortal born in us, and this Knowledge revealed to us is everlasting, and remains for ever, and if ye be gathered up into this, to know him, and to be in him that was in the beginning, then are you builded upon the Rock, and the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against you, neither can the Flood of Death break in upon you. And Friends, walk in the Love of the Lord God, of which you have tasted in a good Measure, and in the Meek and Peaceable Spirit of the Lamb be at Peace, and in Unity with him, and one with another, even as Members of one spiritual Body, that the Head may be honoured through you, and that each Member serve one another in Love, and Respect, not any exalted above what ought to be, nor striving for prehemenence above one another, but that each Member may know his Service, into which the Lord hath called you; for that is a blessed Thing to dwell in Love and Unity, and to know, and to be known to one another in the Lord; and the contrary bringeth the Curse, where Strife and Enmity lodgeth, that is excluded out of the Body, and is of the
Kingdom of Death, and not of the Lamb, but is of the Body of Antichrist; and not of his Body who is exalted at God's right Hand. And see that you walk in all Wisdom, wait that you may be wise; and that Wisdom it self may be justified of you by walking therein, and then you will answer the divine Principle of Equity in your Enemies, and you will cut off that which seeks' occasion against you, and turn backward the slanderous Tongue, and confound the Destroyer which seeks occasion every moment; Oh how pre∣tious is Wisdom, its a Pearl, its better then Strength or Riches, Wisdom is the chief of the Gifts of God, it comes from the Fountain, and it leads answerable unto him who is the Giver thereof; Oh wait for Wisdom, that she may possess your Hearts, that she may go in and out before you, and may be the beginning and end of all your works, and so shall your Enemies have no occasion against you, but you shall be preserved in perfect Peace; for Wisdom is a preserver of Soul and Body, even that Wisdom that is from above, which is pure and peaceable, and leadeth into all the Ways of Peace, Truth and Righteousness; and take heed that none be led aside into Snares, and Temptations of the Wicked, and thereby make shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience, and the whole Work of God, and so lose your Joy and Peace in God, and come short of an Immortal Crown, to which you are be∣gotten; but be faithful to God in all things, and deny not your Principle, nor the perswasion of God's Spirit in your Consciences in any thing, neither for the Love nor Terror of this World; for that is honourable to be faith∣ful to a heavenly Principle, even whether in death or life, to be found walk∣ing answerable unto the Will and Mind of God, as you have received the knowledge thereof: but if any turn aside in the day of Tryal; the Lord will have no pleasure in them, but his displeasure will be against them unto their Destruction; and such shall not be reckoned among the Righteous, but they are blotted out of the Book of Life, even such who are Hearers, and not Do∣ers of the Will of God, whose Hypocrisie the Lord will judge in the justness of his Judgments. And live in Patience in all Tribulations, and in a still and quiet Spirit; for the Lord is there, his Presence is enjoyed in a still and patient spirit; and such receive of his Mercies, even of his hidden Manna: and heed not the Tribu∣lations that are in this World, but mind your Peace that is in Christ, that is everlasting, and be settled in your minds, and fully perswaded to follow the Lamb wheresoever he goes, whether in Death, or Life; and let nothing se∣parate you from that Love of God which you have received; not Powers of Darkness, neither Love nor Terror of this World; but keep in the Dominion of God, that his Spirit may be lifted up in you as the Standard, even when floods of Temptations and Persecutions ariseth against you, which are but for a moment, and they will pass away, but Truth and Righteousness will re∣main, and cannot be shaked; and the Purpose of the Lord is Good unto us, and not Evil, not to destroy us, nor suffer us to perish; for we are his, and he hath chosen us, and he hath placed his Name with us; and for his Name sake which we bear, he will do great things for us; he will visit his Heritage, and defend it with his mighty Power: and therefore be in Patience concerning all things whatsoever that cometh to pass. And the Lord having brought us out of Egypt, and often appeared unto us in great Love and Favour, and his Eye is over us at this day, and he hath not thus far delivered us now, to destroy us, if we live and walk in the Power of the Lord God, and feel his Life and Vertue, and heavenly Authority in our own Hearts; the Lord will not suffer our Enemies to prevail against us, so as ut∣terly to extinguish us from off the Earth, though some of us may be tryed far, if not to seal our Testmony with Blood; but if so, it shall hasten the Glory of the Lord, and cause it to shine forth abundantly, and it will fill up the
Measure of Iniquity, to the utter destruction of Antichrist; and for this cause our Lives are not pretious unto us, nor do I desire further to give Testi∣mony by words, if the Testimony of our Blood be required; for I know, though power may be given them over the outward Man, yet we have a Life which they cannot touch, and a Peace and Victory in the spiritual King∣dom which no man can spoil us of; and we are given up already, whe∣ther to glorifie God in the Body, or out of the Body, so he is glorified we have our reward; for, what is our reward, but this, That we may see the Name of the Lord exalted, and but that our Confidence is sure, and our Faith and Patience stedfast, that we shall behold the Glory of the Lord, and his Kingdom, and the overthrow of Sathan, and Antichrist, the Beast and the false Prophet, our dayes would be sorrowful, and our Life a Death, and our Labour and Travels a Vexation and a Grief? but our Faith is con∣firmed by many Witnesses, that the Kingdoms of the World must become the Kingdoms of Christ, and Mystery Babylon must fall, in whom the Soul of the Righteous hath been slain; and the Purpose of the Lord must cer∣tainly be effected, and no man upon the Earth shall prevent it: and this is our Faith, and therefore our Travels, Labours, and Affliction are not grie∣vous to us, even because the Presence of the Lord is with us. And as for me the Salutation of my dearest love is to all the Saints every∣where, even with that love wherewith I am beloved of the Father, do I love all them that are begotten of him; but unto you more especially my love is aboun∣ding, amongst whom I am known in faithful Labour of the Gospel of Christ, who never sought yours, but you; and I hope you have the Witness of me in your own hearts, even as I have of you, and that in the Immortal Life, I am known to you, where I desire only to be known of you; and though I have been as weak amongst you, and in fear and trembling, yet the Lord hath been strong and mighty in his Spirit; and though I have been as poor, and lowly before you, yet the Lord hath filled me and you with his Riches, and given victory and authority, even in your presence; though many times I have laboured in Tryals, and under great Burdens amongst you, and in much, opposition by many potent Enemies, that have appeared against the Lord; yet, the Lord hath carried above all, and given dominion over them through his eternal Spirit, and of these things you are Witnesses. Oh when I remember the dayes past, and how the pretious presence of the Lord hath been with us, and amongst us, while I was with you, as I hope it is at this day, and will alwayes be continued: I say, the remembrance hereof, even of the goodness of the Lord filleth my Heart with holy Praises, and the same I desire for you, that the Love of the Father, and his Presence, which hath been, is, and shall be, may be alwayes fresh in your remembrance, that you may be comforted for evermore: And at this present, I know no∣thing but that the Lord in his Presence, and Love, and Life, is more large and precious then ever, and he hath opened his Fountain, and we receive of his fulness more abundantly; he hath made us strong, and we are rich in him even at this day to give our witness for his Name, and against Anti∣christ, and all the powers of Darkness, in as much Boldness, Plainness, and Faithfulness as ever; yea, it is in our Hearts to be as diligent and valiant in the Work of the Lord, and to publish his Name, and to pro∣claim the destruction of Antichrist's false Church, false Ministry, and Wor∣ship, now more then ever. Oh, how are our Hearts filled with zeal to go on in this Work, we have no fear of man upon us, not of him that can but kill the Body, we are not afraid of the Storms, and Threats, and Per∣secution of the Ungodly; for we fear the God of Heaven, and him we reverence and worship in our Hearts, and not mortal Men, whose breath is in their Nostrils, and who are as Clay, and their Substance soon desol∣ved,
and what shall these do against us? they can effect nothing without the Lord, who is our Shepherd, that keeps us: and as for the Work of the Lord, we find it goes on, and is prosperous, and the Flock of God eve∣ry where is pleasant, and they grow in Knowledge, in Wisdom, in Faith, and in Patience, and the Power and Presence of the Lord is with us, as ever, and Truth keeps its Authority; and the Lord hath blessed it with a good Report, even to the confounding of our Enemies, to perceive the Con∣stancy and Boldness, and Faithfulness of the People, whose destruction hath long been threatned, and waited for; but we are yet alive, even in him who lives for ever: and we live, because he lives in us, and it is well with us, even because he is our saving Health, and we can speak of his Praise, be∣cause he speaks by us. Meetings are very large and precious every where in these Parts, because of the Presence of the Lord God, who is the Ful∣ness of all, and filleth all with his Mercy, Peace and Blessings; and that the same be continued unto you, even that you may be filled with the Ful∣ness of God, and ever comforted in him, is the desire of him, who is yours, as he is the Lords.

A TESTIMONY Concerning the BOOK of Common-Prayer, (So called.) Being an Answer to an Objection, Whether it be not in it self, and as practised in this Nation, heretofore, and at this present, the True Worship of the True and Living God? Answ. 1. THE Book of COMMON-PRAYER (so called) in its first Institution and Practise in this Nation, did not but differ little from POPERY, and the Men that were the Authors of it, and that constituted it into that Form and Method as now it is, were of much Zeal for their Form, and some Sincerity, and of more Tenderness and good Conscience towards God, in what they knew, then were they of the Church of Rome; who cryed out against them as Hereticks, and the like; and they had so much Light from God by his Spirit, as that they saw the Idolatry and Corruption of the Church of Rome, and did dissent from her, and denyed her Worships and Pra∣ctises in part, though they were because thereof persecuted; and the Lord stirred up their Hearts to bear Testimony against the Abomination of that time, as it was in both Church and State, (so called) and they sought after Reformation, and did in some part Reform this Nation, and did deny the Popish-Mass, and the Popes Su∣premacy, and many Idolatries, both in Doctrine and Discipline; and instead of the way and manner of Worship, as held forth by the Church of Rome, these Reformers set up the Common-Prayer, to be performed as the Worship of their Church, sup∣posing that to be more acceptable then the other, and no doubt but the first Institu∣tion and Practise thereof, was in much sincerity and zeal by many, and they were held under persecution, and suffered some of them even death or denying the Church of Rome, and her ways and worships; even them who did first ordain and compose the Common-Prayer, (so called) though yet there was much error in their Judgments, and darkness in their Understandings, and a vail of great Ignorance in many things upon them, even while it was brought forth, and these things ef∣fected, in the very beginning and proceedings of them. 2. And when it was formed, it being imposed on this Nation by force and pe∣nalty, and set up by compelling all people into the practise of it, by violent Laws upon the Bodies and Consciences of men; this was great Abomination in the sight of God, and made the practise of it detestable unto him; for it is contrary to God, in the dispensation of the Gospel, the way of forcing by compelling & constraint through outward Laws any kind or form of worship, though in it self never so ho∣ly, and like unto the true worship; yea, if the very things that the Apostles practised for worship, were imposed on any people by force, when as the Consciences of Men were not first perswaded thereunto by the Spirit of God, even this were Abomination unto God, and not the true worship of him; which is not of force, but of a willing mind, nor in the Ignorance of Mens minds, but in the Light risen in their Hearts; So that because of Imposing the practise of the Common-Prayer by force, it was hateful to God as so practised, and the performance of it, while it was so held
forth in this Nation, was no better then the Idolatrous Mass, nor no more accep∣table to God. 3. And as for the Matter in it self, partly, and divers practises thereunto per∣taining, it is not the true Worship of the True and Living God, though never so zealously practised; because it cannot be believed that the Authors and Composers of it, were moved, led, and guided, by the Holy Spirit of God, in their very Institu∣tion and forming of it; and whatsoever is brought forth, whether in Faith, or any practise in any kind of Profession and practises in any way of Religion, and not onely by the Spirit of God, is not the true Worship of God, which is only in Spi∣rit and Truth, and consists onely of such practises moved unto, and guided in by the Spirit; and the true Worship of God is not otherwise, neither for matter nor manner, but in what things, and after what manner, as the Spirit of God leadeth unto and guideth in, for the Father seeketh such to Worship him, as Worship in Spirit and Truth. 4. As for the Method and Form of the matter, it is not according to the example of the Holy Scriptures, nor agreeing to the practise of Worship, held forth by the Apostles, but different from, and partly contrary to the Spirit that was in the Saints, and their example of Worship, as in many circumstances, (pertaining to the orders of Common-Prayer-Book) might be instanced; but even some of the Practises themselves, and the manner of performing them, are for the most part Invention and Tradition, traduced into the World long since the Apostles days, and they are not according to the Scriptures, nor example of the Saints Worship in the Church of Christ in their days; and therefore the Matter in it self partly, and the Method of it, are not the true Worship of the Living God, which is not after the traditions of men, as the manner of performance of Common Prayer-Book is, when as the Worship of God is in and by the Spirit of God, as before witnessed. 5. And as for the Practice of it in this Nation, as by Imposition and force, up∣on pains & penalties, as it was practised for many years together, as so held forth, it was not the Worship of God, but Abomination to him, as I have shewed; and that Worship which is practised by any people, being forced upon them, is but Hypocrisie and deceit, and outward conformity in such Worshippers, and God requires it not of them; and such was the Worship in the Common-Prayer, (so called) for there were many who did bow, and conform thereunto, even because of the terror of men, even many in the Ignorance of their Consciences, and some against their Consciences, and contrary to the Light thereof; and some were persecuted because they could not conform, all which was Abomination in the sight of the Lord; even the consequence of the thing was as evil as any part of either matter or manner also; even while many conceited themselves in their Ignorance, that they had Worshipped God, and done well, while they had one∣ly performed such Worship forced upon them, and which the Lord never requi∣red at their hands; and that cannot be the true Worship of the true and Living God which can be performed by a People, without the Spirit of God, by which a∣lone, and without it, God cannot be Worshipped; and the practise of Worship after the order of Common-Prayer, did many thousands, (if not most) perform without the Spirit of God; whereby it fully appears, that in the practise of the Book of Com∣mon-Prayer, the Worshippers did not Worship the true and Living God, but walked only in a part of the Form of Godliness, but had not the Power. 6. But as for the Practise of it, as now in England, without Imposition upon all by force and penalty, but by some, out of supposition that it is the best way of wor∣ship, and that willingly, and neither forced upon them, nor they forcing it upon others; as thus practis'd is not so great Idolatry, nor of so bad effects as if it were vi∣olently forced upon all; but if any suppose it to be the best way of worship, and be so perswaded, such may more equally have their Liberty in the exercise thereof, while they allow Liberty to others to follow what worship as they are preswaded, and as it is unjust to impose by violence that, or any other Form of worship upon people, so it is unjust to impose penalty or punishments on the Bodies or Estates
of any for their conformity to the Book of Common-Prayer, or any other kind of Worship; for as it is contrary to God to compel by force to that Practise of Worship, so it is unjust to stop by force from that Way of Worship, or to inflict Penalties upon the Persons or Estates of any because thereof; for though many ex∣ceptions may be justly made by sound Arguments against that way of Worship in matter, manner, and effects, as I have said, yet none ought to be afflicted in Person or Estate, for the error of their minds, while their error extends not to destroy the Person and Estate of another; for all force by violence that hath been put on the Bodies and Estates of men, about Church-Worship, Ministry and Religion of any kind, hath been Antichristian, and not of God, even for many Generations. 7. And therefore them that read the Book of Common-Prayer, and all other sort of Worshippers, that are either perswaded by the Spirit of God, or suppose in their hearts of the Verity and Truth of their Way; let them all have their Liberty in their way of Worship without force, or restraint by outward Laws, while they im∣pose not one upon another violently; for the true Worshippers ought not to be persecuted for their Worship, but if they are, it will confirm them in the truth of their Way; & the false Worshippers ought not to suffer affliction of Persecution, nor loss of Estate, though they do err in their Minds and Judgments about Wor∣ship in spiritual things, but if they are afflicted, because thereof, it will harden them in their evil wayes, and not convert them, nor turn them from the evil of their wayes; for men are converted to the right way, and out of that which is evil by the Spirit of God, and through perswading of the Conscience inwardly, and not by force or violence put upon their Bodies or estates outwardly, never any were converted to God by such means. And this is my Answer to the Objection, and my judgment of the case inquired into: The Book of Common Prayer (so called) partly the Matter it self, and the Method of it, and the Manner of its perfor∣mance is not the true Worship of the True and Living God, no not the free Practise there of without Imposition, much less the Practise of it by Imposition and force, for that is altogether Abomination, and hath with it woful ef∣fects, upon whatsoever People it hath been, or shall hereafter be forced and vi∣olently Imposed. This is given forth for the Satisfaction of all that desires in this Matter. The 5th. Moneth, 1660. E. B. A Postscript. AND some set up the Institution of Calvin, or Form of Prayer, as these have now the Common-Prayer; and both the one and the other have cast off the POPES Form, and brought in their own; get into a Form of words, a For of worship without either Life or Power. The PAPISTS in some things that they begin to do, will say, In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; And the Pro∣testants, or them who call themselves of the reformed Church. that are come off from the Papists; some of them when they go about to do a thing will say, Our help is in the Name of the Lord, which made Heaven and Earth. Here both the one and the other have a Form of words, but out of the Name, the one as well as the other, out of the Life, out of the Power and Authority of our Lord Iesus Christ. Therefore what they do, how can it be done in his Name, which themselves are out of? Though they may be in the words, and do a thing in the words. But that is not a doing it in the Name; for to do things in so many words in their own Time and Will, that which themselves have brought in, is one thing; But to do it in the Name, Power and Authority of the Lord Iesus Christ is another; for words is not the Name nor the Power; and the Kingdom stands in the Power, not in words.
Therefore all people see what you do, that it be done in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the true Light of the World, who lighteth every man that cometh into the World; in his Light, in his Power, then that will bring you to cease from your own words, and following your own ways, doing it in his Power, in his Strength, out of your own words, your own ways, and your own wills, in his Name. For what hath form or words either one or the other hitherto produced or brought forth without Life or Power? Hath your long Profession and Forms of the words, brought any of you yet into the possession of the things? Or will it ever do? If not; What serves it to? Who hath required it, to have it done? And is it not his right alone who is to be worshipped, to direct himself how he will be worshipped? Or is not all other service and worship in the will? And so Will-worship, that is not of his own direction or appointment. And the Scripture saith, John chapter 4. as you may read, God is a Spirit, and he will be worshipped in the Spirit and in the Truth. (Mark that) He who is a Spirit, will be worshipped in the Spirit and in the Truth that which the Devil abode not in; for into a Form of words, Drunkards, Swear∣ers, Lyars, Prophane Persons, unrighteous, which are shut out of the Kingdom, may get into words, in such a worship, out of the Spirit; but that is not the worship which God requires; And is it not equal that he alone direct how he will be worshipped, that is to be worshipped? And thou art so to perform thy service towards him, that of him it may be accepted; and so it is rightly done, when done as he hath appointed it, as he hath directed. And Obedience is more than Sacrifice, whom thou art to obey, if thou wilt do him service who is worshipped or served in the Spirit and in the Truth; whose Will then comes to be done, and not thine, who will be so worshipped, and so served: But otherwise is it not thine own will, and not his that is done? Therefore whosoever will come to worship the KING, the LORD of HOSTS, must come to worship him in his own way; not in their ways, to bow down to his Light, to bow down to the measure of his Spirit in them; for the Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal; Otherwise, will not People, Teachers and Professors be always in the profitless condition, Ever learning, and never come to the know∣ledge of the Truth?

THe dear salutation of my life salutes you all, in the most pure and dearest love, with which I am beloved of the Father, and with which also at this present my Heart is filled, and issueth forth towards you, and the whole Body of the elected Ones; and the remembrance of you in the Lord is very precious unto me, as I see and behold, and have fellowship with you in the Immortal Life, which the Father hath begotten in you, and in me, and in which my knowledge is of you, and my unity with you, and therein only is the remembrance of my dearest love unto you, and in which I hope I am also known and remembred of you, even in the spiritual Relation and Heir∣ship of Immortality, being fellow Citizens of the heavenly Ierusalem, and Chil∣dren of her conception and bringing forth. Now my dearest Friends, seeing you have believed in the Light and Life of men, even in him that was, and is, and is to come, and have also tasted of that all Fulness that is in him, you have a Witness in your selves, even of the Spirit of the Father, which is greater then all, and you need no other Testimony, but that of the Spirit, That the Lord is good and full of Grace, Truth, Mercy, Peace, and Joy, even the Fountain and Treasure of all Vertue and Blessedness in this present time and hereafter; I say, If you have tasted and felt of Immortal Life, and if the Fountain hath been opened in you, and you have seen his Glory, and received of his Treasure, then the Evidence dwells in you of eternal blessed∣ness, and no man needs to teach you of these things, nor to say unto you, know the Lord, if you dwell in him and go no more forth; yet bear with me a little, that I may speak and be refreshed, not to diminish from what Testimony you have in you, but the rather to add towards it; for my witness is not another, but the same which ye enjoy, which is faithful and true; and this I say, Oh how great, how mighty and powerful is the Lord our God everlasting and infinite; he is that eter∣nal Spirit that filleth all, the Creator and beeing of all things that are, the life and vertue in all, and the invisible Substance greater then all, he is in himself the imme∣rable and infinite Fulness, the Fountain of Life, of Mercy and Righteousness and
Peace, and of all Vertue, and of every good Thing; who can declare his be∣ginning, or end? he is without Time, Place or thing, yet gives beeing to all, and is present in all, yet not known, saving of himself, and by his own Spi∣rit, yet he effecteth all things, and worketh whatsoever he will; who can utter his wonderous Works? Who can number his Mercies? Who can account his Infiniteness? who can behold his Invisibility? Who can reach his endless Beeing? He filleth Heaven and Earth, and of his Fulness every Creature in Heaven and Earth receiveth, and by him doth subsist, though it is only given unto Man-kinde, to behold, and perceive of him, it is only his Gift unto his Saints that fear him, to understand of his Wayes; and in us he hath opened of his Fulness and Treasure, even in our Hearts; and the divine Mystery of this Infinite God is revealed and discovered in the Hearts of the Sons of Men, whom he hath chosen: and he hath given us, to enjoy and possess in us a Measure of that fulness that is in himself, even a Measure of the same Love and ife, of the same Mercy and Power, and of the same divine Nature, and a Measure of the same heavenly quality and property, which is in him in all ful∣ness, dwelleth in us his Saints by measure, even in all that are born of him, in whom the Immortal Birth is brought forth, which is of his own nature, and is Immortal, Spiritual, Holy, Meek, Merciful, even as the Father; for the qua∣lity of him that hath begotten is in us that are begotten of him, we bear his Image, and are of the Father, Partakers of his Substance, Immortal and In∣finite, and are one with him in Nature and Fellowship, and perfect through him that dwells in us, and hath changed us into his likeness; these things ye know, if ye be born from above, and if the Immortal Birth live in you, and you be constant in the Faith, then are you Heirs through it, of the everlasting Inheritance of eternal Life, and already have received the Ear∣nest, and Assurance thereof and all are yours, because you are Christ's, and he is God's, and you have the Father and the Son. And this Life and Immortality is brought forth in us, and Infiniteness it self dwells with us, and eternity possesseth us, and Fulness it self is shed abroad n our Hearts, and we have the Treasure of Life, of Wisdom, of Knowledge, and of divine Fulness in our Tabernacles of Clay, which also are sanctified by his Word and Power, to be fit Habitations for the eternal God to dwell in; And oh what love is this with which we are beloved by him! Oh what Mercy is this of which we partake from him! Who are become the Sons of God, and Children of the most High, in whose earthen Vessels dwells Immortallity and Life, and Infinite Substance, being gathered into his Shep∣herds Fold of defence, where we have Immortal Food, and are established on the holy Mountain, where nothing can destroy, and are at rest and peace and under the shadow of the Rock of Ages, that Hell nor Death, nor wrath of Man can terrifie: Oh what Eye hath seen this, what Ear hath heard it, and what Heart hath perceived it, and not admired the loving-kindness of the Lord? who among you are Witnesses of this, that sayes not, great and In∣finite is the Lord, and Immeasurable in Mercy, and Truth, and Righteous∣ness? Oh, Friends, if you know these things, and if ye receive daily of this Fulness, and if the Measure of that Immortal Life be risen in you, and hath raised up you with it self into its own fulness, which once was descended out of its own fulness of eternal Rest, and Strength, and was manifest in its Measure, in poverty and weakness in your Hearts, in the feeling of Afflicti∣ons and Wrath because of Sin, but it descended to suffer all, and to bear Trans∣gression, that you might be raised with it into its Life, and Glory, and Ful∣ness; and if this be finished and effected in you, Oh then how shall you not live to his Glory and Praise in your Generation, and in Love, and Peace, and Unity with himsel, and one with another, and magnifie him in Soul and Spirit that hath called you, and chosen you, and now works all
your works in you and for you, and you live by him because he lives in you. But though it is thus that some are entred into the Rest, and have received of his fulness, and have the Testimony of Life and Assurance in the Father, and are risen with Christ, yet are you and we, and all the Children of the Father, so set and placed in this Creation, as that there is an Enemy to be ruled over, and also a service to be fulfilled by us for the Lord that hath chosen us, and therefore watchfulness and faithfulness is required from us; and unto this I can∣not but exhort you all, even to walk in the Fear of the Lord, in watchfulness and faithfulness, in Humility and Meekness, in Truth and Justice, and in every good thing, and that you fulfill the Will of the Lord in all things, whatsoever the Motions of his own Life draws you unto, that every Member of his Infinite Body, which is highly exalted at his right Hand, may be preserved in dominion over Sin and Death, and also may shew forth the Honour, and Glory, and Praise of him who is the Head (even Christ) whose vertue hath an ointed every Member, and is shed abroad through the whole Body: I say Friends, of every Member is required the duty and service thereunto partaining, according as it is placed of him, that the Treasure of Life may shew forth its vertue in one man∣ner or another through you all, in all well-doing, to the glory of him who is God above all; and that in the sight of your Enemies (whom you know watches for evil, and would rejoyce in any occasion against you, that they might speak evil of the Lord because of you) you may walk without offence in the answer of a good Conscience; and if you walk as such as are the Lord's, you will cut off all occasions from them that seek it, and they will be confounded, and you preserved in the blessedness and peace everlasting; and you will grow in Im∣mortallity, and into the knowledge and fulness thereof, more and more, till you know the Father, even as you are known of him. And be not unmindful of the Word of the Lord, which begat you, which first entred into your Hearts, and wrought mightily in you, to the wounding and destroying of Death and Enmity; and remember the Travel of the dayes past, and the Indignation which once you felt because of Sin, through the Word of God, and the Word endures for ever, of which you are begotten; and if any appearance of Iniquity, or motion thereunto arise in you, into desire to be fulfilled, the Word will quench it, and give you dominion over Sin and Death, and save you from the effects thereof; for the Word changes not, but is the same alwayes; but if man change and pervert his Way into Ini∣quity, it reproves and corrects, and so delivers him; for this Word keeps clean the Heart, and it sanctifies, and also keeps in subjection the mortal man with all his thoughts, desires and actions, and destroyes the Man of Sin, the sinful Man, by whom the whole Creation hath been corrupted, and perverted into evel, in its practise of degenerate man: and if you forget the Word, then Iniquity prevails again, and the love of this World, and its vanities, and the Riches and Pleasures of the mortal man steals away the Heart, and they possess the Habitation of God unrighteously, and all things are become sinful, and the Body of Death comes over the pure Life, and Peace with God in the Con∣science is lost, and that because the Word of God is forgotten, which once begat unto God; and where the unclean spirit enters again, the latter end of such is worse then the beginning, more finful against God, and more hated of him; and therefore let none follow the way of such, for it leads to Death and Darkness, and Misery will be the end of it. But Friends, mind him and feel his Power, who is the Preserver of Men in Peace and Righteousness; and let not up that part in you into liberty, into which Satan enters, and sows his seed of degeneration, but live in the Cross of Christ, and in the meek and lowly Spirit, tha you may not do your own wills, but the Will of the Father, and may fear him and his Goodness, and that subjecteth the ground of Temptations, that Sin can∣not prevail; so shall your Peace be everlasting, and your Life as a River
of pleasure, and Joy and Gladness shall be your daily Portion, and the Lord shall never forsake you, but be unto you a Tower of Strength, and Habitation of Peace, and a Crown of Victory and Reward in this present time, and for ever. And if ye abide in Christ the Vine, into which you are planted by Regene∣ration, then will your Fruit be of the Vine, and acceptable unto the Father, who is the good Husbandman, and through his Vertue you will grow into Per∣fection, as partaining to the Conscience, where all guilt of sin is taken away, and the burden of Iniquity and body of Death clean removed away from you; for that is Perfection as partaining to the Conscience, where Sin and Trans∣gression is done away, and Power received over it, both in Motion, and Action, and the Guilt of it, and the Conscience sprinkled with the Immortal Blood of the Lamb, and no stain nor guilt remaining, but Peace altogether by the holy Spirit in the Conscience; and this is perfection which was not at∣tained to by outward things in the first Covenant, but is witnessed in the se∣cond, which the Lord hath made with us, and confirmed unto us, where Sin and Iniquity is blotted out, and Innocency and Immortallity lives and raigns; and such stand before the Throne of God without fault before him, and no guile in their Mouthes, and these sing the Song of the Lamb, and of the Redeem∣ed, where all sorrow is fled away; if so be that the burden and guilt of all Trans∣gresion be removed, then there is no cause of sorrow; and blessed are they that dwell here, and that are entred into the everlasting Rest, even into God; for he is the Rest of the Immortal Soul, and the Life of it; and if ye know these things, ye have satisfaction and comfort, which none know but they that have it; its the portion of the Redeemed, whose Father, Master, Ruler, Judge and King is the Lord God and the Lamb, and we are Subjects of that Kingdom, and free born of that City, the heavenly Ierusalem, and we are made free through the price of Immortal Blood, and then how can any of you, that are such serve this World and the Vanities of it, by any immoderate care, or desire, or exercise in earthly things; for this is the bondage of Egypt, but the Children are free from it, and are not entangled concerning the things of this World, but they are subjected under, and the Inheritance of a better Portion is their Crown and Substance, and Esau's portion is the Earth, he that hath no assurance in God: wherefore live above this World in the Seed of God, and be without immoderate care in every thing, as to earthly matters, not taking thought what shall come, or be to morrow, neither cum∣bring your selves about uncertain riches, but leave the issue of all things to the Lord, in whose hands are Blessings and the Curse, to give, or take away, according to his pleasure: and be not Servants unto, but Rulers over all affecti∣ons in earthly things; for spiritual Blessings are the Crown, and the Earth is the foot-stool of the Lord's Redeemed. And as for the dayes and seasons in which we now are, let none be troubled, as though it were not well, or could be better; for all things are well that are come to pass, because the Will of the Lord hath effected them, either as the Cause, or as the Means, and it is good for us that these things are so; for the prosperity of our Kingdom is going on through all, the Hammer is beating upon the Rocks that will beat them to pieces, and the Axe is hewing down the Cedars, and the little Stone prevails against the many-headed Beast, and the Image of Idolatry is weakening, and the holy Seed grows in strength and vertue, and the Purpose of the Lord can none prevent; But the light of the Son must be as the light of seven days amangst us, and the Day-Spring from on high hath alrea∣dy visited us, and we have seen of his Glory; wherefore let all the Upright have Patience and Long-suffering, till the Measure of Iniquity in our Adversaries be filled, which is hastening to be accomplished, and Transgression grows full, and Sinners grow ripe for Vengeance; and we must pass over their Moun∣tain of Darkness, and in the mean time the Lord hides us under his shadow,
even  Transgression be finished, and covers us from the storm, and blinds the enemy, and turns his rage backward; and we are not destroyed, but our life is renewed, and righteousness, mercy and love are a defence about us; and how great is the kindness of the Lord herein, mine eye hath seen it, and my heart meditateth thereon; the power, and wisdom and love of the Lord herein are very great, and who can find out the depth thereof, or declare his immeasurable power and wisdom. And thus the salutation of my life unto all the faithful is expressed, and I am well in him who is my fulness, and desire no more concerning you, then your faithful∣ness in the cause of God; for without controversie the cause of God is with us, and on our part, and as you are faithful therein, that is my reward concerning you, and the addition to my joy; and in the Heavenly Spirit of the Lord God Almigh∣ty are you committed unto him, who is able to keep you, even to the end, and in the end, to glorifie you in eternal life in rest and peace for ever; and this is the porti∣on of the faithful, and my desires on your behalf, and my salutation of you, hoping that you have not so learned Christ as to deny him because of the love or terror of this World, but that over all you will be preserved in faith and victory. I am now according to the Will of the Father in Ireland, it is some weeks since I arived at Cork City in much peace and safety, with my dear Companions; it having been long upon my spirit to visit the Seed of God in this Nation, even of love have I felt it in me, and not of constraint, but of a willing mind, and free spirit, and not of force; and after the time of patience and waiting for many dayes to see my way clear for it, the Lord hath ordered it and brought it to pass acceptable unto me and many here; and this is the time which this visitation must be effected, for till now my way was not clear; and but that this Journey hath laid upon me I should have rejoyced to have been present among you, either in testimony, by suffering, or otherwise; but this is the will of God: and it is in my heart to pass through this Nation, and to visit the Seed of God by the Love and Word of the Father, as he gives of his Life and Strength, and opens the way before me. I perceive in this Land Friends are generally well, and truth grows in victo∣ry and dominion, and the Lord is adding to the numberless number of them that must stand on Mount Zion; and through the rage of men, and above it all, the little Flock is preserved in its beauty, and the Seed sown in weakness and afflictions is received and quickned in much power, which is my joy. About Bristol I continued about two moneths in much precious service for the Lord, and truth had good au∣thority over all, & great acceptation in the hearts of many, and some convinced, and others edified and confirmed, as many can witness in the spirit; and until af∣ter the time of the Fir I was not clear of that City, but imediately after I was free, and my way made very convenient and clear to this place; and the hand of providence ordered all things very well on that behalf, as I do hope, in the continuance of the power and presence of the Lord with me through this work; and in his power I am committed, even to do or suffer all things for his Name sake, and that by vertue of his own life that dwells in me; And the Lord preserve all the Brethren like-minded, that the work of the Lord may be fulfilled and fi∣nished by us. Amen. County of Cork the 21th of the 6th Moneth, 1660. E. B.
A PRESENTATION of Wholsome Informations, unto the King of England, &c. Being a Defence Pleaded, and also appealed unto Him; even to the Testimony of the Spirit of God in His own Conscience. In Answer to a certain Accusation, charged before Him, (in a Printed Book, called, The thrice happy Welcome of King Charles the Second, by one George Willington, of Bristol City) against Us, whom in derision, the Accuser calls Quakers. And also, herein are laid down divers Considerations (in Answer to a Pe∣tition directed to the King, by the same Author, in the Book aforesaid) con∣cerning Church-Government, and concerning the making and sending forth Ministers; and concerning the True Prophets and True Ministers, and the False; and how they are distinguished, in their Call, Maintenance, and Fra∣ctises: and that none ought to suffer death of Body, or be killed or spoiled in Person or Estate, though they may err in their mindes, in the knowledge and Judgment of spiritual things. All which is soberly presented to the King and His Council, for Them to consider. The Epistle to the King, and his Council. KNow ye, That it is Righteousness, Iustice, Mercy, and Truth, and the fear of the Lord God; it is the doing hereof, and the walking herein, in which you onely may be truly honourable: I say, if you do these things, if you fear the God of Heaven, and depart from all Iniquity; and if you be doers of Iustice and Mercy, and if ye break the yoke of cruel Oppressions, and let the op∣pressed go free, then are you worthy to be honoured, both in the sight of God and men: if so be that you are possessed with the nature (I mean with Righteousness, Iustice, Mercy and Truth) then you deserve the name, but not otherwise; for if Unrighteousness, Injustice and Falshood dwell with you, and be brought forth by you, then are you not honourable to God, neither can his servant in feigned∣ness and flattery give the name unto you; but and if I should give flattering titles unto you, I should provoke the Lord to wrath against me, though yet I gain∣ed your favour; but I have rather chosen to speak the truth from my heart in Righteousness, and to be well-pleasing unto the God of Heaven, then with flatter∣ing Lips, and a deceitfull Tongue, be a man-pleaser, while I grieve the Spirit
of the Lord: and the chief desire of my heart is to keep my conscience clear in all things, though I should gain the displeasure of you, and the most eminent accoun∣ted of men. And if you shall say, who art thou? I must answer, That I am a Servant of the great God of Heaven and Earth; him I fear, and before his presence I trem∣ble: I fear not him that can but kill the Body, I flatter not any by feigned words, for I regard not the love or hatred of this World; I have not learned to practise a flattering tongue, nor can I use it towards you, or any upon the Earth; but words of truth and righteousness are my delight, and the dialect of my native Countrey, and the characters thereof are not in the eloquency of words of mans wisdom, but to demonstrate by the Spirit of the Lord, in plainness and soberness, with more respect to please the Lord then to please men. Thus am I known among my Familiars, and thus I desire only to be known unto you, not in words only, but in substance; not in flattery, but in an upright heart. And this my present occasion thus to write unto you, is, even in as much as we have been accused, even to the King, by one George Willington of the City of Bristoll, in a Book of his directed to the King; even therefore is it, that I have taken in hand to answer and publish a defence against his Charge, with some sober Considerations, chiefly laid down and directed, even to the King, that he may consider them: and my hopes are, that he, and you of his Council will read and consider the Defence, as well as the Charge, against us; assuredly knowing, that it is good reason and equity for you so to do; and may prove also of good conse∣quence to you so to do; for if the King should receive mis-informations, and there∣upon proceed in Iudgement; Oh what pits and snares of danger did he run him∣self into, even to destroy himself! Now to the intent that he and you may be better informed in some particulars concerning us, about which we are charged and accu∣sed, and that you might know the truth, and may escape the way of Destruction and Confusion; therefore is it, that the Lord hath put it into my heart thus to write unto you, and not for another end, nor of my self have I done it; but as I found the drawings of that Spirit of the Father, which leadeth into all truth, to which I was made willing to be obedient, without respect to any thing, saving the Lord, and that you might be advised in some things in present controversie, occa∣sioned as aforesaid; and there are a few things towards you upon my spirit, which well deserves your consideration, as followeth: First, That there is an Eternal God, who is great and mighty, above all; and e alone ought to be the fear of you, and all man-kind: for whatsoever he will, it cometh to pass, whether in Heaven or Earth; he planteth and plucketh up, he buildeth and throweth down, he exalteth and abaseth, whether King∣doms, Governments, or Men, Kings or Princes, as he will, and what time soever, as he pleaseth; he is onely wise in Council, and mighty in Power; if he purpose, who shall prevent him? he is the Being of all things that are, and before him are all mankinde upon Earth, even ye your selves, as Dust and Ashes, and Vessel, of Clay; and your Breath is in your Nostrils, and he that gave it can sn take it away from you, and in a moment dissolve your seeming glorious sub∣stance into its first being. And this eternal God hath overturned and changed Powers and Authorities, Rulers and Governments in these Nations of late years, even to the amazement of the Inhabitants, who must confess, that the God of
Heaven hath pulled down and set up whom he would, and taken the Government from, and given it unto whom soever he hath pleased; and he hath given unto many a day and a time, to try them whether they would rule for him; and he tried one sort of men after another, to prove them, if they would exercise Righteousness and Truth, Iustice and Mercy, and right Iudgement in the Land: but when the Lord tryed them, they have all proved deceitful, and unfit men for the Lord to exalt his name by; but they have neglected Iustice and true Iudgment, and the cause of the Fatherless and the Widdow have they not regarded, as they ought to have done; but great oppressions and persecutions have abounded in their dayes, and they have forgotten the Lord and his Iudgements, and sought themselves and not the Lord, and been ambitious and self-ended; and they have exalted themselves in their Pride and Covetousness: and this hath been the path of ma∣ny that have sitten in the Throne, even till the God of Heaven hath been pro∣voked against them to confound them, and overturn them, even when their measure of oppression and unrighteousness, of Injustice and Persecution was ful∣filled; and when the measure of one was finished the Lord brought that down with shame, and another was set up to raign, till it had fulfilled its measure of that which went before it, that it might be brought down, even as the other: and all this the God of Heaven hath effected by his power, that all the Earth might take knowledge, that he can do whatsoever he will, and that he hateth and abhorreth Injustice and Oppression, Cruelty and Persecution, and that his Vengeance and Iudgements are extended forth against such Rulers and Govern∣ments; by whom, and in which, Persecution, Cruelty and Injustice are brought forth; and because hereof, hath he overturned and confounded Rulers and Govern∣ments; and these things have been visible in our eye. 2. Consider, that you are now set in the Throne, and are raised up out of your suffering condition, and you are become the Rulers and Potentates in our Nation, divers having been cast out before you; and unto you a day and time is given, to try you and prove you, what you will do, and whether you will rule and govern alone for the Lord, and answer the end wherefore the Lord hath re∣stored you; which if you do, and walk in the Fear of the Lord, and forsake your Iniquities, and do Iustice and Righteousness in the Earth; then the Lord make you happy, and a blessing in the Kingdoms: But, if so be ye walk in the wayes of Oppression; and just Iudgement, Mercy and Truth be wanted in the Land through you, and you run on as others before you, in Pride, Ambition, vain-glory and Covetousness, and have no respect to the God of Heaven, and his Heritage; then the God of Heaven shall reprove you, and deep confusion shall come upon you, and as with a whirle-wind shall you be overthrown, and you shall know that there is a God that can do whatsoever he will, even he shall deface your glory, and turn your Sun into Darkness, and your Day shall become a Night of Misery. Oh therefore say not in your Hearts, that our Mountain is strong, and we can never be moved; neither think in your selves, that your force is great, and your number many, and none shall be able to prevail against us; but rather consider that there is a secret and an eternal Hand, that can remove your Mountain, and overcome all your might and power, and subdue your Number, and turn all your Wisdom and Policy into Folly and Madness: These can his Hand do, even the God of Heaven, who is greater then all; if he
smite, none can heal you; and if he kill, none can make alive; if he be∣ your enemy to fight against you, there is none that can deliver you out of his : all flesh is as grass, that is soon cut down and withered, and the strength of  sons of men, are as a Reed, that is soon shaken and bruised. 3. Consider, how that you are placed in your present state, between good and , between doing the will of God and the will of the Devil; that ye should do the one, and forsake the other; and in the doing of the one or the other, de∣pendeth the Blessing or the Curse, the Love or the Hatred of the Almighty; and you are in your day that is given you to prove you; time is taken from others, and given to you, even by the Lord that gives and takes time and power according to his own pleasure; and no man hath assurance of time unto himself, but it cometh and goeth at the pleasure of the Almighty; and time nd power is now given unto you for a moment. Consider what the God of Heaven reires of you in this your day; and if you fulfill the will of the Lord, then you may be happy; but if otherwise, then other effects shall follow upon : and let not the King say in himself, that because I am the true , and to me onely it belongs to govern these Kingdoms, and I may gover as I will without correction; as though therefore he might rule according to his own pleasure, and the Lord take no notice: I say, let not this enter into any of your hearts; but let the King know assuredly, that these Islands, and all the Kingdoms in the World, are altogether at the Lords disposure, to give the govern∣mt thereof to whomsoever he will; he giveth and taketh away Power and Domi∣nion according to his pleasure; and it is his proper right to rule over all, even the God of Heaven; and he it is that pulleth down and setteth up, according to his own mind; and if you please not the Lord, but vex him in your proceedings, you must know, that the Lord can take from you the Dominion, and give it to whom he will; and there is no injustice in him thus to do, but of right he doth it, because it is his pleasure so to do, with whom there is no Iniquity nor Unrighte∣osness. Therefore let it enter into your hearts, to Fear the God of Heaven; assuredly knowing, that it is he alone who hath secretly purposed and effected this your re∣ing into the Throne; and he hath given you this day, and put this season into your hand, that ye should do his will: But if ye provoke him, he alone can cast you down, and take your day and season from you, and none can hinder; and this justly, and none can reprove him. 4. As concerning the men that were cast out before you, whose persons, many of them, are now under your power; be not passionate, nor of a spirit of Revenge ards them, neither seek their destruction; but be merciful, and patient, and meek towards them; for though it is the pleasure of God to reprove them by you, for their iniquities, yet it is contrary to his minde, that you should take away their lives, and cause them to be put to death: for there is a seed of God amongst at people; and when they come to true repentance, and to the forsaking of their quities, the Lord will shew mercy to them, and peradventure heal them of all their backslidings and afflictions too. Therefore shew Mercy and Moderation ards them, and cut them not off in their sins, lest that while you condemn them for being too cruel towards you in times past, ye condemn your selves in the sight of the Lord, and all people, in doing that to them (even in the same measure
of cruelty) for doing of which to you, you now condemn them; and so thereby bring the same guilt upon your selves which lies upon them; but therefore show Mo∣deration and Meekness towards them, and leave vengeance to the Lord, to whom it belongs; if they be worthy of it, it shall come upon them. It is true, they have been active against you, and it's probable they were raised up of God, as a judgement and reproof upon you, because of your iniquities, which were many and great against God; and the God of Heaven had a just Cause against you, and impro∣ved them in it, as instruments to reprove you; and they had once a just cause against Oppressions, and the Lord blessed them in it, and gave them many Victories, and wrought great Deliverances for them; even when they were both fewer in number, weaker in strength, and less in policy and craft, even then oft-times did God appear for them, and gave them Victories, and defeate their Enemies; and you your selves must confess to this, That the Provi∣dence of War was clearly on their side, which I call the hand of the Lord; and consider what a sad thing it would be on your part, and how contrary to God, to cause them now to suffer, when you have opportunity against them, for that which was effected by them, when the Lord was with them: you ought not to cause them to suffer on that account; but if you do, you will provoke the Lord against you, if that you destroy them, and take away their lives, because they were once prosperous against you; even through the Hand of the Lord, do I say, and through the Providence and good Fortune of War, needs must you acknowledge. Now its acknowledged, that they quite forsook the just cause, and forgat the Lord and his mercies and deliverances, and became corrupted and abomina∣ble before him, and insulted over their enemies in the spirit of ambition, and began to set up the same things which once they had cried against in others; and this was their Transgression and abomination; and in their corruption and forsaking the Lord, they became fully guilty of the same abominations of others before them, and the Lord became provok'd against them, to re∣prove them, and correct them, and afflict them, even because of their trans∣gressions, who, as I have said, did forget the Lord, and walked in the same Path themselves, which they reproved others for; and the same abomi∣nations were set up by them, which they once pulled down in others; and this was their Hypocrisie, in whom was found a deceitful heart, which led them aside into treachery, false-heartedness, covetousness and vain-glory; and because of these their iniquities, hath the Lord bowed them down un∣der you, and smitten them before you, even because they were not faithful to the end, and not because they were faithful at all; no, not because they were active against Oppressions at all; but because they became guilty of the same abominations, and set up that in themselves, which once they moved against in others; and because hereof, hath the Lord reproved them, and that just∣ly, that they might learn his righteous Iudgements, and be humbled under his hand, and that all the Earth may know, if Men forsake Him; he will give them up to the will of their Enemies: though he may bless a man or a people, while they fear his Name; yet if they sin against him, he can turn blessings into a Curse; and now they that were once exalted, are abased and brought down; and you that were once low, are now exalted:
and if you become corrupted, and provoke the Lord through wickedness in this day of your Exaltation, and if they become humbled, and repent of their Transgressions, through their afflictions in this day of their sufferings, then the God of Heaven can and may suddenly by his secret hand, bring you down, and y you low, and raise them up, and exalt them, and bow down your strength and might under others; these things can the Lord effect according to his pleasure; he exalteth and abaseth whom he will, he setteth up and pulleth down, according as men reverence him, or regard him not: They that honour him, he honoureth; but they that dishonour him by unrighteousness, he bringeth such to shame. O therefore, ye Men, consider how dreadful the Lord is, and take his counsel, lest ye perish. 5. Concerning Liberty of Conscience in the faith and worship towards God, you ought to be considerate, and to take the counsel of God, lest you run upon the same Rock, upon which many have been broken before you (to ) limitting the Spirit of the Lord, and of such whose Consciences have been tender, and binding them to or from, by force or violence, any such  such way of Worship, and Profession of Faith, and exercise in Reli∣gion: if you do thus; and will not allow clearly and freely Liberty of Conscience, but will by force and violence limit the Spirit of the Lord, and tender Consciences; this shall be a Snare upon you, and a Rock o of∣fence against you, to break you to Pieces: for in so doing, the God of Heaven will be displeased with you, as with others, if so be that you take upon you to prescribe the Lord a way how he must be worshipped; and will take upon you to rule and judge in the cases of Conscience, and in the mat∣ters of Christ's spiritual Kingdom, which appertains to Christ alone, to be Iudge of, and Ruler in, and not man; and to him alone you ought to give the whole Rule and Government in all the matters of his own King∣dom; and that he may prescribe and teach Worship, and Faith, and Duty to himself, in all spiritual things: and this I claim of you, on his behalf, even that you give unto him the whole Rule and Authority, in all the mat∣ters of his own Kingdom; and that you allow Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Faith and Worship to all Christian people in these Nations; and that no man be compelled or forced to or from, by outward violence, any kinde of profession of Faith, or practises of worship; for it is of Anti∣christ so to do: if that you impose any Srt of Worship and Religion con∣trary to mens Consciences, upon penalties on mens Persons or Estates; if you do thus, you exercise not the Power of Christ but of Autichrist and it is depriving of Christ of his Heirship, and of the Government of his own Kingdom, which will be reckoned against you as a fearful abomination, if you lk therein. And therefore let men believe in Christ, and Worship him, according as they are perswaded in their own Consciences; for a tender Conscience in the Sight of God, is a thing greatly regarded of him; and if you limit it, and do violence upon it, the Lord will be provoked against you, and these Nations will not bear it; but it will beget fiery contentions in the mindes of men, if any Religion and Worship contrary to their Consciences be im∣posed
upon them; and while some men are gratified, others will be displea∣sed: and if you allow not free Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of spiri∣tual things, the effect of it may prove sad and Miserable to your selves and your Government: and this shall you know in time to come, even the good effect of Toleration in Liberty of Conscience, and of woful effect upon the contrary. Therefore be wise and instructed, ye Rulers of the Earth, and kiss the Son, lest ye perish out of the way of Peace and Happiness. Now you have your day and time to be made happy, or to be left mise∣rable, that your Government may be blessed; or otherwise, deprived of all Bles∣sedness. These things have I Written to You, in Love and Honour to∣wards You, That Ye may know and be informed what the Lord requireth of You, if so be You may escape the Wrath that is to come: And love, nor Wrath to You; Your prosperi∣ty, nor overthrow, is determined upon You, or prophesied unto You by me; but as You walk in Justice, Truth, and Righte∣ousness; or as You walk contrary, and bring forth Oppression and Persecution. Bristol City, the 4th day of the sixth Moneth, 1660. Edward Burroughs.
A PRESENTATION of Wholsome Informations, unto the King of England, &c. THe Servants of the Lord, and his People, that feared his Name, and trembled at his Word, never wanted false Accusers in any Age, to re∣pute them vile, and to reproach them by slanderous words; and that even to the Rulers of the World, and to the Kings of the Earth, have the chosen People of the Lord been falsly accused and reproached by the slande∣rous Tongues of ungodly Men in all Generations, as in many Particulars might be proved out of the Scriptures, by the Example of things in the dayes of old; For even in those dayes it came to pass, that the Elect People were reproached and falsly reputed by the men of the World; as in the Case of the Iews, in their building of the Temple again, when they returned out of the Captivity: How were the People of God at that day accused and reproached? and that by the wise men of that Kingdom, even unto the King Ahasuerus, Ezra 4. 15, 16. That good City of Ierusalem, the Habitation and Dwelling of the Iews (and then, only named People of God) was accused of being a bad rebellious City, and hurtful to Kings, and that the People moved Sedi∣tion therein, to the danger of the Revenue of Kings, &c. And Neh. 4. 2. the People of God were scorned, and reproached, and called feeble Iews, who builded the House of God; and it was said in derision of them, that a Fox should go up, and break down their Wall. And also, how were the holy Prophets and Servants of God rejected, reproached and accused, even to the Princes and Rulers of the Earth, in Generations past, as Daniel to the King! how was he accused? Dan. 6. 13. and the three Children were accused to the King, Dan. 3. 8. and the Apostles were reproached under the slander of being mo∣vers of Sedition, and such-like, Acts. 24. 5. being many times accused and haled before Felix, Agrippa, and divers others of the Rulers of the Heathen: and it was told the Apostles, by Christ, That all manner of evil should be spoken against them, for his Name sake. And throughout the whole Scriptures, there is very large Testimony, how that in Ages past, the Servants and People of God were accused and falsly reproached before Rulers and Kings, by their Enemies, that sought their destruction. The truth of this is so clear and full, that it needs no further Testimony. And as it was in this case, in the days of old, so is it happened in this day; who more now accused and falsly reproached, then the Innocent People of God? Is not all evil spoken against them, and that even to Rulers, and Go∣verners, and Kings? And this is done by their Enemies, that seek to destroy them, even by such as would not have the Work of the Lord to prosper, and his People to be preserved; and on this account, the cry is great against us every where, as if we were Hereticks, Blasphemers, Seditious, and Enemies to Magistracy and Government, to Church and Ministry, and such like. And these, with such like have been, and are the Accusations against us, whereby we are reproached falsly before men: and this hath been our portion
in this World, since we were a People, by the Men of this Generation; and the very same is come to pass upon us in this case, as was upon the People of God in former Generations; and as it was done unto them, so it is done unto us; and therefore we are in Patience under all our Afflictions and Suffer∣ings, whether we are persecuted by Actions or Words; and for the Name of Christ, and his sake, we bear all things, having Prophesie and Example before us, of the same things that came to pass between the Men of this World, and the People and Saints of the Most High. And for as much as one that subscribes himself George Willington of Bristol City, hath publickly appeared in Print, even in the Work aforesaid, with his Accusations and Reproaches against the People of God, whom he in scorn calls Quakers, in his Book called, The thrice Welcome of King CHARLES the Second, &c. Because of which his Accusations, are the very present Occa∣sion of this my present Work; and that his Accusations may be turned back∣ward, and the minds of Men, even of King Charles, may be better informed; for he hath accused us to the King, and being we are somewhat concerned in this matter, being thus reproached, and that to the King, who hath yet little knowledge of us and our Principles; therefore it is upon me to give reasonable Answers to that Part of his Book, wherein we are concerned and accused, lest that the King, to his own hurt, should receive such Accusations for Truth, when as they are otherwise, and so be induced to proceed upon Reports, if the Charge should not be answered. And first, I shall affirm, and prove it in its season, That this same Man (whose Accusations I am now going to answer) hath proceeded in the same spirit of all the false Accusers beforementioned, and he hath lifted up his voyce in con∣tempt of the Lord's People, and hath rendered an evil Report of the Lord's Elect: and though we forgive our Enemies, him, and such as he; yet will the Lord plead with, and give unto them according to their Deeds; and we only may reprove them, and leave Vengeance to the LORD our GOD, unto whom it belongs. Now though we are, and have been thus proceeded against ever since we were a People, even falsly reproached, and all manner of evil spoken against us fo the Name of Christ, by them whose Hearts are filled with Fury and Rage against us; yet we are known in our integrity unto the Lord, who hath pla∣ced his Nme with us; and we know one another in Faithfulness, and Truth, and Righteousness, and I hope we have a Witness in many Consciences, even of our Enemies, and also of many in Bristol, that as to our Doctrines, Practises and Conversations, they are according to the Truth, and answer∣able to the Scriptures, and justifiable even of the Witness of God, in all sober-minded People, even of them that have not yet joyned themselves to us; and we are known to that in many, even to the Witness of God in their Consciences; to which in all, we daily commend our selves in Doctrine, Practise, and Conversation, that thereby onely we may be known and ap∣proved: and we praise not our selves, neither do we boast of what we are, sving in the Lord; yet from time to time, we do, and can make our Ap∣peal in the sight of God, to the just Principle of Him in all Men, and even to the King, before whom we now stand accused by this our Enemy, do I make this desire, (though yet we are in a great measure Strangers to him, in Doctrine, Practises, and Conversation) that he may in all Cases of this, and other Matters, shew Moderation, and the Spirit of Meekness, and may first try all things, and then he may judge the more justly; for we are not afraid to be tryed before him, and all the World, in any Matter of Doctrine, or in any Part of our Religion; and we should judge it great∣ly honourable in the King to hear our Answers, as well as our Enemies Accusa∣tions; and to the Witness of God in him, we can appeal for determination in
any matter that is, or may hereafter come in controversie before him, concern∣ing us. And it is most certain, that the proceedings of George Willington in this case of his accusing us to the King, is not in love to Us, nor to the King and his Government, but altogether contrary, as upon divers found Reasons I might emonstrate, (and may in its season;) and his present work against us, is from old in-bred Enmity and Malice against us, who would have us destroyed, if it were in his Power; for he hath formerly manifested himself in writing Re∣proaches and Slanders against us, which were sufficiently answered, and here∣proved, and refuted to his great shame, among all sober People; to which he ne∣ver yet replied, as being too Ignorant and too weak ever to clear himself from what is charged against him in the Answer given to his former Book; but now, as I have said, out of, and from that bitter, old, long-seated Enmity, and de∣vouring Malice, he hath again appeared in Print against us, supposing him∣self to have so excellent opertunity more then ever before, to have his devou∣ring mind satisfied of us; and therefore hath he in haste presented the King with a Welcome, partly of Reproaches and Accusations against the People of God, but his Heart hath deceived him in this case; for we shall live and not die; God will preserve us, and no man shall destroy us. Now it had been a Welcome of love far more to the King, to have sought his Mercy and Meekness towards all, at his first enterance into the Government; and the rather to have stirred him up thereunto, then to seek to provoke him to ri∣gour and wrath against any to destroy them; as this Welcome of Go. Willinton's tends unto; which is not true love to the King, but rather a preparing a Net for to entangle him, and to lay stumbling Blocks of Iniquity before the Feet of the King, that he might be destroyed, and fall, and never rise. And let the King consider this, for if he be provoked by any means to dstroy, or seek to overthrow the Innocent People of God, that same shall be a Net to en∣tangle him to destruction, and a stumbling Block to fall upon, and be ever∣lastingly broken. So that hereby the Welcome of Geo. Willington doth appear to be, not of love, but of ignorant hatred to the King; and indeed, it is such, especially that part of it now under hand) that it deserves reproof more then acceptation, even from the King, if he rightly consider the ground and end of the Author in his Accusations against us; notwithstanding his seeming fawning and Flatteries, by which he appears to be some Pick-thank, or some News-teller, or rather Tale-carrier, for some hope of Promotion or Reward: But I wish better to the King, then that he receive or accept of the false Informations of this Author, (our Accuser) or of any such like, lest that he ensnare himself, and be taken, and stumble and fall, in recei∣ving mis-Informations instead of Truth; and thereupon proceed in judge∣ment, or censure unjustly, which is a way to destroy himself: Let him take heed to himself, I desire better for him, and that he may shut his Ear against evil Informations, and may never have his Heart opened to the sheding of Blood, or to persecute any for their Conscience, and the exercise thereof towards God. And now I come to the Accusation it self; which is this in substance: That the Quakers are Enemies unto, and have sought to root out the true Protestant Religion: The words are these, calling upon the King to honour the Lord; which (saith he) is done by establishing and preserving the true Pro∣testant Religion; which of late years, hath been in great danger to be rooted out by Anabaptists, Quakers, and Atheists, page 6. line 1, 2, 3. of his Book. Answ. In answer to this, divers things are considerable, as to the manner of his Charge against us. That this Accuser hath proceeded in the same manner, and by the
same spirit as the Iews, Scribes and Piss, and chief Priest proceeded against Christ Jesus; for they numbred him with Transgressors, as it is written, and crucified him between two Thieves, that they might add to his Afflictions, and bring him under the greater reproach to Ages after: and thus this Accu hath done, in numbring the Innocent People of God, called Quakers, with, and among Transgressors; even that he may the more add to their Reproach, and have his Accusation heard before the King; even that it might be received for truth, as if the Quakers were no better then Atheists, that deny God; for, for this end this Accuser, in these Terms vilified us, and made us equal in this account to the Atheists; and thus numbered us with Transgressors and Sinners, and that unto the King; and for this end, no doubt, that we might be destroyed and cut off, and crucified with such as deny the Lord God. Oh how unjustly and unmercifully hath this our Accuser proceeded in thus dealing towards us, let the King and all People consider! 2. As for such as are Atheists, who deny there is a God, or who deny the true God that is, and who live after the desires of their own lusts, saying, Let us eat and drink for to morrow we must die; and there is no pleasure in the Grave, nor state of happiness or misery after this Life: such we do deny, and have no Affinity, Amity, Union nor Fellowship with them, nor they with us; and this is well known through the whole Nation, and fully believed in Bristol, and I am perswaded, in the very Conscience of this our Accuser, he knows we are not such as deny God, nor have any fellowship with such; therefore how hai∣nous is this man's Crime, both to God and Men, who hath abused the whole Nation with his Slanders, and endeavoured to mis-use the King's Ears with false Informations, and hath perverted his own Conscience in speaking contra∣ry to it, and hath vexed the Lord by his Lyes; and all in this his numbring of us in Accusation with the Atheists, as if we were one with them, and no better then they? 3. As for the Anabaptists (so called) the other Party with whom we are ac∣counted, and numbred in the Accuser's charge: It is well known what differ∣ence there is between us and them, and how that we have been opposite one to the other in Controversie about spiritual things; and also in matters of Judge∣ment about Government, and fighting with carnal Weapons, &c. and they have dealt sometime with us, and proceeded towards us too hardly and maliciously, as some of themselves know, in accusing us to the Powers of the Nation, as this man hath done. But I shall at this time say no farther of them then this; There may be a sincerity and uprightness amongst them, in many of them, more then is in this our Accuser, though there is no small measure of Error in Judge∣ment in them, as concerning many Doctrines and Practises held by them; and its not my work now to accuse them, neither to reward them evil for their evil; but only on this occasion I am forced to clear the truth, for the better information of all: and I do wish well to them, and even that they may confess to the justness of God's Judgment in what hath befallen them in this the day of their reproof; who have been too ambitious, and hard-hearted towards others that have not been of their Way and Sect; and now the Lord deals justly with them, in bowing them under others, and in defacing their glory, which was of man, and not of God. But to the case in hand I return, and say, How unrighteous still doth appear the manner of this our Adversary's Charge! for whatsoever the Anabaptists, or any others may hold, or do (though I at this time) shall neither justifie, nor yet condemn all what they profess and practise) cannot we be charged guilty of, except it first be lawfully proved that we hol and practise the same things. And as for us who are scornfully called Quakers, (which Title was given unto us of derision and nick-naming) I cannot in this place say much of us, lest I should be said to justifie our selves, which I seek not to do, because it is the Lord that justifies us; neither do I love much to be heard in our own Cause,
when it is onely our own; nor do I seek praise of men for us, nor of men to be ed: yet this I may say on Gods account, and in his cause, and not of our ; we are the people of the Lord, whom he hath called, and chosen, and ; and though hated of men, yet it is for the Lords sake, and not for any  amongst men that can be chaged upon us: And we are Worshippers of  ue God in spirit and in truth; and we are of God; and they that are of , are not against us, but with us: and as for any Doctrine or Practise in  Religion, held forth by us, they are according to the Scriptures of Truth.  I assert, and can prove, if need require, in opposition to any that shall y it: for we are not of a new Religion, as if we worshipped strange godds, though by the ignorance of men we are so reputed; but are of the same Spirit,  in the same way of truth; and we walk in the same light and life even as t Apostles and Churches of Jesus Christ were of, and walked in, in the days  old; and this I am ready to make proof of, if so it come to pass, even be∣ the King, and the whole Nation; and do further declare. That whatsoe∣ Church-Government, Ministry, Doctrine and Ordinances, Faith and ship, and whatsoever Religion in whomsoever, that is not according to the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, but differing from▪ and corary to, that Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures; I do for my self, and on the behalf of all them that are one with me utterly renounce and y, and freely give witness against, notwithstanding upon whatsoever foundation, such Church-Government, Ministry, Doctrine, Faith and Worship be builded; if not upon Jesus Christ as the alone Foundation, and according to the Scriptures, and proveable thereby, they are Antichristian, and the Lord will confound them. The truth of these things being proved, and rightly considered by the King,  all others, no just occasion will be found for this our Adversaries Charge, nor  place can rightly be found in the heart of the King for the reception of the tion, but may upon just tryal condemn both Accuser and Accusati∣ I mean, not destroy the man, but reprove the Accuser and his lyes er. And now I shall proceed to the Accusation it self, and shall lay open the folly  norance of the matter of his Accusation, as well as I have done the wicked∣  the manner of it. the true Protestant Religion hath been in danger to be rooted out by the Quakers,  This is the Charge it self. sw. If by true Protestant Religion, the Accuser mean true Christan Reli∣ then I deny his Accusation utterly; and do charge him to be a Slander∣ Lyer, and False Accuser: and must desire of the King, that such a   taken notice of, who hath abused and dishonoured him, and that very  in presenting him with Lyes and Falshoods for Welcomes, which is in∣ les then disgrace to both the Person and Office of a King. What a  tending so much to Love and Loyalty, and so much rejoycing on his be∣ nd as if he were one of his choice Subjects, and gave such reverence and  to him, and attempted so high, as to be the Kings Informer and Instructer,  to be found a Presenter of Falshoods and Slanders against as good Sub∣  the Nation as himself? O how abominable is this both to God and the  and the whole Kingdom, that these things should be, much more that  should pass unreproved! for we are of the true Christian Religion, as be∣  have said, even in the same way, and of the same Spirit as were the holy  and for that Religion we stand, to do and suffer all things for that cause,  for the true Christian Religions sake. But if this our Accuser by Protestant Religion, mean the Sects of Luthe∣ r of the Sect of Calvinists (so called) or whomsoever else, which, I do  heartily that I had the full intent of his mind, of whom he means by the
true Protestants; for his words admit of divers acceptations, and so a sound Answer can hardly be given, while I do answer onely what I suppose to be his meaning by true Protestant Religion: for there are divers sorts of Protestants; Lutherans, Calvinists, and many others, which are all Protestants, and have protested against the Pope, each one sort of them saying, They are the true Christians, and true Protestants; yet are very much divided among themselves, even to the killing and persecuting one of another: so that, which sort this man means, and who of them are of the true Protestant Religion which we would root out, &c. this is doubtful: I would I knew his meaning, that I might give him a true Answer and sound; for we may deny and oppose Protestant Religion, or some part of it; that is, some Sects, or divers sorts that have protested against the Church of Rome, and yet be no Transgressors in the sight of God, not many men: for divers of the Protestants themselves are denying others of the Protestants, and their Religion; and it is my belief in this case, that some have deserted the Pope and the Papists Religion upon bad grounds, and have taken up a Religion as bad and no better then Popery: not that I justifie Popry in all things, but have a large Witness to give against it and men ought to protest against it; yet I say, some called Protestants in their Religion, are as corrupt as any of the Church of Rome: so on some account, I may as law∣fully deny Protestant Religion, (or some sort of them that do profess it, as the Church of Rome; for it is as corrupted; (some part of it) and no more acceptable to God, in the Profession and Practise of it. This is spoken in general of it, because his Accusation is general. Now if I had his full in∣tent, whether he means Lutherans or Calvinists, or what others, if not them, that are of the true Protestant Religion that we would root out, then I should insist upon that particular sort, and give my exception against them; for I have many things to object, at least, and some things wholly to except against in the Protestant Religion, or some sort of it; not that I condemn or judge every individual man of the Protestant Religion: for I believe there are many that are sincere and zealous towards GOD, though with some Er∣ror in Judgement; yet as to the Form of Worship, and Constitution of Church and Ministry, and Ordinances in the Protestant Religion, it is much, if not wholly differing and contrary to the Church, Ministry, Worship and Ordinances of the Apostles and true Christians in their dayes: and more then this I now may not say; a more full Answer I cannot give to this Charge, except, that, I did know what sort of Protestant he intended; which if I did, I should utter my mind more large as to the Matter, according as the Spirit of God gave me utterance. And now that I have spoken of the manner and also of the matter of his Charge, I shall hint partly of the end and purpose of his thus accusing as to the King: His end, intent and purpose of his thus charging us, must needs be, and it will appear to be out of Malice, Wrath and Enmity, for to incense and move the Heart of the King against us, to destroy us, as I have before mentioned: And in answer to this, some things most especially are considerable to the King and all his Friends. 1. If he should upon the Report of this Man, or any others, let his Heart be moved into Rigour and Enmity against us, and thereby seek, intend, or work Evil against us, to destroy us, he did but fill the Land with Violence, Cruelty and Persecution, and Innocent Blood, and fill his Government with Oppression and Tyranny, and provoke the God of Heaven against him to destroy him, and overthrow his Kingdom, and Power, and Government: and this would doubt∣less be the effect of receiving such a Mans Counsel, and of his so proceeding, if that he seek to pluck up what the Lord hath planted: and if he dip hi Hand in innocent suffering of God's People unjustly, and if he reach forth his Hand to touch God's Anointed, and hurt the Peaceable in his Land, th shall the Lord take him from his Authority, and give his Dominion to ano∣ther
more worthy then he: And this is for him to consider in the coolness of his . 2. f he did proceed to do any thing against us, or be moved in his heart unto, barely upon the report of this, or such other men, without hear∣ing Face to Face, and lawful tryal in the matter, and hearing our Answer and fence, as well as our enemies Charge against us; then all the Nations of the World might condemn him; and every sober Subject would cry in their Con∣sciences against him, for unjust judgement, and cruel proceedings; if he, up∣ report of others, through prejudice should act against any people; and the Heathen King Agrippa would rise up in judgement against him, who would not demn Paul from the Accusation of others, without first hearing the Accused imself: and a Christian King ought to shew as much Mercy, Justice and Reason in what he doth, as the Heathen Kings have done in the like case. And let the King consider this. 3. Let him also consider what Enmity, and Malice, and Rage, is in the hearts of these men, these Priests I mean, of whose Fraternity and Alliance this our Accuser is one, and how they seek after innocent blood, who are thus ready and ard at his first enterance into the Land, to present the King with Accusations of Falshood and Reproaches against an innocent people, to move his heart, if possible, to destroy and devour the harmless: The spirit and nature of these men are to be considered, whose works are often tending to shed blood; but if he shall be guided and counselled by such, they will lead him into the ditch: for they are of the spirit of Envy and Mischief, and Mischief rests with them, even against all who will not bow under their Authority, and submit unto their false Wor∣ips. And let the King beware of that Generation of men, lest they be a snare pon him, and wound him. And I shall now proceed to some other things in his Book, to that where he aith, He doth upon his bended Knees most bumbly beseech the King, and the Honoura∣ble Parliament, that they will, first, Cut off false Prophets, Hereticks, and perverse and incorrigible Seducers and phemers; for these are the Pst (saith he) of both Church and State, . Answ. I answer to this: Many things are considerable to the King and Parli∣ent, and whole Kingdom. 1. It is to be considered who these false Prophets, Hereticks, Seducers and phemers are, which the Petitioner would have cut off, and destroyed: m his meaning is of, is doubtful; for that there are false Prophets, He∣, Seducers and Blasphemers in these Nations, and that very many; is is not doubtful, but certainly believed and known: but what sort of men,  perfectly who these are, distinguished from all others, this requireth  debate, and large tryal; especially seeing that each sect and sort of ople cries against others, as if they were such and such; and this is usual with sts, Protestants, and others, to cry for their own Liberty and Toleration, a such who are in the right way; and each one sort almost desiring and petiti∣ the Powers of the Earth against others that are not of their way, to de∣ and cut off such as differ from them, as Hereticks and Deceivers: but such it that seeks to destroy menslives on that account, is of Antichrist, and   God. 2. And if false Prophets, Hereticks, Seducers, and Blasphemers, were cer∣ known, and distinguished from others that are not so; yet the King  liament ought not to destroy such, and to cut them off from the Earth,  lling of them, or executing outward punishments and afflictions upon ; for God hath not committed such power and authority to them; nei∣er to be Judges infallibly, who are false Prophets, Hereticks and Blasphe∣; or yet to execute death and outward sufferings upon such as are: for
these are spiritual matters and Causes, to try and judge who deceivers are, and to proceed towards Hereticks and Blasphemers; and these Cases belong to the Jurisdiction of Christs Spiritual Kingdom, and not to any earthly King and Rulers at this day. 4. And if King and Parliament were able to judge of false Prophets and las∣phemers, and who they are that are such, from others that are not; yet how contrary to the way of God would it be, even to the example of Christ and his Apostles, to destroy and cut off by death the lives of such false Prophets and Blasphemers? for if men be in an evil way, even in the way of Heresie, and Error, and Blasphemy, and be deceived, and deceivers of others, yet it is not a time to destroy and kill such, like as if such should be sent straight to Hell, being cut off in their wickedness and in their Error. This is not God's way, I say; for he desires not the death of sinners, not to cut men off in their Errors and evil wayes; but its rather the time to instruct and exhort such, and to correct and reprove them by sound Doctrine, and to win them to the Truth, and out, of their errors, that they may be saved; and this Christ and his Apostles gave example for; for there were many in their dayes that were false Prophets, and Hereticks, Seducers and Blasphemers, and that were perverse and incorrigible, that did Blaspheme against Christ, and called him Devil, and that did oppose the Gospel, and scorned the Apostles; and such were Blas∣phemers and Hereticks: but did Christ and his Apostles at all desire that such might be killed, and cut off by death? Nay: they forgave their Enemies, and did instruct them by sound Doctrine, and sought, to win their Perse∣cutors, and not to have them killed, as this Petitioner would, whose Spirit is manifest to be of Antichrist, and the Dragon, and not of the Lamb: and if the request were granted, and the lives of such as this Petitioner calls false Prophets cut off, then the King and Parliament would rather provoke the Lord against themselves to destroy them, then to give unto themselves blessings and peace. 5. But they being ignorant who the Deceivers and Blasphemers are, and not being equal and just Judges in that case, but also divided among themselves about it; and it being not committed of God to them, to destroy by death of body such as may err in their minds, by killing such whom they may suppose false Prophets; and they wanting infallible judgement to know who are false Prophets; how soon may they destroy and cut off the lives of true Prophets, and Christ's Ministers, and men that Fear God, instead of false Prophets and Blasphemers, even for want of true judgement and discern∣ing, and because of their own division in judgement in that case? for is possible that some of the Parliament may judge such to be Deceivers, whom others of them may judge to be true Ministers; and whose judgement then shall stand? and also, thus it hath often come to pass in the World, the true Prophets, and Christ himself, and the holy Apostles and Ministers of Christ, were accounted Deceivers, Hereticks and Blasphemers, and such like, by th Kings and Rulers of the World in former Generations; and th true Pro∣phets, Christ and his Apostles, were persecuted as such, and destroyed as such, some of them, even by the Kings and Rulers of this World, till they  provoked God against them, to destroy them; and some of them he did bring wrath upon, because thereof. And how easie a thing it is for the present King and Parliament to walk in the same way, even to account the true Ministers  Jesus Christ and his People, through want of infallible knowledge, Hereticks, and Deceivers, and Blasphemers, and to destroy them on that account, while Deceivers may be accounted true Ministers by them, even till Gods displea breaks forth against them, to confound them? And this is worthy to be consi∣ed by them, against the evil counsel of wicked men, who would lay snar  their feet, and cast stumbling-blocks before them, that they may be taken and f, to their overthrow.
6. It is of the Devil, the Dragon, and Antichrist, all this killing and per∣ting of one Sect by nother about Religion, since th Apostles days: the ts and Witnesses have been slain, and all that would not worship the Beast e been killed by the Dragon, the Devil and false power, as may be read in the velations; and never any of the true Churches of Christ, nor any Mem∣er thereof, at any time, in, or since the dayes of Christ and his Apostles, did ever kill, or cut off by death, nor sought so to do, any false Prophet, He∣retick or Blasphemers; the true Christians never proceeded in that way, but forgave Enemies, and did win their Opposers by sound Doctrine and Conversation, or gave them up to Satan, and separated from them, but ne∣vr killed them; but it was the Antichrist, the Wolves in Sheep's cloathing that killed about Worship, even all that would not Worship: The Saints and Martyrs, their Blood was shed by the Beast, because they would not wor∣ship; and it was the Whore that hath drunk all this Blood of Prophets and ust Men, and not the true Church, who wars with spiritual Weapons, and ills Enmity, and Powers of Darkness; but kills not Persons, nor wars with arnal Weapons. 7. And if they should proceed to kill, and cut off by death such as are Hereticks and Deceivers, who err in their minds, how unjust would that be, to destroy the lives of Men for the error of their minds and judgements in spiritual things? And this the King and Parliament ought not to do; though false Prophets, Hereticks and Blasphemers must not escape unpunished, but ought to be proceeded against; yet not in and by the way of killing and destroying mens lives; for that is a Punishment not answerable to the Offence, and every Offence ought to have a Punishment just, equal and answerable to the Crime: and to punish the Body by death for the error of the mind in spiritual things, this is not equal, nor according to the Spirit of the Go∣spel; but if any shall be destroyed, in their Persons or Estates by Cruelty, for, or because they are in Error of Mind and Judgement in Matters Spiritual, or may be supposed so to be, it is no less then robbery and murder in the sight of God: And let the King consider this, and keep his Hands from shedding of Blood on that account, lest he provoke the Lord against him. And now I come to the second Branch of the Petition, where the Petitioner doth request in these words: (saith he) I most humbly beg your Grace, that the oly Sabbath of the Lord, the Christian Sabbath, may by your Majesties strict Com∣mand, be more religiously kept and observed then heretofore, &c. Answ. I answer to this: It is well worthy to be considered by the King. 1. That God did indeed command the People of the Iews to keep and observe the seventh day of the week for a Sabbath; and that they should not do any manner of work therein, they, their Servants nor their Cattle; but that day ould be kept holy unto the Lord by them; and to this the Prophets and Servants of God in the time of the first Covenant, did instruct and exhort, upon the Penalty of God's Displeasure against that People of the Iews, if they neglected to keep the seventh day of the week Sabbath; and upon many the Lord did execute Judgement because thereof, onely upon the People of the Iws; for to them onely was commanded the observing the seventh day of the week as a Sabbath, as a Sign between God and them. 2. That God never commanded the keeping of the seventh day of the week  a Sabbath to the Gentiles, nor to any Nation or People, saving onely the Pople of the Iews, of which people we are not (this Nation I mean) ac∣cording to the Flesh, after the Generation of Men: we are not of the Iews  of the Gentiles; and therefore the seventh day of the week was never com∣manded of God to this Nation to keep as a Sabbath; neither can we be con∣mned or judged of the Lord, though we keep it not, because it was never com∣manded
of God unto us, nor to any of the Gentils, nor to any but to the People of the Iews, as I have said; and it was but a sign to them; and Christ fulfilled all shaddows, and was the end of the Law, and the finishing of the Sabbath dayes, and in him that Type was ended. 3. That the observing of the first day of the week for a Sabbath; which hath been done in this Nation for many Ages, is onely by Tradition, and not from any Command of God, nor binding Example of the Apostles, that we read of: it is not of Commandment from God or Christ Jesus. The first day of the week hath been observed as a Christian Sabbath but from Tradition, and original Ordination of the Church of Rome, as them∣selvs do confess; and the Protestants have taken it up from them, though it is acknowledged that the Scripture saith, The Saints and Churches of Christians in the Apostles dayes did meet together on the first day of the week; for they that witnessed Christ come, did deny Temple-Worship, and first Priesthood, and Circumcision, and Synagogues, and Sabbath-dayes, which were a shaddow, Col. 2. 16, 17. and its said. They came together on the first day of the week; but that this Practise of theirs is a Command to us at this day, or binding Example to any Christians, that all must keep the first day of the week as a Sabbath by force, and upon such or such Pains, Forfeitures and Penalties; this I have not learned, neither from God, nor out of the Scriptures; but it is doubtful to many, even whether the God of Heaven requireth it now of Christians and Believers, the keeping of any one day of the week as a Sabbath of rest from all Labour, and to observe that day for Worship; and to others it is doubtful, if a day the Lord requireth, then which day, whether seventh day, or first day of the week,? And concerning these Cases, there is present Controversie in the minds of many men. 4. That to force and compel upon any Nation by violent Laws and Edicts, the observing any one day as Sabbath upon such and such Penalties, and that onely upon the ground of Tradition and long Custom, while the Scriptures in that case are silent, and fully determines not; this is not acceptable unto God, nor of any reward by him, either to him or them that forces and com∣pels the keeping of a day; nor in that Nation, or from that People that so keep it by the Custom of time, or the Commands of Men, when as their Consci∣ences are not perswaded by the Spirit of God in that case, by which way the God of Heaven is onely rightly worshipped; and the forcing of observing dayes and things either against pure Conscience, or in the ignorance thereof, is but Abomination and Idolatry, both in the Imposers, and in the Imposed; and with such Sacrifices God is not well pleased. And this is for the King to consider, whose greatest wisdom it will be, and most pleasing to God in him, neither to compel and impose by Rigour the keeping of a day, or observing of Practises as partaining to the Worp of God and Religion; nor yet to punish or persecute any for the keeping any day, or for observing such or such a Practise in Religion; but let every Man do in such Cases, even in matters of Faith and Worship towards God, and about Religion, as they are perswaded in their own Hearts and Consci∣ences, without either imposing upon them, or persecuting of them in any thing about Religion: and let him onely rule and govern in the Cases between man and, man and over men in the exercise of earthly Things; but between God and Mens Consciences, let him take heed how he meddles; for there he ought not to rule nor judge, but to leave that to the Lord God, who alone is suffi∣cient in such things to perswade the Conscience, and to judge and rule by his Spirit in all the Matters of his own Kingdom, and about Religion, nd the Observances thereof; and this Trust and Power is onely in himself, to effect all this by his own Spirit, and is not committed to any Earthly King.
And how I come to the first Branch of his Petition; which is in these words: (saith he) I most humbly beg, That your Grace will uphold, cherish and fster a Learned and Pious Ministry in your Kingdoms, who are accounted vile, and laden with Reproaches, and such Ministers (saith he) whose Loyal Constancy and Integrity doth bespeak them to be; not time-serving Polititions to gtifie mans humours, and serve their own Interest; but Lux mundi, Sal terrae, &c. Answ. In answer to this, let the King wisely and soberly consider, 1. That God hath a faithful, pious and spiritual, learned and true Ministry, sent forth by Jesus Christ to convert people to God from sin and wicked∣ness, who are indeed God's Ambassadors and Watch-men for souls, and are Lux mundi, Sal terrae; the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth: this is most certain, and not denyed nor doubted of; but who it is, and whom the Persons are, of and amongst all the many kinds of Ministers and Sects that are now in being in the Nation, this is very doubtful to many, its possible to the King himself, seeing here are in this Nation divers sorts of Ministers; as Prelates and Presbyterians (so called) and divers other sorts; all of whom saying, they are the true Ministers, and they are the pious learned Ministry and that others are De∣ceivers that differ from them, and this is the cry of them all; each sort justifying themselves, and crying up their Ministry against others and their Ministry, and this all of them do with pretence of proving their Ministry by the Scriptures: But the Case remains still doubtful to many, who is it, and who is it not, that are the true Ministers, and have the true Ministry sent of Christ Jesus, seeing one sort as well as another do seem to justifie themselves according to the Scriptures, and yet are divided, and incontention among themselves, to be killing and destroy∣ing, and persecuting one of another, and each sort of others. 2. If the King without certain knowledge by the Infallible Spirit of God, who the true Ministers of Christ are, and who they are not, distinguished from all others by infallible Evidence; if he do establish and uphold any one sort as the true Ministers, and pull down and persecute others as false Ministers, and be but doubtful in his own Conscience who are the true Mi∣nisters, and who are the false; how great danger doth he run himself in∣to, even to justifie the Wicked, and condemn the Righteous, and possibly may establish and uphold a false Ministry instead of the true, and perse∣cute and destroy the true Ministry instead of the false? And this may he soon effect, for want of discerning and right judgement in the Case; and in so doing vex and displease the Lord God, and gain his Wrath and Fu∣ry upon him and his Government. Therefore it will be great wisdom for him to wait upon the Lord, for to receive his Spirit, that he may first dis∣cern and try between true and false Ministers and Ministry; and in the mean time allow Liberty to all alike in their Religion, while they walk justly and soberly as men, and are not hurtful to the Persons, or just Estates of others by their Religion. 3. If Liberty be given to one Sect, and one kind of Ministry, in oppo∣sition to others, and all other prohibited and persecuted; how would this rage and vex the spirits of many in the Nation against him and his Go∣vernment? and while he gained one sort of men on his part, and some Mi∣nisters to pray for him, he disengaged divers sorts; and many would seek God against him; and such proceedings would be both contrary to God, and of very bad effect in these Nations; for men would be provoked in their spi∣rits not to fear any dangers, rather then to be held in such captivity under the Ministry and Worship of such whom they in Conscience could not joyn with; and there is a woful Example in this Nation of the effect of such pro∣hibition and force: for was not that very matter (to wit) the establishing of one ort of Ministers, and persecuting others, one of the principle Cause of the last
bloody War? And may not the Nation fear the like now, if the same Ground be laid, and the Foundation raised, as before-mentioned? And therefore let this enter into the Heart of the King to consider very weightily. But the Petitioner seems to define to the King what Ministers he begs to be upheld and cherished, in these words; Such whose Loyal Constancy and Integrity do bespeak them to be, not time-serving Polititians, to gratifie mens humours, and serve their own sordid Interests; but Lux mundi, Sal terrae, &c. Answ. 1. They who are indeed the true Ministers of Jesus Christ, that are called truely of him into that work, and are God's Ambassadors, neither set this Petitioner a begging for them, nor can accept of this his work; for Christ's true Ministers are no Beggers, neither seek to be approved to Kings, nor any Men, by Flattery and Deceit, but are approved to be the Ministers of Christ, and sent of him, by Doctrine and Conversation, and through Faith and Patience; and thus, and after this manner, were the Apostles and Ministers of Jesus Christ approved in the dayes of old, even before Kings and Rulers, and others; and they did not beg for themselves, nor any for them, approbation to themselves and their Ministry before any: so that this Petitioner is not in the Spirit and Way as the Saints and Apostles were in, who is begging even by flattery, an Approbation of Ministers and Ministry, as he saith, on his bended Knees, that the Ministry may be upheld, maintained and established, and that the King would do it. 2. If none are to be upheld, and maintained and established but such as this Petitioner hath described, then not very many of the men of this Generation of Priests, because they come not under his own proposed Qualifications: For, alas! the King may say, or without offence to him, I hope I may say for him, Where shall we find such as are here described? shall he find one among many? o any at all of that Fraternity, that have not been disloyal, unconstant, and changable in their wayes? And have not they, as for the ge∣neral part of them, (I mean, of the Priests) turned every way, and cryed up, and prayed for this and the other, that would but give them Money and Means; and the very self same men sometime been for one Man and his Go∣vernment, and in a very little time been quite contrary to that, and so pro∣ved themselves absolute time-serving Polititians, to gratifi mens humours, and to serve their own sordid Interests? Doth not ten thousand in England know this? and may not the King himself easily believe it, and know it; especially when he considers who it was chiefly that first preached and prayed up the War against his Father, and who it was that made so many Flattering Addresses to Ol Cromwel, and then to his Son Richard, and then changed from that way of Go∣vernment, and then cryed up Commonwealth-way again, and now are turned to cry up him? By all which it doth appear, that no one sort of People in England are so disloyal and unconstant as that Generation of Teachers: and who can now put trust in such, that have thus served Times, and been Men-Pleasers, even for their own ends? And how shall the King ever, without great danger to himself, repose confidence in such as are so changeable? or how cn any man beg his upholding and establishing of them, without shame to himself; and that under the name and qualification of constant Men, and not-time-serving men for their own Interests, when as these very men called Ministers, for whom this man is now begging, are qualified quite contrary to his own description? And therefore the King hath reason enough to deny the request, because the general part of men petitioned for, are not Lux mundi, Sal terrae, but blind Leaders of the Blind, and changeable Hypocrites, and the Oppression of the Kingdom; nor are they all watch-Men for Souls, but many for Money and Hire, nor God's Ambassadors, but Antichrist's Ministers, who are out of the Spirit and Doctrine of Christ Jesus.
And now I shall proceed to the fourth Branch of his Petition, which is expres∣sed in these words; (saith he) I humbly beg your Grace, That ye would uphold a liberal and sufficient Maintenance for the learned Ministry, because Christ hath ordained, They that prach the Gospel should ve of the Gospel; not a Niggardly but Liberal and Sufficient Maintenance, that they y be encouraged, &c. Answ. As for ue Gospel-Ministers, they beg not Means nor Money of the Powers of the Earth, but are therein without care; only careful how to please the Lord, and to fulfil in Faithfulness their Calling: Nor did ever the Apostles seek for Maintenance that way; though its true, the false Prophets, in Ge∣nerations past, they could never have enough of Maintenance; but every one of them sought for his Gain from his Quarter, Isa. 56. 11. and the false Pro∣phets and Priests they Preached for Hire, and Divined for Money; and all that would not give them, and put into their Mouthes, they prepared War against them, Micah 3. 11. And the false Teachers of old, they taught for filthy re, and by feigned words made Merchandize of people, Tit. 1. 11. 2 Pet. 2. 3. such as walked in these practices in dayes past, were reputed and taken for De∣vers and false Teachers, but Christ's Ministers and the true Prophets, and Apostles never went in this Way; but trusted the Lord, that sent them, with re for all outward things; yea, some of them laboured with their hands, that by all  they might make the Gospel of Christ without charge. 2 But yet it is certain, a Maintenance to the True Ministers of the Gospel is allowed by Christ, and by his Apostles; but not by so much Money a Sermon,  Oe Hundred, Two Hundred, or Three Hundred Pound, or more or less, as they can bargain for, and get by the Year; nor the Tythes of mens Labour, and En∣crease for Preaching; nor any forced and imposed Maintenance whatsoever:  a way as this Christ never ordained that his Ministers should be maintained in the World; nor did the Apostles ever allow, institute or practice such a way of Maintenance in their Ministry: But this kind and way of Maintenance is al∣together Antichristian, and like to the false Prophets way beforementioned, and not at all according to the Scriptures, nor the Example of Christ's Gospel-Mi∣nisters in former Ages. 3. The Maintenance which Christ and his Apostles allowed Ministers, and that Way whereby Christ's Ministers were fed, and clothed, and maintained by out∣d Necessaries, was, Into whatsoever House that was worthy the Disciples entred, they  there abide, and eat such things as were set before them: For (said he) the kman is worthy of his Meat, and the Labourer is worthy of his Hire. And Paul said,  a small matter to reap Carnal things, where they had sown Spiritual things; and he  peheth the Gospel may live of the Gospel. And that was the way of the Apo∣ Maintenance, even by Free Gift, from them whom they had begotten  e Faith; and they that had planted a Vineyard might eat of the Fruit of , and he that kept a Flock might eat of the Milk thereof; and this was E∣land Just, That that Church whom they had planted, and among whom  laboured, should administer outward Necessities to them; but yet they  not any sum of Money, nor Tythes of Peoples Estates, nor so much  the year as a Debt; for this way was not the way of a Gospel-Main∣nce in the dayes of the Apostles; but by a FREE GIFT of the rch, and not by Imposition and Force upon any were they maintained in ward things. 4. Let the King know, That it is not at this day a just & lawful way of Gospel-intenance to Christ's Ministers, this forced way of Maintenance by Tythes,  so much Money a Year, or claiming so much as a Debt of those which may  do not receive or believe such a Minister is a true Minister of Christ; and all  suing people at Law, casting them into Prison about Ministers Maintenance,  not of God, but Antichrist, and not after the Example of Christ's true
Ministers, but after the Example of false Prophets and Deceivers: And it is a lawful Maintenance at this day of Christ's Ministers, That each Minister be maintained by the free Gift of the people under his Ministry; and its just, that every Minister be maintained by the people to whom he labours, and that eve∣ry Form of Worship maintain their own Ministers, how, and as they will; and if men preach the Gospel, let them live of it, and let their Gospel main∣tain them, without begging Maintenance of the King, or troubling him with such matters as pertain to another state, even to the spiritual Government of Christ, who calls his Ministers, and gives his Gifts to whom he will, and sends them out whither he will; and their Gospel hath effect to change and convert people, and to beget Love in the hearts of people: and such as are begotten to God, by the preaching of the Gospel, can freely give of their carnal things; and a Minister of Christ cannot want any thing. And therefore let not the King be careful nor troubled about maintaining Ministers, but let him maintain his own, how, and as he pleaseth, and leave all his Kingdoms to the like; that every sort of people, whether Papists, Protestants, or any others, maintain eve∣ry one their own Ministers, how, by how much, and as they will; and this is the way of Lawful Maintenance to every Ministry; and not this way of beg∣ging of the King; And that not Niggardly, but Liberally and Sufficiently (saith the Petitioner) which shews Covetousness and Impudency in any Beggar, that they may be encouraged, saith the Petitioner, &c. 5. Now that Ministry whose Dependancy is on outward things, and may be encouraged or discouraged by having or wanting large Maintenance, this Mi∣nistry Jesus Christ never sent forth; but it is of man, and by the Earthly Pow∣ers, and not of God; for were the Apostles discouraged in the Work of their Ministry when they were in Wants, and Necessities, and Sufferings, and Af∣flictions, as often they were? No; but they approved themselves the more to be Christ's Faithful Ministers thereby: And it may be a very certain Evidence to the King, That such who will not go forth to minister without such or such large Benefices and Maintenance, by so much Money, Tythes, or yearly Stipends, are not the Ministers of Christ, neither were they ever sent of him to preach his Go∣spel; but have run for Gifts and Rewards, like Balaam, and have not been tru∣ly called by Christ Jesus into his Ministry. Now I come to the fifth Branch of the Petition, which is in these words; I humbly beg your Grace, That in order to the establishing a learned Ministry to Posterity, your, Majesty will be a Fosterer and Patron of the Schools and Nurseries of good Learn∣ing, especially the two once famous Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In Answer hereunto, let the King consider; 1. That the true and lawful Ministry of Jesus Christ is the absolute free Gift of God, to whomsoever the Lord is pleased to give it: and it is not bought nor sold for Money, nor received by Education and natural Learning; but God gives the Gift of Knowledge and Utterance, and every part of his Ministry to whom he will: so the Apostles received the Ministry, and so it is received at this day, by all that have it. It is not a Natural Science, or Art of Knowledge or Utterance; but it is the Gift of God, and ever was, whether to Plough-men, or Fisher-men, or to whomsoever, as the Lord gives it; for, As every one had recei∣ved the Gift, so they might administer, as say the Scriptures. 2. That the Establishing of the Ministry pertains to Jesus Christ alone, and that it depends upon the Power and Spirit of God to establish his own Ministry, and to overthrow that which is contrary; and the Lord alone will do it, and not man; for it is he that sendeth out Ministers, whom he will, and he defends them and establishes them against the Devil, and all their Opposers: Neither did ever any of the Apostles and Ministers of Christ, beg to the Kings of the Earth Maintenance and Establishment; but they knew the Lord, and trusted in him, and therefore let not the King trouble himself with care in these matters, but leave them
to the Lord, to whom they do belong; and let him rule well in outward Affairs, and leave the Government of the Church and Ministry to Christ Jesus, to whom only it pertains. 3. As for Oxford and Cambridge, and sending Ministers from thence, and ma∣king them there, by natural Arts and Sciences, according to the Custom there used; there was no such thing in the Apostles days, as making Ministers at Schools and Colledges by natural Learning; but, as I have said, It was by the Gift of God's y Spirit that the Ministers of the Gospel were made and sent forth: And this way of making Ministers at Oxford and Cambridge, at Schools and Colledges, and all that pertains thereunto, as the Orders, Names and Practices, for the most part, the ve∣ry Habits and Degrees of Schools, and all that stuff is all come up since the Apostles dayes; and that way of creating Ministers, and sending them forth, was never known not in beeing among the Apostles; but much Abomination and Idolatry is brought forth at such places, and in such wayes, to the Grief and Vexation of the Lord God, whose Wrath will break out like Fire, to devour Idolatry, with the Cause and Ground thereof. And happy is that man that partakes not of the Sins of others, he shall not partake of the Iudgements. And in the last part of the Petition, it is craved; That the Seminaries of Sin and Satan, Wickedness and Vice, may be beaten down and suppressed, &c. Ans. These things are abounding which provoke the Lord to great wrath against the Land: Oh! that indeed the King would consider, that Iniquity may be stop∣ped, and Righteousness brought forth; then should the King, and Kingdoms, and Subjects be made Famous and Dreadful through the World: For, because of Oppression and Wickedness the Land mourns, and the great Judgments of the Lord are at the door, except Repentance be made unto God. And thus I have in much fear towards God, and Honour towards the King, laid divers Considerations before him, worthy to be minded, upon the occasion of the Charge against us by George Willington; and it will be Wisdom for the King to consider our Defence; as well as of our Enemy's Charge. By a Servant of Christ, E. B.
THE Everlasting Gospel OF REPENTANCE AND REMISSION of SINS, Held forth and Declared to the Inhabitants of the Earth, that they may Turn, and be Converted to the Living God, lest they Perish in the Day of Vengeance, which is near at hand. And this is a Message of Reconciliation to all People every where in general, but more particularly to the Inhabitants of Ireland, and to all sorts of People therein; even to the Rich, and to the Poor; to the Professor, and to the Prophane; that every one may be stir'd up to seek the Lord by Repentance. With certain Propositions of FAITH laid down, which every one must believe, or else they cannot be saved. And certain Objections answered, relating to the present dayes. With the Way of a Happy and Blessed Government Discovered in the Kingdoms of this World, &c. OH Ireland! The Day of God's Visitation of Love and tender Mercy hath been upon thee, to try thee and to prove thee; and the Lord would have gathered thy People into Covenant and Fellowship with himself, to live in Love, Unity and Peace; and the Lord would have made thy Inhabitants Blessed, but they would not; but many have refused the Day of his Love, and they have neglected his Loving-kidness, and have chosen their own wayes of Iniquity and Unrighteousness, rather then the Way of Truth and Peace; Though the Lord hath often smitten, and caused his Judgments to be known in the Land, and suffered great Destruction in dayes past, even Plague, Sword and Famine were sore upon thee, have thy Inhabitants forgotten the Dealings of the Lord towards thee? Are his Judgments and Mercies clean gone out of Remembrance, which the Lord shewed in thee not many years since? And because of thy Iniquities and Transgressions, which were grown very great against God, he was angry with thee, and provoked against thee, and did give up thy Inhabitants to Hardness of Heart, and Cruelty of Mind one against another, so that they were given up to destroy and cut off one an∣other; and Thousands of them fell through the Malice and Wickedness of each
others Hearts, and Hands, and cruel Murders, Robberies, Treacheries, and a very great Destruction was committed amongst thy People; and this was be∣cause Iniquity at that day was full, Pride and Oppression, Drunkenness and Whoredom, Double-dealing and Treachery, and all manner of Unrighteous∣ness was grown to the height, and therefore did the Lord suffer a very great Re∣buke in the Land; and by Sword, Plague and Famine did he plead with thy In∣habitants for some years together, even that he might humble thee, and correct thee, and that thy People might turn unto him, and forsake their Iniquities. Oh! why hast thou forgotten the Dealings of the Lord, running into the same Abominations? For since the Lord stayed his Judgments, Iniquity is in∣creased, even as before: Though the Lord hath given thee Rest and Peace for di∣vers years, and healed thee of thy Sorrows and Miseries, and replenished thee with People, and thou hast had Peace and Fulness for a good season; but yet thou hast not made a right use of these Mercies, as thou oughtest to have done: Though the Lord hath shewed Love and Favour towards thee, in delivering of thee from thy former Troubles and Miseries; yet thou hast turned, to thy own hut, is Blessings into a Curse, through thy abuse of them: And now through Re, and Peace and Fulness thy Inhabitants are corrupted, and become abo∣minably sinful, and they have loaden themselves with Transgressions, and heped up Wrath against the Day of Wrath, even Wrathful Matter for the Wath of God; and former Judgments and Mercies seem to be both forgot∣ten, many having abused them to their hurt, though the Lord intended them for their good; and thy Inhabitants are, as before, many of them hardened in Iniquity, rather then turned from it; and they are turned into their old Paths, and drink of the same Cup of Abominations? and Pride, and Oppres∣sion, and all Unrighteousness, in every part of it, is grown as high as ever it was in thee. Oh! how doth Wickedness abound, Drunkenness, Wantonness, Vain-Pleasures, Envy, Wrath, Contention, Heart-Burning, Covetousness and Earthly-mindedness, Double-dealing, False-heartedness, Idolatry and Hypo∣crisie, and all Fruits of the Flesh, how do they abound in thee? even as high as ever before, as though thou hadst never felt Judgement because of thy sins, and as though thou hadst never tasted of Mercy, that thou shouldst live a better life; but both Judgment and Mercy by-past are neglected, and the Re∣membrance of them worn out; and thou hast said in thy heart, We love this world, its Pleasures and Vanities, and after our wayes will we go. Oh Nation and Kingdom! this is thy Condition, and thy present State; Thou drinkest up Iniquity as an Ox drinketh Water, and thou addest sin to sin, as if all thou couldst do were too little, and like as if thou wert appointed for no other end but to commit sin; and thou hatest Reproof, and despisest Corre∣ction; and him that reproveth thee thou countest thy Enemy: for the whole Pleasure of many of thy people is in sinning against God; and thus thou thinkest to serve him with thy sins, and requitest the Lord evil for his good towards thee, and his Judgments and Mercies have no place in thy Heart; though yet thou hast been warned for these divers years, that thy People should turn from their Iniquities, and serve the Living God; Repentance and Forsaking of Sin hath been preached thorough thee; and Warning hath been given of the Judg∣ments of God, that are to come; but hereof hast thou taken no notice, as thou oughtest to have done; but thy Inhabitants have despised the Lord's Servants, and persecuted them; and thou hast held in Derision and under great Afflictions the People of the Lord, and persecuted them for good Con∣science sake. And this is the fulfilling of Wickedness in thee, and the heigh of thy Inha∣bitants Transgressions, in that they have persecuted such who have warn'd them, and despised the Lord's Reproof, and would not hearken to the Advice of his People; but do alwayes reject the Message of God's Light, which reproveth
people in their own Consciences, because of Sin, that they should turn from i and be saved; this Message hath been proclaimed thorough the Land, even for some years together, wherein the Lord hath visited thee with his Love, that he might gather thy People, and condemn their Iniquities, and save their Souls; but thy People have rejected this Message, and would not be turned from their Idolatrous Wayes and Worships, nor from the Hypocrisie of their wayes, that they might be healed: But thy people have forsaken the Living God; and rebelled against the Light; and the Way of Peace they have refused; and turn∣ed their Backs towards the Lord, and not their Faces; and after Covetousness and the Love of this World they have gone; though there hath been a great Profession of Worship and Religion in thee, much Preaching and Praying, Sabboth-keeping and professed Church-Fellowship, Ministry and Ordinances, and a Sect here of one sort, and there another, that have cryed, Lord, Lord, and have made a shew of Worships and Duties towards him; yet not∣withstanding, Hypocrisie, False-heartedness, Covetousness, Double-minded∣ness, and the spirit of Pride, Ambition and Vain-glory, have possessed the Hearts of both Teachers and People in all the false Sects and divers kinds of Religion; though they have had a shew, as if they were the Lord's People, and a Pretence of Worship, and Conformity of Church-Fellowship, &c. yet their Hearts have not been right before the Lord: but of these it may be said, Even they have professed God with their Mouthes, and with their Lips honoured him, and in the very time their Hearts have gone after Covetousness, and been far departed from the Lord; and though they have cryed, The Temple of the Lord, and we are the Church of Christ, and Members of him, and have Gospel, and Ministry, and Ordinances; yet these People have walked in Pride, and Arrogancy, and Covetousness, and their Hearts have been Corrupted in the sight of the Most High, and all their Religion hath been but as the Fig-leaves, by which they have sought to cover themselves, but it cannot be. For, Behold ye Professors and People of Ireland! God hath beheld your Hypocrisies, and the Deceitfulness of your Hearts and your Nakedness doth ap∣pear; for, though you have professed much of the Spirit and Spiritual Things, yet you have walked in the Flesh, and brought forth the Fruits thereof; and your Garments of feigned Prayers and Practices, and your Profession of Church and Ordinances, will not cover nor hide you from the Wrath of the Lamb. Oh People of Ireland! many of you have been corrupted in your Hearts, and polluted in your Minds; and from the highest of you to the lowest you are found Transgressors against God, even from the Professor to the Pro∣phane, the Lord hath found no good Fruit amongst you well-pleasing to him; but four Grapes and bitter Fruit have you brought forth, even Fruit of a bad Taste and loathsom Smell unto the Lord: and now the Lord hath found you out in your Wickedness, and the Cry of your Iniquities call for Vengeance; for of you it may be said, Ah Nation, laden with Iniquity! ab sinful People! a seed of Evil doers; corrupted from the crown of the Head to the sole of the Foot: These things are so, and they cannot be hid. But now the Lord's Purpose is, to deal with thee because of thy sins, seeing he is provoked against this People by their Iniquities, who have been disobedi∣ent to the Living God; therefore will he renew his Judgments of old, and with-draw his Mercies, and he will plead with this People in his Justice: his Judgments are at the door, and he will punish the Stout-hearted, and Proud and Arrogant, till they learn Meekness and Humility: He will correct the Transgressors with his Rod of heavy Wrath, till they turn to him by Re∣pentance; and all that will not how, and kiss the Son, and cease from Evil, and learn to do well, they shall be broken, and cut off, and perish in his Anger, and he will never heal them; even the Feller will come upon thy People, O Nation, who will hew down thy Cedars, and cut up thy strong
Oaks; the Fanner is coming upon thee to sift thee, to preserve the good Grain, and to separate the Chaff into the Fire; thy Strength will be made weak, and thy Crown will be trodden down, and thy Beauty shall be marred; and all thy Glory and Might shall fade like a Flower in that Day, when the Lord of Hosts pleads with thee; and when he rewards thee for thy Wickedness, then Wo unto thee, and unto all the Wicked, and Workers of Iniquity; and he will cause them to remember what they have done: Thy Sins, O Nation, shall be set in order be∣fore thee, and thy Persecution of the Lords Servants shall be charged to thy ount; and the Rod of Affliction shall reach close unto thee because there∣of: And as thy Rulers have done to others, so shall it be done to them; into Captivity shall they go, and the Spoiler shall come upon the Land, for just is the Lord, and his Iudgment altogether equal; and though he be Long-suffering and of great Forbearance, yet he forgets not to plead with his Enemies, and to Plague the Ungodly, nor to shew Mercy to them that trust in him: And doubt∣less there is a Cup of Wrath prepared for the Wicked to drink, and it seemeth to be near; even a Day of great Wrath and Tribulation upon Sinners and Trans∣gressors, who have rejected the Lord, and despised his Reproofs, and would not receive the Message of the Light of the World, that they might be healed. Wherefore Repent, Repent, all sorts of People, all Sinners and Transgressors; Tremble before the Lord ye Stout-hearted and Rebellious Children: Wo un∣to ye unjust Rulers and Judges, that have exercised unjust Judgment in the Land, that have judged for Gifts and Rewards, and that have turned aside just Judgment, Mercy and Truth, and that have persecuted the Innocent without just Cause. Wo unto you that have been Oppressors of the Poor and Needy, ye that have not judged for the Lord, as ye ought to have done; but have been Ambiti∣ous, and Vain-glorious, and puffed up in the Flesh by high Titles, and Pla∣ces of Honour. Ye that have exalted your selves above your Brethren, and sought Ho∣nour of Men, and loved the Honour of this World mor than the Honour of God; Wo unto you, for the Day of the Lord's Judgment is at hand, and an Account of your Stewardship must you give. Ye that should have judged in Mercy, and Truth and Equity, but have per∣verted just Judgment, and made the Innocent Offenders, and have not been a Praise to them that do well, nor a Terror to Evil-doers, as ye ought to have been; Wo unto you, and to the Oppressing and Flashearted Lawyers, and that Train, who have been greedy of Gain and served your own Ends, and sought Riches to your selves, and the Cause of the Poor hath not been freely pleaded by you. Wo unto all ye that have made a Trade of doing Judgment and Justice, and have been exercised in the Law for your own Ends, and not singly for the Lord. Tremble ye Sons of Wickedness, ye that have exercised the Power of An∣tichrist and the Beast; for the Judgments of the Lord are at hand to be executed upon you. Wo unto you Great and Rich Men, ye Covetous and Earthly Worldlings, e that have made your selves Rich by Oppression, and Grinding the Faces of the Poor, that have got Gain by Hard-dealing, and added Land to Land; and Field to Field, and that have over-reached the Ignorant, and oppressed the Widdows and Fatherless, and that have exercised Cruelty and Hard-dealing to your Tenants and Servants, and have laid heavy Yoaks upon such with whom you have dealt, and that have made your selves Great and Rich in the Earth by such means; Wo unto you, Misery is coming upon you: Weep and Howlye Earthly, Greedy, Covetous Wretches of this World, who have sought Riches more than the Lord, and gotten Gain by Oppression and Over-reaching your Neighbours; your Riches, so gotten, shall never prosper, no be blessed to you; but shall be a Curse to you, and your Children: And your Covetousness
will God plague; Ye that have gotten Goodt, and not by Right, shall leave them in the midst of your dayes. Wo unto you Carnal Minds; all the Treasures of them are corruptible; your Lands, Gold and Silver are fading Treasures: The Day of the Lord's Judgments are at hand upon you, and the Rod of his Wrath will smite you; and ye shall have Poverty and want instead of Fulness and Excess, and ye shall have Leanness and Barrenness, and God will plead with you in the way you have sinned against him: The Time of your Visitation draws near. Wo unto you Merchants, Traders, Buyers and Sellers, that have been Dou∣ble-Dealers and Double-Tongued, and dealt deceitfully in your Commodities with your Neighbours: Wo unto ye that have got Gain by Double-dealing, and by feigned and flattering Speeches have beguiled one another, and sought to out-reach in your Bargaining every man his Brother; these things have ye done, O ye Covetous Men! ye have even robbed the Poor by your Craft and Guileful-dealing, by your smooth and flattering Tongues; and if any amongst you could not use Fraud, and Dissemble, such have been your Prey and Scorn; and its your Use to discommend a Commodity when you buy it, and to praise it when you sell it; and ye make a fair out-side to please the Eye, and ye use multitude of words and fair speeches, and decive the Simpl, and get Gain by Oppression, Craft and Deceit: Wo unto you, Repent of this your sin; Cleause your Hearts, you Sinners; and purifie your Hearts, you Double-minded. I charge you by the Lord, Give over your Double-dealing, and deceitful Merchandize; cease to Lye and Defraud; cease your Flattery and Feigned words, and speak the Truth every one to his Neighbour; and come out of your Iniquities; use not a bad Conscience any long∣er, for its a fearful Abomination against the Lord: But mind the Light of Christ in you, which will convince you in your Consciences of your noughty and sinful wayes; and that Light will exercise your Consciences to do the Truth and speak the Truth to your Neighbours in all things, and this is Blessed, and the Gain that is thereby gotten is not a Curse; for ye ought in all your wayes to reverence the Lord, and respect him, that he should lead you and guide you in your exercise of all Earthly things; For the Earth is the Lord's and the Fulness thereof, and it ought to be exercised to his Glory: and there is suffi∣ent in this Creation for all People, and therefore covet not Earthly things one from another, neither oppress nor over-reach one another about them; nei∣ther treasure up Earthly things, while the Poor want; for if ye do, you hide your selves from your own Flesh, laying Field to Field till there is no Place for the Poor; and Wo unto such, the Day of the Lord will be upon you: But learn the Wisdom of God, how to be ordered, and how to order all things of this Creation, and be in Unity and good Agreement amongst your selves; and do not fall out, nor strive, nor contend, nor envy one another about Earthly things; but if ye have much, or if ye have little, be contented with what you have, and do not grind the Hearts and Consciences one of another to get Earthly things, for they will fade and perish away; and seek not after that which perisheth, but after that which is unto Eternal Life: For the Day of the Lord is at hand, and his Judgments upon all Oppressors, Double-dealers and False-hearted Flatterers, that are Covetous of Earthly things. Wo unto all ye Drunkards and Swearers, Whoremongers and Prophane Persons, the Judgments of the Lord are upon you unawares; ye that destroy the Creation upon your Lusts, that are rnn into the Excess of Wine and Beer, and that covet it excessively, and that drink till ye inflame your selves, and spend your time in it; ye are like the Beasts of the Field, and like the Swine that wallow in Filthinefs; ye pervert the right use and End of the good Creatures of God, and spend them upon your Lusts, and have not regard unto the Living God; and one sin even begets another, Drunkenness begets Swearing, and prophane Words, and Whoredom and beastly Affections; and thus ye add sin
to sin, and heap up one sin upon another, conary to the Light in your own Consciences; and thus ye serve  il and Satan, committing Iniquity with both hands, as it were, by   and swearing, and taking the Name of the Lord in Vain, and  Spes, and falling out one with another; and your Minds are eed  the Lord, and  abuse your selves, and your  Bodies, which were made f the service of God, and not  whor ; and ye slay your own soul by your own Iniquities, and ma∣mes provoke the Lord to destroy both Soul and Body: Wo unto you,  lagues of God are your Portion, and Misery your nd here and hereafter;  of your Iniquities, and turn from them, left the Lord find you in  Iniquities when he comes to Judgment;  if you continue in them  can never be pardoned, but you si unto death, and the Lord will come pon you suddenly; for ye that followed Drunkenness and Propess, you live contrary to the Light in your own Consciences, and you sin against your knowledge, against that Knowledge that God hath given you; and this is your greatest sin, even because ye do the things which ye know ye shoul not do,  the Light in your, Consciences doth she you, that these things are evil before you do them; but ye doing the things contrary to the Light in your  Consciences, this makes your Crime , and your sin upardonable,  e continue in sin and prophaness, contrary to the Reproof of God's Spi∣  your own nsciences: Wherefore ye prophane Persons, cease to do evil, est the Lord's Judgements come upon y suddenly to your Dstruction, and the Lord smite you, and you never be healed. Wo unto all ye yporiil and deceitful Profssors of Religion, that hold the Truth in Unrighteousness, th have a talk and a shew of Religion, and that have the Name of Church-members and of Worshippers of God, but are  in Sins and Trespasses; ye that are Christians by Name, but want the Nure, who are Wolves in Sheep's cloathing, that have Christ's words, the Prophets and Aposts words, but want their Spirit and Life; Wo unto you, the D of the Lord is at hand upon you, ye Hypocrites, ye that serve God with your Li, and with your outhes profess much love, whenas your Hearts are full of y. Covetous and Earthly-mindedness; ye are the Apostate Christians, th have taken the Form of Godliness upon you, but want the Power; ye preach and pray, and hear sermons, and keep Sabbath Dayes, and perform Duties,  ye are not changed in your Hearts, but the old Nature is alive, and the old Birth lives in you; and ye are unlike unto God in Nature, ye walk in the iesh and not in the Spirit; and ye take Christ's words and the Apostles words, and use your Tongues, when God never spoke to you; O ye Hy∣pocrites! ye have a Name to live, but are dead, and ye think ye are rich, w as you are Poor, Miserable, Blind and Naked, and your souls are le and want the Bread of Life, and ye have not put off the body of sin, nor have you overcome your souls Enemi, but the burden of sin lies upon your onsciences, and Temptations overcome you daily; and though you say, ye have Faith in Christ, yet your Hearts are not purified, but the old Man with his Deeds, is yet alive, and the new Creature is not brought forth in you, nor is Christ living in you, and speaking in you; the Day of the Lord will come upon you, you false-hearted men, ye Apostate Christians, that old the Profession of Truth, and Church, and Gospel, and Ministry in your righteous Minds; your Sacrifices are not acceptable to God, nor your Offe∣rings well-pleasing to him; for your Hearts are not aright bfore him, and your Hypocrisie will God judge, and his Wrath will go out like ire to consme your glory, and God will cloath himself with Zeal as with a Cloak, and with a Garment of Vengeance, and he will slay you with his Sword, and wound your Consciences with the Words of his Mouth, and your Religion will not sve you, or your Garment cover you from the Wrath of the Almighty: Wo unto you, the
mighty Day of the Lord is at hand upon you, ye earthly Professors, who would be Heirs of two Kingdoms, who would enjoy God and this World too, and love its Vanities, and Profits, and Pleasures, and Honours, and live in Strife and Contention one with another abot thly things, and about your Religion too, and are not of one Heart, and Mi and Soul, but are Strangers to the new Covenant of God; though you hear Sermons, and say a Form of Prayer, and keep Sabbaths and Lecture-dayes, and perform Ordinances, and Duties, and yet your Hearts are hard, and the body of Sin and Death li upon your Consciences, and you are not changed into the Divine Nature; this Reli will not save you, away with it all, its of Antichrist, and his spirit leads you; while you walk in the Form of godliness without the Power, the Lord will come upon you suddenly; therefore repent ye of your Hypocrisies, and turn to the Spirit of God within you, hear its Reproofs, and obey it, and walk in the Spirit, and be ye changed, or else you can never be saved. Wo, Wo unto all ye false Teachers, and blind Leaders of the People, ye Diviners and false Prophets, the Day of the Lord is at hand upon you; ye have deceived souls for dishonest Gain, ye have run and never were sent of God, and ye have not profited the People at all, and ye have taken the Name upon you of Ministers of Christ, when he never sent you forth; and you have kept a prating and preaching up and down, and run for Gifts, and Reward, and Hire; ye have deceived the World, and the Blood of Souls rests upon you; O ye Generation of Serpents! Poyson hath lodged under your Tongues, your Hears have been rotten, and your Tongues feigned and full of Flattery, and you have been as Canker-worms in the Earth, that have corrupted the whole World; whom have not ye deceived by your Lyes and false Divinations? Whom have not you cryed Peace unto, if they would but give you Gifts, Money and Hire? What Form of Religion would not you take up for advantage to your selves? how often have you turned from one Way to another? Oh ye false-hearted men! the God of Heaven will shew you no Mercy; ye are the men that have made the Earth drunk with false Faith and false Doctrines, and with Contention and Dissention, sometime preaching up one Govern∣ment, sometime another; and sometime being for one way of Worship, and sometime for another; Treachery hath lodged in your Hearts above all others; ye have eaten up the sin of the People, and cryed Peace unto the Un∣godly: Wo unto ye that have gone in Cain's way, that have bred Contention, Persecution, Strife and Emulation amongst People, and that have gone in Balaam's way for Gifts and Rewards, and would do any great man a Plea∣sure, and even curse the People for Money; ye have been such as all the holy Prophets cryed against, your Fruits and Works declare it; ye have sought for your Gain from your Quarter, and could never have enough, such as Isaiah cryed against, Chap. 56. and such as Micah cryed against, Micah 3. That preached for Hire, and divined for Money, and leaned upon the Lord, and cry∣ed Peace to them that would give Money, and prepared War against them that would not; and these things have you done, some of ye Teachers and Priests; and ye have been blind Watch-men, and ye have been idle and lazy Shepherds, such as Ezekiel cryed against, Chap. 34. that ruled over People with Force and Cruelty, and killed them that were fed, and did not heal the Diseased, nor strengthen the Weak, but pusht with the Horn at such as went astray from you; and idle and lazy Shepherds have you been, who have not fed the Flock with living Food, but you have caused them to drink of the foul Waters, and thei Souls are lean and barren under your preaching; Oh look into your Flocks, and see what Fruit is brought forth by them, and what may be gathered from them! Oh the abundance of Pride and Wickedness, of Ambition and Vain-glory, and Covetousness, and the love of this World, Lying and Double-dealing, and all the Fruits of the Flesh! How do they abound a∣mongst the Flocks of your Fold? who are in their fruits, and by their works not
the Sheep of Christ's Pasture, but are like Goats and Wolves under your teach∣ings; can ye behold this and consider of it, and not be ashamed of the fruit of your Wayes; What have ye brought forth these many years; Or what profit have the People received from you, who are yet in their sins, unturned from them, and not converted to God? whereby it appears you have run, and never were sent, because the People are not profited at all; and it grieves the Heart of the Righteous to look into your Vine-yards, and to s such bad fruit grow∣ing; you have been sloathful Tillers, and have not sown the good Seed in the Hearts of the People, but the seed of corruption brings forth fruit in them, and your Vine-yards are like barren and untilled Ground, that is unplowed and undigged, and unplanted with Trees of Righteousness: Oh ye have been unprofitable Vineyard-Dressers, and ye have laboured for your selves, and not for the Lord, as is manifest; and ye have been idle and lazy, and the God of Heaven is weary of you, and the time is at hand he will pluck you up by the Roots, and visit you with great Destruction, and your name shall be a Reproach amongst men; for ye have not sought the Lord's Honour, but your own; and ye have been changable in your Ways for your own advantages; ye have preached for filthy Lucre, and through Covetousness made Mer∣chandize of People; and ye have traded with the Scriptures, and made a Trade of the preaching the Gospel; and ye have made Traffick of the Souls of Men: and these things have you done, and the Lord hath kept silence, and he hath forborn to smite you, and therefore have you been hardened the more in your Transgressions, as though the Lord took no notice; and you have fil∣led your Hands with dishonest Gain in your unrighteous Wayes, and your sins are increased every day against the God of Heaven; you repent not when you are warned, but reject reproof, and go on without fear; ye are a compa∣ny of proud men, heady and high-minded Men, ambitious and self-seeking Per∣sons, even such as the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles marked forth for De∣ceivers, and your Fruits and Works do preach it; ye have been covered with Sheep's cloathing in your unrighteous natures, and your Iniquities are almost full, and the Lord wi bring unresistable Destruction upon you, in a Day when you cry, Peace, Peace, then sudden Destruction will come: Wo unto you, be∣cause of your Iniquities, the Earth is weary of you, which ye have corrupted through your false wayes, and the Kingdoms groan under your Oppressions, and the Earth will spue you out, and the People, whom you have deceived, shall rise up in judgment against you; the dreadful Day of the Lord is at hand upon you, the Apostates from the Life and Faith of Jesus Christ, fo of that Race you are, even of them Apostates that went out in the Apostles dayes, that went in Balaam's way, and Cain's way, for ye are of the spirit that kills and persecutes People about Worship and Sacrifices, and Religion, as Cain did; and you go for Gifts and Rewards, even as Balaam did: these things are so, the Witness of God in your Consciences shall answer, and all People shall acknowledge the truth hereof in the day when God pleads with all the Wicked. All People return and repent of your Iniquities, the dreadful day of the Lord is at hand, ye Sinners and Transgressors, ye hypocritical Professors and pro∣fain Persons, the day of Vengeance is at hand; whither will you fly, and where will you leave your glory? where will you seek a defence, or where can you be hid? the Mountains will not cover you, nor the Rocks will not fall upon you; the Wrath of the Lamb you cannot escape, even the long-suffering of God will be turned into a flame of Anger, and Patience will be turned into sharp Rebuke, the Wrath of the Lamb will utterly smite you, and the Cup of God's Indignation you must drink, all the Earth must taste of it, and the Wicked shall drink the dreggs; wherefore all ye Inhabitants of the Earth forsake your Trans∣gressions, that the Lord may not cut you off for ever, but let God arise to de∣oy your Iniquities, and to save your Souls, let him take Vengeance upon your Inventions, that he may forgive you: Oh! why will you dye, why will
you perish? the Lord would have you to return, that he might save you. And this is the day of your Visitation, the door of Mercy is yet open for a little season, and the Lord yet calls unto you for a moment; but the time is at hand, that he who is filthy, shall be filthy still, and that determination shall be passed, Come, ye Blessed, and, Go ye Cursed; the doleful sentence shall be pronounced to all workers of Iniquity, Into everlasting Burning must they depart, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, and shall not see the Countenance of the Lord to refresh their soul, but in the presence of the Lord and of the Lamb, shall the Wicked be tormented: Wherefore hear and tremble, all ye Transgressors that live and act contrary to your knowledge, and against the Witness of God in your own Consciences; and this is your great sin, for which the wrath of God cometh, not because you have acted in Ignorance and without knowledge, but because you have acted against the Light in your Consciences, and sinned against your knowledge, and done the things which you know were evil before you did them: and because hereof you are not to be excused, but the burden of your own sins, and the guilt of them will fall heavy upon you in the Day of the Lord; For this is the Condemnation of the World, that Light is come into it, but you have loved Darkness rather than Light, and followed evil deeds and loved them, and this is contrary to the Light that is come into the World, and which hath enlightned your own Consciences. Certain Propositions of Faith laid down, which every one must believe, or else they cannot be saved. I. NOw none can be saved from the Wrath of the Lord but they who are sa∣ved from their Sins; for Sin bring the Wrath of God upon the Cons∣sciences of men, and Anguish upon Soul and Body; and who are not saved from Sin, canot be saved from Wrath; for Wrath pursues the Guilty, and he that doth evil, sin lies at his door, and continual anguish upon his spirit because of sin, and the load and burden of the Body of Death oppresseth his soul, and an∣ger from God kindleth in his Breast, because he hath sinned; and he knows he is guilty of Transgression, and the Lord wounds him in his Conscience, and no man in that state can speak peace unto him, nor can any save him from the Wrath of God, because he is not saved from his Sin, nor from the guilt of it; but his grief and burden is, because he hath sinned against the Light in his own Conscience: And therefore whosoever will be saved from Wrath, must be sa∣ved from Sin, and Christ must purifie his heart, and the Blood of the Lamb must sanctifie him, and his Conscience must be cleansed from the guilt of Trans∣gression, and Christ must live in him, and he must live the Life of Faith, which gives victory over all Sin, or else he cannot be saved with the Salvation of God eternally. II. Again, whosoever will be saved with the salvation of God, must own the Light of Christ Jesus in his own Conscience, and he must believe in this Light and walk in it, even the Light in his Conscience, that convinces him, and checks him for his evil deds, and that lets him see what sin he is guilty of; you must believe in this Light, and follow it, and depart from that, and for∣sake that Iniquity which it convinces you of, and do that Good which it moves your hearts unto, or else you can never be saved; for if you continue in evil-do∣ing, contrary to the Light of Christ in your own Consciences, you are in a condemned condition, and you cannot be justified of the Lord, while you are accused by the Light within you, of such and such sins, and that you are guilty of them, and sorsake them not; for the God of Heaven condemneth and justifieth men according to the Witness of the Light in their own Consci∣ences; for it is Gods Evidence, to bear witness for God, and to accuse or excuse every man in his sight, and according to its evidence, God justifieth or condemn∣eth all the Children of men.
III. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must be born again of the seed of God, and must be changed and renewed in Mind and Heart, and Spirit; and old things must pass away, and all things must be made new; and a new Na∣ture must live in you, and the Image of God must be brought forth, which is in Righteousness and true Holiness, which is like unto God; and this is the new Creation, which every one must witness to be wrought in them that ever ers into Gods Kingdom; For saith Christ, Except a man be born again he can∣ enter into the Kingdom of God; for it is not a profession of Religion made with the Lips, nor the practises of Duties and Ordinances taken on and performed in the old nature, and a holding of truth in unrighteousness; this is not the way of Salvation, but it is the regenerating and making like unto God, being his Image of Justice, Truth and Righteousness; it is this in which men may be sa∣ved everlastingly. IV. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must receive the Spirit of God, and it must dwell in them, even the Spirit of the Father; and they must be taught by it, and led into all Truth, to do the Truth, and speak the Truth in all things; even the spirit of Truth must be received, to teach and to lead in all the wayes of God; it alone must teach; and all the Hireling-Teachers of the World must be turned away from, by whom peoples souls have been deceived; all such as have run, and God never sent them; that have cryed up Tching and Mi∣nistry, and through whom people have not received the Spirit of th Father, all such Teachers must be denyed, their Church and Ministry; and the Spirit of the Father must only teach and lead; and you must walk in the Spirit, and not after the Flesh; for if you walk after the Flesh, in the wayes and works of it, you are in the state of Condemnation, and not of Salvation: and the Spirit of God doth not teach you, but you are out of the New Covenant of God; in which Covenant all are taught of the Lord, and in Righteousness are they established: the Spirit of God is put within them, and the Law of God is written in their hearts; and they need no man to teach them, but as the Spirit teacheth: and this is the New Covenant of Peace with God, into which all must come to wit∣ness this, or else they cannot be saved. V. Again, all that will be saved, must be sanctified, cleansed and purified from all Unrighteousness, by the Spirit and Word of God, whereby every Heart must be made clean, and every Conscience sprinkled with the Blood of the Lamb; and the body of sin and death must be put off, and the bondage of Cor∣ruption must be broken, and Iniquity must be forsaken, and turned from, and si must be judged in the Flesh, and Purity, Holiness and Righteousness must live and reign in all that will be saved; and Sin and Transgression, and the guilt of it must be removed; and you must shew forth the Image of God in Holiness and Righteousness; and must be pure, as he is pure, in kind and qua∣lity; and you must walk in Holiness and Righteousness, being freed from Corruption, and from the Wayes of Sin and Death, being sanctified in Body, Mind and Spirit, by the Word of the Lord; and Sin must be blotted out, and Transgression must be covered, and Iniquity must be remembred no more, and in all things you must cease to do evil, and learn to do well, if ever you will be saved. VI. Again, whosoever will be saved must witness Christ revealed in yo, d e must live in you, and you must be Followers of him wheresoever he gos d your Bodies must be the Temples of the Living God; and God must walk  you and dwell in you, according to his Promise; and he must be your King, your Judge and Law-giver, your Teacher, Father and Master, and he must be  in all unto you, even God the Father who is blessed for ever; you must ow him near you, and feel his Presence in you, to be your Joy, Life and eace; and you must have fellowship with him in spirit, and must worship him  Spirit, and by the Spirit, without respect of Dayes, Times or Places:
every one that will be saved must come into this, and witness it; for this is the way of the Salvation of God. VII. Again, whosoever will be saved, must live in the Power of Godlinss, and must deny all Forms of Religion without the Power; all Profession of Scriptures, Ordinances, Church-member-ship, Praying and Preaching, which is not in the Power of God, and by his Spirit, must be denyed, and that part that holds it, (that holds the Form of Godliness without the Power) must be crucified; and every one must come into the Power of the Spirit of God, and must witness that to work in them, to will and to do; and no more professing the Things of God, but as they are witnessed by the work of his Spirit in their hearts: you must not hold Truth any longer in unrighteousness, nor make a profession of it in your your unrighteous minds; no more talking of Justifi∣cation and Redemption, nor of any of the matters of Gods Kingdom, but ac∣cording as they are witnessed by the working of the Spirit of God in the heart: and every one must feel in himself the evidence and Testimony of the Spirit of God to witness the Truth in his heart (or Conscience) of what he professeth with his mouth. VIII. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must witness the Scriptures of Truth fulfilled in themselves: the things that they have read of without them, must be wrought within them, wrought in their hearts by the same Spirit as gve forth the Scriptures; they must pass through the same conditions as the ho∣ly men of God did; and the same truth that the Scriptures declare of, must be revealed in the heart, by the same Spiit that gave forth the Scriptures; and none must profess more than they do enjoy from God; and all flesh must be silent from speaking of the things of Gods Kingdom, which they have not seen, hand∣led, rasted and felt, by the working of the Spirit of God in their Consciences: and this is to witness the Scriptures fulfilled, when you have experience of the same conditions, and of the same operations and manifestations which the Servants of the Lord passed through and bad experience of; and so that you may speak what you have heard, and seen, and handled, and tasted of the Word of Life: All that will be saved must come to this, and wit∣ness it. IX. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must believe in Jesus Christ, and receive him; and they must take up his daily cross and follow him; and must know him to mortifie and crucifie them to the World: and he must work the same things in you by his Spirit spiritually, as he wrought without you in his Person, or else you have no part in him, nor salvation by him: For it is not enough unto eternal life, only to believe that there was such a one as a Christ, and that he did and spoke such and such things at a distance without you; for many may make a belief and a profession of this, and yet perish; but Him that was, of whom you read, without you, must you receive, and witness within you; and you must know Him as he was before Abraham was, and before the World was; and He himself by his Spirit in you must give you the knowledge of Himself, what He was before the beginning, what he is now, and what he shall for ever be. X. Again, Every one that will be saved, must come up out of the Apostacy into which all Christendom hath been fallen, and must come into the same Spirit, Life and Power, as the Apostles were in; from which Life, Spirit and Power, all Christendom have been Apostates, and they have held the words and practices of the Apostles without the same Life and Power, and made Sects, Churches and Ministers, but out of the same Life and Spirit as the holy men of God were in; and all that will be saved, must be restored and received into the same Spirit and Life in their Churches, Ministry and Ordinances, as the Apostles of Christ Jesus were in: and this is Restoration, when People come again into the same Life and Spirit of God, which the Apostate Christians have all wanted, and been in the Form of Ministry, Churches, Religion and Godliness, without the
Power: And unto this is the Lord God restoring People, his Day is dawned, and his everlasting Light is risen, and his Name will be known in the Earth: and none can be saved with the Salvation of God, but who believe, receive and understand these things. A General Objection answered. ject. 1. And whereas there is a great cry by some People of late, That there must be no private Meetings, but all People must come to Church (as they say) d that there must be no more Conventicles, &c. Answ. As for Conventicles, I understand you mean Meetings out of publick Steeple-houses, and that there must be no private Meetings for preaching and Praying, but all People must be forced to come to publick Places of Worship. Now I say, If the Authority that is now set up, and hath the Power, doth exercise it self in this way, then the God of Heaven will be provoked against it, to overthrow it and confound it, if it proceed contrary to the End of just Rule and Authority ordained of God, which is for the punishment of them that do evil things between man and man; but not to impose upon mens Con∣sciences, in things relating to the Worship and Service of God: But the Lord God  wholly Judge in such Matters, and not any Man; and if any Men  er in their Minds concerning Faith, and Doctrine, and the Worship of, God, that belongs to the Lord to punish, and not to any Earthly Au∣thority. And what, must not the People of God come together to worship the Lord in Spirit and Truth? Must not People conveen together in this Age, as the People of God did in Ages past? Did not Christ many times preach in the Dsert, and sometimes in a Ship by the Sea-side, and someties on a Mountain, as you may read in the Scriptures? And did not he often preach unto the Pha∣risies, and sometimes to his Disciples, out of the publick Synagogues? And might not the Iews have called those Meetings Conventicles, because they were not in their publick Synagogues? And also, did not the Apostles and Saints, after the Resurrection of Christ, when they returned from Ierusalem, meet together privately? for they went into an upper Room, and waited upon the Lord, an continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication: And again, at aer time, they were about an hundred and twenty in number, that were in one Place to wait upon the Lord, and Peter preached unto them; and were these Meetings Conventicles, because they were not in a publick Synagogue, but in  upper Chamber, and in a private Place? And thus the Saints of old met together, as ye may read, Act. 1. and worshipped God in Spirit and in Truth, and preached and prayed; and must not the People of God now meet together to pray and wait upon the Lord, but they must be reproached with th  of Conventicles, and threatned and punished for so doing? Oh how blind i this Generation, and how contrary to the true Christian-Spirit in their Practices! And did not Philip preach Jesus unto the Eunuch in a Chariot, as  ent on the way? and this was not in a publick Synagogue, as in Act. 8.  id not Peter preach to Cornelius, with many others, in Cornelius his house?  is was a Meeting, and not in a Synagogue, Acts 10. And did not the les and Saints meet together in an Upper Chamber, where Paul preached until midnight amongst the Saints? Act. 20. and was this a Conventicle, and a unlawful Meeting? Might not the Iews have said, this was an Unlawful Assembly, being in a Chamber, and not in a Publick Synagogue? And again, Did not Paul preach in his own Hired House for two whole years together, and received, all that came in unto him? Act, 28. And here were Privat Meetings out of Publick Synagogues. But did the Iews threaten them, and in∣flict sufferings upon them, because they met in private houses, and would not
come to their Synagogues and Publick Worship? or did they reproach them with the name of Sectaries and Conventiolers, when they met together to wait upon the Lord, sometime in praying, and sometime in preaching? And thus you may see by many Examples, that the Saints and true Christian Churches in the dayes of old met together, sometime on Mountains, and sometimes in Deserts, and sometime in Upper Chambers, their own hired houses, and not in the publick Synagogues; but they were gathered from the Temple and first Priest∣hood, and from the Worship which God had once commanded, which stood in outward things and Ordinances; and when they had received the substance, they denyed the shadows, types and figures, and did not uphold them any longer: And they were gathered by the preaching of the Gospel into the second and new Covenant, and they met together in private Houses, and upper Chambers, and by the Sea-side to preach and pray, and to worship the Lord; and we do not read that the Iews persecuted them for so doing. And will you that have the name of Christians persecute the People of God, though they meet together in private houses, and their own hired houses, and cannot come to your Temples and Steeple-houses? And will not you suffer such to meet together out of your Publick Places, but you will persecute them, and call them Hereticks, and such like? Is not this worse than ever the Iews did to the Apostles? And so you are out of the Example of the true Christians, who met together, and preached and prayed often, and not in a Synagogue or Publick Place; but you cry against them that do so, and threaten to persecute for it: and thus you shew your selves out of the true Christian Example, and in this you are worse than the Iews and more cruel, if you should persecute Peo∣ple for meeting to wait upon the Lord in their own houses, or in what place or time, as the Lord should move their hearts; but if you proceed in this way, and will not permit the People of God to meet together in their own hou and not in your Idol-Temples; then the Power of the Lord will confound you, and God will break you to peices, and you will feel his heavy Wrath upon your Consciences, and God will smite you with his Judgements inwardly and outwardly. Now for your restraining of people from one way of Worship, and forcing them to another, and compelling them about Religion by cruel Laws and Com∣mandments of men; this is of Antichrist, for you to do; and of the Devil: for all forcing of People to this kind of Worship, and from another,  posing upon their Consciences in matters of Gods Kingdom; this is also of ∣tichrist, and contrary to Christ and his Way; for he won People by sound Doctrine; and by Love, and by a good Conversation; and so did his Disciples, for they never forced any by outward violence to their Worship, nor   Church-Government and Ordinances: but it was the practice of the Beast, and the Dragon, that first forced People, and compelled them  ship, since the dayes of the Apostles, Rev. 13. It was Antichrist that first  up∣on People in the Ignorance of their Consciances, and contrary to their ∣ences, by the Commandments of men, false Faith, false Worship, false Mi∣nistry, false Doctrine, and false Religions; so that now, if you should force any contrary to their Consciences, to your Steeple-houses, to  and say your Form of Prayers, we shall say then you are Antichrist,  of the Devil, if so be you should endeavour to compel any, either against  Consciences, or in the Ignorance of their Consciences, to your way of Worship or Religion. Therefore take heed how you meddle in these things, lest God confound you. And as for us, we are the People of God, we fear his Name, and worship him, and cannot bow to the Devil; and we need not be forced to worship the Lord, for his Spirit leads us into all Truth, and we need none of your outward Prescrip∣tions, or Form of Prayers, for the Spirit of God teacheth us in all these things, when, and where, and how we should worship the Lord God, who is a Spirit,
and will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth, which is free, and not by outward force; and all the Worship that is otherwise, and not in the free Spirit of Christ, is of great Babylon, whom the Lord will confound and destroy. Another general Objection answered. Object. 2. Again, whereas it is said by some, Now there must be no more private Preachers, unlearned men, and men not ordained must not now preach anymore; Lay-Persons must not be Preachers that are not so qualified, nor so and so ordained: and this is the present talk among some People. Answ. To this I also answer, and say, Wo to them that would stop, or quench, or limit the Spirit of God in Sons or Daughters; for such are Denyers of the Scriptures, and the Power of God; and such bring guilt upon their own Consci∣ences, and work fearful Abomination against God. And what, must not the Spirit of the Lord speak now, where it is, in this Age, as it did in the dayes of old, as you may read in the Scriptures; for, was not Elisha a Plow-man, and was not he called from the Plow, 1 King. 19. and became a Prophet of the Lord unto the House of Israel, and had the spirit of Elijah poured up∣on him? and would not you have said he was a Lay-man, a Plow-man, unor∣dained, not fitting to preach, if you had lived in his dayes? And was not A called from following the Flock? who had been no Prophet, nor no Pro∣phets Son but an Herds-man, Amos 7. 14, 15. and it was lawful for him to preach the Word of the Lord, though he was but an Herds-man and had been no Prophet, nor Prophets Son; which if he had lived in your dayes, you would have called him a Lay-man, an unfit Person, unlearned, and one not ordained for the Ministry: and you, like Amaziah the wicked Priest of Bethel, would now quench the Spirit, as he would have done in Amos, who was a Trades-man, and such a one as you call Lay-men, who are not (as you say) fitting to preach. And did not Christ Jesus himself chuse Fisher-men, and sent them forth to preach the Gospel, and such as were men of Trades, and unlearned in Books, as it is written, Act. 4. 13. When the Ru∣s saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived they were Unlearned, they velled; and these were Ministers of Christ, and preached the everlasting Gospel, whom you would have called Lay-men, and men unfit to preach,  you lived in their dayes. And Paul himself by Occupation was a Tent-er, it is said, and he laboured with his Hands, and yet was a Preacher of the Gospel; and there are multitudes of Witnesses in the Scriptures of these things, how that men of Trades, and unlearned in Letters and Books, and never were brought up at Schools and Colledges, but followed the Plough, and were keepers of Cattel, and some followed Fishing; such as these in old  had the Spirit of God given them, and they preached the Gospel: And what if the Lord at this day give his Spirit to such as these, and send them  to preach the Gospel, even to such as were brought up and educated  ay be) at Handy-craft Trades, and are labouring men, and are not  at Schools and Colledges; will you limit the Lord, and quench his , and reproach his Wayes and Servants, and now call them Lay-per∣ and say they are not fitting to preach? for they are not Learned nor ed, say you; and calling them Mechannicks and private Preachers, and  they must not now be admitted to preach the Gospel; and in this you  the Scriptures, and the Example of the Saints in former Ages, and so neither  the Scriptures, nor the Spirit that gave them forth: though you say,  own the Scriptures, yet if the same things come to pass which they declare  you deny them in this Age, and ry against such as Hereticks who wit∣ the fulfilling of them, which shews you are of Antichrist, and that you
quench the Spirit in the Sons and Daughters, which God hath promised in the New Covenant, that he would give and pour forth upon Sons and Daughters, and they shall prophesie: And are not we to look for these things now? What must not God's Promises be fulfilled? must not an Heards-man now preach, if the Word of the Lord come unto him? and must not Plow-men now speak of the things of God, if they have experience of them? and must not Fisher-men and Tent-makers bear witness to the Name of Christ, if they have received of his Spirit? and will you deny the Scriptures, which saith, As every one hath received the Spirit and the Gift, so let him administer the same one to another? 1. Pet. 4. or do you say, None must have the Gift of the Spirit, but such as are brought up at Schools and Colledges? or will you limit the holy One to such and such Men and Wayes? Oh you are blind and ignorant, who would quench the Spirit of God, that it should not speak in these dayes; and thus you are denyers of the Scriptures: but God hath given of his Spirit, and spoken in our Hearts, and we must prophesie, and speak as the Spirit of God giveth utterance, as the Saints of old did, Act. 2. 4. Now for your way of making Ministers at Schools and Colledges, and so qual∣lifying them with knowledge in the seven Sciences, as it is said, and ordaining them in that manner and way, as among Papists and Protestants hath been practised for Ages; this way of making Ministers, and sending of them forth, was never known among the Apostles; for they were not thus made and ordained, and sent to preach, nor was this way of making and sending forth Ministers, till the Spirit and Power of God was lost and forsaken by the Apostate Christians; and the Scriptures make no mention of such ways, nor give no Example for such things; and we cannot own any Religion, nor any Practice thereof, but what we have Example for from the Saints of old before us: and we believe that it is generally of Antichrist, to invent and introduce such and such Practices for Religion towards God, and for the Worship of him, for which there is no Example in all the Christian Churches in the Apostles dayes: and we believe that way of making Ministers, and sending of them forth, which is not approveable by the Scripture,, nor according to them, is of Antichrist, and not of God; neither can we own such Ministers nor their Ministry, who are not ordained of God, and according to the Scriptures; nor can we deuy private Preachers nor their Ministry, as you call them, if they have received the Spirit of Christ, though they be not so learned outwardly, nor ordained according to what some may call the right way; but who are Ministers, made and sent of God, and have the Authority of his Spirit, such we own, and cannot deny; and such the Lord will bless with his Presence, to the confounding of all their Enemies. Concerning Settlement in a happy Government. Object. There hath been great Divisions and Distractions in these Nations for many years; and in the midst of them the great cry hath been by many for Settlement and Peace, and for a quiet and happy Government. Answ. These things hath the Lord suffered to come to pass in the World; even great Contentions, Divisions and distractions, and much Changes of Government in these Kingdoms; And the appearing Cause of these things, hath been from the Lust that hath warred in the Members; for from thence doth Wars and Strife arise: and many have been Ambitious, Vain-glorious, Self-seeking and Covetous of the Honours and Pleasures of this World; the lust and desire of these things hath possessed the minds of Men, and induced them to Envy and Wrath one against another, and hath filled them with Heart-burnings, and cruelty of mind, to the killing and destroying of one another, by Wars and Blood-sheds, and by Plots and Contrivances have sought how to extinguish one
another from the Earth, that themselves might be exalted: and thus from the desires that have warred in mens minds, have Wars arisen against the Persons of Men, and among them: and this is the appearing Cause of the Wars and Distractions that have been in these Nation, though the hidden cause (which hath not so appeared) hath been in God; and because of the wicked∣ness of Men, both high and low, and because of their Oppressions and Abo∣minations, which have been many and great in the World; therefore hath the God of Heaven been provoked in just Judgement towards Rulers and People, to suffer Men to destroy one another, and to execute Bloodshed and Destructions one upon another; and he hath brought it to pass, in giving up men to the fulfilling of their cruel intents, which have been hatched in their evil Minds, every Man against his Neighbour, and even because they have been departed out of his Counsel, and followed their own wicked Wayes, and Justice, and Mercy, and Truth have been wanting amongst Men in these Na∣tions; so that this is the principal cause wherefore the Lord God hath brought about and suffered these Wars, Distractions, Confusions and Discord in these latter dayes; and out of the justness of God's Judgments, because of the wickedness of men, have these things been. And now these Distractions, and confusions and Discords amongst Men can never wholly and truly cease to be, till Iniquity and Transgression be repented of, and turned from, which is the very cause wherefore God hath done and suffered these things, as I have said; and so Men must cease from Oppression, from Cruelty, and from all Unrighteousness, and must turn to the Lord, and become cleansed from their Sins, ere ever the Judgements of the Lord be removed, and these Distractions, Wars and Confusions cease to be in these Lands; and till Men become Meek and Humble; and till they cease to seek revenge one of another; and till they cease all Oppression and Covetousness, Injustice and Unmercifulness; and till they forsake their worldly Honour and high Titles, which puff them up in Arrogancy and Am∣bition; and even till every Man forsakes his particular Iniquity; till all these things be, Distractions will not cease, nor shall Settlement, and Peace, and happy Government ever be: This is certainly so; for except the Cause be removed, the Effect can never cease: and there appears to be at this day as great (if not far more) Dissatisfactions in the Minds of some People, than hath been heretofore; and it appears to be as far from Settlement and true Peace in an happy Union in Government, as for many years; though it hath been expected by many, that we should have Peace and Settlement in Go∣vernment, yet, behold it cannot be; for there are Discontents and Mur∣murings in the Minds of Men, and Unsettlement in their spirits, and the Foundation of a happy Government is not yet discovered unto many; nor do the People walk in the way of Peace; but Iniquity is abounding, Op∣pression and Cruelty yet lives, Hard-heartedness and Envy, Pride and Am∣bition, are not yet cut down, neither in all the Governours, nor in the Governed: and this is not the way of Peace and true Settlement; but it is the way of Troubles and Distractions, and the very Foundation of great Distractions and Wars, rather than of Settlement and happy Government: These things are so, and therefore true Peace and settlement in good Agree∣ment, who can expect? because the ground of Distractions and unsettle∣ment is continued and increased, rather than abated and removed amongst , and the true Foundation of Peace and settlement in happy Govern∣ment, is not yet raised up amongst men; but because Injustice and Oppressi∣ are continued, therefore will God be provoked to bring Distractions, Wars and Tribulations upon the Kingdoms of all the World; and God will found and dash in pieces, Powers, Authorities, Rulers, Nations and Peoples; and he will break one Potsherd against another, and overthrow
one Mountain against another; and the Hands of cruel Men will God suffer to devour one another; and ambitious and malicious Hearts shall be suffered to finish one anothers ends, because of their own wickedness: and therefore be not deceived; Blessedness in the Kingdoms of this World can never be, except Iniquity and Transgression be departed from; except Oppession and Hard-heartedness dye; and except the Foundation of War and Strife be removed, and the Foundation of Peace and happy Government be raised up among Men. Again, True Peace and settlement in good Government can never be, except the Lord alone be owned as Judge and Law-giver, and his righteous Laws to be executed in the Earth; that Justice and true Judgement may flow down, and all the contrary may be stopped and limtted by the just Laws of God; and all unjust and unequal Laws (made and established in the Ignoranc of Men) which have not been justly according to the Law of God, nor de∣pended thereupon; such Laws must also be made void, judged and cast out, and the Law of God must enter: This must be accomplished, if ever true settlement in a pappy Peace be amongst us; the Laws must be changed, the un∣just and unequal cast out, and just and equal Laws brought in; for because hereof, while unjust and unequal Laws have been executed in Judgement, therefore have we wanted settlement and peace in a happy Government, and the cortrary hath been, and will continue, till all unjust, unequal and oppressive Laws be discontinued. Again, If ever true peace and settlement in a happy Government be amongst men, Governours Rulers and Executioners of the Law must be just Persons and righteous Men, Men that fear God, and hate Covetousness, and that depart from every evil way; and all ambitious, self-seeking, and unjust Men must be cast out, even all they that have sought themselves, and not the Lord, in their places of Trust; such as have perverted Justice and true Judgement for their own corrupted Ends, and such as have been cruel and hard-hearted Op∣pressors; all such as these must be cast out, and the Law must not be committed to such to execute, neither must such sit in judgement over the People; for be∣cause hereof, and while such men have ruled and governed, and executed the Laws, no true settlement in a just Government, but the contrary hath been, even De∣stractions an Tribulations; and while such men do continue to rule and judge, and execute the Laws in any part of the World, we shall never have a happy Government nor settlement in it in this World; nor till just men, that have the Spirit of God, and sound judgement, that are humble and meek, patient and merciful, and such as fear the Lord, and walk in his Wayes, be called to rule and judge, and execute the Laws: and the Laws must be just and holy, and the Executioners of them equal and upright men. Till these things be accom∣plished, a happy settlement in this Worlds Kingdoms can never be, but God will dash one Mountain against another, and throw one Hill upon another, and he will give no Peace among the Kings of the Earth, but stain the glory of all the Worlds Governments, till Truth and Righteousness come to reign, and till just Laws be executed by just Men, and till Mrcy and Justice, Truth and E∣quity flow forth abundantly. Therefore all Nations, you have been deceived while you have turned up and down, from one way and manner and kind of Government to another, and from one sort of Governmten to others: sometimes you have been for a Par∣liament; sometime for a Protector; and sometime for neither; from each of these to others you have changed, thinking to have peace and settle∣ment in a happy Government, but it could not be; for there are continul Distractions untill this day in the minds of Mn, and they are yet unsettled in their spirits; and there are Heart-burnings, and nvyings, and seeking of Revenge; and while these things are, nothing but Distractions and Tribul∣tions;
not Peace, but Troubles, even till these things be removed: And till e have just and equal Laws, according to the Law of God, established over , and just, and holy, and Righteous Men to execute them in Judgement pon us; and till we have Truth and Righteousness sit on the Throne, un∣til this be, no true Settlement in a happy Government; but Distractions and Contentions, and woful Tribulations in the Kingdoms of the World, and amongst men▪ and this is certain, and according unto the Will of the Lod: and in the justness of his Judgement these things come to pass; for it is Injustice and Oppressions, and want of Mercy and Truth, which is the Foundation of Contentions and Distractions; and it is Justice and Equity, Truth and Righteousness, that is the only Foundation of Peace and Settlement, and a happy Government for a Perpetual con∣tinuance. To all False Christians. THere are many false wayes in the World, and many false kinds of Reli∣gions, and People are in much disagreement about their Church, Wor∣ship and Ministry; Papists are opposing the Protestants, and the Protestants the pists; and there is a great contention in the World. But the Papists are in a wrong way, and so are the Protestants too; and their Religions are both false in many things; for whilst they profess Christ and Christianity, and make a shew of Righteousness in outward appearance, yet many of them live in sinful wayes, and bring forth the fruits of Iniquity against the living God; and Pride, Cheating, and Double-dealing, Covetousness and Envy, Drun∣kenness and Whoredom, and all Wickedness is abounding and brought forth, both by the Apostate Christians, though they cry up the Name of Christ, and the Profession of Godliness, yet are they wicked in the sight of God, and they are not changed in heart and mind, nor do they know the New Birth; and ll such are out of the right way, in the way of Error, if they have the Form of Godliness, but want the Power; though they may have Mass, or say Com∣mon-prayer once a week, o oftner, yet all this is but Abomination and De∣ceit, whilst they practise Iniquity, Hatred, Back-biting, Lying, Drunken∣ness, and the like; they that act these things, the Plagues of God will be their portion, and Misery their end, and their Profession in Religion will not save them. The Day of the Lord is at hand, ye Hypocrites, ye false Christians, ye at profess God with your Lips, and your Hearts are far away: There∣fore repent ye, and treble before the Lord, lest h smite you with Ven∣geance: and forsake your false Religions, both your Mass, and your Is of Prayer; and be not Idolaters, in professing love in your mouthes, and honour with your Lips, wilst your hearts are departed from the living ; and now come to learn the true Religion: Depart from all Iniquity, and do not Lye, nor Swear, nor be Drunk, nor Steal, nor Murder, nor Envy; but love the Lord with all your hearts, and your Neighbour as your selves: And this is the true Religion, in which man may be saved; and live in Soberness, Meekness and nestty, and speak every man Truth to his Neighbour, and live in love  with another, and be kind, and gentle, and bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit of God; Cease to do evil, and learn to do well, and depart form all iquity, and follow after Righteousness: This is true Religion, and in it ou may e saved; this is the right way, all that walk in it shall have Peace
and Blessing from God; and all that walk contrary, Damnation is their portion. Therefore you Papists and Protestants (so called) turn from your Hypocrisie, and learn this way, and cease from your false worships, that are after the Forms and Traditions of men, and not after the Spirit of God; and learn to worship God in the Spirit, that you may be saved: You have a Light from Christ in your Consciences, which lets you see what sins ye are guilty of, and it reproves you for your sin: If you believe in the Light, and walk in it, that is the right way, then you will deny what is evil, and follow what is good in your Conversations; but if you follow what is evil, and act contrary to the Light in your Consciences, and repent not, Vengeance in flames of fire will be you portion. This is the day of your Visitation, the Army of the Lamb is gone forth, and the Sword of the Spirit is drawn amongst them, that will wound your Consciences, and God will smite you with the words of his mouth; ye Rocks, and Hills, and Bryars and Thorns, and fruitless Trees, the God of Hea∣ven will hew you to pieces, and pluck you up, and cast you into the fire to be consumed. Repent, for the Day of the Lord is at hand. By one that seeks the Good of all men, E. B.
A VINDICATION OF The People of God, CALLED QUAKERS, Directed Unto Roger Boyle, Called Earl of Orrery. Charles Coote, Called Earl of Mountrath, Theophilus Iones, Called Sir Theophilus Iones. Being an Answer to a Book, dedicated to them, by one George Pressick of Dublin. In which Book many Lyes and Calumnies are presented against the Innocent People of God. And this is for the clearing of the Truth, that no Lye may rest upon it; And for the Satisfaction of all Sober People in Ireland, and elsewhere. With a Word of Good Advice to the Chief Governours there. THere is Irreconcileable Ennity between the two Seeds, (to wit) the Seed of God and the Seed of the Serpent; and these two are alwayes opposite and contrary one to the other, in Nature, Fruits and Effects; and the seed of the Serpent is alwayes persecuting the Seed of God, in every Age and Gene∣ration; and they in whom the seed of the Serpent is living and ruling, are al∣wayes projecting and contriving mischief and hatred against the People and vants of the Lord, in whom the Seed of God liveth and reigneth; as it is written, He that is born of the Flesh persecutes him that is born after the Spi∣rit; Thus it hath been in all Generations, and thus it is at this day: Great is the sition that is made by many in Lyes and Slanders, in Reviling and Re∣hing, in Imprisoning and Persecuting, and in all manner of evil works  words against the innocent People of God, called Quakers: How have the hands of ungodly men been lifted up to smite that People by many kinds of abuses? and how have their Tonges been set on fire, to reproach, and revile, and slander in all kind of evil-speaking? and all this for Righteousness-sake, and not for any evil doing: For who is the man, and where is he, that can just∣ly charge Evil upon that People, either in Doctrine, Faith, or Practice? or in any ing relating to their Religion to God-wards, or in relation to their Conversations
and walking towards men? It is true, we have not wanted Accusers to every Authority, but such and such things have been falsly charged against us, and that to every Power that hath been since we were a People, under whom we have been a suffering People, even from all that ever have sitten in the Throne, since the Lord raised us up to bear Witness of his glorious Name and Truth in the World. Now the present occasion of this my present work, is, Forasmuch as we now stand accused of great and heinous Crimes in the view of this whole Kingdom of Ireland; and more particularly before you three, in a Book called, A brief Relation of some remarkable Passages of the Anabaptists in Germany, &c. published by one George Pressick of Dublin, and dedicated in a special manner to you; that his Work may pass with the greater Credit, and his Slanders and Calumnies, be received for undoubted Truths: Now that the Innocency of the Upright may be cleared, and that no Lye may rest upon the Truth, nor that you, neither any others, may receive Falshoods for Verities, because of our silence; there∣fore it is that the Lord hath put it into my Heart, to defend the Cause of God and his People, by returning plain and sober Answer to the principal part of his Book, wherein we are concerned and falsly Charged; and for the end that the false Accuser may be reproved, and his Calumnies returned into his own evil and malicious Heart, from whence they came; and that you, and all men, may be truly informed, and prevented (if possible) of being seduced into the belief of Falshoods, lest that your Hearts and Hands should be stirred up, to act or do, in your Authority against the People whom God hath blessed; and from the ground and cause of Mis-informations, and false Accusations, without better Testimony; which would be a way to destroy your selves, and to bring the unjust Sufferings of the Lord's People upon your own Heads, which would draw down the heavy Wrath of God upon you. I cannot flatter you by feigned words of guile, nor give you flattering Titles, but I judge you are reasonable men, in that degree as to hear and con∣sider our Defence, as well as our Enemies Charge; and I hope you are wise in that degree, as to judge between Truth and a Lye, and to distinguish one from the other; and I suppose you are just in that measure, as to receive what ye know to be truth, and to reject what you know to be false, being convinced in your own Consciences; and as such, I must place my Plea before you particu∣larly, and make my Defence to your judgement Seat [even to the Witness of God in your Consciences, I intend and mean] and I shall omit to say much to the Accuser himself, as supposing him, a man more full of envious raging hu∣mour, than of solid and wise judgement, to receive either reproof or conviction; for many such as he I have dealt withall in this case, whom I have found men so filled with Prejudice, that neither the authority of sound reason, nor of the Word of God, could convince them of their evil Proceedings; therefore, before you, I shall state the particular Accusations, and the Defence against them. The way in which our Adversary hath proceeded in his Accusations is ob∣scure, and yet malicious enough, and also in great ignorance; for he tells  in his Epistle, he hath gathred up out of several Authors, the most remarkable passages both of the Doctrine and Practice of the Anabaptists (so called) i Germany, . years ago, and then he charges the same things upon the Anabaptists and Q (as he scornfully calls them) in these dayes; and then he applauds you th  words of high stile, for being Instrumental to suppress their insolent tyrnical  Authority, which they exercise ever God's People in this Nation, to nslave  (saith he) to their insatiable lusts. These are his own words in his Epistle. Answ. In answer to all this, divers things are very considerable, which I desire to lay before you. 1. Concerning the Anabaptists (so called) in Germany; and their Doctri and Practices, with the several transactions falling out in that tim: It is not
my work now to plead their Cause, nor yet can I justifie them in their proceed∣ings, if the relations given of them be true, which are many, and to me seems not in every thing credible; because I find it were their Enemies, who are our Authors; who seldom give true Relations of such whom they hate: But be the Relations true or false, it is not material in this case in hand, for my occasion is not concerning a People so far off, as in Germany, and of so long time, as above a hundred of years; but I am to clear the Innocent who are now living, from the present Accusations of an envious man; though, if it were necessary; or would edifie, or were a matter of pertinency, I could say somewhat more concerning that Peoples appearing in Germany, but being a matter not suting y occasion, I do forbear it. 2. As for them, called Anabaptists of this our Age and Country, I shall not plead their Cause at this time, though I cannot believe that they are of that spirit of Murder and Tyranny, &c. as is reputed by your Informer; though their Judgment in every case, neither about civil or spiritual things I dare not justifie; nor may I lawfully clear all of them from a large measure of the spirit of Ambition and Covetousness, Vain-glory and Self-seeking; for which the Lord hath justly brought them under a just Reproof, and by this time I believe some of them may see some Error in their own way, and more I may not say of them, but that I believe the present Accusation against them, by your present Infor∣mer, is more out of bitter and perverse Emnity, and devouring Malice, that he bears towards them, than out of any other end; and I doubt not but they are sufficient to answer for themselves, and to clear their Innocency in things where∣i they are not guilty; and if they are guilty, let them fall in their Tryal: I leave them to speak for themselves, thus omitting any further Answer on their behalf. 3. As for us, whom in scorn the Accuser calls Quakers, and whom he hath accused as guilty in all things, with the Anabaptists (so called) in Germany, and in this Nation; I say, there is great difference both in Iudgment and Practice, in things, Civil (so accounted) and things Spiritual between us and them, as is well known; and were they fully guilty of all what is said of them (which I dare not believe) yet how can we be charged guilty of their Crimes, being they and we are different in Iudgment and Practice, as I have said: Surely your In∣former hath neither shewed good Conscience, nor yet pure Reason in his pro∣ceeding, who hath laid things to our Charge which we never knew, and hath accused us guilty of that which never entred into our Hearts to practise, and hath (as it were) charged other mens Crimes upon us, being wholly innocent, as will appear in the prosecution of this matter; and I hope to make it plain, that he hath wronged us, and abused you, by dedicating Falshood for your aproof, and sent Slanders abroad, as it were, under your Name or Pa∣age. 4. As concerning the Charge it self, included in these words, saith your In∣former; And considering how Instrumental your Honours have been to suppress their t, Tyrannical, Usurped Authority, which they exercise over God's People in  Nation, to enslave us, &c. In these words there are very deep Accusations, ders, and unjust Reproaches vented against us; and with what Face (except ent) we can be thus charged, is almost wonderful; especially consider∣ at we have been our selves a suffering People by every Authority, since  time the Lord raised us up, and never had any outward Authority in  Nation, but all were cast out of all Place and Power, both Civil and Military, when as they have become one with us in our Way, and this hath been the manner of dealing with us by all that ever have ruled; and yet we are charged most unjustly with exercising Insolent, Tyrannical, U∣d Authority in this Nation, &c. for its said, Their Insolent, and they exercise, to wit, the Quakers; when as it is manifest, as I have shew∣e, that we never excercised any outward Authority at all, but have been
suffering People by all Authorities unto this day: therefore I do appeal to the Witness of God in your own Consciences, how great is this Slander, and how false this Accusation, and how wicked is our Adversary in thus accusing us before you, in the things which you so well know are utterly and detestably false; and the Accuser and his Accusations are to be condemned together. 5. But and if it had been so, or should be so in time to come, that we had any, or all outward Authority in our Hands, (I may suppose impossible things, to manifest the truth of our Principle) our Principle is not to be insolent, tyrannical, nor to be Usurpers over God's People, to enslave; but far the con∣trary, even that Justice, Mercy and Truth may sit in the Throne, and that Peace and freedom may be held forth unto all; that no Usurpers nor Tyrants, but Iust Men, and men that fear God and hate Covetousness and every evil Way, that such alone may sit in Judgment whom God calleth to that Place; who will rule in Righteousness and Justice, and regard the Cause of the Poor and Needy; we would that such onely ruled, who were ruled by the Lord; who would be a Blessing in the World, and to all People; not desiring more Liberty to our selves, than what we would give unto all others in all just Ways. This is, our Principle, as to matters of outward Authority among men, and not as this false Accuser hath suggested out of his evil Heart. 6. As to the matter of your suppressing us, which your Applauder saith, you have been instrumental to do: This is as false as the rest; for we are no more suppressed than before, you exercised your present Authority, but are every way in as much liberty of Persons, and otherwise, as in their dayes before yours; and are no way suppressed, nor fearful of it: So the Author of such Lyes, hath but flattered you, and fawned upon you, in telling you, ye have suppressed us, whenas its nothing so: but and if it had been in your hearts, or be at this day, to suppress us, and to hinder us of our Liberties, and to persecute us, the Lord shall plead our Cause against you, and give no success unto your Work; but it shall be turned to our Renown, and to your Overthrow, and the secret hand of God shall confound you, and break your Purposes, and deliver his People out of your Mouthes; Thus it shall come to pass, ifthat your Hand sshould be stretched forth to hurt us, who are Gods Heritage, and the Sheep of his Fold. And thus much in answer to his Epistle. Now I come to a second Accustion of his, stated in his first page, in these words. We may see from whence Anabaptists, Quakers, Ranters, and Levellers, all had their Original, namely, from the Papists, &c. Answ. 1. As for the Anabaptists, Ranters, and Levellers, I leave them to plead their own Cause; and though we are accused with such, yet there is much difference in Iudgment and Practice between us and them; though I believe, they are all further from Popery both in Iudgment and Practice, than is this Accuser of them; but yet they shall answer for themselves; and I shall onely mind the matter I have in hand, which is, to clear the People of God, called Qua∣kers, from the Accusations charged falsly against them, whom I know to be innocent, from these false Accusations. 2. That we did arise from the Papists, or, that they are our Original, in D∣ctrine, Faith, or Practice, this is utterly false; for between us and them, is per∣fect separation, and we are of another spirit, and divided from them; as ap∣pears every way, even by their persecuting of us for our Testimony bearing against them, and their Religion; and they have written against us, and we against them, divers Controversies; and they have imprisoned divers of our Friends in their Dominions, for giving Testimony against their Wayes: by all which it doth appear, that we are not of the Papists line, nor arisen from them; for if we were of Them, they would love Us, and not perse∣cute Us; and that herein we are falsly accused, as in other Things: And this is an old out-dated Accusation, and is of no Account; for
now we are otherwise known through these Kingdoms, and we are manifest to the Consciences of men in the sight of God, to be such as fear the Lord, and walk in his ways. 3. And as for our Original, It is the Lord God alone that hath raised us up, and planted us a People, that were not a People in times past; and not from the Apostate Christians, neither of Papists nor Protestants (so called) are we sprung; but are of the Apostles Line, and of the Stock and Race of the true Christians, that believe in Christ, and follow him: and in every part of our Religion, both in Faith and Practice, and in Conversation, we are agreeing with the ho∣ly Apostles, being witnessed unto by the Scriptures in all that we profess and Practice; and the Lord hath raised us up out of the Apostacy, into which all Christendom hath been fallen since the Apostles dayes, whilest Antichrist hath reigned over the World; and we are as the first Fruits unto God and to the Lamb, since the flling away from the true Faith; and Truth and Righteous∣ness is our Original, and Christ Jesus it our Foundation, on whom we are builded, and the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against us: and this Testinony the Spirit of God giveth for us, and in us, in contradiction of the false Accusations of all our Enemies. 4. And if it be an offence to be risen from the Papists, and if all that be evil which they are the Original of; then the Protestants (so called) are in the Offence, and their Ministry, and the chief part of their Church-Govern∣ment, Worship and Ordinances are evil; for did not the Protestants spring from the Papists? and did not the Papists institute the Way by which the Protestants Ministers at Schools and Colledges? And was it not they that first Instiuted sprinkling of Infants, and calling it Baptism into the Faith, and into the Church? And was it not the Papists that first taught the Protestants to keep holy dayes, as Christmass and Candlemass, so called? and many other particular things relating to the Protestant Church, Ministry and Worship, were originally ordained and first practiced by the Church of Rome and Papists: and so while this false Accuser is charging others, himself and the men of his Way, are found guilty of the same things; and the Papists may justly say to the Protestants, that they are false: hearted to them, in denying of them and their Church, when as their Fathers were the Instituters of the principal parts of the Protestants Worship and Ordi∣nances; and so they, like unnatural Children, have denyed their Mother that bred them up, and ordained them a way of making Ministers, and maintain∣ing them, and many other parts of their Religion: But because she hath not been the National Interest for these many years, therefore the Church of the Protestants have denyed the Church of Rome, though originally they rose out from them. The next thing in his Book I take notice of, is, where he seemeth to charge us, with boasting that we talk with God, and God with us, and have Revelations, and as if God commanded them to kill all the Wicked, and to make a new World: a Sect in Saxony (saith the Accuser) arose that held this; and the Quakers now are like them: which is as much as charging all this upon us. Answ. 1 That we do boast of talking with God, or of Revelation. This is ano∣ther of his false Accusations; for we boast not, nor do we glory in any thing, saving in the Lord, and this is no Error, but that which we must acknowledge unto, or else deny the Truth, to talk with God, and God with us, in and by his own Spirit; for all the Saints have converss with God, and union and fellowship with him in his own Spirit, as the Scriptures do declare: and as for Revelations, we do acknowledge according to Christ's Words, that we had never known the Father, nor the Son, but by Revelation; For none known the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him, as it is written: and all such as have not con∣verss with God, and that have not Revelation, are not in the Way of Eternal life, but are ignorant and without God in the World, and neither know him, nor have fellowship with him.
2. As for killing all the Wicked this is another false Charge; for it is not our Principle to war against the Persons of any Men, and kill them with carnal Weapons, about Church and Ministry, and Religion, as the Papists and Pro∣testants do one against another; but it is our Principle to war against the evil spirit in men, and to smite that with the spiritual Sword of God's Word; and we would have mens wickedness killed, and their Persons saved, and their Souls delivered; and this is the War we make, even till men be changed by the Power of God, and all things made new; even a new World, and a new Earth we do expect, according to the Lord's Promise, so that it is no error to expect a new Earth, and a new World; for there is a new Creation which the Saints do wit∣ness, created anew in Christ Jesus, to bring forth good fruits unto the living God: and all that do not witness this, are in the transgression of the old Crea∣tion, which brings the Wrath of God. Again, The Accuser tells a story of one, that professed the Gift of discerning spirits, and to know the Elect from Reprobates, and that made holiness consist in speak∣ing little, and living homely and sordidly▪ as our Quakers do, saith he. Answ. 1. As for discerning of Spirits, that is a Gift which the Saints of God do receive in all Ages; for the Apostles said, to some was given the discerning of spirits, by the manifestation of the Spirit of God: So to profess discern∣ing of spirits, is no error in us, though it be stated as a great error before you, by an ignorant man, who knows not what he saith, nor whereof he affirms: And its possible to know the Elect from Reprobates by their fruits and works; for the Children of God (who are the Elect) are known by their holy and Righteous works and fruits; and the Children of the Devil (who are the Reprobates) are known also by their works and fruits of unrighteousness, which they bring forth; and this the Scriptures bear witness of. 2. As for speaking little, and living homely and sordidly: If he means, by homely and sordidly, plainly and without superfluity; this is also works and fruits of holiness; and its better to speak little, than to utter multitude of vain words; and its more justifiable to God and just Men, to be plain and homely (as he saith) in Apparrel, than superfluity of naughtiness in vain Attire, and more holy; for true holiness consists in the Power of God, which crucifies all idle words, and all superfluity in Apparrel, and whatsoever is not like God: And was but this Accuser as wise as he is envious, he would never be seen to scorn the Quakers (scornfully so called) with speaking little, and wearing plain and sober Apparrel; but Fools love to be medling to manifest their own folly, as it is written. Again, The Accuser telleth another Story of Muntzer, how he did exhort some that were on his part, (viz. Anabaptists) to kill every Mothers Son, for a Sacrifice to the Lord; and saith he, by this we may gess, if Anabaptists and Quakers should get the upper hand, what they would do, &c. Answ. 1. As for the Quakers getting the upper hand, we strive not for it by carnal Weapons, to have victory over mens Persons, though we know the Lord will give us victory and dominion over the Beast, and over the false Prophets; for the Lamb shall get the victory, and they that are with him, who are called, and faithful, and chosen; but this victory is spiritual, and obtained spiritually; and thus we believe the Lord will give us the upper hand, even victory over ll our Enemies. 2. But what a wicked envious sirmise and suggestion is here coutched under, as if the Quakers, if they had victory, would kill every Mothers Son for a Sa∣crifice, and that, they would make War, &c. The Lord rebuke his slanderous Tongue, who hatched Mischief in his mind against the Innocent, and presented you with forged Lyes and Surmises, and imagined & guessed cruel and evil things against us, who are far otherwise Principled than as he suggesseth: but all this his own doings, doth but manifest the folly of his own Heart, and  own wickedness; for we are of the Spirit of Mercy and Peace, and not of
Murder and War; not to kill mens Persons, but to war with the Spirit of God against spiritual Enemies; that mens Iniquities may be slain, and their Persons and Souls saved. Again, The Accuser, pag. 4. tells a long story of Micher Hopman, and others with him, what things they held, As they condemned the Baptism of Children: they would not take an Oath: they pulled down Magistrates: they undertook to kill all Princes: they taught, that in their Churches all were holy; and that it was lawful to have many Wives: that all Learning is prophane, and that mean men are fittest to ex∣pound Sriptures; and there must be no ordinary calling in the Church, but every man must speak as he is inspired: And thus it is (saith the Accuser) with the Quakers and Popish Agents, who are their Ring-leaders, have been endeavouring in these three Nations these eight or nine years by-past, &c. Answ. 1. It is to be considered, that all these things are fully charged upon us, as being guilty thereof, and so to every particular I shall answer. As to that of the Baptism of Children, we do say, there is neither Command nor Ex∣ample for it in all the Scripture, God never commanded it, nor did the Apostle ever practise it in their dayes, but it is a Tradition of the Church of Rome, in∣troduced into the World long since the Apostles dayes; and except better ground can be shewed for the Practice of it, than bare Tradition, it is law∣ful to deny it, as being no Ordinance of God in his true Church; except (I say) that it can be proved that God ever commanded it, or the Apostles and Saints practised it; till which be done, it is no error to deny the sprinkling of Infants, and to deny it to be the true Baptism into the true Church. 2. Concerning taking an Oath, we say, Christ Jesus commanded, Mat. 5. Not to Swear to all; and the Apostles Iames said, Above all things; my Brethren, Swear not: so that to deny to Swear and take Oathes, is according to the Com∣mand of Christ and his Apostles, and is no error, though the Accuser hath here charged it on us as a heinous crime; but we do deny all swearing, in obedi∣ence to the Commands of Christ, and our Yea is Yea, and our Nay is Nay, as Christ hath taught us, without an Oath; who hath commanded us not to take Oaths, nor Swear at all. 3. As for pulling down Magistrates, and killing all Princes, and that it is lawful to have many Wives: These are Lyes and Slanders charged upon us by a false Ac∣cuser; for our Principle is, to obey all Magistrates, and all Princes, in every thing, either by doing or suffering; and we would have Princes and Magistrates to rule and reign in the Power of God, justly, righteously, and according to the Law of God; and would not have them killed and pulled down: And we say, it's better to keep in the single chaste life, than to have many Wives: but any Accusation to make us appear vile, this your Informer spareth not; but according to his Work will be his Reward in the Day of the Lord. 4. Concerning all being holy in the Church: we say, That every Member in the true Church of Christ, is holy: for the Church of Christ is his Body, and every Member of his Body, which are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bones of his Bones, are holy, as he is holy, in kind and quality; and it is his Exhortation to his Saints, Be ye holy, for I am holy, saith Christ: So that to hold that every mem∣ber of the Body of Christ is holy, is no error, though it be so reputed by an ignorant man. 5. Concerning all Learning being prophane, and that mean men are fittest to ex∣pound Scriptures: I do say, that Learning in it self is a gift of God, and is not prophane; though as to the knowledge of God, and the things of his Kingdom, learning in Tongues and Languages, is little available; for it's the Spirit of God that teaches the things of God, and reveals all the things of his Kingdom; and none can know God, but as the Spirit of God discovers him; for the Di∣sciples, who were some of them unlearned men in Books and letters, had
the knowledge of the matters of God's Kingdom taught them by the holy Spirit: and such as have the gift of the Spirit of God, be they poor or rich, are fitted to expound and understand Scriptures; for none can understand the Scriptures, nor the things therein declared, but by the Spirit of God that gav forth the Scriptures; and it is not Latine, Greek or Hebrew that teacheth to un∣derstand the Scriptures, but it is the Spirit of God, and to whomsoever that Spirit is given (and God gives it to whom he pleaseth) they only are fit to declare the things of God unto others, and to expound Scriptures, and none else but them who have experience of the operation of the Spirit in their own hearts: and this we hold and believe. 6. Concerning ordinary Calling, and speaking as he is inspired: I say the Scrip∣tures no where speak of ordinary calling; and if by ordinary calling it be meant, calling to any Office in the Church, without the Spirit of God; I say, there was no such Calling; for the Ministry of Christ in the Apostles dayes, was called by the holy Spirit, and the Ministry of the true Church, is made, ordained and called according to the Gift of God's holy Spirit, which he giveth; And as every one (saith Peter) hath received the Gift of the Spirit, so let him administer the same one to another. So that it is manifest by the Scriptures, that the Call to the Ministry in the Apostles dayes, was not of man, nor by man, saith Paul, but according to the gift of the holy Anointing, the Spirit of God: and also every one in the true Church might speak, as it was revealed to them, for saith Paul, If any thing be revealed to another that stands by, let the first hold his peace; for e may all speak one by one, that all may be edified: So that it is no Error to hold, that every one in the true Church may speak as the Spirit of God gives them utterance, and to whom the things of God are revealed by the Spirit. 7. That there are Popish Agents among us, and that such are our Ring-leaders; this is a false slander, and you ought to put the Accuser to prove it, it is your duty so to do; and that such Popish Agents be named, and where they are: And I challenge the Accuser to name one among , or else let him stop his Mouth for a Lyar; who hath abused your Names, with dedicating Untruths to you for your approof. Again, He accuseth us for saying, The Spirit bloweth where it listeth, and he saith, we judge none have the Spirit but our selves. Answ. 1 Christ himself said, The Wind bloweth where it listeth, and so i every one that is born of the Spirit: And we do judge God hath given of his Spirit to many that are yet Ungodly, and many are convinced of sin by the Spirit of God in their Consciences, that are wicked and ungodly, who are not of Us: but yet we say, as the Saints in Ages past said, We know that we are of God, and that the whole World lies in Wickedness; and they that are of God, hear us, and are one with us, and we do inform all People to the measure of the Spirit of God in their Consciences, that they may come to the Knowledge of God, and to be one with us. Again, He accuseth us to be acted by the same deluding spirit as John of Leyden was acted by. Answ. 1. What spirit Iohn of Leyden was acted by, we now dispute not, neither doth this Accuser well know, but what he hath from the reports of others, which may be false as like as true in fome particulars; but the Spirit that we follow is the Spirit of God, by which we are acted in the wayes of Truth and Righteousness; and are not deluded, nor Followers of a deluding spirit; for we are willing to be tried in our Doctrines and Practices according to the Scriptures: and though we stand accused of these, and the like things, yet we challenge him to prove it before you, and that we may be admitted to make our defence; and we shall the rather easily prove that our Accuser is acted by the spirit of the De∣vil, who is an Accuser of the Brethren like the Devil; and that is a deluding spirit that teacheth men to backbit, ly and slander, as this man hath done; so
he is proved fully guilty of that whereof he hath accused others, and must own the shame and condemnation to himself, which he would bring upon others. Again, The Accuser chargeth us, That we would neither have King, Magistrate,  Ministers, but of our selves, &c. Answ. 1. I have before mentioned what kind of Rulers and Government we would have, even such as are just men, and men of Truth and Righte∣ousness, and that hate Covetousness and every evil Way; and such are of us, even such we would have to reign as are approved of God, who would be a praise to them that do well, and a terrour to Evil-doers; and that would only rule and reign for the Lord, exercising and executing his Righteous Laws by the Spirit of God; and such will be blessed in their Authority. 2. And till such only rule and bear the Sword of Justice in the Earth, we do know Peace and Happiness can never be in the Kingdoms of the World, but divisions and confusions will arise and be brought forth; for it is the only blessedness of a Government in any Nation, when the Authority it self is just ad according to God; and when such as bear the execution thereof are just Kings, Righteous Magistrates, and Ministers of Justice, that will judge for God and not for man, and we seek not the Place of Government in this World, nor do we intrude our selves into such Places; though this we say, while that spirit reigns and rule in the Nations of the Earth, which is not of God, but contrary to us, Peace and Happiness in good Government amongst men through the World can never be; though we are truly subject to whatsoever Authority is set over us, by doing or suffering. Then the Accuser speaks of teaching the Wayes of Righteousness, and saith, ac∣cording to this, the Quakers have gone through Ireland, and he speaks of God's Wrath following for hardness of Heart, and this (saith he) is just like the Quakers Do∣ctrines now. Answ. That the Quakers (scornfully so called) have gone through Ireland, and through many other Nations of the Word, to teach and preach Truth and Righteousness, this is true, and without occasion of an evil Charge against them for so doing; and the Lord hath prospered us, and been with us, to the turning of many from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God; and we have Testimony in the Consciences of many for the truth of our Doctrines and Practices; and this is not Error nor Heresie, to proclaim the Wrath of God, because of the hardness of Peoples Hearts; for that is the Portion of all hard-hearted men: and we are not ashamed of this Doctrine, for it is accor∣ding to the Scriptures of Truth; and but that this Accuser is given up to blind∣ness of mind, he would never have mentioned these things against us, nor used our Names in reproach in this matter. And lastly whereas he saith, some of the Quakers say, they are Jews, and are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan: and thou chargest Iames Naylor with ying, that he was Christ: and that one should say, George Fox was Iohn Baptist, and such false Prophets and Prophesies we have heard too much of, &c. Answ. 1 That they say, they are Iews, and are not, are such as have a Name to live, but are dead, who say and do not; but we are not such; so this his Charge is false and wicked, and of the Synagogue of Satan he doth ma∣nifest himself to be, by his accusing of the Brethren: And as for Is Naylor he never said he was Christ, through this hath been cast, as a foul Re∣proach, upon him by others, yet it never was proved against him lawfully, no any thing tending thereunto, saving that he said Christ was in him, as  i in every Member of his Body, according to measure. And as for the story of George Fox, there are many such lying stories that have gone abroad in these Nations, in opposition to the Truth of God made manifest; but over all these things Truth ath gotten the victory, and the Lord's Work must prosper in the Earth; and all Lyrs must be confounded, and have their Portion in the Lake: And this i
our Portion from the World, as Christ said. They shall speak all manner of evil against you falsly for my Name sake; but great shall be your Reward in Heaven: And this is for a Testimony against them, that our Enemies are of the Devil, and for a Testimony to us, that we are of God. And thus I have returned our Defence before you, against his several Lyes and Slanders, and its left to the Witness of God in your Consciences to be Judge in this Case, between us and him; and if you be cloathed with the Spirit of moderation and meekness, and will judge according to Equity, I doubt not but the Cause is clear against our Adversary, who wrongfully, and to a wicked and evil intent hath hatched Mischief against us, and brought it forth before you; and we desire nothing of Revenge towards him for his evil work, but do leave him to be rewarded of the Lord, who will justly give him and all men ac∣cording to their Deeds. And now I have a few Considerations to present unto you three in particu∣lar, as such in that capacity who bear rule in this Land. 1. Consider how that you are set in Place and Authority, and ought to judge and govern for God alone, and to be a Terror to all Evil-doers, and a Praise to all that do well; and the living God requireth of you, To do Iustice, Truth and Righteousness in the Land, to hear the cry of the Widow and Fatherless, and to judge uprightly the Cause of the Poor, without respect to your own self∣ends; and ye ought to be meek and humble men in your Places of Care and Trust which i committed unto you; and take heed that your hearts be not lifted up in the honour of high Places, and so Iudgment, Mercy, and Truth be neglected, and Oppressions and Cruelties be brought forth. 2. Consider, that if ye do Iustice and Righteousness, and walk humbly with the Lord, and exercise Mercy and Truth in the Land, and hear the Cry of the Poor, and deliver the Afflicted; then the Lord can make you a Blessing to your selves and to the People: But if you be proud and exalted, and ambitious and vain∣glorious, and exercise Cruelty and Oppression, and tread down the Poor, and vex the Needy, and grieve the Lord God by your Iniquities; then God will cast you down, and lay your honour in the Dust, and make you a Curse and a Reproach, and your Names and Memorial shall be a stink, and the justice of the Lord's Hand shall effect it. 3. Consider that ye are Men, and not God, and your strength flesh, and not spirit; and there is a God greater than all, who is above all, who can suddenly in a moment save his People, and destroy his Enemies; and he can break you down and never raise you up; he can turn his Hand upon you and all man-kind, as the Potter doth with his Clay, even tread it and mould it for honour or dishonor; and if his Spirit blow upon you, and if he smite you, you perish, and none can restore you: Take heed to this God, and have respect unto him, and re∣member you are but as Dust before him; and you now have a time for a mo∣ment, which the Lord hath given you to try you what you will do, and how you will walk towards him; an Account unto him must you give of all your wayes: Remember this now in your life-time, while you have time, and the day of your visitation is not quite extinguished. 4 Be tender and compassionate towards all men; not perverse, hasty and froward, thinking to bow men to your wills by rigour, but rather win them by love, and this is of good report to you, to be humble, meek and tender to∣wards all, even towards your Enemies; and insult not over the Afflicted, neither add to their Sufferings; for the Lord can raise up, and bring down whomsoever he will, according to his pleasure; and remember that Law to walk by it, Do to others but a ye would have others do unto you in the same case; and be not too cruel to such, who cannot conform to Times, and Things, and Men; for what know you, but some mens Consciences may be tender in things which you yet make no Conscience of; meddle not to persecute any for their Conscience sake in religious matters, but rule and govern well in outward
Affairs, according to the Law of God; but afflict not, nor persecute any for their Conscience sake towards God, while they walk justly, as men, in things between man and man: Take this Counsel, lest you vex the Lord against you, to destroy you. 5. Be moderate and compassionate towards this same People, that are accused be∣fore you; though they are at this day a People under Afflictions and Sufferings every way, yet shew not the height of Rigour and Oppression against them; though you have Power to imprison them, and to deal hardly with them, yet be tender and meek, and shew bowels of mercy and forbearance; and use not the extent of your Power, to seek their Destruction, lest ye provoke the Lord against your selves: for the God of Heaven remembreth their Cause, and doth give ear to the cry of their innocent groanings under their heavy Bur∣dens, and Deliverance may he work for them, whether you will or no; Though it be an hour of Affliction, and a day of great Tryal upon them, yet Wo unto them that shall be found adding to their Afflictions, by encreasing their Bur∣dens through Injustice and Persecution: Therefore as ye hope to receive Mercy from the Lord, and as ye would have his Compassion shewed to you, do the same to his People, for Power is in your Hands to be Merciful or Cruel, to relieve them or persecute them; and it is your day of tryal what you  do; ye have your hour to do Good or evil, and according to your Works will the God of Heaven reward you. 6. Consider the Innocency of this People; they are clear before the Lord and you of plotting, or contriving, or designing Evil again you, or this Go∣vernment, they seek not the hurt of any mans Person, nor do they intend Evil towards the Government or Governours; Who have found them agitating any such things? of all such things they are innocent, and are peaceable Subjects under the Government, and are perswaded in Conscience so to ntinue: And as for their Deportment in their Callings and Occasions, and Tradings amongst Men, ask their Neighbours; Do not they deal justly, truly, and equally in all their Dealings and Occasions? Do not they speak the Truth to their Neighbours in all Matters? and are they not Persons of upright and inoffensive Lives and Conversations? Do they defraud their Neighbours? or are they Drunkards or vain Persons? et the very Witness of God in their Neighbours answer. And if you should fall a persecuting this People, and seek to destroy them, concerning whom the Witness of God in Mens Consciences giveth such an Evidence, Wo, wo will be unto you; for you cannot hurt them, but you act contrary to the Witness of God in your own Hearts, which will condemn you in the Day of Judgment. So let this dwell upon your spirits, and be aware what you do; take good Consideration, lest you act out of God's Counsel to your own overthrow. 7. Consider what became of all the Persecutors of old, Were not they Emi∣nently destroyed by the Hand of God who persecuted the Lord's People? What be∣came of Pharoah? and what became of Hammon? and what became of Herod, who persecuted the Lord's Heritage? Let this enter into your Hearts, to be Exam∣ples to you, that you persecute not the Innocent, lest God overturn you by the Roots; for as I have said, The Cause of this People God regardeth, and he will avenge himself in his season of all their Persecutors; Have not your Hands dip∣ped in their unjust Afflictions, that God may bless you; and spare them, that you may be spared in the Day of Vengeance; if you have no matter of Evil against them in things between man and man, nor in the Affairs of your Government, as contriving against it; nor nothing but concerning the Worship of their God, and the Matters of their Conscience in spiritual things; Touch them not, Persecute them not, Afflict them not; but be tender towards them, as you will answer the same before the God of Heaven. These are only Considera∣tions of Warning to you: and I commit the Matter to the Lord; and ye have time to do Good or Evil, and accordingly will God reward you.
A Testimony concerning Government and Authority. WE are a People whom God hath raised up out of the Apastacy, Dark∣ness and Ignorance which all Christendom hath long been fallen into; for since the dayes of the Apostles many have professed the Words of Christ, and had a Name of Churches, and the shew of Religion, and have professed the Scriptures, but have wanted the same Spirit and Power of Godliness which the Apostles lived in; the Life and Spirit of God hath been wanting amongst the false Christians, and they have been persecuting one another about Religion and the Worship of God, and imposing upon one anothers Consciences, in spi∣ritual Matters; and Kings and Rulers have been setting up what kind of Wor∣ship, and Religion, and Church Government as they pleased; and they have imposed upon Kingdoms, and made people subject to them, to profess and con∣form to such a Way of Worship and Religion, some in the ignorance of their Consciences, and some contrary to their Consciences; and all this hath been in the Apostacy, since the Apostles dayes, while men have been fallen from the true Faith, and many have been subject to their Rulers and Governours by force, and for fear, and not for Conscience sake; for Love, Peace and Unity hath been wanting among Christians, and Bitterness, Frowardness and False heartedness, hath been amongst them: but out of all this the Lord hath redeemed us into Peace and Comfort with God, and one with another. And as concerning our Principle about Magistracy, and Government, and obe∣dience thereunto, this I do declare. 1. We do own and acknowledge Magistracy to be an Ordinance of God, instituted of him, for the punishing of Evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well; and we acknowledge all subjection to Authority, Magistracy and Government: This is our Principle, and hath ever been our Practice, known through these Kingdoms, that we are subject by doing or suffering, to whatsoever Authority the Lord pleaseth to set over us, without Rebellion, Sedition, Plotting or ma∣king War against any Government or Governors. 2. That Government and Authority which is justly according unto God in all its Statutes and Ordinances, we are, and do engage to be subject thereunto, by full Obedience to all the Commands and Injunctions of such Authority and Go∣vernment, whose Laws, Ordinances, and Commandments are grounded upon right Reason and Equity, which leadeth to do to all men as we would be done unto, and punish the contrary; to such Government and Authority we are readily subject in all things and cases; and we are for the Order and Assistance of such Govern∣ment in all Righteousness. 3. That Government which is contrary unto this, which is Injustice, com∣manding and requiring things contrary to the Law of God, and imposing upon People in Matters and Cases, contrary to Right Reason and Equity, whose Com∣mands are different to the Will of God; yet to such Government we acknowledge subjection, by patient suffering under all Penalties inflicted for disobedience to the Commands which we cannot perform by Obedience for Conscience sake: And this is our Principle, though an Authority and Government were never so Unjust in it self, and in its exercise, yet we may not plot nor contrive, or make tur∣bulent Insurrections to redeem our selves from such Government and Authority, but we must commit our Cause to the Lord in such case, of suffering under any unjust Commands of Men. 4. As concerning Church and Ministry, and the Exercise of Religion, We be∣lieve and acknowledge that Christ hath a Church upon Earth, and a lawful Mi∣nistry; and we are not Enemies to Church, and Ministry, and Gospel-Ordinances, as we are falsly reputed by Men, ignorant and slanderous; but we only bear wit∣ness
against the corruption and degeneration of the Church of Papists and Protestants (so called) wherein they are different and contrary to what the Churches of Christ were in the Apostles dayes; they are different and contrary I assert, to what the Churches of Christ once were in Ministry, (in its Call and Mainte∣nance) in Ordinances and Worship, in Discipline and Government; in all these things there is difference to what these things were in the true Churches in the Apostles dayes: And our Principle is, for the reforming of Mi∣nistry, Church Government, Discipline and Worship, and not to destroy them. 5. As concerning Imposing of Faith, and Doctrine, and Practices, and Worship in Religion by the force of Laws and Penalties, in the ignorance of mens Consciences, or contrary to their Consciences: We do say, This Practice never was in the Apo∣stles dayes, but is an Intrusion of Antichrist, and we bear Testimony against it, not to be of God, but contrary to him: And that outward Government and Authority in Kingdoms and Nations, is to be exercised over the outward man, in things between man and man, and not over the inward man, in things between God and mans Conscience in spiritual Matters, and Worship, and Duty to God-wards: No King, nor Ruler upon Earth, hath Power given him of God to exercise such Authority over the Consciences of Men in the Matters of God's Kingdom: And further, Religion and Church Government so set up and established by force, upon Pains and Penalties, can but reform a Peo∣ple into Hypocrisie and false Conformity, and not into any real Performance of Religion or Duty to God: And such Performance of Religion, Church-Fellowship and Ordinances is not unto eternal Life, but to the making of men two fold more the Children of the Devil. 6. We do believe, That it is the Convictions and Teaching of the Spirit of God that doth make men and People only truly Religious: It is that only that perswades the Conscience from all Evil unto that which is Good; and true Religion, and the Worship of God, and Duty towards him, is not truly learned by Traditions of time, Commandments of Men, or Custom of Countries, or the like; but it is the Spirit of God, and its Teachings in the Consciences of People, that leadeth into all Truth, according as Christ hath said; so that the Way of forcing Religion and Duty to God upon People by force and outward Penalties, this was never known among the Saints and Apostles of Christ. These things are presented to your Considerations; The Lord give you a right Understanding of them, and that you may walk in the way of your own Peace with God and Man. E. B. Written in the 10th Moneth in Ireland, 1660.
SOME CONSIDERATIONS Presented unto the King of England, &c. Being an Answer unto a Petition and Address of the General Court of Boston in New-England; present∣ed unto the KING (as is said) Feb. last, the Eleaventh Day, 1660. Subscribed by Iohn Indicot, the chief Persecutor there; think∣ing thereby to cover themselves from the Blood of the Innocent. OH King, this my Occasion to present thee with these Considerations is very urgent, and of great necessity, even in the behalf of Innocent Blood; hoping that my Work will find such Favour with thee, as to induce thee to the reading and serious consideration hereof. My Occasion is this, Because of a Paper presented to thee, called, The hum∣ble Petition and Address of the General Court at Boston in New-England: In which is contained divers Calumnies, unjust Reproaches, palpable Untruths, and malicious Slanders against an innocent People, whom they scornfully call Quakers; whom, for the Name of Christ's sake, are made a Reproach through the World, and by these Petitioners have been persecuted unto Banishment and Death: It is hard to relate the Cruelties that have been committed against these People, and acted upon them by these Petitioners; they have spoyled their Goods, imprisoned many of their Persons, Whipped them, cut off their Ears, Burned them, yea, Banished and Murdered them: and all this I aver and affirm before thee, O King, wholy unjustly and unrighteously, and with∣out the Breach of any just Law of God or Man; but only for and because of difference in Iudgment and Practice concerning Spiritual things; and without any Transgression of the Law of God, or their own Laws, saving, that they made Laws against them on purpose to spoil their Goods, imprison Persons, cut off their Ears, yea, and kill them; which Laws were made by them, without any Power truly derived from the lawful Authority of England, contrary to their Patent. And now, O King, these same men have presented thee with a Petition, in which is asserted very many extream Reproaches, as I have said, in Contempt and Derision of that People; and all this, as if those People were guilty of heinous Crimes, that it might appear to thee, as if these Petitioners had done no∣thing but Iustice in what they have done; and they seek to cover themselves, and to hide their Wickedness before thee, in what they have unjustly acted; and this
seems to be the Current of some part of the same Petition, already presented unto thee, like as if they had done no Evil, though they have Unjustly Banished,  off Ears, Whipped inhumanly, and taken away lives, as aforesaid: And they would have thee believe, they are Innocent towards thee, and towards us; whenas it is evident, as the Sun at Noon-day, that they are our Persecuters, and that they have justly persecuted us unto Death for the Name of Christ; and that also they are not unto thee as they Hypocritically feign themselves. And therefore, O King, for the clearing of our selves, and the Name of the Lord which we profess, and for reproving of their bold & impudent Insolencies, both in what they have already done to us, and now in seeking to cover them∣selves unto thee: And also, if there be any doubtfulness in thy Heart of these Matters, for these Ends and Causes, with Respect to the Fear of God, and Honour  the King, I hereby presume to pursue their said Petition, even unto thy Court, and to wipe away the Slanders and Reproaches of Ungodly Men, as much as possible; hoping thereby thou wilt receive due and just Information in this mat∣ter of proceeding between us and them, that thy just Judgment may be given accordingly. And I shall transcribe some few of their own words, presented to thee, and thereupon spread some few Considerations before thee also; and I pray God give thee an Understanding to judge justly in this and all other cases. The first thing that I note, is, whereas they say, That they have chosen rather the pure Scripture-Worship, with a good Conscience, in this poor remote Wilderness (to it, New-England) among the Heathens; than the Pleasures of England, with sub∣jection to the Imposition of the then so disposed, and so far prevailing Hierarchy, which we could not do without an evil Conscience, &c. say they. The Considerations presented unto the King, upon these words, are di∣vers. 1. The Worship, Doctrine, Discpiline and Constitution of the Church of New-England is different and contrary, and not purely according unto the Scriptures, in the Administration of the Gospel, nor in a pure Conscience, purely guided by the Spirit of God, though they seem to justifie their own Way and Case before the King; and this may justly be made appear in his Presence, upon good Occasion; only at this time I assert the Case, and if ever God gives oportunity, I may prosecute it with Proofs and Evidences, and that to the great Reproof of the Church (so called) of New-England; who are not only in Doctrine, Worship and Conversation contrary to the Scriptures, but impudent and too presumptious, to affirm their own Self-justification and Innocenc before the King, when, as it is manifest, as the Day is from the Night, that the Pastors and Members of the Church of New-England want the Spirit of God, that gave forth the Scriptures; and follow the spirit of Persecution, Violence and Cruelty, and are void of a Good Conscience, both towards God and Men. To prove this, there needs no greater Evidence than their own Deport∣nt towards the Harmless Quakers for these five years time; who, as I have said, have spoiled their Goods, and imprisoned their Persons, cut off their Ears, Banished them, and inhumanely put them to Death; and all this because of difference in Iudgment and Practice in Religious Matters, when as no manner of Evil could be charged upon them in the things between man and man. And if these be not works contrary to the Scriptures, and the Spirit that gave them forth, and contrary to a Good Conscience, I am yet ignorant, and must leave it to the Judgment of the King, before whom this Matter is brought to receive his Judgment. 2. Let the King consider, how they have ignorantly condemned them∣selves in the same things, for whith they have judged others; for while they seem to complain of the Impositions of the Bishops, which they stile prevailing Hierarchy; if it was Transgression in the Bishops in dayes past, to impose upon
these Petitioners, and to Persecute them for Non-conformists; how much more are these men guilty of Imposition and Persecution of tender Consciences? Nay, they have exceeded in the same Transgression, and become seven-fold guilty of the sins themselves which they complain against in others; for they have gone further in Cruelty and Persecution towards the Innocent Quakers, than ever the Bishops proceeded against them, even so far further, as the murdering of a man is more than cutting off his Ear: And the Cause of the Quakers towards these Petitioners hath been as Innocent, as ever theirs was towards the Bi∣shops. Oh hypocritical Generation! who are condemning of others for that where∣of themselves are guilty, and imposing upon others in a far higher degree than ever the Bishops imposed on them; witness their Law in New-England, which judgeth every man to pay 5s. per day, who come not to their Assembly; and imposing Fines of 40s, and 50s. apiece on such as meet together to worship the Lord; which are evident signs of an evil Conscience, as themselves speak. The next thing that I note, upon which the King ought to consider, the Pe∣titioners say concerning the Quakers, Open Capital Blasphemers, open Seducers from the Glorious Trinity, the Lord's Christ, the Blessed Gospel, and from the holy Scriptures as the Rule of Life; open Enemies to the Government it self, as established in the hand of any but men of their own Principles; malignant Promoters of Doctrines directly tending to subvert both our Church and State. By way of Answer to this, let the King consider; 1. The envious and detestable spirit of maliciousness of these Accusers, and how vehement and fervent their persecuting spirit is drawn forth with reproachful Tearms in the highest degree, like as if they could not utter sufficiently the Envy of their Hearts; or, as if they wanted words to demonstrate their Ma∣lignity and devouring Malice against that People, whom they in scorn call Qua∣kers; and all this to present us Odious and Abominable before thee, O King: I say but this of them unto thee, The Lord forgive them, if they have not sinned un∣to Death, and Unpardonably; I have no desire of Revenge towards them, but I leave Vengeance to the Lord, who will recompence in his season; neither do I desire to provoke or incense the King against them, only Duty to God and the King teacheth me, and Love Constraineth me, and an absolute Necessity pres∣seth much upon me, to spread our Denyal of their Bitter and Malicious Accu∣sations against us before the King, unto whom we are thus foully accused: And I say, I am confident, That the King hath better Experience of us, than to believe these our Malicious Accusars: And I do appeal to him, from the knowledge which he hath already of us, that he believes we are Innocent, and not guilty of those things thus unjustly charged upon us; and I question not but he will rightly understand that these Accusations are more out of Ha∣tred and Envy against us, than out of desire to benefit the King by such Pre∣sentation. 2. I do testifie unto the King, and before the whole World, That we do pro∣fess and believe concerning the Father, Son and Spirit, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Blessed Gospel, and the Holy Scriptures; I say, we do believe and make prefession in Truth and Righteousness concerning all these things; and by our Doctrines and Instructions do perswade all people to believe, and not seduce any from these Truths of the Gospel; and this is known through these Kingdoms concerning us, though we stand now accused falsly concer∣ning these Matters before the King. But as for the Scriptures being the Rule of Life; we say, The Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures is the Rule of Life & Faith unto the Saints, and leads not contrary, but according unto the Scriptures in the Belief and Practice of whatsoever the Scripture saith: And if these Petitioners did make the Scriptures the Rule of their Lives and Practices, for the denyal of which they here accuse us, they would not have cut off Ears,
Banished and put to Death for the Cause of Conscience, which is contrary to the Scriptures, and proceeded from another spirit than that which gave forth the Scriptures. 3. Concerning Government, our Principles and Practices are well known to many, and partly to the King; We are not Enemies unto Government it self, as these our Accusers do charge us; but it is our Principle, and hath ever been, and is our Practice to be subject to whatsoever Government is set up over us, either by doing or suffering; and neither to vilifie nor rebel against any Government or Governours, by any Malicious Plots or Contrivances; but to walk in Meekness and Humility towards all, being subject for Con∣science sake, as I have said, either by doing or suffering: and I doubt not but the KING is sufficiently informed hereof, and believeth this Te∣stimony. 4. As for our Doctrines tending to subvert both Church and State, this is also a false Accusation and Slander; for our Doctrines are to convert, and not to subvert; even to convert to God, and Truth and Righteousness, that men should live in these things, and forsake all that which is contrary; and this Effect our Doctrines have wrought in the World, as the Testimony of many Consciences shall bear witness. Oh let the King consider of our Defence, as well as of our Enemy's Charge; who have thought it not enough to Whip, most cruelly Banish, cut Ears, and put to Death the Innocent, but must still accuse them alsly, and seek to cover themselves by fawning and flattering Addresses unto the King, like as if they had done no Evil; whenas the God or Heaven is Witness, to whom we can appeal, That our Brethren suffered the Tortures of shameful Death in New-England (through their unjust Laws and Sentences) as Saints and Servants of the Living God, for the Name of Christ Jesus, and for his Truth, which they held until Death, and not for Evil-doing. And the Executioners of these in∣humane Cruelties seem so far from Repentance for their Evil doing, that they rather justifie themselves in what they have done, and cease not to smite, and wound and reproach the Innocent, and that before the King, and that after they have Martyred them. Again, These Petitioners say, After all other means for a long time used in vain, we were at last constrained for our own safety (say they) to pass a Sentence of Banish∣ment against them upon Pain of Death; such was their Dangerous, Impetuous and Desperate Turbulency to Religion, and to the State Civil and Ecclesistical, as that  unwilling soever, could it have been avoided, the Magistrate, at least in Conscience both to God and man, judged himself, called for the Defence of all to keep the Passage with the Point of the Sword held towards them; this could do no harm (say they) to them that would be warned thereby: their willing rushing themselves thereupon was their own act; and we with all humility conceive a Crime, bringing their Blood upon their own Heads. By way of Answer to this, let it be considered; 1. What Means was for a long time used, before they put them to Death, is shameful to mention; Was it not by the means of Cruel Whippings, Banish∣ment, Imprisonment, Cutting off Ears, and taking their Goods by Vio∣lence? Its true, by this Means the Petitioners dealt with the Quakers, and ne∣ver by any Christian like Means; for the very first of our Friends, that ever came among them, they made them Prisoners ere they came on shore, and inhumanely dealt with them, and Banished them; and this was the first and fairest Means that ever was used by them, which are not Gospel-Means, nor the Way by which the Church of New-England ought to have proceeded: Had our Friends been in Error, and such as they say of them, it had been their Duty to have gained
them by Love, by Mercy, and by Long-suffering; these are the Weapons of the Spirit of God, which ought to be us'd towards them that are in Error, in order to the converting of them from the Error: but contrary to this, the Magistrates and Church-Members of New-England took Cain's Weapons, and dealt Cruelly, and not like Christians, nor like sober Men towards the Innocent; but their thus proceeding was in vain, as themselves acknowledge; for notwithstanding, the Gospel of Christ grew and encreased, and many were converted to the Faith of Christ Jesus throughout New-England. 2. Let it be considered, what their dangerous and desperate Turbulency was to States Civil and Ecclesiastical; Did ever these poor People, whom they condemned and put to shameful death, lift up a Hand against them, or appear in any Turbulent Gesture towards them? Were they ever found with any Carnal Weapon about them? or, What was their Crime, saving that they warned Sinners to Repent, and the Ungodly to turn from his way? We appeal to the God of Heaven on their be∣half, whom they have Martyred for the Name of Christ, That they had no other Offence to charge upon them, saving their Conversations, Doctrines and Practices, as Saints of the Most High God; and this is witness'd by many of their Neigh∣bours, though themselves have hardened their Hearts against the Reproof of God's Witness. And we certainly believe, it was their Malice and Envy that constrained them to pass Sentence of Death upon them, and not the Equity of either just Law of God or man; for they deserved not the merit of Death, such was the Innocency of their Cause: And they are no more safe by the taking away the Lives of our Guiltless Brethren, than they were before; no more safe I say, but more lyable to the Justice and Terror of the Almighty, and to the Justice of the King, and the good Laws of England, for, and because of their Barba∣rous Cruelties: But, as I have said, we leave Vengeance to the Lord, and commit them to the Justice of God's Hand, which we doubt not but it will pass upon them in his Day and Season. 3. Whereas they would seem to extenuate their Crime of putting to shame∣ful Death the Lord's Servants; they tell the King, as if they only kept the Passage with the Point of the Sword held towards them, as if they had no intention to hurt them, and this the Magistrate did both in conscience to God and man: I say, It is to be considered what occasions were given them to stand in the Passage with the point of the Sword towards this People; Was it for any Cause on their parts, but as aforesaid, for reproving their Sin, and crying against their Wickedness, whenas their Lives & Con∣versations were Harmless and Innocent amongst them? I say, This was no just Cause for the Magistrates to stand in the Passage with the Point of the Sword, and therefore they were Unjust in so doing, if they had done no more, and pro∣ceeded in the way of insolent Usurpers: For what Reason had they to stop the Passage with the Point of the Sword, for hindring of as good Subjects as them∣selves to pass through the King's Dominions? Is not this derogating from the Honour and Authority of the King, for the sub-ordinate Magistrates of New-England to usurp such Authority over free-born People of England, as to prevent them from Egress and Regress in lawful Occasions in any part of the King's Dominions? And I suppose this will be found contrary to their Patent and Pre∣scription, delivered them by Charles the first, even this standing in the Passage with the Point of the Sword towards the Innocent, and imposing great Fines upon men that came o their Harbour to sell their lawful Commodities; if they had but the Name of Quakers, though no other thing could be charged against them, yet they were imposed upon by Fines and Imprisonment, and the Point of the Sword was held out against them; and all this I suppose is contrary to their Patent, and in De∣rogation and Dishonour to King Charles the second. 4. But to extenuate their own Fact, of putting to shameful Death the Innocent, they charge their Death to be a wilful Rushing, and their Death was their own Act, and their Blood was upon their own Heads: Concerning which, let it be considered,
they no more wilfully rushed upon their Death, neither is their Blood on their own Heads more then the Prophets and Apostles, that were slain for the Testimo∣ny of Jesus. But these Petitioners do plead, These Quakers (so call'd) knew there was a Law proclaimed against them, Sentence of Banishment upon pain of Death; but they would not keep away, but came again, and run themselves upon the Sword point: And af∣ter this manner of arguing they would make it appear, their Death was of them∣selves, and their Blood was on their own Heads; but these poor Evasions, and favour∣able Interpretations of their own Cruelties, ought not to cover them from the Justice of God, not from the Justice of the King; for its to be considered, That where God commands one thing, and men another, God ought to be obeyed, rather then men: and it is fully believed by us, That these Sufferers did not go into New-England in their own cause, but in God's Cause, and in the Motion of his holy Spirit, and in good Conscience towards God; they did rather suffer the loss of their own Lives for their Obedience towards God, than to disobey him to keep the Commandments of men: And this was the Apostles Case, when they were commanded to preach no more in the Name of Iesus; Did they at all obey it for fear of Man? And when the three Children were commanded to bow to the Image, did they do it for fear of Man? or, If they had dyed for their Disobedience of the Kings Commandment, could it have been said, That their Blood was upon their own Heads, and that they rushed themselves upon it? and this is in part the like Case, that our Friends suffered under the Injustice of these Petitioners, who would now cover themselves like men of guilty Consciences; But the God of Heaven will let them know one Day, and the King may justly do it, That the Blood of our Bre∣thren lieth upon the Heads of the Magistrates of New-England, and they are guilty of their cruel Death, for they put them to Death, not for any Evil doing between man and man, but for their Obedience to God, and for Good Conscience sake towards him. Again. The Petitioners say, The Quakers dyed not because of their other Crimes, how Capital soever, but upon their super-added Presumptions, and incorrigible Contempt of Authority, breaking in upon us, notwithstanding the Sentence of Banishment; bad they not been restrained, there was too much cause to fear, that we our selves should quickly have dyed, or worse; and they would not be restrained, but by Death: Nay, had they at last but promised to depart the Iurisdiction, and not to return without leave from Authority, we should have been glad to have said they should not dye. In Answer to this, it is considerable; 1. What these other Capital Crimes were, which the Sufferers were guilty of; here is a secret Charge of Crimes, without Nomination; and this is the part of Slanderers, to Accuse in general, without particular Proof; but this is still to extenuate their own horrid Fact, of putting the Innocent to Death, and that the King may believe better of them than indeed he hath cause: and the super-added Pre∣sumption, and incorrigible Contempt of Authority; what was it any more than that Unjustly and without Reason, they commanded them to depart, or if they did not, they should be put to Death? whenas no Reason could possibly be rendred for such Law & Commandment, but because they were called Quakers, and were different in Matters of Faith and Iudgment concerning spiritual Things; for, as I have said, No Sedition, Evil-dealing, Drunkenness, Lying, nor any of these thingt could be charged against them; and therefore the Law and Commandment of Banishment was un∣just, and could not be actively obeyed by our Brethren; but they returned again, not in contempt of Lawful Authority, but as they were moved, and upon their Occasions, which was lawful and just in the sight of God and Men, deporting themselves Harmlesly towards all people; and this is stiled, Super-added Presump∣tion, and incorrigible Contempt of Authority; but they must needs put a Good Name upon their bad Work, and render the Innocent as high Offenders as Excellency of Speech can demonstrate. 2. There can be no just Cause rendred, wherefore they should fear our Bre∣thren, except the Guiltiness of their own Consciences; for, as I have said, They
were never seen with any Sword or Staff amongst them, nor any Carnal Weapon, nor ever held Designs of Mischief; and for them thus wickedly to suggest unto the King, as if they would have killed them, or worse, this is Backbiting and Slandering in the highest degree, and punishable by the Law of God and Men: And its true, Them whom they have killed are restrained, but the Principles and Practices of the Qua∣kers (so called) have entred into New-England, and passes thorough the Consci∣ences of people without Restraint. And its a shame for themselves to mention, how all the Pastors, and the whole Church of Boston overcame Three Innocent Per∣sons, and what Weapons they overcame them by; not the Weapons of the Spirit of God, but the Weapons of Cruelty and Hard heartedness; even as Caiu over∣came Abel, and as the Iews overcame Christ, and so did the Church of New-Eng∣land overcome our Brethren: And this is all the Confession they can make of Re∣straining our Friends, That they cruelly put them to Death, and thereby overcame them. And it is not known to us, that the Court at Boston hath such Absolute Power, as that the Free Subjects of England may not come and return again and again, according to their lawful Occasions, without leave from the Authority of Boston Court; I say, this seems to be usurp'd Authority, rather than lawfully establish'd upon them by Charles the first; but it is apparent, and the King knoweth it, that in this case the Magi∣strates or Boston have taken too much upon them and proceeded further than they can justifie either before God or the King, in Imprisoning Whipping, Cutting off Ears, Banishing and Putting to Death the good Subjects of England, without either President, Example, or any power derived from the Lawful Authority of England. And we have cause to say, They were so far from desiring to spare their Lives (as they would suggest to the King) that they thirsted for their Blood, and nothing else could satisfie them, but the extinguishment of their Lives by shameful Torture. Again, The Petitioners fawn and flatter in these words; (say they) Let not the King hear mens words; your Servants are true Men, Fearers of God and the King; and not given to Change; zealous of Government and Order; we are not seditions to the Inte est of Caesar, &c. In answer to this, many things are considerable; 1. Why should the Petitioners seem to exhort the King, not to hear mens words? Shall the Innocent be accused before him, and not heard in their lawful Defence? Must not the King hear the Accused as well as the Accusers, and in as much Ju∣stice? I hope God hath given him more Nobility of Understanding, than to re∣ceive or put in practice such Admonition; and I desire it may be far from the King ever to condemn any Person or People upon the Accusation of others, with∣out full hearing of the Accused, as well as their Enemies; for it is Justice and Equity so to do, and thereby shall his Judgment be the more just. 2. They pretend to be Servants to the King, and that they fear him, and are not gi∣ven to change, I shall not seem to intrude into the Matters to which I am a Stran∣ger; but I leave this Case to the King to consider, what their former Actings and the current of their spirit hath been towards the King: I shall only instance one Particular, well known to me in a Letter to one Gurden, dated at Boston, and sub∣scribed by some of these Petitioners, where they say, There is more Danger in these Quakers (as they call them) to Trouble and Overcome England, than in the KING of SCOTS, and all the Popish Princes in Germany: these be the Petitioners own words, whereby it is manifest what the current of their spirit was against the King then, tho gh now they have chang'd their Tale, and call him High and Migh∣t Prince, and Dread Soveraign, and such like, and that they are the King's Servants, &c. whenas not long since they have signified by their words quoted against them, That there was Danger in the King of Scots (as they called him) and reputed him a Troubler of England; and numbred him with the Popish Princes of Germany, or amongst them: Let but the King consider their own words, and he shall plain∣ly read as well the temper of their spirit against him not long since, as he shall see their Hypocrisies and fawning Fatteries at this time; and he may fully perceive
that these Petitioners are given to Change, though they would make him believe otherwise. And this their Address unto the King is like the Approach of the uncir∣cumcised Gibeonites unto Ioshua, cap. 9. who wrought wilily and deceitfully, u∣sing the same words to Ioshua, We are thy Servants, as these Petitioners have us'd to the King; whose deceitful Address is equally paralel with that mention'd; the case is worth observing, Iosh. 9. vers. 4, 6, 9. 3. As for being zealous of Government and Order, not Seditious nor Schismatick, as they say; it is to be consider'd, that their Government, and the Order there∣of, is not only different and contrary to the Government and Order of the Churches of Christ, but different and contrary also to the wholsom Constitution of the ivil Govern∣ment of England; who have made Laws, and executed them to Banishment and Death, without any Power deriv'd from the Lawful Authority of England, which is absolute contrary to their Patent, by which they hold their Jurisdiction, which saith, They shall make no Laws contrary to the Laws of England, &c. I shall not Charge them in the King's Presence further of Sedition and Schism than himself believeth concerning them. Again, The Petitioners say, They could not live without the Publick Worship of God, and they were not permitted the use of Publick Worship without such a Yoak, Subscrip∣tion and Conformity, as they could not consent unto without sin, &c. In Answet to this, this is to be considered; That these Petitioners have laid heavier Yoaks of Subscription and Confor∣mity upon others than ever was laid upon themselves, witness their imposing Fines upon such as cannot conform to their Worship, some Ten Shillings, some Forty Shillings, and some Five Pounds; if any shall be absent from their As∣sembly, it is so much a Day; and if any keep any Meetings different from their Way of publick Worship, it is so much a Time; and these are unjust and il∣legal Impositions, and it is a heinous Yoak of Tyranny put upon the Neck of the King's good Subjects, without any Power derived in this case from the King. This they themselves do, and yet are complaining of such Impositions and Yoaks laid upon them by the Bishops; which were not comparable to these; which dis∣covers their own just Condemnation in the same Matters for which they accuse others. And thus these Considerations are presented to the King, in Vindication of that Innocent People, called Quakers, whom these Petitioners have accused as guilty of heinous Crimes, that themselves might appear Innocent of the Cru∣elty, and Injustice, and shedding of the Blood of Just Men, without Cause; being men of Guilty Consciences, upon whom the Terror of God, and of the King, seems to be, because of what they have done: But now let the King rightly consider of the Case between us and them, and let him not hide his Face from the hearing of the Cry of Innocent Blood. And for a further Testimony of the Wickedness and Emnity of these Petiti∣oners, and to demonstrate how far they had proceeded contrary to the good Laws and Authority of England, and contrary to their own Pattent, hereunto was annexed, and presented to the King, a Brief of their Unjust Dealings towards the Quakers (so called) which the Reader may see at large in the Reccord of Sufferings. E. B.
To all My DEAR COMPANIONS, In the Travel and Labour of the Gospel of Christ, And in the Faith and Patience, in the Sufferings for his NAME's SAKE. DEarly and Well-beloved Brethren, in the Heavenly Relation, and Blessed Immortal Birth, of which we are born most dearly in our Fa∣ther's Love; my Salutation extendeth unto you all, as one with you perfectly in Sufferings and in Rejoycings, in Faith and Patience, and even in all things which you do and suffer for the Name of the Lord our God; and my Soul greets you, and embraces you, and servently wisheth Peace, Love and Unity, and the Increase of every good Gift unto you all; for I am perfectly one with you; if you receive of our Father's Fulness, I am refreshed; and if you Rejoyce, I am glad; and if you suffer, and be in Heaviness, I freely par∣take with you; whatsoever is yours, whether Liberty or Bonds, whether Life or Death, I partake of the same; and whatsoever I enjoy, the same also is yours; we are of one Birth, of one Seed, of one Line, even of the Genera∣tion of him who is without Beginning of Dayes or End of Life, who is an High Priest, made after the Power of an Endless Life; and as he was blessed of the Fa∣ther, so are we, because we are of the same Birth, and are Partakers of his Nature; and he lives in us, and we in him. Well, my dear Companions, I need not multiply words unto you, as if you knew not these things; for, What know I, that you know not? or, What can I say, but you know the same? Yet bear with me, for my Heart is very full, and my Soul ready to be poured forth, that I may once more express a little quantity of what is abounding in my Heart; for Love, even perfect Love, even that Love wherewith we are beloved of the Father, filleth my Heart at this time towards all of you, from the least to the greatest; and I know nothing but Love towards you all; and I doubt not but in the same Love you do receive this my Salutation, which is from the Fountain of Love, which at this time is opened in my Heart. Now Dearly Beloved The present Considerations of my Heart are very ma∣ny concerning the great Love of the Father, which hitherto hath been shewed unto us; we all know, how that he called us by his Grace, and turned our Hearts from the Vanities and Evil-wayes of this World, and sanctified us by his Word, and put his Image upon us, and called us by his Name, and redeem∣ed us unto himself, and gave us the Testimony of his holy Spirit in our own Hearts, That we should be his People, and he would be our God; he taught us, and instructed us, and fed us, and gave us Peace and Rest in himself, and freed us from the Bondage of Sin and Corruption, and from his Terror because of sin, and he removed our Transgressions, and blotted them out, and ceased to smite
us any more; but brought us into the Land of Rest, flowing with Mercy and Peace, and Knowledge, and all good Things; this did the Lord our God do for us in the dayes of our Infancy, even when we were yet in our sins, he called us forth, and cleansed us from them; and when we were Stran∣gers to him, he made himself known unto us; and when we were wholly ignorant, he gave us Knowledge, and when we were not a People, he raised us up, and made us worthy to be called by his Name; and thus, and after this manner did the Father love us, and shew his Love unto us; this you know even as I do, and the Consideration of it causeth me thus to ex∣press it. Again, when he had thus wrought for us, and shewed Love unto us, he was pleased to call us out into his Work, to the turning and converting of others unto the Way of Life; he put his Spirit into us, and gave us Gifts of Know∣ledge and Utterance, and armed us with Wisdom, and Strength, and Courage, and every way fitted us for that work and service in which he hath carried us; he, I say, fitted us for his Work, and called us into it, and carried us on joy∣fully in it, and all this of his free Love, and infinite Power; and what we have been, and what we have done, it hath been only of the Lord, and not of our selves, even of his Love which to us may be admirable; for alas, what were we but Children, and neither Prophets nor Prophets Sons, and our Edu∣cation unanswerable for these things, and to perform this Calling? and there∣fore it is the Lord, and only him, that hath effected his own Purpose through us, and by us, as Instruments mean of our selves, but by him very ex∣cellent. Again, he hath mightily prospered us in his Work, and a glorious effect we have beheld of our Labours, and Travels, and Testimony; yea, the Lord hath been with us abundantly, and his Arm hath compassed us about, and he hath often given us great victory over the Wise and Prudent of this World; he hath made his own Word often very powerful in our Mouthes, to the wounding of the Consciences of our Enemies; and the Lord hath blessed our Testimo∣ny, to the confounding of the Wisdom of this World, and to the gather∣ing of many unto himself; and he hath gone forth before us in his Autho∣rity, and been alwayes with us in his own Work; and our Testimonies, La∣bours and Travels have been very precious and pleasant unto the Lord, and all his People; and the effect thereof causeth my soul to rejoyce, because the Lord hath been with us, and prospered us unto a great People, who have received our Witness, and accepted thereof unto their Salvation, and unto the Lord alone the glory of all this appertaineth. And for these eight years and upward, the Hand of the Lord hath carried us thorough great Labours and Travels in his Service; and many Dangers and Persecutions and Afflictions, have attended us all this time; and ye know that many a time hath the Lord delivered us from the Hands of such, as would have destroyed us; and we have been delivered again, and again, out of Dangers and Difficulties; and the Lord hath been a present help un∣to us in the time of our trouble; for the plotting of the Wicked, and the purpose of ungodly Men, hath often been broken for our sakes, even many a time have we been delivered out of the Snare that hath been laid for us; and we have seen our Enemies fall before us on the right Hand, and on the Left, even the Wise in their worldly wisdom, and the Foolish in their bru∣tishness, both Professors and Prophane hath our God often cut short in their desires, and endeavours of our destruction: and we have been wonderfully preserved unto this day, and all this I attribute to the infinite Love and Power of the Lord God, who is blessed for evermore. And through all these things we are yet alive, and the Lord doth not fail us unto this hour, but he lives and walks in us and with us, and his Testi∣mony
is with us, even the Seal of his good Spirit in our Hearts, that we are his Sons and Servants, and we are confirmed by many tokens, that he is our God, and we are his People; and that great Oppression which we have met with∣al, hath not restrained us, but thorough it all have we grown, and prospered unto this day: and concerning the things whereof we have testified these divers years, I am no way doubtful but our God will fulfil them, neither can my confidence be shaken by what is or can come to pass; for Antichrist must fall, false Ministry and Worship, false Ways and Doctrines God will con∣found, false Power and false Church the Lord will lay low; and Truth and Righteousness must raign; and God will gather his People more and more, and glorious dayes will appear; God will exalt his Kingdom upon Earth, and throw down the kingdom of the man of sin; all Oppression must cease, and the Oppressors shall no more be; and God will free his People, and they shall be happy in this World, and forever: These things have we prophe∣sied from day to day; and my faith is constant and unmovable, that God will effect these things in his season; for the Lord never yet deceived me, but what he hath said will surely come to pass. And therefore Brethren, let us be in Hope and Patience, and live in the Word of Patience, and not be faint-hearted, as though the Lord had for∣gotten us, or was unmindful of us, or as though he would not perform what he had testified of by us; for he is not a Man, that he should lye, nor as a Man that is given to change: But lift up your Heads; for the Lord is with us, even in our greatest Tribulations and Afflictions, and he will accomplish his Purpose; for he is mighty to save his People, and to de∣stroy his Enemies. It is true, the Gates of Hell at this time seem to be open against us, and we are a People like to be swallowed up of our Enemies, and floods of wick∣edness seem to over-flow, and the waves of the great Sea seem to be void of mercy, and the hope of our Adversaries is to extinguish us from being a People, and to destroy us from the face of the Earth; and the Hands of our Persecutors are highly exalted at this day, as though all that we have done for the Lord, by our Labours and Travels should now be made of none effect. Well, dear Brethren, though it be thus, yet our God can deliver us, and confound our Adversaries; and we can appeal unto our God, and can spread our Cause before him; and he knows that our Sufferings and Afflictions are altogether Unjust, and Unequal, and Unrighteous, and that our Perse∣cutors do afflict us out of their Envy, and without any just cause admini∣stred unto them by us; our God knows it, Angels and Saints know it, that we are at this day a Persecuted People for Religions sake; and this our pre∣sent Affliction is not any just Punishment, either from the Justice of God, or from the justice of men. For God hath given us the Witness of his eternal Spirit, that Wrath is not in him towards us; his Wrath be to his Enemies, but unto us is Joy and Peace for evermore: and the Lord clears us, and he justifies us; who then shall condemn us? he chargeth no guilt upon us, as if we were unto our selves the cause, by our evil deeds, of this our present sufferings, and as if this were come to pass upon us, as punishment from the Hand of God: I say, it is not so; these our present Sufferings are not out of God's An∣ger towards us; for his Love is to us, let his Wrath be to his Enemies: and as I said, neither is this suffering in the justice of men; for unto all the World we can say, (and God himself shall plead our Cause) whom have we wronged or done evil to? What evil have we done to any Mans Person? Whose Goods have we falsly taken or coveted? Against whom have we de∣signed Mischief? even the Lord himself be Judge between us and our Per∣secutors
in this matter; for unto him we are known that we do desire the good of all, and not the hurt of any, and yet we are dealt with as Evil doers, whenas the God of Heaven is Witness in our Consciences, that we neither plot nor contrive, nor agitate in thought or word the hurt of any mans Person; but we walk justly towards all, being our Principle to do to others as we would be done unto; and we can plead our cause unto our God, and he shall plead our cause with our Enemies, and this is the present state of our case; what we suffer at this time, it is singly in the Cause of God, and for Righteousness sake, and for the Testimony of Jesus, which we hold; there∣fore freely let us commit our Cause unto the God of Heaven, and if we dye, it is for him, and if we live, it is to him; and we seek not vengeance against our Enemies, but leave it to the Lord to plead with them. And dearly Beloved, I hope I need not exhort you to be patient and faith∣ful in this day of our tryal, knowing that the Cause is so excellent in which we are tryed, it is God's Cause, and not our own; and I hope you all have the Testimony of his Spirit in your Consciences verifying the truth of the Cause for which we suffer; and having that Evidence, we need not to be doubtful as towards God, not ashamed before-Men, if so be that every one feels the Evi∣dence of the Spirit of God bearing witness, that we suffer for Righteousness sake, and for the Name of Christ Jesus. And so dear Brethren, lift up your Heads, and be asd, that we are the Lord's, and in his Cause we are tryed, and he will judge and avenge our Persecutors in his season; and we shall be a People when the Egyptians lie dead upon the Sea-Shore, and when the raging Sea is dryed up, this sae People shall be safe; for hath the Lord done so excellent things for us? hath he led us forth and blessed us unto this day? and hath he preserved us hi∣therto through many Tribulations and Dangers? hath he shewed infinite Love and Favour unto us to this hour? And will he now suffer us to be de∣stroyed from being a People? surely no; Will he give our Enemies their hearts desire to cut us all off, that they may blaspheme his Name? surely no; and if it be the Pleasure of the Lord, that some of us should seal our Testimony with our Blood, good is the Will of the Lord; not ours, but his Will be done: for the Testimony that we have born for these divers years, hath been so excellent in it self, and in its Fruits and Effects, that the finish∣ing of it deserves the best Seal that possibly we can signe it with, which is indeed our hearts Blood; and this dwells upon my spirit: and yet, though it should be thus, my confidence is sure, that the Work of the Lord shall pro∣sper, and our Testimony shall be glorious forever; and this People shall never be extinguished from being a People. And I know not any thing that remains upon our part at this day, but that we commit our selves into the Hand of the Lord, living in the Seed of God, wherein our Election is sure, before the World was, and forever: and let us remember one another, and pray one for another; and let us stir up all the Children of our Father to Faithfulness and Patience, while we have time; I say, let us walk to the Glory of the Lord, keeping Faith and a good Conscience to our last end; our Testimony shall never dye, nor our Memories never perish when we are ceased to be; and though we suffer now the loss of Life, and all we have, yet the Effects thereof will be glorious in Ages to come, and our present Sufferings will hasten the Glory of God's Work throughout the World: Receive this as my Salutation to you all. It is now eight dayes since I left Ireland, where my Service hath been precious for the Lord, for full six Moneths; all which time the Lord car∣ried me in much Faithfulness and Diligence in his Service, to the confir∣ming
of many in the Truth of God, and to the converting of others; and through, and because of the Presence of the Lord, which was with me, I had a very precious time, and was wonderfully preserved through many Dangers and Tryals; and I travelled near two thousand Miles to and fro in that Land, and had very free passage in the principal Cities and Towns, till my work for present was fully ended there, having more time then could be ex∣pected to clear my Conscience to all People: and it would be too large to mention every particular Trans-action, wherein I perceived the Eminent Hand of God with me; and also many things I observed concerning the present state of things which I shall not now mention; for what have we to do with the Affairs of worldly Kingdoms? but as for Friends, it was well with them, they grow and increase in the Blessings and Fulness of the Fa∣ther; and when I came thence all was quiet, and very few in Prison, though (I suppose) the Tydings of things as they are here; will produce the same Sufferings upon them: But I hope they will be bold and valiant for the Truth, in giving their Testimony by faithful Sufferings, till these things be finished. Thus I remain in Life and Death, and when I am no more, in everlasting re∣membrance, your dear Brother and Companion, by doing and suffering for the Name of the Lord and his Truth. I am well, and at liberty as yet, E. B. 11th of the 12th Moneth, 1160.
A JUST and 1661 RIGHTEOUS PLEA Presented unto the King of England, And his COUNCIL, &c. Being the true State of the present Case of the Peo∣ple called Quakers, Truly Demonstrated and Justly Plea∣ded on their Behalf; for the true Information of the King and his Council, that they may well understand the Truth and Verity of doubtful Cases, and may shew Just Judg∣ment and Mercy. And this is laid down in Six Particulars, viz. 1. Concerning Swearing at all, and particularly of the Oath of Alle∣giance. 2. Concerning Meeting together to Worship God. 3. Concerning Tythes among the Jews, and among the Christians, and why we Refuse to pay them at this day. 4. Concerning giving Security by Bond, to live Peaceably; or, to an∣swer Accusations then and there, &c. 5. Concerning Government it self, and particularly of this present Go∣vernment. 6. Concerning Persecution, what it is in it self, and how great an Enemy it is to the King and his Government, laid down in ten Particulars. All which Cases are truly Stated and pleaded, and the Cause of the Innocent Vindicated. And this for the King and his Government, that they may be Just and Righteous, and perfectly according to God. The Epistle to the King and his Council. OH Friends! this is your Day that God hath given you, to try you and to prove you what you will do, and whether you will Rule, and Iudge, and Exercise your Power for God, or against him; and this is the Hour
of your tryal, and the living God that made Heaven and Earth beholds you, and his Eye is upon you, and he waites for Iustice, true Iudgment, Mercy, Righte∣ousness and Truth, to be brought forth by you in the Land, that he might bless you and prosper you; but and if the contrary be abounding, and brought forth and ex∣ercised thorough you, Blessings shall be turned into a Curse, and the Iust God will deal with you after your deserts; for the Reward of the Almighty is Iust and Equal unto all the Sons of men, even according to their ways and works; and the judgment of you nor of any is determined by him, but according as He is served, obeyed and feared, or the contrary. And seeing you have a day to do good, and to forsake all evil, to do Iustice, Mercy and Truth in the Earth, and to subdue the contrary; if that you do the things you ought not, and leave undone what God requires of you to do, and trifle away your time in matters of less value, and spend your days in Pleasures and Vani∣ties, and neglect Mercy and Iudgment in the Earth, and have no regard to the Cry of the Poor and the Oppressed, to deliver them from their cruel Persecu∣tions; if it be thus with you in this your day, Who shall stand in the Gap, to prevent the Anger of the Lord from breaking out? or who shall plead for you in the day of your Reward, when God himself ariseth unto just Iudgment, to judge all Flesh, and to deliver the Innocent? Oh Friends! is this nothing to you? Is there no cause unto you of consideration in this matter? Ought you not to lay these things to heart? Why, surely you are but men, and your Breath is in your Nostrils, and your Substance but dissolvable clay, and the God of Heaven and Earth can do what he will with you, and concerning you; if ye please him, it might be well with you; but if the contrary, he can answer your doings with an equal Reward, and none can prevent him. And here is a Cry, and a very great Cry of Persecution under your Au∣thority, the Prisons filled with Upright and Innocent Persons, to the ruin of Persons, Wives and Families, if the great Mercy of the Lord did not prevent  than the Iustice of men; thousands within these few moneths have been cast into Goals, and Dungeons, and nasty Holes; and divers have finished their Lives, and dyed in Prisons; many being taken out of their Houses, and from their lawful Call∣ings; and many taken out of Meetings, where they have been waiting upon God, and cruel Sufferings inflicted upon them, and all this for Truth and Righteousness-sake, and for their Profession and Practice in Religion; when as no plotting or evil-dea∣ling towards the King nor any of his Subjectes, could be justly charged and proved against them. And thus the Innocent have been made a Prey to prophane Persons, and their Sufferings have been woful, and all this hath been under and by your Au∣thority; And are these things nothing to you? or do you judge this is well doing? Is this Iustice and true Iudgment? Is this for your Happiness and Prosperity? Let the God of Heaven and Earth judge in this matter between this People and You, for the Cry of their Sufferings are very loud in the Ears of God, and they have been laid before you, and you ought to have relieved them, and eased their heavy Bur∣dens, and shewed Iustice, Pitty and Love, and this would have made for your Hap∣piness; but if that you always neglect to hear the Cry of the Poor, and of the Op∣pressed, yet God hears, and takes notice; and though this People should have no Helper in the Earth, yet He is their Helper, and their Cause is committed unto him.
Can these things stand? can you be happy in these Proceedings, while the Innocent suffer under you? Is it in your Hearts to destroy the Heritage of God? do you think to extinguish an innocent People from off the Earth? Must none wait upon God, and worship him, and pray to him, but after your Prescriptions and Limitations? And will you kill and destroy all such as do not? who cannot for good Conscience sake conform to every Way of Worship and Religion imposed, but must wait upon God, and worship him and pray to him according as his Spirit teacheth and guideth; will you, I say, destroy all such? Is it in your hearts to effect it? if it be, the God of Heaven will not prosper you in such Purposes; Will ye force men to forsake the Way of their God, wherein they have found his Presence? will ye persecute men for their Religion-sake, while yet they walk uprightly in their Con∣versations among men? Oh Friends! it is not Iustice and true Iudgment thus to do, it pleaseth not God, neither doth it unite the hearts of Subjects in true Love and Unity, but it hath contrary Effects, and that you may find. Indeed, according to my judgment, such Proceedings are not good Policy nor humane Wisdom, for you to seek to establish one particular Perswasion and kind of Religion, and impose that by force, and persecute and seek to destroy all the rest that are otherwise minded, if they will not deny their Principles and Consciences, and conform: this seems, I say, no good Policy among men; for if it doth gra∣tifie one sort of men in their desires, it discontenteth and dissatisfieth many more, and it breaketh Love and Unity amongst Subjects; and your safety is in the uniting of Peoples hearts to you, and one to another in Love and Liberty, and not in the Divisions and Distractions of People; surely this cannot be for your safety. When as if you did give Liberty to all that were peaceable in their Lives and Con∣versations, in the exercise of their Religion in Faith and Worship to God∣wards; this would cause all to love you, and none to be discontented with you in good reason: If one sort of People had as much Liberty as others (in the ways of their Religion I mean) and none more than others, this doubtless would encrease Content among Subjects, and be ablessing to you and your Authority; and to pro∣ceed in that way which may keep the People in Love and Unity one with another, and to you-wards, this were good Policy for your establishment to perpetuity; and there seems to be no otherway, than in shewing Iustice, Mercy, and Liberty to all in all right ways, and in the exercise of their Consciences towards God. And this is my Iudgment, the way for you to prosper, is, to leave the prescribing the Way of Worship unto God, as his Spirit shall teach and perswade the Conscience, and to leave the Iudgment in all Cases of Conscience about Spiritual Things unto Him, and not to meddle about imposing Religion, nor persecuting men for that cause, for it is not your place to do it; but you are to rule well over the outward man, and to judge in the Cases of wrong between man and man, but not at all in the Cases between God and mens Consciences. But you may say, Who art thou, inferiour man that seemest to advise us that are high and potent, and wise enough for our selves? Well, though it be thus, though I am so, and not much acquainted with the State-affairs, nor do I profess Policy in the Governments of this World, yet this I say, Whatsoever my Birth or Quality be, and whether I live or dye, yet these things you must find true one day; (for I speak not as a Politition but as a Servant of God) that your prosperity and Happiness in this World, and hereafter, standeth, in shewing and executing
true Iustice and Iudgment, and Mercy and equal Liberty towards all, without respect of their Title in the Profession and Practice of Religion, and in allowing Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Faith, and Worship, and Duty to God∣wards, to all Christian People equally in your Dominions; and not to persecute or destroy any in their Persons and Estates, for the Exercise of their Religion to God-wards: This is the Way of your Prosperity, and the contrary is the Way of your Destruction; if that ye persecute Men for their Conscience sake, and ex∣ercise Lordship and Authority over mens Consciences in Spiritual Things; and if ye prescribe a Way of Worship, and seek to destroy all that cannot conform thereunto: if you do thus, this is not good Policy to establish you. Well, I shall say little further, but that these things I write not as your Enemy, but as your Friend, who would you have saved both Soul and Body, and not as in any kind of Harshness in my spirit towards you do I write, but in Love and Compas∣sionateness to you and these Kingdoms. And I have here in brief stated and pleaded the case of the Innocent People called Quakers, who are at this time under great Afflictions and Tri∣bulations by your Authority; and it hath been in my Heart divers times to declare the Substance of these things unto you, but at last I have chosen to write my Mind to present to you, concerning the Matters very needful for you to be informed in; and it is for your sakes, as well as theirs, that I have done it, that you may not run on to act any thing against them upon Suspitions and Accusations of others, without hearing our Defence: and therefore it is, for the avoiding and stopping of Persecution in the Land; for this Cause have I taken in hand Submissively, and not Presumptiously, to state this Plea before you; and I must leave it to your Considerations, and cannot impose my Faith upon you, to believe as I believe; but having laid the Truth before you, I shall leave it to the Lord to work Faith and Love, and Iustice, Mercy, and all good things in your Hearts, that you may bring them forth in the Exercise of them in the World. London, the 10th day of the second Mo∣neth, 1661. I am a Lover of Justice and Mercy, Truth and Righteousness, E. B.
A Just and Righteous PLEA presented unto the KING of England, and his COUNCIL, &c. CHAP. 1. The Case Stated and Pleaded concerning Swearing at all, and par∣ticularly concerning the Oath of Allegiance. 1. WE do acknowledge our selves to be free-born People of this Kingdom of England, the Land of our Nativity; and we do assert, That we have just and lawful Right and Title, as such, to possess and enjoy our Lives, Liberties and Estates, both by the Laws of God and Man; having never unto this day, since we were a People, forfeit∣ed our Birth-right as men, by any Rebellion, Sedition, Contempt, or otherwise; but have alwayes been and are a People exercised in the Law of our God, by walking justly towards all men, and doing to others as we would be done unto, and have been and are a Peaceable People under every Government and Autho∣rity that hath been over us since the Lord raised us up. And I do hereby declare, That we now are and shall be Faithful, Innocent and Peaceable in our several Stations and Conditions, under this present Go∣vernment of King Charles the second, whom we acknowledge supream Magi∣strate and Governour over this Kingdom; and for Conscience sake we are obe∣dient and submissive to him, as such, in all his Commands, either by doing and performing of what he justly requireth, or by patient suffering under whatsoever is inflicted upon us, in the Matters for which we cannot be obedient for Consci∣ence sake, when any thing is required of us different from the just Law of God: And to this Subjection, to the King and his Government, we are bound by the Law of Righteousness; and such hath ever been our Principle and Pra∣ctice, and is unto this day, even to be Quiet, and Peaceable and Patient under every Authority that is set over us; and not in Unrighteousness, to Plot, or Contrive, or Rebel against any Government or Governours, nor to seek our own Deliverance from Injustice and Oppression, in such a way. And we are perswaded to seek the Preservation of the King's Person and Authority by all just and lawful Means, and not to Rebel against him with carnal Weapons; and so far as his Government is in Justice, Mercy and Righteousness, we declare true and Faithful Subjection and Obedience thereunto; and wherein it is other∣wise, we shall be subject by patient suffering what is unequally imposed upon us, and yet not Rebel in any Turbulent way of Conspiracies and Insurrections: For, our Principles are not for War, but for Peace with all men so much as in us lie; neither may we render Evil for Evil to any, but are to be subject to the King and his Government, Actively or Passively, upon the Conditions afore∣mentioned. And we renounce all Forreign Authority, Power and Jurisdiction of the Pope, or any else, from having any Supremacy whatsoever over the King, o any the good Subjects of England. And this we Declare, Acknowledge and Te∣stifie, in the Fear and Presence of God (to whom we and all Mankind must give an Account) and that without secret Equivocation, or any deceitful mental Reservation.
2. But as for all Oaths and Swearing, we utterly deny, for Conscience sake towards God, because Christ Jesus hath commanded Not to Swear at all, Mat. 5. And the Apostle saith, Above all things, my Brethren, Swear not, Jam. 5. And it was the Principle and Practice of divers holy Martyrs, even some of the Protestant Church, since the Apostles dayes, in all Ages, Not to Swear at all in any Case: so for Conscience sake, and according to the Example of Saints in former Ages, we do refuse to Swear, in this Case of Allegiance to the King, and in all other Cases whatsoever, and we cannot Swear at all: Though the Truth and Verity of all Things in all Cases, so far as known to us, and as Occasion requireth, we can acknowledge and testifie with Yea and Nay, as in the Fear and Presence of God, and with true Intent and Meaning, to dis∣cover the Truth, as is needful to be known: And in this manner we acknow∣ledge just Allegiance to the King and his Government (that we shall live Peaceably, and not Plot nor Rebel against him) according to the Law of God and a safe Conscience, but without any Oath, or Swearing at all; for we may not break the Command of Christ, nor walk contrary to the Example of the Apostles and Saints by Swearing, though we suffer the Loss of all because thereof. And it is our known Principle and Practice, ever since we were a People, that in no Case whatsoever, though of great Dependancy oft times to our selves, both in respect of Advantage to us, and also in avoiding of Sufferings, we have not taken any Oath, nor Sworn at all; whereby it is manifest, that our refusing chiefly to take the Oath of Allegiance is not because it is that Oath, but because it is an Oath, and for Conscience sake we cannot Swear at all. 3. And thus the state of our present Case, about this Oath of Allegiance, is different from some others, from all such who can swear and take Oaths in other Cases, to whom taking of an Oath in it self is not matter of Conscience; but as for us, we make Conscience of an Oath in it self, and that upon just Ground, as we are able to demonstrate: and therefore our Refusal of this Oath of Allegiance gives no Ground at all of Doubt or Suspition concerning us, as if we would not live peaceably and quietly under this Government, or as if we would Rebel against, or Plot to destroy the King's Person or Au∣thority, and so deny to take this Oath, as if we would leave our selves clear to proceed in such wayes: this Judgment cannot justly be given of us, because we deny to Swear at all, in all Cases; which if it were not so, but that we could Swear in other Cases, and not in this, then we might justly be the more sus∣pected that we had a reserve against the King's Person and Government, and our living Peaceably might be the more doubted of: but being our known Principle and Practice alwayes, Not to Swear at all in any Case what∣soever, this removeth all Ground of Jealousie, or Cause of Suspition of us in this Case: And also, we being ready to confess, all just Authority and Pow∣er to the King, to declare Obedience thereunto solemnly and sincerely, and that we shall live Peaceably and quietly under his Government, and not to Plot or Rebel against him, and this to confirm by Yea and Nay; our Testimony of this kind may as justly be taken, and stand as effectual, and be as faithfully performed, as the Oaths of any others; for we make Conscience to perform what we say in Yea and Nay, as much as any do to perform what they Swear; and this is known of us in the Consciences of our Enemies. So that in Good Conscience, and Just Reason, and Equal Justice, we are excusable from all Penalties and Forfeitures in that behalf, of denying the OATH of ALLEGIANCE. 4. And the King and his Government is not the less safe and secure, though
we refuse to swear Obedience to them; nor could they be any safer or securer if we, contrary to our Principles and Consciences, were forced by Penal∣ties to swear Allegiance; for, by the same Principle which keeps us from Swearing, and by which we deny it, we must be preserved to live Peaceably, and not to Plot nor Rebel against the King: and if we renounce our Principle and our good Conscience, and be induced to swear against our Consciences, what likelyhood is there to perform such a forced Oath, taken contrary to our Con∣sciences and Principles? For if we swear to the King and his Government, be∣cause of the Fear of Men, and to save our Estates, &c. and this contrary to our Consciences, it might well be suspected of us, that at Opportunity we would break such Oaths for fear of Men, or some Self-end: On the other hand, If we had already renounced our good Consciences, so that it more appears we shall perform good Obedience to the King and his Government, acknowledgd by Yea, without an Oath, and in good Conscience, then by Swearing, forced on us, contrary to our Consciences; therefore our Yea may better be accepted in this Case, then Swearing can be demanded of us. And also, If we should Change with the Times, and Renounce our Principles and Consci∣ences, and Swear, we should make our selves Ridiculous, and a Scorn to all men, and bring our selves into a capacity not ever to be trusted in any Case, if we should bow and bend to Times and Powers, and for Terror of en deny our Religion, as other Hypocrites; and I very well believe, the King would not trust us in our Allegiance any whit the better, but rather the worse, though we did swear, and fawn and flatter with him, contrary to our Princi∣ples; neither could he reasonably judge himself the safer, nor more happy, nor that we would be truly subject the more to his Authority, if we swore and conformed in things by Force, contrary to our Consciences and Principles; for himself knoweth, that Oaths and Engagements, made and taken by Force, and for Fear in Straits, are seldom or never truly performed, but alwayes broken. And of the like Case there are large Testimonies in the Kingdom, of many that have sworn, promised, and engaged, and sometimes by Force and Fear, to this kind of Government and another; and yet at Oportunities, and for their own Self-ends, have broken all Oaths and Engagements, and Re∣belled against the very Persons and Authorities to which they have sworn and engaged Fidelity and Allegiance; so that many are not the more to be trusted, though they swear Allegiance: For the Proverb saith, He that will Swear, will Le; and he that is forced to swear against his Conscience, will hard∣ly perform his Oath. And we are no less to be trusted, though we Swear not; for we never yet engaged our selves by Oath to any Governours or Government, and yet we never Rebelled, or Plotted against any; but have lived Peaceably, and in a Patient Suffering Condition under all that have sitten on the Throne since we were a People. And therefore our living Peaceably under the King's Government cannot justly be doubted of, though we cannot engage the same by swearing. But yet, if we do not live quietly, and in good Obedience, as Peaceable Peo∣ple; but do Rebel, Plot, &c. then we refuse not to suffer the Pains, Penalties and Forfeitures as such that swear, and do not perform their Oaths: I say, If we do not live Peaceably, but Plot and Rebel against the King and his Government; then let us suffer the same in every particular, as if we had sworn, and not per∣formed our Oath. 5. All these things rightly considered, it doth fully appear, 1. That we are not Enemies neither in present Action, nor future Intent, to the King's Person or Authority: 2. Nor that we refuse to acknowledge Just Authority to King Charles the Second, as supream Magistrate over these Kingdoms:
3. Nor doth it appear, that we are otherwise than Peaceable and Quiet People under the King's Government: 4. Nor is it manifest, but that we are ready to ac∣knowledge so to continue, in all Good Conscience and Righteousness. And therefore we do appeal to the God of Heaven, and to King Charles, and to all peo∣ple whatsoever, That our present Sufferings by Imprisonment, and whatsoever else, we may suffer in this Case, for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance, it is not for Plotting against the King, nor for refusing to acknowledge Just Au∣thority to the King, nor for denying just Obedience to him and the good Laws of the Land, nor for denying to live peaceably in the Kingdom under the King's Authority; because, to all this we acknowledge solemnly in Yea and Nay: Neither are our Sufferings in this Case for any Evil-doing, towards God or Men; but our Sufferings are for keeping the Command of Christ, which to us is Matter of Conscience to perform, more than to save our own Lives and Estates; and our Sufferings are, because we cannot Swear at all, and not because we are Rebellious, or that we deny just Allegiance to the King; and such our Sufferings are not as Evil-doers, nor Justly and Righteously as Offenders, because we are not guilty of Evil in this Case, towards God nor Man; and our Sufferings are Cruel Persecution for our Tender Conscience sake, and for the Name of Christ Jesus. And we call God and just Men to witness between us and our Prosecutors, that as Saints and Servants of God we suffer in this Case, and for our Faithfulness and Obe∣dience to the King of Heaven, and not for Evil-doing or Disobedience to King Charles, and his Authority. And if any be persecuted on this Case, for Refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance, to the Ruin of Persons, Wives, and Families in this World; then we shall have Cause to say, Occasion is Wrongfully taken against us, to de∣stroy us; and we are proceeded against contrary to the End of Just Govern∣ment, which is, To preserve the Peaceable, and not to destroy them: and contrary to the KING's former Promises, who hath said, We should not suffer for Matters of our Religion and Conscience, living Peaceably in the Land. And if we suffer because we cannot Swear at all, such our suffering is for our Conscience sake, and we are therein Persecuted Unrighteously, as Innocent People, and without just Cause: And we must commit this our Cause to God, who regardeth the Oppressions of his People, and will avenge their Cause in his season. And for the present this is all I have to say, and present, concerning this Case of Swearing, and concerning the Oath of Allegiance. CHAP. II. The Case Stated and Pleaded concerning our Meeting together to Worship God. 1. WE do Meet together in the Name of Jesus Christ, and in his Pow∣er and Spirit; and we do come together in the Fear of God, to wait upon him, and to receive the Teachings of his Holy Spirit, and his Council to direct us in all our Wayes, how to walk Righteously to∣wards God and Men: and in our Meetings we practice our Hearts and Minds in Godliness, and speak of the Things of the Kingdom of God, in Preaching the Word of God, and in Prayer to Him, according as his Holy Spirit guideth us, which is given us of God, to lead us into all Truth,
according to his Promise, Iohn 16. 13. and that we may edifie one another in the Wayes of Holiness and Truth, for the benefit of our souls; and this is according to the Scriptures; For they that feared the Lord met often together, and spake one to another, and edified one another: And this is our Principle, That it is our Duty to God-wards to meet together, and that he requires it of us, and for the exercise of our Consciences to him it hath been alwayes and is our Practice to meet together in the Exercise of the worship of God, as afore∣said; and not for any other End, as in Contempt of Authority, or to Plot or Contrive, or to Meditate Evil against the King or his Government, or any of his Subjects; we have no such end (I say) in meeting together: But our alone, only and absolute End in our Meeting, is to worship the Lord our God, and to serve him, and to wait upon him in obedience to his Will, and for good Consci∣ence sake as our Duty towards him. 2. And this our Practice of Meeting together, for the End and Cause men∣tioned, if it be in publick Houses, or more private in Upper Chambers, or in the open Fields on what day soever, is Lawful and Just in the sight of God, and is according to the Example of the Primitive Saints, and provable by the Scrip∣tures, as in Acts 1. 13, 14. And when the Disciples and Saints returned from Jerusa∣lem, they went up into an upper Chamber, both Men and Women, and Waited upon the Lord, and continued with one accord in Prayer and in Supplication. And in Acts 20. 7. 8. The first day of the k the Saints met together, and Paul preached unto them, and continued his Sermon till Midnight; holding forth the Matters of the Kingdom of God: And they were met in an upper Chamber, from whence Eutychus fell down. And Acts 28. 30, 31. And Paul remained two full Years, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, in his own hired House in Rome; and he exhorted the Saints, Not to neglect meeting together, as the manner of some was, whom he reproved, Heb. 10. 25. By which Testimonies, with divers others that might be given, it is manifest, that the Saints of God in former Ages did meet together to wor∣ship God, and to wait upon him in Prayer and Preaching, as the Spirit of the Father taught them, that dwelt in them: And sometime they met publickly, and sometime more private, and sometime on the day time, and some in the night season (and they met separate from the Synagogues, and wayes of publick Wor∣ship among the Iews) according to the Will of God, and as it was ordered amongst them. And thus it is manifest, That our Meeting for the Worship of GOD at this Day (though they are separate from the Way of Publick Worship of the Kingdom, and are in more private Houses) are justifiable, being after the Example of the Saints, and according to the Scriptures of Truth; and therefore our Meetings are according to the LAW of GOD Just and Lawful. 3. And forasmuch as by Reason of the late Insurrection of some few Per∣sons in London, our Lawful Assembling of our selves together in the Wor∣ship of God is under present Restraint and Prohibition, and by Proclama∣tion forbidden, under the Denomination of Seditious and Unlawful Meetings, and our Friends Imprisoned and persecuted for that Cause, of Assembling themselves to wait upon God. Now in this Case, this I plead unto the King, That we are no manner of way guilty of that Insurrection, upon which the Proclamation of forbidding our Meetings was grounded; and therefore ought not to suffer with the guilty, being Innocent from the very Occasion of that Proclamation: And for the King to prohibit our Meetings, for and because of the ill Use that others made of theirs, this seems a Condemning of the Innocent with the Guilty, which is no way just in the sight of God nor men, but altogether unequal that we should suffer for other mens Fault; though
such did abuse their Liberty, and pervert the End of their Meetings into rising up with Carnal Weapons against the King; so did not we, neither in Intent nor Action; and therefore our Meetings ought not to be prohibited for the Cause of other mens Faults and Miscarriages in that Case. And also, We have the King's Promise divers times, That we should not suffer for our Religion, while we acted nothing against the Peace of the Kingdom and Go∣vernment; which yet we never have done, nor made any ill use of our Meetings, nor of the King's Promises, nor forfeited them, and therefore, according to his own Promises, we ought to have our Meetings, and enjoy them without Restraint, because we have not forfeited the benefit of his former Promises in that behalf, nor ever made use of our Meetings to Plot or Con∣spire against the Government, to its Harm or Detriment; and because of our Innocency herein, the Benefit of his former Promises are yet in force unto us, to protect our lawful Meetings, and not to prohibit them: And though upon Suspition only our Meetings have been Restrained, and our Friends Imprisoned by the late Proclamation; yet we being proved Innocent, and without Guilt of that which occasioned it, the KING and Council may and ought in Justice and good Reason, to Reverse and Revoke that part of the Proclamation related to us, as being Innocent, that we may enjoy our law∣ful Meetings, according to the Scriptures and Example of Saints, and accor∣ding to the King's own former Promises. 4. All these things considered, and rightly understood by the King and his Council, it will appear unto them in good Reason, 1. That our Meetings are just and lawful in themselves, because they are for the Worship of the Lord God, and to wait upon him: 2. They are according to the Example of the Apostles, because the Scriptures prove the like Meetings: 3. And they are not contrary to his own Promises and Tolleration, that he gave for Six Moneths after his coming in, because he said, We should not suffer for our Religion, if we lived Peace∣ably; and we were not disturbed by Authority from him (that we know of) in our Meetings, till this Occasion: 4. It will appear, That we ought in Justice & Equity to have our lawful Meetings Protected and Preserved by the King's Authority, and not prohibited; because we are not guilty of that which occasioned this pre∣sent Restraint: but what we have suffered in this Case, it hath been upon Suspi∣tion, and without any just Cause on our part. And for these Ends and Cau∣ses I plead on the behalf of the Innocent, that we may enjoy peaceably our Meet∣ings for the Exercise of God's Worship, and not be prohibited in the King's Dominions under his Authority. 5. But and if we are persecuted, and imprisoned, and made to suffer for this Cause of Meeting together to Worship God, and Wait upon him, in Con∣science and Duty towards him, and for following the Scriptures Example, as the Saints of old, as afore-mentioned; we must only commit our Cause to the God of Heaven, and in Patience suffer under whatsoever is unequal∣ly inflicted upon us for this matter, if men shew the height of Oppression towards us; and we must put on the Spirit of Long-suffering and Forbearance, and leave Vengeance to the Lord, who will in his season redress our Cause, if that we are Persecuted for meeting together, and for Worshipping of the Lord, according as his Spirit perswades our Consciences; and such our Sufferings are not for Evil-doing, nor as Transgressors against God nor the King; but as Servants of God we suffer, and fot holding the Testimony of JESUS and a Good Conscience. And thus I have brought the state of our Case, as concerning our Meetings, unto the Kings Knowledge, and must leave it to his serious View; and Hap∣py will he be if he hath regard to the Afflicted; but if he stop his Ear from the
Cry of the Poor, and suffer them to be destroy'd, who shall plead for him, or excuse him in the Day of the Lord, when He comes to Iudgment, to reward every man according to his Deeds. CHAP. III. The Case Stated and Pleaded concerning Tythes, as paid among the Jews, and also among the Christians; and the Cause why we Refuse to pay them at this day. 1. WE do acknowledge, That Tythes, as instituted, given, and re∣ceived in the Law of Moses, amongst the Iews, and according to the Commandment of God, were of Heavenly Ordination, and were for that Holy Use and End of maintaining the Levitical Priesthood, and the Poor, the Wid∣dows, and the Strangers in Israel; and we know, that whilst that Levitical Priesthood of Signs, and Types and Figures, was yet unfinished and unful∣filled by Christ Jesus the Everlasting Priest, that Law that gave and recei∣ved Tythes was in force; and it was sinful against God, and contrary to his Law, in any of Israel to with-hold their Tythes, and not to pay them, and such as did robbed God and the Poor, and the Prophet complained against them; for then the Ordination of Tythes was of God, and the Practice and End of them was good and blessed. But that Law and Priesthood, that gave and received them, is finished and ended, with all the Types and Shadows of the first Covenant, Heb. 7. 12. and Christ Jesus the everlasting Priest of God is come, in whom is ended the first Priest∣hood that took Tythes, and that Law that gave them; and he hath put an end to Tythes, Temples, Priests-Office under the Law among the Iews, and all   Types and Figures, and First Covenant, and is an High-Priest forever, and the Everlasting Substance of all Shadows pertaining to the first Covenant, and hath finished them, and ended them, even that Law and Ordinance that gave and received Tythes, and that Priesthood to whom Tythes pertained; so that though it was Unlawful in the first Covenant, to with-hold the payment of Tythes, yet that Covenant being ended, and that Law and Priesthood, and another Covenant and Priesthood established, to whom the Law of God allows not the Tythes of mens Estates, it seems now to be unlawful to pay, receive or demand Tythes, and for good Conscience sake we cannot do it. 2. We cannot now pay Tythes, according to the first Covenant, nor uphold any part of the first Priesthood, that stood in Types and Shadows, nor sub∣mit to that Law, by any Obedience to it, which once gave and received Tythes; seeing Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, who hath ended all that Cove∣nant, with every thing that pertaineth thereunto: and we believe in Jesus Christ as the Everlasting Substance, and receive the Law, by which we walk in all things unto him, and not from Abraham nor Moses: For he is with us that is greater then they, whose Law and Example we must follow in the Administration of the Go∣spel, and not the Law and Example of Abraham and Moses in the First Covenant, who did but Prophesie of Christ, and did not witness him fully come, but dyed in the Faith. Now if we should pay Tythes according to the First Covenant and so uphold any part of that Priesthood, which took Tythes, which was but a Type of Christ the Everlasting PRIEST then we should deny Jesus Christ to be come in the Flesh, and turn back again to the
Law, and to the Iews Ordinances, and prove our selves Unbelievers and An∣tichristian; for he that denies Christ to be come in the Flesh is an Antichrist, 1 Iohn 4. 3. and we may as well turn back to Circumcision, Sacrifices, and Burnt-Offerings, as to pay Tythes, being all pertaining to the First Cove∣nant and Priesthood; which whomsoever doth uphold, denieth Jesus Christ to be come in the Flesh, and so are of Antichrist: But we believe, Christ is come, and we have received him as the End and Finishing of the first Priest∣hood; and we believe in him as the Everlasting Substance, who hath put an end to Tythes, Temples, Burnt-Offerings, &c. and we confess unto him as our Judge and Law-giver, and have renounced all Shaddows pertaining to the first Covenant, where∣of one was Tythes; and for Conscience sake, and that we may continue in the Faith of Christ, the Substance, and not deny him; therefore it is that we refuse and cannot pay Tythes; for, we are Christians; and Believers, and not Iews, nor Children of the first Covenant. 3. And there is no Example by any of the Apostles or Saints, in all the New Testament, That ever any of the Christians, that believed in Jesus Christ, gave, paid, or receiv'd Tythes: I say, There is no Example at all, by either Precept or Practice, let us on Record, That any of the Ministers of the Gospel, in the Apo∣stles dayes, did pay or receive Tythes for any Ministerial Office, nor otherwise. But we do ve, That none of the Christians, in the first nor second Age after Christ, since his Resurrection, did institute, pay or receive Tythes as Maintenance of Go∣spel-Ministry: But we believe, That the Ministers of Christ, whom he sent forth to preach the Gospel after his Ascention, did bear witness to the New Co∣venant, and to Jesus Christ the Substance; and against Temple, Sacrifices, Tythes and first Priesthood, and the Worship of the first Covenant; and said, That Covenant was falty, and none could attain Perfection, as pertaining to the Conscience, in it; and therefore God took that Covenant away, that he might establish a better, Heb. 8. 6, 7. Heb. 6. 19. And also, Divers of the holy Martyrs, since the Apostles dayes, as William Thors, and others, Did preach down Tythes, and denyed the Payment of them; and for Conscience sake to God could neither give nor receive Tythes, but fully witnessed against them, though they suffered for it in their dayes. So that, 1st, We have no Example from the Apostles nor Christians in their dayes, to pay Tythes, but rather the contrary; for we have Testimony from them, That the first ovenant and Priesthood, with all Shaddows and Ordinances thereunto belong∣ing (whereof Tythes was one) were disanulled, finished and ended by the coming of Christ; and a new Covenant established, in which nothing is signified of paying Ts: From whence it may appear to all, that Tythes are ended, and not to be paid in the New Covenant. 2d, We have clear Example from the Martyrs, since the Apostles dayes, not to pa Tthes; for divers of the Protestant Martyrs (call'd, the Fathers of their Church) did  against Tythes, and refused to pay any. 3d, We believe in our own Consciences, That Tythes, as receiv'd and paid in  , are not of any Institution of God, nor exercised to any good Use and End;  t they are of Antichrist, and Oppression, and Unjust Exactions, and Impositi∣ons upon the poor People of these Kingdoms; and therefore we do refuse to pay Tythes, and we cannot for good Conscience sake: And the Exercise of our Consciences here∣in, in denying to pay Tythes, is well and lawfully grounded upon the Coming of Christ, and upon the Example of the Apostles and Martyrs. And thus in brief I have shewed concerning Tythes, and why we refuse to pay them, and the matter of our Consciences in that Case. 4. As for Tythes, as now demanded, paid and received in these Kingdoms, we know they are not of heavenly Institution, nor for a good use and end or∣dained
and practised, but as they are now paid, both in these Kingdoms, and through Christendom, they are of Popish Institution, and were first ordained, paid, and received by the Authority of the Church of Rome, and were unequally im∣posed upon the Nations through her Authority, for the use and end to maintain her Priests, and Clergy, and Church; and the Institution and payment of Tythes among Christians, was not till near 400. Years after Christ, as Hystorians say; and for divers Ages after that, there were no Laws enjoyning and forcing the payment of them, not till about the Year, 786. that Pope Adrian the first, sent two Legates into England, to make a Decree, that the People of two Kingdoms (to wit) Merce-land and Northumberland, should pay Tythes. By these and other Testimonies it is manifest, that the payment of Tythes amongst Christians, had their first Original from the Church of Rome, and by Succession from thence, and not from the Apostles, are Tythes paid, given and received at this day in these Kingdoms; and the Institution, payment, and use, and end of them, is not according to the Law of Moses at all: for Tythes, as then amongst the Iews ordained and paid, were for the happy use, to feed the Poor, the Widdows and the Fa∣therless in Israel, that there should not be a Beggar amongst them: But the use and end of the payment of them now in these dayes, is for the maintaining a company of Priests, in their Pride and Fulness, and the Poor and the Strangers may starve, and lie begging up and down at the corners of the Streets; so that we cannot for Conscience sake at this day pay Tythes. 1. Because the first Institution of them among Christians, was not from Hea∣ven, nor from Christ Iesus, nor his Apostles, but from the Pope and Church of Rome. 2. Because the use and end of Tythes is not according to God, nor Righteousness; but for the maintaining the Priests in Pride and Fulness, and their Families; and in the mean time the Poor want. 3. Because the continued payment of them, is Exaction and Imposition, contrary to the Gospel of Liberty and Peace, upon the Persons, Estates, and Consciences, of many good People in these Kingdoms. 5. All these things rightly and justly considered, it is manifest, and plainly apparent to all good men, that this matter of denying to pay Tythes, is a clear case of Conscience with us, and that we have sufficient ground to make Consci∣ence hereof, and for good Conscience sake we may justly refuse and deny to pay Tythes; and the exercise of our Consciente herein is bottomed upon a right Foundation, as I have made appear; and it is not for Covetousness to our selves, nor in contempt of Authority, nor in wilfulness to wrong any man of his just Right, nor for any other evil end, that we do refuse to pay Tythes; but it is for Conscience sake, only and alone for that end, that we may keep our Consciences clear in the sight of God, by our Faithfulness, in denying of what we are con∣vinced of to be evil and not of God, as I have shewed we are in this case of Tythes; and we dare not sin against God by disobedience to him, nor uphold the payment of Tythes in these Kingdoms, which are so evil, both in their Or∣dination, and in their Use and End, as paid in these days, as I have shewed; for if we should, we might offend his Spirit, and our own Consciences, and bring anguish upon our Souls, and be guilty of denying of Christ and his coming, and of making void the New Covenant; and of walking contrary to the Examples of the Apostles and holy Martyrs, and of upholding Antichrist and his Kingdom: These, with many other Evils, we run our selves into, if we should pay Tythes in these days, and after the Romish Institution; and therefore it is for Consci∣ence sake that we do refuse to pay Tythes: And whatsoever we do suffer because thereof, it is Persecution, and for, and because we cannot sin against our God: and it is not for Evil doing, for Rebellion, nor for Transgression against the Law of God, nor the just Laws of men; but it is for holding the Testimony of Iesus and a good Conscience; and in such our Sufferings, we commit our Cause to the
God of Heaven, patiently bearing what is unequally inflicted upon us for this matter, and our Cause is Iust and Innocent for which we suffer, and we have more respect to keep our Faith and Conscience towards God, than to save our Estates or Liberties; for could we transgress against God, and pay Tythes, we might preserve our Liberties and Estates, which we have endangered and lost often, because we could not; which may shew that it is not for Covetousness nor self-ends, that we refuse to do it: And this our Case about Tythes, and the rea∣son why we cannot pay them, is in brief stated and pleaded, before the King and his Council, and I leave it to their Considerations in the sight of God, only to warn them, that they persecute not any for the Cases of Conscience, neither in this nor in any other thing, lest the Effect of it be sad upon them in a day when God visits them with Judgments. CHAP. IV. The Case stated and pleaded, concerning giving Security by Bond, to live peaceably, or to answer Cases then and there, &c. as is often required of us. 1. FOrasmuch as we are often demanded, to give Bond of one or two hundred Pounds (or the like) for security (so called) That we will live peaceably; or, that we will appear and answer such Cases objected against us, or supposed of us. Now we cannot give such kind of formal Engagements out of the Council of God, to be or do, or appear, or answer, that, or the other Case, when as we are no Trans∣gssors in the things objected against us, and supposed of us; and when we are cted by prejudiced minds of such and such matters, of which we are no  guilty in the sight of God nor men; and then it is demanded of us, To bind our selve, to find Sureties, and to answer this and the other Objection and Sup∣p, only falsly supposed and suspected against us, by men that seek occasion against u This Demand we cannot fulfil for Conscience sake; because we are clear, and not gilty of such Suspitions; nor can we bind our selves (out of the Counsel of Gd) n Penalties and Forfeitures, to appear and answer such and such ground∣less Objections; for if we should in that manner bind and engage our selves not to d , o answer this and the other Objection against us, when we know our selves innocent of that Accusation to which we are to answer, and that it is not in our Harts to do the thing whereof we are doubted, but contrary to our Faith and Principles; then this were a betraying of our own Innocency in that behalf, and a rendring of us guilty to all men, when as we are clear; and by binding our selves, as afore-mentioned, we should be reputed, Transgressors: For Bonds and En∣gagements by Forfeitures and Sums of Money, are for the Guilty, and not for the Innocent; and we may not betray our guiltless Cause, and bring it under false reputation amongst men, by giving such binding Engagements. And Again, when as we are clear of any such Suspitions as are made against us, if we should bind our selves, as aforesaid; it many times doth appear, that occasion is more taken against us, in answering or appearing, and we made to be greater Offenders than before; and there again our Innocency is betray'd, when as innocent of the Fact supposed against us, yet made Offenders in answering, through Formalities and Tricks in the course of Law, practised at the time of Answering; and therefore we do in good Reason and Equity, deny to bind our selves in that manner, and to give such Security (so called) lest we should betray our own Innocency, and render our Cause to false Reputations in that be∣half; and lest we should fall into a Remedy, to clear us of false Suspitions, worse
than the Suspitions themselves, by laying our selves liable to greater Sufferings in answering to our Accusations, falsly objected, than our suffering can be by the Ac∣cusations themselves; and evil-minded men do often take greater occasion against us in answering false Charges and groundless Suspitions laid against us, than they can take by the false Charges and Suspitions themselves: and so we cannot bind our selves, as aforesaid, to fulfil the wills of men, and thereby ex∣pose our selves to a far greater Suffering (to be taken in it) for to escape a less. 2. But as for living peaceably in the Land, and being subject in all just and good things to the King and his Government; and not to plot against them, n to harm any Person whatsoever, but to be in love with all, and in good be∣haviour towards all, and to answer to any thing justly required of us: This is our Principle to do, and hath ever been our Practice, and we are bound by the Law of God to perform this in every particular; and we can fully make confession hereof, and testifie it in Yea and Nay, according to the New Covenant and Christ's Command, who hath said, Let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, but not by an Oath, nor binding our selves upon such Penalties and Forfeitures in Engagements by Sums of Money, out of the Counsel of God; and our Yea and Nay, in this and all other Cases, is more binding to us, than all the Formal Engagements of others; and we make as much Conscience to perform our Yea and Nay, as any others do their Oathes, or Bonds; and if we do not, but do plot and rebel, and be of evil behaviour towards any, then let us suffer the same, as if we had bound our selves in Forfeitures o great Sums of Money, and broken such our Engagements: and no man need in any case bind himself upon such Pains and Forfeitures, not to break the Laws of the Land; when as the Justice of the Law will be executed upon him if he transgress it, whether he bind himself, or not before-hand, not to break it; and this is the thing we al∣wayes offer: Here we are, if we have broken any Law, let us suffer according to the Law; and if at any time we are found guilty of transgressing the Law, let us then suffer accordingly, whether Death or Bonds; we crave no favour, but the Execution of just Law: And in the mean time, being we are clear of Re∣bellion and other Transgressions; Who shall accuse us? or who can reason∣ably require such or such Engagements of us to do, or not to do, or answer so, or so; seeing we must in Justice suffer the Punishment of the Law when we transgress it; which we must do, if we are at any time guilty, whether we be∣forehand bind our selves to the contrary or not? And also, if we should bind our selves, by the Engagements of such and such Sums of Money, to live quietly and not to rebel: yet we should be no better trusted because hereof, for that would not slay the Principle of Strife and War in us, but rather cause us to murmer because of our Bondage, and strive for Liberty; and also if we were men of disposions to war and plot, &c. it cannot be supposed by reasonable men, that any Engagement by any Sum of Money, would bind us from it, upon occasion, seeing we might hope in such attempts to save our Sums of Money, and to gain far more advantage, or else we hazarded to loose all; and to gain a greater advantage (if we were men of strife) we would not doubt to attempt to lose a less, and we being not men of strife, we cannot bind our selves as aforesaid, in this or any case; neither can any in good reason desire the same of us, if they rightly consider the case. 3. These things considered, it is fully manifest, That upon good Reason and a clear Conscience, we do refuse and deny to give Bond, and make such and such Engagements by Forfeitures of Sums of Money; it is I say, In good Reason and Conscience, and not in any wilfulness or stubbornness, or contempt of Authority that we do it, nor as though we were guilty in such matter suspected, and durst not answer the Law; but we do it to keep our Innocency clear, and not to betray it
into real cause of doubt that we are guilty. 2. That we may not lay ourselves liable to a greater Suffering, by answering false Suspitions and Accusations, as it often happeneth in the Proceedings in course of Law. 3. That we may not come under men of evil prejudiced minds, that seek more occasion against us than they have; and we may not fulfil their wills, and to give them oc∣casion against us, when as in the Accusations they have justly none. 4. That we may not expose our selves to be intrapped and ensnared into greater Suffe∣rings, to avoid a less. 5. That we may walk in the Doctrine and Command of Christ Iesus, who hath commanded to let our Yea be Yea, and our Nay be Nay; and whatsoever Oath or Engagement (out of the Counsel of God) is more, cometh of Evil, which we may not do. These, with some others, are the Reasons and Causes why we cannot for Conscience sake bind our selves in such kind of Formal Engagements (out of the Will of God) to do, or not to do; to answer this false Suspition or the other; but we do deny it out of good Reason and Conscience. And also there is no Example for it, that we know, among the Saints in former Ages, that any of them ever bound themselves to any Kings or Rulers in any such kind of Engagements, neither can we at this day; but as I said, If we Trans∣gress the Law, let us suffer by it; if we are already, or hereafter be found guilty, we desire nothing but the just Execution of Iust Laws, and in Patience we shall bear it; but before-hand we may not bind our selves in Formal En∣gagements out of the Will of God, to promise upon Forfeitures and Penalties what we will do or say, or what we will not do or say, for at the Will and Dispo∣sure of the Almighty we are, in all Things and Cases; and it is our Prin∣ciple and Belief, That we abiding in the Fear and Counsel of God, can be no ∣ther than Peaceable, Just, Righteous and Innocent in the Land; So that what∣soever we may do or suffer for this Case, of denying to give Bond, or En∣gage our selves so and so, as aforesaid, it is for Truth's sake, and such our Sufferings are Persecution and Unequal; and we must commit our Cause to God, who will plead it in his season, if that we are persecuted for the Cause of groundless Suspition, and because we cannot Engage to answer causless Objections. And thus I have sought out this matter, and laid it before the King, and I leave it to him to consider; and to shew Justice, Equity, Mercy and Long∣suffering, and in so doing he will be blessed; but if the cortrary be brought forth, the Effect thereof will be more miserable. CHAP. V. The Case stated and pleaded, concerning Government it self; and par∣ticularly of this present Authority, and our Obedience to it. 1. WE do acknowledg Government, and Rule, and Magistracy to be an Ordinance of God, ordained and instituted of him, to be ex∣ercised among the Children of Men, For to be a Praise and a Defence to all that do well, and to be a Terror and Corrector to all that do Evil. And we believe there ought to be Rule and Government and Authority, exercised and executed, in e∣very Kingdom, Nation, City and Country, for the end aforesaid (to wit) That Evil-doers may be made afraid and corrected, limitted, restrained, and sub∣dued; and that Sin and Transgression may be suppressed; and Truth and Righteousness promoted; and them that do Well, praised and strengthened: And this is the very end of outward Government of Kings, Princes, or other, amongst Men upon the Earth, even that the outward Man may be kept in good order and subjection in his Conversation in the World, and may be li∣mitted
and restrained from all wrong doing o speaking against his Neighbours Person or Estate; and if he do, he is punishable by such Iust Authority. This is the very end of outward Government in the Kingdoms of the World; but it extends not over the Inward Man, to rule, govern, or exercise Authority over the Consciences of any in spiritual Matters and Cases between God and Man's Conscience; This Dominion and Authority only partains to the Inward Government and Rule of Jesus Christ by his Eternal Spirit, but not to any Out∣ward Government of Kings, Princes, Parliaments, or any others; They, I say, ought only to exercise Authority over the Persons and Estates of People in all just and lawful Things and Matters, but not over the Consciences of any in the exercise of Duty towards God, or in the Cases and Matters of Worship and Religion. 2. The Exercise and Execution of this Iust Government over the outward Man, as afore described, ought to be committed into the Hands of faithful, just and upright men, such as fear the Lord and hate Covetousness, and every evil Way, in all Kingdoms of the World; The Execution of the Government in all just Laws, ought (I say) to be committed to such men, and not to Drunkards, Lyars, Covetous or Evil-minded Persons, Ambitious or Vain glorious Persons in any Nation; such as these ought not to be entrusted with the Execution of the Government, and the good Laws of any Kingdom; for such will not be a Blessing unto the Land, nor unto any People, but a Curse, and the cause of provoking God to Vengeance and Wrath against themselves, the People and the Government, if such men, whom God chooseth not, be chosen to make Laws and execute them, and to exercise Governments in any Kingdoms of this World; But Men that fear God, and delight in Iustice, Mercy and Truth, that are hum∣ble and meek and lowly Persons, ought to be called to the place of Government, and only such are fit to exercise Rule and Authority, and to make and exe∣cute Laws in these Kingdoms, and in all the Kingdoms of the World; and such would be a Blessing in the Earth, and the Governments under such, and in the Execution of their Hands, would be Blessed and Prosperous; and all good Men would have cause to rejoyce therein, and all Evil-doers and Transgressors would be limitted and made afraid, if so be the Laws be Just, Holy and Righteous, and according to Equity and the Holy Law of God in all things, and the due Execution of such Laws committed to Just and Righteous and Meek Men, that love Judgment, Mercy and Truth, and would execute them in the Earth; Then the happy and blessed Government will be exalted, and Truth and Righteousness would reign as Judge on the Throne; and in this shall all Nations and Kingdoms be prosperous and blessed when it cometh to pass. 3. And as for this present Authority and Government now in being, under the Name of King Charles the Second, we do believe and acknowledge, That according to the Purpose and Will of God, and of his bringing to pass, this present Go∣vernment and Authority is set up, and into its present being established; The Lord, I say, hath suffered it to be effected, for the Cause, and End, and Time, and Purpose, known to himself, and not to mortal man: And thus this Government and Authority is of God, being brought in and set up, in opposition to, and for the reproof and correction of such as went before, who had neglected Mercy, Truth, Judgment and Righteousness in the Earth, till it was time for the Lord to cast them out, and reprove them, and make them a Desolation before their Enemies; and this Authority was judged of the Lord fit for that use and end, and reserved to be brought in, as a Rod of God in his Hand, to cor∣rect and smite many People; And it is right in the sight of the Lord, that this Authority should have this time and season to be exercised in these Kingdoms, to try and prove, both it self, and all under it, if so be that
Truth, Justice and Righteousness, Mercy and Peace, may be brought forth it these Kingdoms through it, that God may establish it for long continuance; and it is now a trying and proving, to make it self happy and blessed, or other∣wise to bring it self into contempt and dishonour; and accordingly as Truth, Justice, Mercy, Judgment and Peace is brought forth by it, or the con∣trary brought forth by it, so must the Just and Equal Effects and Reward of it be from the Hand of God; and it is only just Judgment, Mercy and Truth, Righteousness, Relieving the Oppressed, and the doing thereof; that can alone make the Person and Government of the King Happy, Blessed and Honourable in this World, and hereafter; and the contrary, if it be brought forth, must needs bring Confusion, Discontents, and all miserable Judg∣ments; and to say no more of it, this is my present Judgement of the King and his Authority, both in respect of their coming in, and the Cause thereof, and the Fruits and Effects that must follow, which is not o∣therwise Determined of God, but according to Desert and Merit, of walking in Truth, Justice, and Righteousness, or in walking otherwise. 4. Our Obedience to this Authority, must be according, as before declared, in the Plea of the first Case concerning Allegiance (to wit) For Conscience sake to God, we are bound by his Iust Law in our Hearts to yeild Obedience to it, in all Matters and Cases actively or passively; that is to say, in all just and good Commands of the King, and the good Laws of the Land, rela∣ting to our outward Man, we must be obedient by doing, and not withhold our Just Obedience; but in the Cases of Conscience (to wit) in the Matters of Duty to God, and of Worship, Faith and Religion towards him, we must only be obedient to God; for it is he that teacheth and requireth O∣bedience in all those things: and if any thing be commanded of us by the pre∣sent Authority, which is not according to Equity, Iustice and a good Conscience towards God, to be done by us, we must in such Cases, obey God only, and deny active Obedience for Conscience sake, and patiently suffer what is inflicted upon us for such our Disobedience to Men; and we must choose Obedi∣ence to God rather than man, though we suffer because thereof: And this is our Principle, and hath ever been our Practice, to obey Authority, by doing, or suffering, not disputing whether the Authority in it self be absolute of God, or not; yet being an Authority over us, we are to obey it, either by doing, or suffering, because it is an Authority; and not to plot, rebel, or rise up with car∣nal Weapons against it: and thus must our Obedience be to the King and his Government. And if that in any thing of the Commands of the King, we can∣not be obedient for Conscience sake, in the Cases of Conscience, and when ought is required different or contrary to the Law of God; we have Example hereof in the Scriptures, of many of the Servants of God that could not in all things, yield Obedience to the Laws of Nations and Commands of Kings, when they re∣quired ought to be obeyed, contrary to their pure Consciences; as in the Case of the three Children, Dan. 3. they could not obey the Law and Command of the King, though it was absolute, but refused Obedience, and suffered for it; and Daniel also himself disobeyed the King's Law and Commands, Dan. 6. and the Apostles the same, when they were commanded by the Authority of that City and County, To preach no more in the Name of IESUS, Act. 4. 17, 18. They did not obey the Command of the Rulers in that Case, but went on and preached Iesus, in disobedience and contrary to the Command of the Rulers. And by these, and many other Examples, it is apparent, that it is justifiable in the sight of God, and that it was practised by the Servants of God in former Ages, even Disobedience to Kings and Authority, in the Matters and Cases com∣manded contrary to the Law of God and a good Conscience; and their Example may justifie such now in the same Practice, in the same Case, if they walk therein by the same Principle.
5. And thus it is manifest, That if we at any time be found not in full obe∣dience by doing, in all Cases and Things, to the Laws and Authority of this Kingdom; it is not out of contempt unto, or Rebellion against the King's Per∣son or Government; it is not I say, on that account, but for good Conscience sake, and because we must obey God rather than man, when and where their Com mands stand in opposition the one to the other; and this is, that we may keep our Consciences clear in the sight of God, from disobedience against him, which is our care and endeavour by all means: and when any thing is required of us to be done, which we cannot do with a clear Conscience in the sight of God, such Commands we cannot yield Obedience unto; and yet it is not out of Wilfulness, Stubbornness, Contempt, or Rebellion against the Authority; but it is for this End and Cause, that we may not sin against God, nor against our own Consciences, by doing any thing that is contrary thereunto, lest we should bring the Wrath of God upon our own Consciences: so that all these things rightly considered, it doth appear. 1. That we acknowledge Magistracy and Authority to be the Ordinance of God, to be exercised and executed in the Kingdoms of the World among men. 2. That Iust and Righteous men, are the only Persons fit to execute Iust Laws and Authorities in the Earth. 3. That we acknowledge this present Government of King Charles, and that according to the Purpse of God it is now set up. 4. That we are to be obedient by doing or suerig in all things, to the Authority of the King, as the Supream Authority. 5. That if in any case we are disobedient thereunto, and cannot wholly perform every Command, by doing, yet it is for Conscience sake to God, and that we may not sin against him, and not out of Rebellion or Contempt of the King or his Power. And all these things truly considered, if we do suffer Tribulations, Afflictions and Imprisonments, under and by this present Authority, for and because of our Profession and Practice of Religion, without evil or wrong doing to our Neighbours Persons or Estates, though we do not in the things contrary to our Consciences obey actively this present Authority, yet we are persecuted for the Name of Christ; and as so, we receive our Sufferings, and not as for Contempt or Denial of Au∣thority, or as Rebellion against it; but for Conscience sake to God our Sufferings are, and our unjust Persecution will be upon our Enemies in the effect and re∣ward thereof, with great Indignation and Wrath from the Lord God, that rewards all according to their works. Thus much about Government. And now I shall shew what Persecution is in it self. CHAP. VI. Concerning Persecution; what it is in it self, and how great an Enemy it is to the King's Person and Authority. 1. PErsecution is, when a Person, or a People, do suffer Tribulation, Affliction, Imprisonment, Bonds, or Death, whether by a Law or without the Law, for, and because of his or their Principle and Practice in Religion; As when a Person or a People are reproached, falsly accused, imprisoned or put to death, only for and because of their Religions sake; when as no evil-dealing in the things between man and man, can be justly charged and proved against them, but only because they are righteous, and walk in the Wayes of the Lord, and cannot conform to the Wayes and Vanities of this World, but are separated from it in its Prophaneness, and in its formal Profession also of Religion; and because thereof Sufferings are imposed upon them, while yet they walk justly, innocently and harmlesly towards all men.
This is Persecution for Conscience sake, and such are persecuted, if so be they suffer for and because of Righteousness sake, and because they will not deny their Principles nor Profession of Rēligion, nor conform to Times nor Laws contrary to a good Conscience, and yet suffer because hereof; this is Persecution. 2. Persecution is, when a Person or a People is afflicted, and any kind of suffe∣rings imposed upon them, whether by any Authority, or without Authority, and only because they are of such a Profession and Practice in Religion; though yet their Profession and Practice in their Religion is not perfectly according to God, nor by the Exercise of that Spirit of God ruling in their Consciences in such their Religion; yet if they suffer only for their Religion sake, while yet they walk uprightly as men, in all outward Affairs relating to the outward Man, this also is Persecution. and such are persecuted for their Religions sake, though not wholy for Righteousness sake; and none ought to suffer as such under the Authority of any King, Prince or Power: but if such do suffer, as I have said, and that for their Religions sake, only so, though yet their Religion is not perfectly according to God, yet they are persecuted, and this is Persecution. And thus I have in short described & defined what Persecution is in it self, and who it is that are persecuted; and I shall now shew how great an Enemy Persecution for Conscience and Religions sake is unto the King's Person and Authority. Persecution for Conscience sake, and for Difference in Matters of Religion, is a great Enemy to the Person and Government of the King; it is, I say, a destroying and devouring Enemy, and the Fruits and Effects thereof may work terrible Destruction; yea, this Enemy [Persecution] hath often wrought Overthrow in Kingdoms: Let the King strive to be delivered speedily from this great Enemy, which is fierce and cruel, and may work woful Effects in this Kingdom also; and the King may be more blessed in his Person and Government if he remove far from him this Ene∣my, Persecution. 1. It is his Enemy because its Effect is, To eat out the Affections of many good and sober People from the King, and may make their Love and Affections dye to the King's Government, when they behold and consider the Persecution of many good and peaceable People for Righteousness and good Conscience sake, whenas no Evil-doing between man and man can justly be laid to their Charge, but only for the matter of their Religion, and the exercise of their Consciences towards God; and if such suffer cruel Imprisonment, unjust Fines and grievous Vexations for such Cause, it may weaken and eat out the Affections of good People, and divert their Love and good Desires from the King and his Government, in which such Persecution is brought forth: and that which diverts the Peoples Love from the King is his great Enemy, and such is Persecution. 2. Persecution is the King's great Enemy, Because it may kindle Heart-burnings, Envyings, Strifes and Murmurings among his Subjects, while some are tollerated in the Profession and Practice of their Religion, and others persecuted and imprisoned for the same Cause; and this kind of dealing exerciseth the King's Subjects in harsh dealing one towards another, and gives great Occasion for Quarrelling, Envies, Debate and Malice one against another; even when some execute Persecution upon others, hailing them to Prison, spoiling their Goods, and the like: And this kind of dealing, I say, whilst the Authority of the Land persecutes one sort of the King's Subjects by the hands of others, it tendeth much to great Division and Di∣stractions amongst the people; and it is not for the King's safety, but for his great Dishonour and Disadvantage every way, to have the people divided into Heart-burn∣ings and Quarrellings against one another: and therefore Persecution is the King's great Enemy, because it worketh such evil Effects. 3. It is his great Enemy, Because it is contrary to the Trust which God hath re∣posed in him, in promoting him to be King over these People; for God hath not
committed Power to him to judge in the Cases of mens Consciences, and to perse∣cute any because of the Exercise thereof, whether they be of this Profession and Practicé in Religion, or the other, yet living peaceably and uprightly as men, he ought not to persecute us, nor to suffer them to be persecuted by nor under his Authority; but he ought to defend and preserve all mens Persons and Estates in their Just Rights, from the Violence each of others, without respect to what their Profession and Practice of Religion is; but if the contrary be brought forth, it is contrary, and not answerable to the End of God's Restauring him to these Kingdoms; and if he doth not what God hath justly called him unto, but otherwise, this is his Enemy; and such is Persecution for Conscience sake, it is contrary to the End of Just Government, and wherefore God hath restored him; and therefore this Persecution is an utter Enemy both to the King's Person and Au∣thority. 4. It is his Enemy, Because it provokes the God of Heaven and Earth over all to be offended with him; for he is provoked and vexed because of the Per∣secution of his People in this Age, as ever he was in all Ages; and if the King be guilty thereof, it incurreth God's great Displeasure against him: For God was ever offended with Kings, Rulers, and whomsoever, that were Per∣secutors, and he is the same at this day; and whatsoever it is that provokes God to Anger against the King, that is his Enemy: And such is Persecution of People for the Profession and Practice of their Religion, whenas no Evil can be charged upon them in things between man and man; and therefore let the KING beware of this Woful ENEMY that waits to wound him; for if the God of Heaven be provoked against him, how great is that Enemy which brings it to pass. 5. It is the King's Enemy, Because it not only provokes the Lord to Anger, but to Judgment; Persecution is the Cause wherefore God bringeth grievous Iudgments and Vengeance upon whomsoever are guilty thereof; and the Effect of Persecution is Plagues and Misery; and it incenseth God to Anger, and also to Destroy: and therefore let the King beware of such a deadly Enemy, as should Cause God to destroy him. And such an Enemy is Persecution of God's People for Conscience sake, it draweth down the Wrath of God upon Kings and Kingdoms, upon Rich and Poor, upon High and Low, that are guilty of it; for it is the fulfilling of all other Sins, and it hasteneth to bring Destruction upon all that are guilty; and this Effect it will work upon the King, even this his Enemy [Persecution] if he turn not from it, and overcome it, and Banish it from him, for it is the Cause of both Inward and Outward, Internal and External Plagues and Iudgments of God. 6. Persecution, it is an Enemy to the King, Because it will work to weaken the Hands of Iust, and Sober, and Righteous Men; it will weaken their Love and Affections, and it makes their Hearts sad; And Wo is unto them that make sad their Hearts, whom God doth not make sad; and this doth Persecution: And it doth not only weaken the Hearts and Hands of the Righteous and Sober Persons, but it strengthens the Hands of the Rude, Ungodly and Prophane through the Land; and that which strengthens the Wicked and the Rude Multitude in Wantonness, Scorning and Prophanness, that is the King's Enemy; but such is Persecution for a good Conscience sake: And because it weakens the Righteous in their Good and Upright Wayes, and strengthens the Wicked in their Evil Wayes, therefore it is an Enemy unto the King. 7. Persecution is an Enemy unto him, Because it tends to render him disho∣nourable, both in the sight of God, and all good men through the World; for
it will shew, that he is cruel, and bitter and perverse, and that he wanteth Humility, Meekness, Forbearance and Patience, if he be guilty; and this is dis∣honourable, to have and profess Evil Qualities and Properties, and to be with∣out the Good; and by persecution this will be made manifest to all the World, and ever was in all Ages, that the Persecutors of good Conscience gained unto themselves, Dishonour and Reproach of all good men in all Ages after them; for they were men full of Rage, and Malice, and Passionateness, and wanted Patience and Humility, and this made them Dishonourable: And the Case will be the same with the King, if he be a Persecutor for Conscience sake, and he will be Dishonour∣able both in this present Time, and in Ages to come, and this by Persecution, and therefore it is his Enemy, that will work many Mischiefs and Evils upon him, if he be not wholy delivered from it. 8. Persecution is an Enemy to the King's Person and Authority, because Per∣secution for Conscience sake is of the Devil, it is of his spirit, and not of the Spi∣rit of God, to Persecute, Imprison, Kill and Destroy mens Persons and Estates, because of their Religions sake, whenas no unjust Dealing nor Unrighteous Conversation can be justly laid to their charge, but only for and because of such Profession and Practice in Religion, to persecute any because hereof, this is of the Devil; and that which is of the Devil is the King's Enemy, and an Enemy to all Mankind, and such is Persecution; and therefore it is a deadly mortal Enemy, which wounds Kings, Princes and Rulers, that ever have had friendship with it; and therefore let the King avoid this great Enemy, lest its Effects prove miserable. 9. It is the King's Enemy, Because it is according to the Example of all the wick∣ed King's and Rulers that ever have been through Ages and Generations; as of Pharaoh, Ahab, Herod, Nero, and many more, who were Persecutors of People for Conscience sake, who gained unto themselves thereby Reproach, Infamy and Misery from God and men; and to follow their Example is the King's Enemy, and such is Persecution: If he should persecute for Conscience sake, and about Religion, and the Worship of God, then he follows the Example of wicked Kings, and this will be his Enemy, and will work woful effects, if so be he walk in the steps of the Persecutors of old, & love that which is his Enemy. 10. Persecution is the King's Enemy, Because the End and Effects thereof is Mi∣sery and Destruction upon all that persecute the Heritage of God: What was Pharaoh's end, and Herod's end, and Nero's end? was not their end woful and miserable to God, and shameful to men? And Persecution for Conscience sake will bring the same Effects at this day: The End of all Persecutors will be Misery and Shame, even in the day of the Lord, when he comes with Iudgment and Vengeance, and to reward every man according to his deeds, then will He reward Persecution and Persecutors with his fierce Wrath, and they shall know the Iustice of God's Iudgments executed upon them. And therefore happy will the King be, if he keep himself clear, and put far from him this Enomy, Persecution Three Considerations I have to present unto the King for Conclusion. 1. THe Strength, and Safety and Prosperity of the King and his Govern∣ment, stands in the Union, good Affection and Love of his Subjects, and the People of these Kingdoms, one to another, and to the King; and the more that the People of the Kingdoms are in Love, and Union, and good Affection one with another, and to the King, the more strong, and safe, and prosporous there∣by is the King and his Government, and the more like for a long and happy Continu∣ance and Establishment: And it is the Love, and Union and Affection of the Sober, and
Grave, and Just and Upright People, and of the Meek of the Land, that is the King's Strength and Safty, and will much tend to his Prosperity, and to the Establishment of his Government and Authority; and the King's Safety and Strength, and Prosperity doth not depend upon the Affections and Ac∣clamations of the Ruder Sort, and of the Wild Multitude, though such pro∣fess great Subjection, and cry up the King and his Government, and drink his Healths, and Swear the Destruction of all his Enemies, and have much Love and great Union for the King, and are for him, to serve him, and Swear Fidelity, and Engage themselves very highly in Words and Gestures for the King; yet the King and his Government is no whit the safer, nor more strong, nor prosperous because hereof: For his Prosperity and Establish∣ment dependeth upon the Love and good Affection of the Just, and Upright, and Temperate and Meek Men of the Kingdoms, and not upon the Love of the Rude Multitude; such cannot be a Blessing to him in their Vaunting, and Boasting and Rudeness, nor can he stand by them; but must stand in the Establishment of his Government by the Love of such as fear the Lord, and depart from all Iniquity; by the good Affection of such, and their Faithfulness and Love, may the King be happy and blessed: Therefore let him strive to please such, and to gain their good Affections to be united to him, and this may add to his long Continuance. 2. It is the doing of Justice and Truth, and allowing all Just and Equal Li∣berty to all People under his Authority, that will gain upon the Hearts of all Just and Good People: And as Righteousness. Mercy, True Judgment and Truth is brought forth in the Land, and all the contrary limitted in the King's Government; this will gain much upon the Hearts and Affecti∣ons of all good People, to be united in Love one to another, and to the KING: And this is the way of the King's Prosperity, and to make his Go∣vernment established, if so be that he exercise his Rule and Authority in Love and Meekness, and Equal Iustice and Mercy, and love Righteousness and Truth, and hate and deny all the contrary, and limit it; then the spirits of all People in the Kingdoms would be subjected and subdued under his Power, and he should Rule over them, and his Kingdoms be Established prosperously; and this is the Way of an Happy Government. But if so be the KING put on Rigour, and be Fierce and Cruel, and think to subdue all under him by Will and Force, without shewing Justice and Reason to answer the Consci∣ences of his Subjects in all his Proceedings; this way can never be prospe∣rous, nor Establish him in his Authority; but it will work the contrary Effect: For, if Oppression be brought forth, and Heavy Yoaks laid upon the Back of the Poor; then will the Wrath of God and of Men be kindle∣ed against him, and Murmurings, Strifs and Contentions will arise in the Minds of Men against him; and the Oppressions of the Poor will reach un∣to Heaven, and God will hear and Revenge their Cause. So that it is Ruling and exercising Authority in these Kingdoms in Justice, Righte∣ousness, Love and Good Reason that must gain the Hearts of People un∣to right Subjection, to make the King and his Government Happy and Esta∣blished; and Rigour, Force and Cruelty will never make the King happy, but will work contrary: For the People are Wise, and Understanding will not long bear any degree of the Yoak of Slavery. 3. Inasmuch as the People of these Kingdoms are divers, and divided, and contrary in Judgment one to another in many things, and so are dis-uni∣ted into several Opinions and Parties; the King ought to Rule in Wisdom and Love over them all, and to shew Equal Justice and Liberty, and to ea∣rcise Righteousness towards them all alike, notwithstanding their Difference
in Religion and Judgments; for if he shall give Liberty to some, and Op∣press others; if he do joyn with one Way, and promote that; and the men of one Judgment be tollerated, and all other Wayes, and all others that are different in Judgement, be persecuted and oppressed, and sought to be destroy∣ed; this is not the way for the King to prosper, nor to be established to per∣petuity: for there seems to be no one Way so strong, or any one sort of People so many, for the King to cleave to and allow, and seek to destroy all the rest, be∣cause there is of other sors of people that ballance that sort in opposition; and so the King and his Government seems not secure, if he take hold of any one sort of People, only to stand thereby, in opposition to all the rest, persecuting of them; because there are many of other Sects that will be discontented and mur∣mur, if not more: So that the King's Safety is, and the Prosperity of his Govern∣ment, and the Establishment of it seems to be, By giving Equal Liberty and Iu∣stice, and shewing Love and Tenderness to all of all Iudgments, and then he may stand by all, and none will oppose him, but all will be ready to defend and preserve him: For he may stand established, and be happy in his Government, by engaging all sorts to him through Love, and Righteousness, and Liberty towards all; but he can∣not (according to my Iudgment) be established nor prosperous, if he choose only the Men of one Judgment to stand by, and cleave only to that, and persecute and seek to destroy all the rest that are different; and so only make one Party his Friends, and dis-engage all others in Love and Affection; this seems, I say, not the Way of Prosperity. Let the King consider it, and the Lord give him a Right Understanding. By a Friend to Iust Authority, E. B.
PERSECUTION IMPEACHED, As a Traytor against God, HIS LAWS and GOVERNMENT; And the CAUSE of the Ancient MAR∣TYRS Vindicated, against the Cruelty inflicted upon them by the Papists in former Dayes. Being a Brief ANSWER to a Book called, Semper Iidem; Or, A Paralel of PHANATICKS, &c. lately published by a Nameless Author: Wherein is contain'd a Relation of the Martyrdom of many such as Dissented and Opposed the Church of ROME; who are in the said Book Villified and Reproached, by the Name and Term of Antient Phanaticks. And this is sent forth as an Answer thereunto, to Pursue it, Apprehend it, and Condemn it, as a Pamphlet of Calumnies and Slanders against the Protestants, both of former and present Dayes; who are all of them Scorned in the said Book, the one as Ancient, the other as Modern PHANATICKS. Which is sent abroad as a Warning to ENGLAND, to beware of the spirit of the Church of ROME, lest it Exalt it self in Cruel Perse∣cution against the PROTESTANTS, and all that differ from it. HOW Great and Miserable hath been that Darkness and Ignorance, which hath over-spread the Nations and Kingdoms of the World, since the Apostles dayes? And how manifold is that Error into which many have been fallen, even as into a Snare of Destruction? And how woful is that Strife, Division and Contention about Religion, that hath highly aboun∣ded among the Christian People? (so called) For the whole Christendom have been divided, and in Opposition one part against another, about the True
God, and his Worship, and concerning the knowledge of Salvation by Jesus Christ: And divers kinds of Religion, Church-Government, and Practices of Ordinances of Faith & Worship have been extant in the World; and Nations & Countries have been all in Division, Strife and Contention about these Matters, and have been also persecuting one another violently unto Bonds and Death, for and because difference in Judgment and Practices concerning Spiritual Things, Papists against Protestants; and Protestants against Papists, and one sort of Chri∣stians (so called) against another, and the men of such a Judgment, and Fai, and Way of Religion have been persecuting and seeking to destroy all that have been contrary minded to them; And thus have been the woful Divisions and evil Effects thereof in the World among Christians, about Faith, and Worship, and Religious matters, & this has come to pass because of the spirit of Error & Dark∣ness that hath possessed the minds of men, since the falling away from the Truth, as it was once manifest among the Apostles: And thus its come to pass, because of the erring from the Spirit of God, and because that hath been wanting amongst men, therefore have People been divers and divided about Matters of Religion, each one sort following their own Invention and Traditions of men, and also perse∣cuting one another, and killing and imprisoning one another because of the same; and all this, because the Spirit of Truth hath not dwelt in the Hearts of Christians, as it did in the Apostles, not led, guided and taught them in true Uni∣ty and Fellowship, as it did the true Christians in the dayes of old: And while the Spirit of Christ hath been wanting, and is not received into the Heart, to morti∣fie, guide, rule and teach in all the Wayes of God, and the whole exercise of Reli∣gion and Duty towards Him; and while there is any kind of imposing and force∣ing of Religion by Laws of men, upon Penalties and Forfeitures, and setting up Worship and Church Government by that means, and in that way, without the imm Teaching of the Spirit of Christ in the Conscience; I say, while this hath been and is continued, nothing but Division, Strife, Contention, Persecution, and Nations and Peoples destroying one another about Religion, hath been, is, or can be in the World amongst Christians. And of this same (to wit) of Division and Contention about Religion, with the Enmity of such as are so divided one against another, to the persecuting and killing one of another, that are contrary minded, as it hath been brought forth in the World for Generations past, we have here a sufficient large Testimony, lately published in a Book called, Semper Iidem, or, A Paralel of Phanaticks, &c. wherein is made mention of what Strife and Contention there hath been in for∣mer dayes among the false Christians; and how they have cruelly Persecuted, Burned and Destroyed one another in this Cause, only for and because of the difference in Maters of Judgment and Religious Things; and these Persecuti∣ons and Cruelties, effected contrary to the Example of Christ and his Doctrine, who hath exhorted to Love and Peace, and not to Kill and Destroy; and that a man should love his Enemies, and not Kill and Destroy them; contrary to which Do∣ctrine the false Christians of all kinds have walked and acted since the dayes of the Apo, who have been Apostatized, and fallen from the very Life and Power of Godliness, as held amongst the primitive Saints, into Forms and empty Sha∣dows, being all in strife one with another about such things, and have wanted the Spirit of Christ, which should have led and guided into all Truth, and exercised them in the true Worship of the true and living God, who is a Spirit, and is on∣ly truly worshipped in Spirit and in Truth; but out of this Spirit and spiritual Worship the false Christians have been erred, and so all divided and in Centention, a aforesaid, and persecuting one another because thereof, each one sort justi∣fying their own Way  Right, and condemning that which hath differed as the Wrong, and all as Hereticks that have been otherwise minded. But as    Book, Semper Iidem, &c. I would gladly animad∣  coning it, and do intend to write a few things by way of an∣er thereunto, and this is the present Occasion of my present work; for having
met with the said Pamphlet, and perusing of it, I found divers Considerations on my spirit to send forth in Answer, to pursue the said Semper Iidem up and down the World, till it returns again unto the place from whence it came (to wit) Unto the bottomless Pit, out of which it lately arose: and in reading the same Book, I have principally observed the Mischievout End and secret Evil Intents of the Name∣less Author, more than the Matter it self contained: and though the Author be Nameless, yet is his nature and spirit known by his Book; and for what end he hath concealed his Name, I know not, except he was ashamed of his Work, and durst not Authorize his Matter by his Name; but however, the spirit, end and intent of the said Nameless Person is perceived and known, as much as any Tree can be distinguish∣ed by its Fruit; and he is of an Envious Disposition of Heart, and of Malicious Countenance, and in nature and stock of the descent of Cain; for his spirit is of an evil constitution, hot and fiery, and enclinable to destroy all that are not like-minded with him∣self in the Iudgment of Religious Matters; and his proceedings and the end of his work is of an Intent and Purpose wicked enough, if every Effect answers the Cause appearing, and be not diverted from the End proposed by the Author; and this I find by Calculation of his Birth, and the Temper of his spirit, and of the Time wherein his Book is published, and by the Cause, and End and Intent of the Matter and Manner of it, and by the Effect that would follow, if the Author's Aim and Purpose were fulfilled: By all which I must in true Judgment conclude from the Appearance, Disposition, Temper and Constitution of the spirit of the man, and from all Causes and Effects pertaining to the said Semper Iidem, That the Author thereof is indeed chiefly a Member of the Church of Rome (to wit) mostly a down-right Papist, holding forth the Principles of Antichrist in perfect form and manner, for the perfect End and Cause of Persecution, even Burning again in Smithfield, and else-where, and killing and destroying even all sorts of people under the scurrilous reproachful name of Phanaticks, that are in Iudgment and pra∣ctice of Profession contrary to this man's Way, and differing from the Papists Religion: This, I say, I truly find to be the current and disposition of the Nameless Au∣thor, and his Proceedings in his Method and Matter of his Semper Iidem, &c. and I have taken in hand at this time to answer him a little, and to unfold some of the dangerous Intents towards England, which may inhabit and secretly lodge in that spirit of the Church of Rome, according to the current of the said Book, and from which I have just cause to suppose the thing that I partly assert, even that the spirit which hath Indicted the said Book, waits its Opportunity to effect its end, and to revive and renew Fire and Faggot again, to the extinquishing and destruction of all that differ, and are contrary minded in Principles and Practices of Religion and Worship from themselves; for the Fury and Reproach of the said spirit that indicted and published Semper Iidem, reacheth not only to others, whom they call more Phanatical, as Quakers, Anabaptists, &c. but to the very Protestants themselves, even to all whatsoever that differ from the Church of Rome; for such by the Nameless Author are no less termed and vilified by that scornful term PHANATICKS, distinguished by the Name of Ancient and Modern, as hereafter I shall make it appear.
And First, I shall shew a little concerning the Signification of the Term Pha∣natick, as of late used; and the first use of it in these late Dayes; and the exchange of the word from one Sort to another; and in whose mouthes it now remains; and who are now so accounted. 1. NOt to discuss the Etimology and signification of the word Phanatick in it self, and what its Original is, and from whence derived, this I shall not now proceed to do, as being not needful to my Occasion, though there is difference of Judgment amongst some in this matter; and some say, the original and root of the word is from Phanos, a false Godd; and some say otherwise: and they are not in unity among themselves that do most of all use the word, concerning the Derivation and Signification of the word in it self: Neither shall I spend time to seek out a Judgment, and to give it in this case, as counting the recompence that can be obtained not answerable to such a work; but the sig∣nification of it, as now used at this day among People, is this, All that differ in Iudgment and Practice of Religion and Worship from the generality of People, and cannot conform unto such Way of Religion as generally practiced in the Land, such are called PHANATICKS: and this Signification the word beareth among People, as now practiced, Such as meet together to Preach and Pray out of Publick Places, and cannot either out of Knowledge or Conscience conform to the Publick Way of Worship held forth; such are called Phanaticks, and Reproached by that Name from the Mouthes of Scorners and Revilers of the Wayes of God (Numbers of whom do now abound) and also, Such who make Consci∣ence of their Wayes, and cannot run on in the Wayes of Iniquity, in Lying and Drunkenness, and such like, but have been and are more sober, and do walk more in Meekness and the Fear of God, and have separated themselves from the Evil Com∣pany of men, and from all Evil Wayes, and could not run into the same excess of Riot with the Multitude, such have been called of these late dayes Phanaticks by the Scorners Generation. And thus much in brief of the signification of the word, as used of these late dayes. 2. As for the first use of the word Phanatick in this Age, it is but of ve∣ry late use; for till within these two Years, or less, we had very little or no use of the word Phanatick, until about the time of then General Monk's Army coming out of Scotland to London, when the Army was new model'd, and many of the Sectaries (so called) were turned out of Places, about the Eleaventh Moneth, 1659. then began the common use of this word Phanatick; and the Anabaptists, and such as were turn'd out of the Army, and called all by the Name of Sectaries, that were different from the publick Way of Worship, then held out (which was for the most part of it Presbyterians) these were called Phanaticks; and then the use of the word so common began about this time (as I have said) as now practiced in our dayes: For the Rage and Indignation of the then Presbyterians (so called) and that Party, was such against the Anabaptists, and such as differed in Iudgment and Practice from them, that scornfully they called them in Derision Phanaticks. And, so far as I know, this was the Time and Occasion of the first use of this word, as of late Practiced; or at least, it was the first Time and Occasion of my Observation of the common use of the word Phanatick. 3. And now as concerning the exchange of the word, from one sort of People to another, and how it hath been used by divers sorts of People against others
that have differed from themselves, this is also observable, That the word Phanatick hath not so much proper relation to any one sort of People, as that it is only perfectly true to one sort of People more than to others; but the pro∣perness of the word Phanatick, is only as Scorners and Revilers will wickedly use it, and as they will turn it to this sort of People, or to the other, to scorn them by it, whom they have an Emnity against, and whom they list to abuseby re∣proaching: And this is the end of the use of the word to this day, and not of any truth or verity in it to any People, but only its used as a Term of Reproach and Scorning, by the Mouthes of ungodly men against such as differ from them and their Wayes, though they are better in Practice of Life and Conversation than themselves: And the Term hath been changed divers times, and divers sorts of People reproached by it by others, since its first use: as first, The People called Presbyterians (as aforesaid) they used it towards such as were otherwise-minded than themselves, and reproached the Anabaptists, and others that differed from them in Iudgment and Practice of Religion, by the Name of Phanaticks, and then they reproached many by that Name that differed from them, and did not conform to their Way of Worship and Religion; but this continued not long, for when others came over them, and they grew under Reproach, then they themselves were reproached by that Name Phanatick, by which they had re∣proached others not long before; and many that are for the Government of the Church under Episcopacy, they now reproach the Presbyterians (so called) by the Name of Phanaticks; so the word is used in scorn to them by Scorners, as they used it to others that differed from them in the like scornful spirit: And thus the word is made use of only in derision and reproach to any that differ from the publick way of Religion in the Land: For when the publick was generally Presbyterians, then they that would not conform to that, but opposed it, were called Phanaticks; and now when the publick is Episcopal, even the Presbyte∣rians themselves, and all that differ from that way, and cannot conform to it, are reproached by the scornful Name of Phanatick. And thus the word hath been exchanged from one sort of Scorners to another, and used reproachfully to∣wards divers Persons; so that as I have said, the word Phanatick is truly pro∣per to none of the Sects more than others, but only proper to be used by Scoffers and Scorners against any whom they have a mind to villifie; and its exchan∣ged from one to another, and used by divers sorts of People, according as Times and Religion do change by the Powers of the Earth. So the Term Phanatick is changed into the Mouthes of Scorners, to reproach all that differ from the Common General Way of Profession and Practice of Re∣ligion. 4. Now, last of all, it is changed yet once more into the Mouthes of the Papists, as by Semper Iidem doth appear, now under my explanation: and now the Pa∣pists have gotten the word Phanatick both from the Presbyterians and Episcopals, and all must now be reproached by that Name, that differ from them and their Way and Religion; and they have already begun to cry Phanatick to the Pro∣testants, that differ from them in Principles and Practices. And thus its ma∣nifest, that the word Phanatick is truly proper to none, but only used by Scor∣ners, to all whom they will revile and hold in derision, as different from them in Religion, such they villifie by the Name of Phanaticks: First, the Pres∣byterians used it to such as differed from them; then Episcopal men (so called) used it towards all that differed from them; and now last of all, the Papists have got it from both, and use it to all in derision that differ from them. And thus I have shewed, First, the beginning of the use of the word Phanatick, and upon what occasion, and its true signification, as used at this day. Secondly, concerning the exchanging of the word from one to another, and how that its truly proper to no People, but Scorners only use it, to deride and reproach such as differ from them, and cannot run in the same excess of Vanity. Thirdly.
How the Papists now last of all have got it, and use it against the Protestants; and in their Mouthes now it remains: and the Protestants (so called) are now the Persons and People that are accounted Phanaticks, because they differ from the Papists in Principles and Practises of Faith, Worship and Religion: and this is manifest by the scope of Semper Iidem. Secondly, I shall now shew how maliciously the nameless Author of Semper Iidem hath slandred the Martyres and Sufferers for Righteousness sake in former Ages; and how he hath accused the Protestants (now living) and what effect this would work in England, if the Author's Intent were fulfilled. 1. HE hath slandered, accused and rendred the Martyres of old, as Infamous as he possibly can, even termed them by the scornful Name of Pha∣naticks, even the Protestant Martyrs (so called) who are said to be the very Fa∣thers of the Protestant Church; as Bishop Latimer, Cranmer, Ridley, and many others, who have been accounted honourable in England for their faithfulness against the Church of Rome, who because thereof, were martyred and burned by the Cru∣elty of the Papists; yet these Persons, with Robert Woodman, Thomas Hawks, and many more of the Antient Protestant Martyrs, are slandered by the villi∣fying Term of Phanaticks; and that they were men of mischief, and licentious Tongues, and seditious behaviours and they were erronious and obstinate, as in the ninth Page of Semper Iidem doth appear; and in pag. 16. Latimer is again called one of the Antient Phanatick. And thus the main work of this nameless Author throughout his Book, is to accuse the Protestant Martyrs that suffered in Queen Maries dayes, to be rebellious seditious Hereticks, and he villifies them by the very Title of Antient Phanaticks; and this is apparent through the whole Pam∣phlet, even by his Calumnies, Reproaches and Accusations against the Protestant Martyrs, who suffered for bearing Witness against the Church of Rome. And thus the very Fathers of the Protestant Church (so called) stand now in reputation to be Hereticks, seditious, rebellious, and jdged Phanatick; and this is for the Pro∣testants (so called) even the very Bishops themselves in England to consider of. 2. The Auther of Pemper Iidem hath accused some of the Protestants, even of the King's Friends now living, and villifieth them by the Name of Phanatick, as William Prin, &c. whom he calls one of the modern Phanaticks: And no doubt but the Intent of this Man, with whom I am now in contest, reputes even all the Protestants of this present Age to be Phanaticks, and such as the Antient Pha∣naticks, to wit, the Protestant Martyrs, as before-mentioned; for he having accused Ridly and Cranmer, and many more, being such who were some of the first Promoters of the Protestant Religion in England, and the very Instituters of that Book, called the Divine-service-Book; it must needs follow consequently, and may be concluded from his words, and by his meaning, That all the Pro∣testants now are such, even the present Prelates of England; and durst the Author have spoken plain, it is likely he would have said the same, but that he hath minced the matter a little, as well as concealed his Name, though his work be cryed up and down London; which all sober People may indeed well take no∣tice of, seeing that the Martyrs of old, who have to this day been of good re∣port and fame for their Piety and Faithfulness in London, and through these Lands, are now accused, slandered and reproached up and down the Streets of London by the Name of Rebels and Seditious, and by the Term of Antient Phanaticks. Is London so blind that cannot see what is in the Bottom and Intent of such a Work, as renders the very Fathers of their Church Hereticks, and no better than Phanaticks? And as for William Pryn, who is also accounted one of the
chief modern Phanaticks, I shall leave him to answer for himself, not doubting but he is sufficient to say something in the Case; only may mind him, with many others of his Principles and Familiarity, how they have cryed out Pha∣naticks against such as have differed from them, and this not long since; and now themselves are under the same Reproach by others, as they have re∣proached others; and now he and they are reckoned the Modern Phanaticks and no better. 3. What can possibly be the Author's Intent in his proceedings? First, in relating of the burning, destroying and martyring of the Martyrs, whom he wickedly calleth Aions Phanaticks. And then, Secondly, in intimating the Protestants now living to be Phanaticks by this Paralel, the purpose and end of the man must needs be, That he would have Fire and Faggots up again, Burning and Martyring up again in England; and all that shall differ from that Man's Way (whom we find by Calculation to be chiefly a Papist) should be burnt, martyred and destroyed now again, as in the dayes of Queen Mary; this effect would follow: and this Semper Iidem is but a little Item or Intimation before-hand, cryed up and down London, to prepare its own spirit, where it shall meet with it, into Fary and Rage even to the destroying of all the Protestants: And as this  dem may possibly work such an effect among the People of that spirit,  love to murder and burn for difference in Religion, It may also and ought   an effect in the other Party, to be considerate and diligent, and to re∣d the signs of the Times, even the sign of Semper Iidem, which seems to be tle Black-stur predicting a bad Effect, if the course of Heaven alter it not again. And Semper Iidem is indeed to be taken notice of in London, because the   not  for above an hundred Years, nor any one ever durst to appear  such a publication of villifying the Protestant Martyrs with Reproaches and  of Rebels, Seditious men and Phanaticks, as this Nameless Author  done: which gives us cause to say, The Times are changed, and may yet  further, if the Effects of Semper Iidem be not diverted; for the Effects of his work, is, to bring all to the Fire, Faggot, and Martyrdom that shall differ from the Church of Rome, of whom the Author is a Member, as by all signs d tokens doth appear. Thirdly, I shall now shew how this spirit in the Papists, that burnt the Martyrs, (which is the same spirit that endited Semper Iidem, that is again moving its Countenance now adayes) I shall shew how that spirit was not, nor is of Christ, but of Antichrist and the Devil. 1. IT was not the way of Christ and his Apostles, neither did they give Com∣mand or President for it, to kill, burn, or destroy their Enemiec, and such   Hereticks, as the false Christians , and as the Papists did in Queen   who burned and destroyed many hundreds of the Protestants who  them in their Profession and Practices of Religion: and this was not  way, for he commanded To love Enemies, and not to kill them, and it was  He did Good for them them did Evil  him; and so did his Apostles;   was no such thing in the Churches of Christ in the Apostles dayes, as   burning of Hereticks, and putting them   by Cr Torments;   and his Apostles did convince  srs by Love and  Doctrine,   walk peaceably towards all their Enemies, and did not sk their , not to be revenged  their Persecutors: but the Papists and , contrary to Christ's Doctrine and Example, do burn and kill, and destroy their
Enemies, such whom they judge to be in Error, though yet their Iudgment be ut∣terly false, and their killing and burning grounded upon such Iudgment: and this hath been the Papists way of proceeding as is related in Semper Iidem; where∣in is mentioned the burning and destroying of a great number of such as they then called Hereticks, whom Semper Iidem now calls Antient Phanaticks: and he hath justified their Martyrdom to be Right, and condemned the Martyred as Phanaticks; and this is published in London. 2. All Persecution about Religion, and killing and burning for difference in mat∣ters of spiritual things, hath been and is of the Devil and Antichrist, both in the Papists and other false Christians, though it hath long been practised in the World, for to destroy the Workmanship of God, the Persons and Creatures, by Fires and Cruel Torments: This is not of God, but of the Devil, especially when it is done upon such an unjust occasion, as to destroy mens Persons by cruel tortures for the Error of their Minds; This is of the Beast and Dragon, spoken of in the Revelations: For the Beast killed all that would not worship him, Revel. 13. for it was the Dragon that persecuted the Woman, the true Church, and made War with the Rèmnant of her Seed, and cast floods out of his Mouth, after the Woman had brought forth the Man-Child; and he persued her into the Wilderness, and then he gave power to the Beast, his Seat, and his great Authority, as you may read; and then that Beast, to whom the Dragon gave Authority, forced all to worship him, and killed all that would not worship him, and made War against them, and overcame them: And so it is manifest that this Practice, which the Papists and false Christians have used, of burning and killing all such as will not worship after their manner, is of the Devil the Dragon and Antichrist, and hath no foundation in God, but is of the wicked One to all Intents and Purposes. And thus I have shewed the Papists Practices in Queen Maries dayes, (and at all times before and since, of burning and destroying of such as differ from them in religious Matters) are of the Devil and Antichrist, though the Author of Semper Iidem seems to justifie the Death of the Martyrs, and hath reproachfully villified them, about an hundred years after they are dead, by the scornful Name of Phanaticks. Fourthly, I shall now shew something concerning the Cause of the Publication of Semper Iidem, which the Author saith, is from the late Insurrection in Lon∣don, and comparing them with their Predecessors, he thought fit to publish the same; as in his Epistle. NOw in answer to this. As for the Insurrection in London, I shall not justifie it, nor speak a word in vindication of the said Persons Pro∣ceedings, but shall leave them without giving my Judgment upon them fur∣ther than this, That it was an Evil Occasion, administred against such as were no way guilty thereof, who are deeply suffering this day Imprison∣ment and Persecution, and their Peaceable Meetings broken up, and they vi∣olently dealt withal in many particulars, and onely upon the occasion of that Insurrection aforesaid; And how Unjust it is, let all the World judge, that any should suffer for the Faults of others? And how Unequal it is that many should be Imprisoned, Fined, and taken out of their own Hou∣ses and Meetings, to Goals and Prisons, as it is at this day, upon the Occasion of that Insurrection, whereof they were clear and innoent both to God and Men, though they are dealt withal as Plotters Conspirors and Rebellious, when as hereof they are not guilty?And this is all that I shall say
at present as about that Insurrection, and the Occasion of Semper Iidem its Publication. And whereas Sir Iohn Oldcastle, and Sir Roger Acton, with divers others are mentioned, and their Deaths related, whom this Author saith, were put to death for Treason and Rebellion, and making Insurrection. Concerning the Car∣riages and Death of such I shall say little, nor can I justifie any in so doing, neither in Ages past, nor in this present Time, if they were put to death on∣ly upon that Account, for rebelling with Carnal Weapons, and rising up in Conspi∣racies against the Authorities which they were under, or for Evil-doing to their Neighbours; I say, such neither in this Age, nor in Ages past, do I justifie, nor will vindicate their Practices, nor condemn their Death, but shall leave them to be justified or condemned of God according to their doings, and ac∣cording to the end and intent of their Hearts in their Proceedings; but many others are mentioned in Semper Iidem, who suffered and were put to Death, burned and killed, only for and because of their Principles and Pra∣ctices in Religion, while yet they lived peaceably, and were of a harmless Conversation amongst Men; the Persecution and Death of such, upon that account, I do condemn, and do charge it to be Murder in the sight of God, of such who were burned and destroyed because of their difference in Religion from the Church of Rome when as no Unrighteousness nor Double-dealing, as to men, could be charged and proved against them; such (I say) as died and suffered for that Cause, have been murdered by the Power of Antichrist among the Apostate Christians, and the Blood of such will the God of Heaven avenge one time or other. Now I come to search some Particulars, which are stated, pag. 3. which its said John Wickliff held; which Doctrines the Author of Semper Iidem seems to say are Errors, by his condemning such for Hereticks as held them for Truths. THe First, That the Sacrament of the Altar is nothing but a piece of Bread. This the Lollards (so called) are said to affirm, for which the Papists condemn them as Hereticks. Answ. As for the Sacrament of the Altar, so termed by the Papists, we find nothing of it in all the Scriptures, not Sacrament of the Altar nominated; only we find, That Christ took Bread and brake it, and gave it to his Disciples; not as Himself, for He only gave it them to eat in remembrance of Himself; As oft as ye do it (saith Christ) do it in remembrance of Me. Where it is manifest, that there is a distinction to be made, and a separation in expression to be put between that Bread which Christ gave his Disciples to eat, and his own Body; for they were to eat the Bread, not as Him, but in remembrance of Him: and this shews that the Bread which Christ gave his Disciples, was Bread to be eaten in Remembrance of Him; and so it is no Error, but sound Truth to affirm, That the Bread called the Sacrament of the Altar by the Papists, is but indeed a piece of Bread, and may safely so be called: But suppose it were Error in men so to believe and say; yet it is Murder, Cruelty, and not of Christ, but of the Wicked One, so to deal with them for their Error sake, as before∣mentioned. Doct. 2. That Priests have no more Authority to administer Sacraments then Lay-men; Held by the Lollards; Condemned as a great Error by the Papists. Answ. As for the Name and Order of Priests, we find none such among the Apostles in the Christian-Churches in their dayes; Pastors, and Ministers,
and Prophets, and Teachers we find, but not Priests by that Name, as a par∣ticular Order of Men in the Church, saving that all the Saints are called Kings and Priests unto God; neither do we find such a thing, As consecrating a piece of Bread into a more holy quality then it was in it self before; nor any Commision given by Christ to a particular Order of Men, to administer Bread to the People as his Body; we read that the Saints brake Bread when they were met together, and some time from House to House, but that there were particular Persons by an Office among them, that did administer the Bread in the Form and Manner as among Papists, we read not of this in all the Scriptures; And as for Lay-men as Papists term them, this word we have not in all the Scrip∣tures, but Saints we have of divers growths; but the Papists have made ma∣ny Inventions of Offices, Titles, and Names in their Church, for which they have no Example at all in the Scriptures. Doct. 3. That all things ought to be in Common; Opposed by Papists as a great Error. Answ. It is a great question what signification may be put upon the Word Common; so I shall not vindicate for Truth the Doctrine as it lies, and leave the Interpretation of the Word Common to my Adversaries, and so I pass it; only do mind that it is said in the Acts, That they that believed, had all things Common; Though the Word Common there, I understand not Abso∣lute but with Restriction. Doct. 4. That it is as lawful to Christen a Child in a Tub of Water at home, or in a Ditch by the Way, as in a Font-stone in the Church; Opposed by the Papists as a great Error. Answ. As for the Baptizing of Infants, by dipping or sprinkling, and calling it the Baptism into the Faith, and into the Church, as practised and held by the Papists, we have cause to question the Lawfulness of the Thing in it self at any Place; For we find no Command or President of Christ, nor among his Apostles in the pimitive Churches, for this thing of Christening Infants; and therefore we question, whether the Thing in it self is lawful at any Time or Place? suppose the Papists could prove the Thing lawful, and that it ought to be done by vertue of any Command or Example of Christ or his Apostles, then again we question, why not as lawful to be done at any other Place, as in a Font-stone? (so called) Of what holiness or purity is that, more than other Places? and of whose invention is it of all the Christians since the Apostles dayes, seeing we find nothing at all of it in the Scriptures? But suppose the Principle to hold indeed absolute Error, the Papists yet do still wickedly in rack∣ing men, and burning them because thereof. Doct. 5. That it is as lawful at all times to confess unto a Lay-man as to a Priest; Opposed by the Papists as great Error. Answ. As for that manner and form of Auricular Confession, (so called) pra∣ctised among the Papists, we have no Command or Example for it in all the Scrip∣tures; only the Apostle exhorted to confess your faults one to another; but no men∣tion of distinction of persons, as if there was an Order of men among the Saints, Ordained for Confession to be made unto, as is among the Papists pra∣ctised: But such kind of Inventions are among them, and all that gain-say them in their Wayes must be burned as Hereticks; and this is the way that the Papists do uphold their Religion, not by sound Arguments, and by the Spirit and Power of God, but by killing such as will not Believe, and Practise as they do. Doct. 6. That it is not necessary or profitable to have any Church or Chap∣pel to pray or perform Divine Service in; Opposed by the Papists as a great Error. Answ. As for the Church, it is in God, 1 Thes. 1. and the Body of Christ is the Church, Ephes. 1. 23. the Saints of Christ, that have Believed in
the Church of Christ; for the Church was in Aquilla's House, as may be read: and in this Church of Christ, wheresoever come together, is the Divine, Holy, Acceptable Service of God, performed in the Spirit, and in the Truth: And as for Houses of Wood and Stone, builded and called Churches and Chappels, which Papists have builded to perform their Service in, these are Idolatrous Places, and not true Churches; God dwells not in Temples made with Hands, as it is writ∣ten: And though a man affirm, That God may be worshipped and served as well in any Place, as in your Churches and Chappels, and that such Places are not necessary, but God may be served in other Places; This is no Error, de∣serving Fire and Faggot, as the Papists do affirm and Practice. Doctrines 7. and 8. That burying in the Church-Yard is unprofitable and vain. That Holy Dayes, Instituted by the Church, are not to be observed and kept in reverence, in as much as all Dayes are alike; Opposed by the Papists as Errors. Answ. There is no respect of Places with God, neither are the Dead more or less acceptable to him, notwithstanding the Place of Burial, whether it be on the Land, or cast into the Sea, if occasion so happen, as some times it doth; The Patriarchs of old had Places appointed and purchased for Burial of their Dead, as it is at this day among the Lord's People; but that the Church-yard (so called) is more Holy than another Place, as the Papists do account, This we believe not, nor can it be proved to us, by Scripture or sound Reason. And as for Holy Dayes instituted and observed, is but a meer Invention of the Romish Church, without any ground from the Apostles, and it is no sin against God not to observe them, and all dayes are as to God alike holy in His sight, without respect of one or another; And for the Papists to invent Practices, without Ex∣ample in the Scriptures, as Religious, and then to impose them by force upon all People, and to kill and burn such as Hereticks, as cannot conform thereunto; How Impious, Oppressive, and Antichristian this manner of work is, let all sober, People judge? And this is but a mocking of God, for the Papists to profess Holy Dayes, and with a pretence of God's Worship to observe them as Holy, when as more Rudeness, Drunkenness, Wantonness, and Ungodliness is usually com∣mitted that Day, which they profess to keep Holy, than is on the other dayes be∣side; And this is manifest to all People, that thus the Papists do mock God in their exercise of keeping Holy Dayes. Doctrines 9. and 10. That it is sufficient to Believe, though a man do no good Works at all. That no Humane Lawt or Constitutions do oblige a Christian; Opposed by the Papists as Errors. Answ. It is sufficient to believe in Iesus Christ, and that Believing is a good Work, and if a man truly believes, he cannot but bring forth by that Faith good Works; and it is impossible for a true Believer in Christ, but to do good Works; if a Man do no good Works, he is not a Believer; For Faith without Works is dead; and that is no true Belief, which is without good Works; and a Christian, one that is truly so, is obliged and bound by the Law of God, To do all Good, and to forsake all Evil; and the Laws of men, they are subject to them all for Conscience sake, by performing them, or suffering under them. And as for Humane In∣ventions of the Papists, which they bind on the Consciences of Men, upon loss of Life, or Estate, or Damnation; These things we say, do not oblige the Con∣science, nor any Laws or Constitutions of men do oblige Christians to Obe∣dience, which are not truly grounded upon the Law of God. Doct. 11. That God never gave Grace or Knowledge to a great Person, or Rich Man, and that they in no wise follow the same. Answ. This is a false Doctrine, for God gave Grace to all; The Grace of God which brings Salvation, hath appeared unto all men, as it is written, which Grace teacheth the Saints to deny all Ungodliness; and the Wicked turn the Grace of God into Wantonness: but the true Knowledge of God is given but to a few; and not many Wise men after the flesh are called, but God chooseth the Poor and Con∣temptible (as saith Paul) to confound the Wise and Mighty of this World; and yet
God gives Knowledge to Rich and Poor without respect of Persons, as it plea∣seth Him. Doct. 12. That any Lay-man may preach by his own Authority, without Licence of the Ordinary; Opposed by the Papists as a great Error. Answ. All in the true Church, and that are of the Church may Prophesie and Speak in the Church one by one (as Paul saith, without distinction of Titles, such as the Papists use, Clergy, and Lay-men, and such like Terms of their own Inven∣tions, without Example from the Churches of Christ in the Apostles dayes) for the Apostle saith, If any thing be revealed to another that standeth by, let the first hold his Peace; for ye may all Prophesie one by one, that all may be edified: And again, Peter saith, As every man hath received of the Gift of the Spirit, let him administer the same one to another. Thus it is manifest by the Scriptures, That every Member of the true Church of Christ may Preach by the Authority of the Spirit of God, as that moveth and leadeth; and this was the Example of the holy men of God, decla∣red in Scriptures: Elisha, that was a Plow-man, and Amos, that was a Herds-man, and Peter, that was a Fisher-man; these, and such as these, whom the Papists would have called Lay-men, did Preach and Teach without any Licence from men, but as the Lord Commanded them, who said, Ier. 23. He that hath my Word, let him speak my Word faithfully; and this without respect of Persons, and without distin∣ction of Names of Lay-men, or otherwise; though contrary to this, the Papists would limit the Holy One to such and such kind of Persons, whom they name Cler∣gy-men, as if they knew all Religion, and might only Preach, and all besides them∣selves might be in Ignorance, and know nothing, nor can be fit to speak of the Matters of God's Kingdom; which is contrary to the Scriptures, and Example of Saints in former Ages. As for the 13th and 14th Doctrines, about Baptism of Infants, I have spoken somewhat to it in my Answer to the fourth Doctrine; so here I pass them. Then Semper Iidem goes on, and saith, Who sees not among these the principal Te∣nets of our Anabaptists, Fifth-Monarchy-Men, Levellers and Quakers, &c? Answ. As for the Anabaptists, Fifth-monarchy-men and Levellers (so called) I shall not now plead their Cause, but shall leave it to themselves, to do it against Semper Iidem; neither shall I condemn them with him, or justifie them against him. But as for the Quakers (so called) I have a few word to plead for them, against their Adversaries, though I shall be brief at this time; They are nei∣ther Rebellious, Seditious, Hereticks, nor Phanaticks, though accused at this time of these things, and accounted by the Author of Semper Iidem as such; though neither he, nor any of their false and envious Accusers, that have ever risen against them, can prove any such matter, nor ought against them, saving That they are an Innocent and Harmless People towards all people; and though Sufferers by Injustice and Cruel Imprisonments under all Authorities, yet not Rebellious nor Seditions against any, but Peaceable and Quiet under all; this is their Pra∣ctice since they were a People. And as for their Principles of Faith, and Wor∣ship, and Doctrine and Religion, they are according to the Scriptures, and Example of the Saints in former Ages, and not ever yet convicted by any, ei∣ther Protestants or Papists, of Error, False Iudgment, or Heresie; though all manner of Evil hath been spoken against them in that Case, yet never to this day truly detected, or reprehended concerning the same: And they desire no bet∣ter way to be made manifest in their Doctrines, and to be approved or disproved therein through the World, than to have free Egress and Regress among the Papists and Protestants, and all others in the Way of sober Arguments and Dispu∣tations, and Reasoning out the Truth of what they hold and profess; and if they can possibly be convicted, that their Way, and Doctrines and Religion are not found Verities, but Errors, then it is time to forsake them: But all the Persecu∣tion, that is already, or can be acted upon them, will never make them change their Minds till Death, nor renounce the things which the Spirit of God in their own Hearts doth bear witness to the truth of. And therefore let the Church of
Rome lay down her Cruel Weapons of Persecution, by Burning and Destroy∣ing of such as differ from them in Religion, and let her admit of Disputations and sound Arguments, to uphold her self thereby if she be able, and to Confute and Convince such as are contrary minded to her, even the Quakers (so called) if she can; and let her cease her Fire and Faggot, and Inquisition-Disputation of Murders and Cruel Tortures against such whom she calls Hereticks; and let her appear in the soundest Arguments of Reason, and Scripture, and Antiquity, that she can adorn her self withal; and the Quakers (so called) will not doubt nor fear to advance towards her, and meet her, and answer her in the same, for the true and legal Tryal of both; that all the World may see and understand the difference between these two, and whether the Papists Religion or the Quakers Religion is of more Reason, Verity and Antiquity; and the Quakers are willing to try this Case with the Papists, engaging upon the adventure of certain Proof or Disproof of their Religion, in the view of the whole World. And this is the most I shall say at present on their behalf, and in the mean time, till this be per∣formed, let the Church of Rome, and all her Members, cease to persecute and ac∣cuse such, whom they know not, but by the Evil Reports of others; and the Tenets and Principles of the Quakers (so called) will be justified, where the false Christians cannot stand nor appear in Judgment. Then Page 7. The Author of Semper Iidem complains of some Phanaticks, as he calls them, that nick-name what they dislike; saith he, They call the Church, a Steeple-House; the Surplice, a Rag of Popery; the Organs, Grumbling-Pipes, &c. Answ. As for the True Church, it is in God, 1 Thes. 1. The People of God, that are regenerated and sanctified, wheresoever come together, are the true Church of Christ; for the Church was in Aquilla's House, as it is written: So that it is the People that are the Members of Christ, the true Church, and not the House or Place wherein they assemble at any time. And as for calling the publick Meet∣ing Places (which some call Churches) Steeple-Houses, this is no Error; for the Form, Fashion and Service of the Place prove it to be so; A great House, made of Wood and Stone, and a Steeple with Bells in it erected at the End of the House, may properly be called a Steeple-House, without Error; and cannot at all be called a Church, but in Error. And as for the Surplice, which the Priests put on, this is without Question an Invention of the Church of Rome, because there is no such thing in the New Testament, nor was there any Surplices worn by any of the Ministers of Christ in the Apostles dayes; but is an Invention, in∣troduced into the World by the Church of Rome; and so is, and may be called A Piece or Rag (if you will) of Popery. And as for Organs, and the Practice of them, as held forth for the Worship of God, there was no such thing among the Apostles, neither did the Saints of the Primitive Church hold forth the Wor∣ship of God by playing on the Organs; but the true spiritual Gospel-Worship is more heavenly and spiritual, even in the Spirit and in the Truth is God worshipped, as Christ said; and not by outward Musick, on Organs, and such like; but this is also an Invention of the Church of Rome, since the Apostles dayes: And Organs ha∣ving Pipes of different sounds, may be called Grumbling-Pipes without Offence. Again, Page 11. It is charged as a great Error in some, that held, It was not lawful for a Christian to take an Oath. Answ. To deny all Swearing, and taking of Oaths, is according to the Do∣ctrine and Command of Christ Jesus, who hath said, Swear not at all; so its ma∣nifest, that the false Christians accuse and condemn such for Hereticks as abide in the Doctrine of Christ, and keep his Commands: And thus both Papists and Pro∣testants are found in Error and Heresie themselves, and breaking the Command of Christ, and walking contrary to his Doctrine, in Swearing and taking Oaths, and condemning such as Hereticks as cannot take an Oath for Conscience sake; and so such as refused to take any Oath, walked in the Doctrine of Christ; and such
walked contrary to his Doctrine as did condemn them. And thus it is manifest, that Papists and false Christians are fallen from the Doctrine of Christ, and are calling Good Evil, and Evil Good, and putting Light for Darkness, and Dark∣ness for Light; for they account such as will take Oaths, and Swear, good Chri∣stians, who are Breakers of the Commands of Christ; and such as abide in the Doctrine of Christ, and cannot take any Oath, but keep the Commands of the Gospel, they are accounted Erronious, and Hereticks, and such like. And whereas the Author of Semper Iidem hath censured, judged and condem∣ned in his work, Iohn Wickliff and Iohn Lambert, Thomas Evison and Iohn Waddow, William White, Cornelius Bunge, Iohn Maundrel, Iohn Trankerfield, George Eagles, Hugh Latimer, Bishop Granmer, and Bishop Ridley, Thomas Hawkes, Richard Woodman; all of whom were Martyred and put to Death, because they dissen∣ted from, and denyed the Papists Religion: these by name, with a great many more, this nameless Author, with whom I am now dealing, hath condemned for Hereticks and Erronious Persons, and made void, as much as in him lies, their Blood, and justified the Papists in putting of them to Death. Now every particular Case of these particular Men, that he hath named and accused as Phanaticks and Hereticks, I shall not seek to shew or demonstrate, so as to justifie every man's particular Case against this nameless Author of Semper Iidem: but this is evident, That these men are reputed by Fox, in his Monuments, as MARTYRS of JESUS; and they have been reputed in England, for many years as such; and have been held of great Estimation, and have been accounted as the Fathers of the Protestant-Church: and my Judgment of them is this, That their Death generally was for the Testimony of Jesus, and because of their Faithfulness in denying the Church of Rome; for I do believe, That God did awa∣ken these men, with many more, and stir up their Hearts in their Day against the Idolatries and Superstitions of the Times they lived in, and many of them were sincere men, according to their Light and Knowledge in their Day; though I shall not justifie every particular man in every particular Part and Act of his Faith and Conversation, but shall leave that at this time reserved in mine own Heart: And still I say, for the most part they suffered Innocently on their part, and without Cause, and Cruelly, Inhumanely and Unjustly on their Enemies part; and they Martyred them, and put them to Death by Fires and Tortures unrighte∣ously, and as cruel Murderers on their part that Executed them. And in asmuch as their Sufferings were only and because of denying the Church of Rome, dissenting from her, and denying of her; and wherein only and alone their Sufferings were in this Cause, and for this End, they suffered as Servants of God; though, as I have said, I shall not justifie every particular man of them in his whole Faith and Con∣versation. And for a further Relation of these Persons, who were put to Death, menti∣oned by my Nameless Author, whom he accuseth for Phanaticks, and Hereticks, and such like, I leave it to be read in Fox's Acts and Monuments, where it may be read concerning the Martyrdom of every one of these particular men, with their Examinations, Tryals and Executions, as they are reported by Fox, who hath al∣wayes been reputed, A Faithful Chronologer of the Protestants Cause, till this Sem∣per Iidem seems to accuse him for a Lyar, and false Reporter, and such like. And whether the People of England have not better cause to believe his Relation of these Persons, than they have to believe they know not whom, viz. the Author of Semper Iidem; a Nameless Author, who hath reviled the Protestants Cause, and accounted the Martyrs and faithful Witnesses thereof Phanaticks and Hereticks? let themselves be Judges. But I shall leave this, only with desire, that these men whom he hath named, their particular Cases may be read in Fox's Acts and Monuments, which, if you look in the Table at the end of the second Volumn, ou shall find the mens names, with the Pages disciphered, where their Cases  be read; and when you have read them, then judge whether Semper Iidem
hath not falsified their Cases, and wickedly reviled them by the name of Ancient Phanaticks; thereby seeking to supplant the whole Protestant Religion, and all that dissent from the Church of Rome. And thus much in brief concerning the Martyrs, whom in the 14th Page, Sem∣per Iidem saith, That a notable part of the Sufferers, whom Fox makes relation of, were Phanaticks, and Sectaries and Mad Saints; and such like naughty words, by which he accuses a notable part (these be his words) which is the chiefest part of the Martyrs, related of by Fox; and accuseth Fox himself of double Injuries in his Relation, in that he hath Canonized Phanaticks, and Sectaries and Mad Saints, for Saints and Martyrs; and in that he Reviled and Accused Queen Mary, and the Papists in those dayes, of greater Persecutions than they were guilty of; and saith, They did no more than Henry the Eighth, and Edward the Sixth, and Queen Elizabeth did to the Papists: Thus it is manifest, That that well reputed of, and credited Historian, Fox, is reputed a Lyar, & false Reporter & so the Book of Martyrs made worth nothing, and Queen Mary & the Papists justified in what they did, in martyring and putting to Death the Protestants in their days; and also, Queen Elizabeth is secretly condemn'd in what she did against the Papists: Oh that these dayes should ever appear in England, which once were not thought of! These things are published and suffered in this Old Government, newly revived; Let the Protestants of England take notice of it, and see how the Records of their Martyrs are made null, and of none effect, and the Martyrs themselves slandered as Phanaticks, and the Martyrers justified as Righteous in what they did; and these things published and proclaimed up and down London. These things I cannot but observe, as full occasion is given me by Semper Iidem, How that the Papists Cause seems to revive, and to lift up its Head again in Eng∣land, in vilifying and reproaching the Cause of all the Protestants of all sorts, who seemingly begin to be crow'd over again, and the Death of their Martyrs made of none Effects (as aforesaid) And this is only in Love towards the Peo∣ple of England, to make them consider what attends them, and what Invasion is coming upon them, if it be not prevented; not that I wholy justifie the Protestants Cause against the Papists, though Semper Iidem pleads, That Queen Mary did no more to the Protestants, than Henry the Eighth, Edward the Sixth, and Queen Eliza∣beth did to the Papists: as the one Persecuted, Burned and Martyred the Prote∣stants, so the other did Persecute and Destroy the Papists; by which he would reason a justification of Queen Mary and the Papists, by the Example of others against them: Now I say, The Wickedness of one will not justifie the Wicked∣ness and Cruelty of the other; for neither Party of them are justifiable in the sight of God, but condemnable in such Proceedings; and it was doubtless of Antichrist and the Devil in both Papists and Protestants, to Destroy and Burn one another only for and because of Difference in Religion; and wherein the Protestants did put any of the Papists to Death, only for and because of Difference in Profession and Practice in Religion, and because they were Papists, herein the Protestants were acted by the same persecuting spirit of the Devil, as the Papists were acted by against them: so that I am not an absolute party with the Protestants, against the Papists; for I know that there is Error of Judgment amongst them, both in Faith, Worship and their whole Religion; only my End is at present in pursuing Semper Iidem, to confound his Bloody spirit of Persecution and Cruel∣ty, which I find him possessed withal, as by his Discourse is apparent; and also, to put the Protestants in mind how their cause begins to be Reproached, Vilified and Despised, even in their own Land, publickly in the Streets of their chief City, which hath not been the like for above an Hundred Years; And this is the End of my pursuing Semper Iidem with this Answer, and I shall not much enlarge fur∣ther, only in the 11th Page there is one Passage worth observing. There is instanced one Richard Woodman of Sussex, who affirmed, That he had the Spirit of God; and can prove, said he, by the Scriptures, that Paul had the Spirit of
God, as I my self, and all God's Elect have. Now, saith Semper Iidem, No Argu∣ments nor Reasons could reclaim him from his Errors; and so he was Burnt at Lewis, be∣cause he said, He had the Spirit of God, and could prove that Paul had it. Answ. There its manifest, that this Martyr suffered for Truth and Righteous∣ness sake, as a Saint and Servant of God, and for witnessing the Truth according to the Scripture, which saith, If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his; which is manifest in the Scriptures, that all that are Christ's, and Mem∣bers of his Church have: and it is also manifest, That the Papists have not the Spirit of God, because they Burn such as do witness and testifie that they have it, as here Semper Iidem hath given us an Instance, that they Burn and Destroy such for Hereticks as say, they have the Spirit of God; he not believing that Paul had it, but saith, It is an Error to affirm it: and yet this work seems now to be justified up and down London streets, which is the double Iniquity, and that which once many looked not to have seen, that any being condemned and burned as Hereticks, for saying, They had the Spirit of God, that this should be justified now in these Glorious Dayes of Light; this seems almost incredible, but that our Eyes behold it; and causeth wonder in many what will be the Effect of such a bad sign appearing, as a Justification of putting to Death the Innocent for no other Cause, but in that he affirmed. He had the Spirit of God. And by this we learn to know, how great the Ignorance, Darkness and Blindness of the Church of Rome is, and deserveth not the name of a Church, if they be all of this mind, to condemn men, and Burn them for Hereticks, for saying, They have the Spirit of God, and then an Hundred Years after justifie the doing of it; to their shame and confusion let this be rehearsed, who have themselves denyed that they have the Spirit of God, and Condemning and Destroying others for saying they have it. And this I leave to the Consideration of all the Protestants, who must ei∣ther deny that they have the Spirit of God, or be Condemned, and [may be] Killed as Hereticks for affirming it, if so be the Church of Rome recover her de∣sired Power and Pupose in England. Its worthy to be minded while it may be , lest the time come when it cannot be prevented. And thus I have run through the main part of Semper Iidem, and chiefly hint∣ed at the principal Matters worthy to be taken notice of (though much more might be said) but that it is my property in all Cases to be as brief as may be; for that is the best for the Understanding to contain what is spoken or written: only shall not forget William Pryn, who is stated in pag. 18. as one of our Mo∣dern Phanaticks; I would not forget to mind him, I say, to answer his part, and to clear himself if he can of the Aspertion of a Phanatick, by which term he stands reviled, though Semper Iidem fawneth upon him, and flattereth with him, and telleth him, He is the only Person in this unhappy Paralel, who hath given Testimony of his Reconcilement: But what better is William Pryn for this Flattery? I hope he is not yet reconciled to the Papists, and become one of them; if he be, I desire he would let us know it; and if he be not, then Semper Iidem accounts him a Pha∣natick: I shall say no further, but shall leave him to answer for himself.
And now, last of all, for Conclusion, I have some CONSIDERATI∣ONS to present to the People of ENGLAND, and particularly to the People of LONDON, occasioned by the Publication of Semper Iidem. 1. COnsider how the Ancient Martyrs, as Wickliff, Hawkes and Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, with many more, who have been accounted by the Protestants themselves, Famous for Piety and Faithfulness, and Honourably esteemed Innocent Martyrs, for their Witness-bearing against the Romish Idola∣tries, and this for many years in these Kingdoms; how, I say, they are now rendred Odious and Contemptible, and Scorned and Slandered as Hereticks, seditious factious Blasphemers, and Phanaticks, by the Author of Semper Iidem; and this published openly through the Nation, and up and down the Streets of London, and this without rebuke from any in Authority, that we know of: I say, this deserves serious Consideration, That the Faithful Martyrs in their Day, according to their Knowledge, who were as the first Fathers of the Prote∣stants-Church (so called) and did lay down their Lives, and seal their Testimony with their Blood against the Idolatry of the then present Times; and the Lives and Blood of these Men now to be made void, and they that Martyred them ju∣stified, as doing of Justice, and they now reputed Hereticks and Phanaticks publickly; this ought to be considered, both in the Cause why it is thus, and in the Effect of it, if it be not restrained. 2. Consider, How that the generality of the People of England and London are reputed, and stand under the present Reproach of being Phanaticks, even all the People of England, I say, except the Papists, not only the Separatists from the Church of England as Quakers, Anabaptists, Independents (so called) and the rest, but the Presbyterians and Episcopals, and all of that way; and these Professi∣ons stand in Reputation, and are accounted Phanaticks and Hereticks, even William Pryn himself; and this is manifest by the Author of Semper Iidem, who hath reviled and reproached all the People of England publickly and openly: For, seeing the Antient Martyrs, the Fathers (so accounted) of the Church of England are villified as Phanaticks, Then must needs follow, that the Church of England, even in the way of Episcopacy (as being in their own account the Successors of the Martyrs in some things at least) are also Pha∣naticks and such as Semper Iidem saith, the Old Phanaticks were: for the men being reputed Phanaticks, who were as the Fathers, then needs must the Chil∣dren be the same; and this deserves serious Consideration by the Protestants of England. 3. Consider how the very Cause it self of Protestants in this their long Contest for these many years, with, and against the Church of Rome, is now weakened, and even, as it seems, in a way of losse and decay, being now re∣proached and held under publick scorn in England by Semper Iidem; I say, the very Cause of the Protestants is new struck at and beat against, and sought to be destroyed, being already defamed and reviled, as appears by the discourse of the nameless Author, who hath rendred the Antient Martyrs (that pro∣moted as much as they could the Protestants Cause against the Church of Rome, and dyed for it, many of them sealing the Cause with their Blood (as Here∣ticks, Erroneous Rebels and Phanaticks, and hath also rendred Fox, and his Acts and Monuments, who hath hitherto in England been counted a true Repor∣ter and Historian of the PROTESTANTS Sufferings, as invalid as possible,
even that he is a Lyar, and his Chronology Untruths; and hath justified Queen Mary and the Papists, who put the Martyrs to Death. And these things considered duly and justly, how is the Protestants Cause it self struck at, and weakened, and as it were, the very Victory given to the Papists against the Protestants, in this long Quarrel between them, ever since Henry the Eighth's dayes, and long before? 4. Consider, How the Papists Cause seems to be reviving in England, and how bold the Members of the Church of ROME are of late dayes grow∣ing, as to appear so publickly in Print, justifying their own Cause as good; as Queen Mary, and the Papists in her dayes, in Martyring and Burning the Protestants, and condemning the Martyrs of the Protestants as Hereticks and Phanaticks: This, I say, is great Boldness in the Papists, more than hath been for this Hundred of Years, and a Sign of a Reviving and Recovering of their Cause more than hath been for many Years, who durst not any of them appear so publick, as the Author of Semper Iidem hath done, with that Boldness and Courage, to justifie the Papists Cause, and condemn the Prote∣stants: For, if such a Discouse as Semper Iidem had been brought forth and published in the dayes of Queen ELIZABETH, which were Darker Dayes then these are, it is possible it would not have been suffered to be cryed up and down LONDON, but Restrained and Condemned for the Fire: But now the Papists have taken Confidence to themselves, and are of better Hopes than formerly, even that they shall have Fire and Faggot again, and to Burn and Destroy such as differ and dissent from them, whom they may call Hereticks and Phanaticks. And this I observe from the spirit of Semper Iidem. 3. Consider, The Nature, and Constitution, and Disposition of the spi∣rit of the Church of ROME, how that it is not Changed, but the self-same that ever it was, viz. A spirit of Murder and Cruelty, that hath Killed and Martyred such as have Differed from them, and been Contrary-Minded in Religi∣ous Matters; and it would work and bring to pass the same still, if it had its Power without Limitation in ENGLAND; The Papists, I say, would Burn, Kill, and Torture such as they judge Hereticks, and all that cannot Bow, and Bend, and Conform to their Wayes, and Injunctions and Reli∣gion; this they would be at again in England, if it were in their Power, as it was heretofore. I say, This ought to be considered, even the Cruelty of that spirit, and what Danger there is in it to give way to the Exaltation of that spirit, and to embrace it in the least, whereby to give it occasion to get into the Power and Judgment-Seat: for if it doth, then Fire and Fag∣got, and Killing and Burning about Religion, will openly appear again; and this seems to be manifest by the Constitution of the spirit of Semper Iidem, which may give Good and Wholsome Cautions, that the spirit of the Papists is still a Cruel Spirit, and would Destroy all that Differ from their Way, if they had Power; and that that spirit is not to be Hugged and Embra∣ced, nor set highest, lest the Effect of it proves Woful to England, by bring∣ing forth again what it once did, in Renewing Fire and Faggot; for this is the Disposition of the spirit of the Romish Church, as is apparent by Semper Iidem. 6. Consider how Careful and Vigilant the People of England ought to be, to wait and attend the Motions of the Spirit of the Church of Rome, lest it insinuate it self into Authority, and get its intended Advantage and Purpose against the Protestants and their Cause, and advance it self against them, and promote its own Interest, and Destroy and overturn theirs: For, without all Controver∣sie, that same spirit is now at work to agitate its Desires, and according to its
old course, its Hatching and Contriving how to promote it self, and destroy all that's contrary; it is Undermining and secretly Surmizing its Opponents Overthrow, that it self may be exalted: For that spirit is diligent in its way, to take the least Occasion for its Self-advantage, as is manifest by Semper Iidem; and therefore the People of England ought also to be Careful and Dili∣gent in their Cause, to Preserve themselves and their Interest from the defeat of the Church of ROME; and they ought to watch against that spirit, to keep it in subjection under Authority and Command, and not to exalt it into Com∣mand over them, lest they be subjected to the Idolatries, and Oppressions and Persecutions of that spirit to their own Destruction, both of Persons, Estates, and Religion; for that spirit will attempt alwayes to Rule, and if it Rule, then will follow consequently, An Utter Overthrow of the Protestants PER∣SONS and CAUSE that will be the Effect of the Authority of it, though it bear hand in hand in seeming Love and good Agreement with the Protestants, till it hath gained its desired end over them, which is, To promote it self, and subdue by Burning and Cruel Tortures all that which is contrary to it. Let the People of ENGLAND consider this Matter, now while it is time, and be Watchful over the Motions of that spirit, and not put Confidence in it too far, nor to commit too much Credit upon it, even as they love their own Safety and Peace, which are concerned in this Case. 7. Consider, Into what a great Danger the Protestants and People of Eng∣land have run themselves, by ecing from a less; for, by avoiding the Secta∣es (so called) they have run themselves into the very Borders of Popery; and to escape a Less Danger, they have exposed themselves to a far Greater: For the Protestants cryed out of the Sectaries, and were afraid their Church and Religion should be overthrown by them, and made haste to Escape and flee from the Danger, and in so doing they have (as it appeareth by Semper Iidem) run themselves into a Danger far greater, Even to have their Religi∣on, and Persons and Estates Destroyed by Fire and Faggot, if the spirit that indicted Semper Iidem hath its desired End, which is grown Bold and Confi∣dent, more than formerly: Thus, while the Protestants have sought to destroy the Sectaries, an Enemy is appearing to Destroy them; and they have exposed them∣selves (if Popery prevails) to an Enemy far more Cruel and Dectructive to both their Persons, Estates and Religion, than ever the Sectaries would have been, had they prevail∣ed? And this is considerable to the Protestants, that they may lament their case, who have run themseles into a far greater Danger of their own Destruction to escape a less, and are in present Reproach by the Papists, and exposed to Destru∣ction if they prevail. 8. Consider, How Favourable the Church of ROME seemeth to grow of these late dayes in these Kingdoms; and what Dignity she seems to have at∣tained to, besides of Times past; and what Liberty she enjoyes, more than many of the good Subjects of England, which may as justly have the Priviledge of Liberty in their Exercise of Faith, and Worship, and Religion, as she can have: As for instance, In Ireland, where the Papists have the Enjoyment of their Liberty to Meet to hear Mass very frequently, and are not Restrained nor Prohibited; and many of the English Inhabitants, known Faithful Prote∣stants, are not admitted the like Liberty, but their Meeting broken up, and they sent to Prison, and Cruelly Persecuted for Meeting together, when the Papists are not meddled withal for the same Cause; and thus their Cause seems more to be favoured than the Protestants, and they more Liberty in their Worship than many of the English Protestants. And also, In and a∣bout London, upon search, you will find Meetings of the Papists, large ones too, consisting of very many Forreigners of other Lands, which have their Liberty of
Worship and Profession of Religion; and divers of the Inhabitants of the City, who have been and are Known; Upright, Honest and Just Persons, and are true Protestants, and faithful Subjects of the Land, are not admitted to have their Meetings, but are haled out of Meetings, Persecuted, and sent to Prison, and cruel Sufferings inflicted upon them, for the Exercise of their Faith and Wor∣ship; whenas the Papists are admitted their Liberty, without Persecution, in the same Cause for which many good Protestants are Perfecuted, and not suffered to have their Liberty, even in the Exercise of their Faith and Worship, and this is manifest to all People; by which it is plain, how the Papists Cause is advancing, and the Protestants Cause decaying in LONDON, and through ENG∣LAND; whenas the Papists, and that Forreigners, have more Liberty in the Exercise of their Religion, then some Protestants have that are Natives, and known to be good Subjects: And these things deserve true and serious Confide∣ration by all good Protestants; Alas that this day should be seen! Many more Considerations might be asserted in this Case, of the Papists Cause being as it were reviving; but these for present are presented to the publick View of all People: And blessed are they that have an Ear to hear. E. B.
THE CASE OF Free Liberty OF CONSCIENCE In the Exercise of FAITH and RELIGION, Presented unto the KING and both Houses of PARLIAMENT: And also Proved absolute Needful and Requisit for them to Grant and Allow in these Kingdoms; by many Considerations and Reasons unfolding the Woful Effects and Ill Consequence which will infallibly follow upon the contrary, to the Mi∣sery and Destruction of these Nations, if the Free Exercise of Conscience to God-ward be Limit∣ted and Violently Restrained. FOrasmuch as it hath pleased the Lord God of Heaven and Earth (who is Mighty and Powerful, and bringeth to pass whatsoever he will in the Kingdoms of this World) so to suffer it to be accomplished, that Power and Authority is given unto you, to exercise over these Kingdoms; And where∣as the People of these Nations (over whom your Authority is extended) are divided in their Judgments in Matters Spiritual, and are of different Principles and Wayes in relation to Faith, and Worship, and Practices of Religion; and yet are all of them Free-born People, and Natives of these Kingdoms; and as such ought to possess and enjoy their Lives, Liberties and Estates by the Just Laws of God and man; And may not justly any of them be Destroyed by you, nor one sort of another, in their Persons and Estates, by Death, Banish∣ment, or other Persecutions, for and because only of their Differences in Mat∣ters of Opinion and Judgment; nor though they are contrary minded in Pro∣fession of Faith and Worship and Religion, while they do walk Peaceably and Justly in their Conversations, under the King's Authority, and do not make practice of their Religion to the violating of the Government, nor to the In∣jury of other mens Persons or Estates; but ought rather to be Defended and Protected by you in all their Rights, both as Men and Christians, both in things
Civil and Spiritual, Notwithstanding their difference in matters Religious as aforesaid, they giving proof of their peaceable and honest deportment towards the King and his Government, and the people of these Kingdoms. And therefore that due care may be had, as justly it ought to be by you, for the peace and Prosperity and happiness of these Kingdoms, and that the just Liberties both civil and Spiritual of all people therein, may be allowed and maintained in all the Kings Dominions, and that unity and peace may be fully established, and justice and Righteousness only brought forth in the Land, and all persecution, Hatred, Contention and Rebellions may die and perish and never more appear; And that all Christian people (though different in Judgement and practises in matters of Faith and worship) may be protected to live a quiet and peaceable life in all Godliness and honesty under this Go∣vernment and that indignation and vengeance may be diverted from these Lan, which seems to threaten because of the contrary, and that blessings and peace ma come, and rest upon this people forever. Therefore for these ends and causes, and in the Name of the Lord I do pro∣pound unto you, and lay before you on the behalf of all the divided people of these Kingdoms, That free Liberty of conscience in the exercise of Faith, Worship and Religion to God-wards, may be allowed and maintained unto all, without any imposition, violence or persecution exercised about the same, on the persons, Estates, or Consciences of any in any relation to Religion, the Worship of God, Church Government and Mi∣nistry; But that all Christian People may be left free in all these Kingdoms, in the exer∣cise of Conscience without being restrained from, or compelled to any way of worship and practise of Religion, upon any pains and penalties, and that every one may be admitted to worship God in that way as his spirit perswades the heart, and may be defended in such their profession of Religion, while they make not use of their Liberty to the detrement of any other mens persons or Estates as aforesaid. And let it not seem strange to you, why I appear in this manner and matter, at such a season as this; for your very Happiness, prosperity and establishment, or the contrary, dependeth hereupon, even in allowing and maintaining liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Religion, or in limitting and forcing and persecuting about the same, and this may appear if you justly consider these things following. 1. The Lordship in and over conscience, and the exercise thereof in all matters of Faith, and Worship, and duty to God-wards, is Gods alone only and proper right and priviledge, and he hath reserved this power and Authority in him∣self, and not committed the Lordship over Conscience, nor the exercise thereof, in the cases of faith and worship, to any upon Earth, not to perscribe and impose principles and practises of Faith and worship and Religion, by force and vi∣olence on the persons and Consciences of men, but this belongs only to God, even to work faith in the heart, and to convert to holiness, and to lead and teach people by his Spirit in his worship, and to exercise their Consciences in all his wayes; For the Apostles themselves said, they had not Dominion over the Faith of the Saints, 2 Cor. 1. 24. but the Lord alone. And King Charles the first, said in his Meditations, page 91. of that Edition Printed for R. Royston; I have often declared, how little I desire my Laws and Scepter should intrench on God's Soveraignity, which is the only King of men's Consciences, &c. So that to be Lord in CONSCIENCE, and Exerciser thereof in all the Mat∣ters of God's Kingdom, is his Only Proper Right, and to him alone it appertains. 2. And therefore consider, If ye do not allow Free Liberty of Conscience, and give unto God the Lordship and Exercise thereof, in all Matters of Faith and Worship to Him-wards; but do impose by Violence in forcing to, and restraining from such and such Wayes of Religion; than ye take Dominion over mens Faith, which ye ought not to do; and ye intrench on
God's Soveraignity, and usurpe his Authority, in exercising Lordship over the Conscience, in and over which Christ is only King, as before recited; and ye ought not to take his right from him, nor to exercise that Authority over ruens Faith and Consciences which only appertains unto him, as his proper pri∣viledge; for in so doing how dangerous effects may it bring forth? even ye may easily provoke the Lord to wrath against you, and bring upon your selves sorrow and misery, if ye exercise violence upon mens Consciences in and concerning Religious matters, contrary to the Scriptures and the example of Primitive Christians who were persecuted for their Conscience sake, but did never persecute nor punish any for that cause, nor ever used violence about their Religion, as Charles the I. in his meditations pag. 82. Nothing (said he) violent nor injurious can be religious, &c. 3. Consider, if ye allow not the free exercise of Conscience in Spiritual matters, but do take Dommion over mens faith, and impose by violence in the cases of Conscience about Religion, and do not suffer the Lord to enjoy his only right to be King, in the matters of his own Kingdom, then ye divert the end of just rule and government among men, and pervert the end of Gods great love and favour shewed unto you in restoring of you to the place of Authority and Judgement; for the end of just Government upon earth by Kings and Rulers is, To exercise Justice, Truth, and Righteousness among men, and over the outward man, and to be a praise to all that do well and walk uprightly, and to be a terror to all transgressors, and them that do evil in their out∣ward man, and to keep the outward man in good order by just Judgment in all cases between man and man; This is only the extent of your Authority over the outward man, and to your Jurisdiction only this belongs, to judge in Truth and Righteousness to make Laws and execute them between man and man, to preserve mens persons and estates from the wrong one of another, but not at all to make Laws and execute them between God and mens Consci∣ences in the cases of his Spiritual Kingdom, this power belongs to God, and he hath not committed it to you to exercise; and therefore, let justice, equity and mercy be exercised by you among men, and over the outward man, and in all cases between man and man, but meddle not in the Cases of mens faith to God, and their Consciences to him, but leave that unto him alone whose right it is, for it is dangerous, and will bring wofull effects if ye intrench on Gods Soveraignity, and if ye divert the proper end of just Government, and of the Love of God in restoring you into Authority and power. 4. Consider if ye allow not free Liberty of Conscience in the profession and practice of spiritual things, but will compel by violence about Religion, then this will inavoidably produce and bring forth cruel persecution in the Kingdoms, imprisonment, banishment, and death, and all the evil effects of persecution will fill the Nations; for though never so forceable impositions be laid on the persons, estates, and consciences of men, for the cause of difference in Judg∣ment, and practises of Religion, and tocompel into Conformity, yet it cannot be supposed that all will bow and conform to the denying of that way which they are perswaded in Conscience to be right, and to the embracing of what they cannot in Conscience believe is of God, but will rather suffer the cruelest death, then conform to any thing contrary to light and knowledge; and if free Liberty of Conscience be denied, many such must needs be exposed to Per∣secution even to Death, though they may be Peaceable People, and profitable Inhabitants of the Kingdoms, and in the things between man and man, and in all matters Temporal pertaining to the King, may be Just, and Righteous and Unreprovable; yet because of Difference in Judgment and Opinion, exposed to be destroyed in person and estate; and such effects will not be of honour nor saftey to these Nations if innocent and just men be destroyed, and their relations ruined, only for their Conscience and Religion sake, by persecu∣tion.
5. Consider, if ye do impose one way of worship by force, and perse∣cute all that are contrary-minded to prison and death, then how shall your Names and memorial be left a reproach to Generations after you, in dayes to come; who shall repute you cruel men and persecutors, and such as destroyed your people for difference in Matters of Religion, and without just Cause; and thus will your Names be a Curse, and not a Blessing, to your Children, and their Children to all Ages, if that ye make Laws, and execute them to the Persecution and Destruction of People for Conscience sake, and for difference in Religion; for Persecution was never of God, nor ever justified in succeeding Ages; but Persecutors alwayes were rendred Tyrants, and Cruel in the Ages succeeding them: For do not you condemn the Papists as Oppressors and Cruel Persecutors in Queen Mary's dayes, for the Persecuting your Fore-Fathers? And K. Iames said, it was usually the Condition of Christians to be persecuted, but never to Per∣secute, &c. in his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, page 4. And indeed, they are no true Christians that persecute for Matters of Conscience, and Difference in Opinion; but the False Christians, that have a Form of God∣liness, but are without the Power, and out of the Doctrine of the Scriptures, who say, Love your Enemies, and render not Evil for Evil; but overcome evil with good. 6. Consider, If ye do impose upon the Conscience, and persecute about Re∣ligion, ye can never effect your End thereby, as to force all into a Conformity and Uni∣formity to your Church and Religion; but though Death, and Banishment, and the Loss of all be inflicted, yet such a thing cannot be effected, neither is it the Way of Christ to promote his Church, and to convert the Contrary-minded, by such means as Force and Violence exercised on mens Persons and Estates; as King Iames said in his Speech in Parliament, 1609. That it is a sure Rule in Divinity, That God never loves to plant his Church with Violence and Blood: And if ye do per∣secute to the heighth in the Case of Religion, ye will weaken your selves, and cause the Love and good Affection of the People to die towards you, and the Persecuted will grow, and their Cause be made Honourable, and many will be encreased unto it; for it is usual in Ages, That the Way and Religion which hath been most persecuted, hath most grown; and thus it must infallibly be at this day, and ye can never effect your End-by Persecution, nor promote your own Church, nor destroy all the Contrary-minded; as a Privy-Counsellor to K. Iames the 5th of Scotland, advised in Counsel about the year 1539. upon the Occasion of diversities of Opinions then in that Kingdom, said he, It is an Error of State in a Prince, for an Opinion of Piety to condemn to Death the Adherers to new Do∣ctrines; for the Constancy and Patience of those who voluntarily suffer all Temporal Mise∣ries for Matters of Faith, stir up Numbers, who at first, and before they had suffered were ignorant of their Faith and Doctrine, not only to favour their Cause, but to embrace their Opinions, Pitty and Commiseration opening the Gates, and thus their Faith is spread, and their Number daily encreaseth, &c. 7. Consider, If that ye do not allow Liberty of Conscience, but do Impose, and Persecute, as aforesaid; though some for your Fear, and Terror, and Force against their Consciences should deny their Principle, and conform to your Church, such ye cause to sin; For whatsoever is performed by Force, and not of Faith is sin, as it is written, and such their sin will be laid to your Charge; and such who cannot deny their Principles, and Conform, will be destroyed, and their Death will be accounted against you in the Day of the Lord: And therefore, if ye do not allow Liberty of Conscience, many grievous Evils will infallibly follow, both to your selves and your People: And what Advan∣tage of Honour will such be to God and your Church, that are against their Consciences and Light forced into a Conformity for Fear and Terror of men; it makes them manifold more the Children of the Devil, and Time-Servers, and Hypocrites, and destroyes their Souls; and such can be no true Members of the true Church of Christ, but are Reprobates, and a Dishonour to God and your Church.
8. Consider, if ye constrain and compel in matters of Religion, and do not low liberty of Conscience, it is unreasonable and unequal, and down-right contrary  the Holy and pure Law of God, which saith, ye shall do into all men, as ye would that men should do unto you, and thou shalt love they neighbour as thy self, and this is the fulfilling of the Law; But to be imposed upon and persecu∣ted for the case of Consciences, and for the matters of Worship of God, your selves would not willingly be against your Light and Knowledge, and then it is unequal and unjust, and contrary to the Law of God, for ye to do the same to others, which your selves would not be done unto; And do not you to this day cry out against the Papists in Queen Maries dayes, and at this day in other Nations, and condemn them as Tyrants and Oppressors, for Persecuting, Killing, and Destroying the Protestants, for the matters of their Conscience and difference in Opinion and Judgment? And will you do the same at this day as they do to others, and follow their example of cruelty and Persecution, and break the Law of God, and walk contrary to it, in doing to others what you would not be done unto? And seeing you condemn the late fore-going Powers in these Kingdoms for Tyrants and U∣surpers, and Oppressors, for prohibiting your way of Worship, and command∣ing the contrary, and disanulling so much as they could your service Book and Ministry; how can you justly do the like to others, as to force Wayes of RELIGION upon them, and prohibit theirs, and command the con∣trary? if you do it, ye condemn your selves by judging of others in the like case. 9. Consider if ye do not allow liberty of Conscience, but impose Church Government and Religion by pains and penalties, then ye will fill the Land with Hypocrites, and force people into time-serving obedience, and into for∣mal wayes of worship, some against their Consciences, and some in the ig∣norance thereof, which is great abomination unto the Lord, and such will neither be true and faithfull in Church nor State, but will seek advantages against you (if they are forced by violence in the cases of their Consciences) and it will beget great contentions and hatred in the minds of men, and divide the into heart-burnings one against another, and against you and your Government; for if men become Hypocrites for your fear and terror and deny their professed Principles and conform, they will be false-heart∣ed, and Envious, and Malicious, and attempt any thing to be freed from Bondage and Impositions of Conscience, and their Hearts will be dis-en∣gaged in Love and Affection to you-wards; and this will be infallibly the Effect of Persecution for Conscience sake, as King Charles the first saith in his Meditations, A charitable Connivance and Christian Toleration often dissipates their Strength when rougher Opposition fortifies, and puts the Dispised and Oppressed Party into such combinations, as may most enable them to get a full revenge on those they count their persecutors, &c. 10. Consider, if ye force Worship, and Religion, and cause men to conform against their Judgments, how dangerous is this to destroy mens souls, and to lead  even to destruction; For seeing ye affirm not the Infallibility of your Worship and Religion, and yet will impose them, and so engage mens Souls in depandancy for Salvation upon things and wayes uncertain, and which GOD giveth not the Faith to believe in; I say how dangerous is this to ruin souls; for in no way can the soul be secure but in the faith which God works in the heart, in the Obedience of Infallible TRUTH; So ye  mens souls upon a Rock, and it is unreasonable as before mentioned, that men should be forced into the profession and Practice of uncertain and fallible Religion, and that they should be forced by you into that which may be evil, for which not you altogether, but themselves must bear the punishment in the Day of the Lord; and except ye could affirm and prove the infallibility
of your Church (which is impossible) there is no Equity nor Right Reason for it, That you should impose upon others any more than others should impose upon you; For, as King Charles the First said in his Meditation, He desired not any should be further Subjects unto him, then he and all of them might be subject unto God, &c. 11. Consider, if ye allow not liberty of Conscience, but persecute about the same, ye walk in the way and after the example of some of the Heathen Rulers, and of the false Christians, and shews that ye allow of the cruel persecutions by the Church of Rome, and ye follow their example, who persecute unto death such as they call Hereticks, and if ye do persecute for matters of Conscience, then ye allow the very deeds of the Heathens, who persecuted the Christians for their Religion sake, and ye justifie Papists in persecuting the Protestants; and ye plainly demon∣strate unto all the World by your works and fruits, that ye are of Antichrist, if ye impose on mens Consciences by force in the matters of Religion, and perse∣cute good Conscience about the same; for it was the Antichrist and the Beast, that first forced all to worship, and violently engaged all into a conformity, and killed and persecuted all that would not worship according to the Image, Rev. 13. as ye may read. And it was not Christs way, nor the practice of any of his primitive Churches to impose and force on the persons and Consciences of men concer∣ning their Church and Religion, to cause all into a conformity thereunto, and destroy and persecute all that would not; This was not the way of Christ and his Apostles in their daies, but they left Religion free, and said they were not lords over mens faith, nor lords over Gods Heritage, neither did impose upon any in doubtful cases of conscience, much lesse compel against mens Conciences; for the Apostle left the practice of doubtful things, as every one was perswaded in his own mind, to do or not to do, without imposing by force or directions of persecution about the same; Therefore if ye do not allow free liberty of Conscience, ye are out of the Do∣ctrine Example of Christ and his Apostles, and follows the way and example of Antichrist, Heathen Rulers, and cruel Papists, to your great dishonour. 12. Consider, if ye allow not liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Religi∣on, but impose and persecute about the same; It must inavoidably tend to destroy and expel Trading, Husbandry, and Merchandize in these Kingdoms, for a great part of Trading and Husbandry depends upon such kind of persons whose princi∣ples are for toleration in Religion, and hates persecution and violence in that case, this ye will find true on examination; and if liberty of Conscience be not al∣lowed, such will be exposed to great afflictions, some to imprisonment, and some to poverty, and some to flee into other Countries, to the destruction of their Cal∣lings and Trading, and the hands and industriousnes of such people will be weak∣ned in these Kingdoms, if they cannot enjoy their just liberty in temporal & spi∣ritual cases, and the effects thereof will work wofully in this very respect, even to dis-enable both the hearts and hands of Husbandmen and Trades, and expose these Nations to want and poverty, and to enrich their enemies. 13. Consider, If Liberty of Conscience be deny'd, and Persecution be introduc'd about the same; all these, and many more woful Consequences and Effects will follow in∣fallibly, to the ruin of these Kingdoms; even Wars, and Bloodsheds, and Discontents, and Murmurings, and all evil things will be the Product of the aforesaid Cause (viz.) Of denying Liberty of Conscience in Religious Matters; for, in a word, it will tend to, and may effect the Overthrow of you, and Ruin your Government and Authority; for the great and mighty God of Heaven and Earth will be provoked against you, and his Wrath will go out like a Devouring Flame upon you, if that ye limit the Holy One, and will not suffer him to exercise his proper Right, in being King in mens Consciences, to exercise them in all the Wayes of his Worship, and Matters of his Kingdom, but do oppress, impose and per∣secute about the same; this, I say, will infallibly work the Kingdoms ruin, and expose you and your Government to the Indignation of the Holy Lord God, who is tender of his Ho∣nour, and will not give it to another; and he loveth and effecteth the Cause of
such, whose Consciences are truly tender towards him; and though ye persecute such, and seek to destroy them, and for a time exercise great Afflictio: and ressions upon them, for the matters of their Conscience, yet the God of Heaven will appear for such in his season, and deliver them, and avenge their ersecuors; And therefore all ye Rulers consider, and lay these things to heart, lest ye provoke the Lord against you, by destroying the People whom he regards, and that not for evil doing, but for the Caes of Con∣science, and because they cannot relinquish their profession and principles of their Religion, and how and conform in things against their Light and Knowledge. 14. Consider, If ye allow not Liberty of Conscience, what exceeding danger  run your selves into, even to destroy just men and righteous, as Hereticks and erroneous, and may promote Hereticks as Church-members, both which are great Abominations in the Sight of God, and this Danger ye bring upon your selves, for ye are not infallible Judges, who are Hereticks, and who are not; and therefore may easily proceed in that way to punish such as Hereticks that are not truly so, and except ye could affirm and Prove your possession of the infallible spirit, ye can no way proceed justly & reasonably to deny Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Religion, nor punish and per∣secute any in that case: but if ye do, ye do it in ignorance, and know not what ye do, and may as soon destroy true Christians and Saints, as Hereticks, for want of infallible judgment to discern who are, and who are not; and this is a danger ye ought to avoid by allowing the free exercise of Conscience, as the Lord perswades every mans heart. 15. And lastly, also consider what a reproach you are under, If such whom ye call Heretick, (and yet doth not infallibly know that they are such) be punished, and persecuted, and destroyed for their Religion sake, who are just and upright men, in their Conversing between man and man, and unreprovable in their dealings among men; (whether they err in judgment in spiritual knowledge, or not err) and such as are Drunkards prophae persons go at liberty, in their stage-playing and gaming, and the like, even tolerated, and un∣punished, and not prohibited, whom all do know and can distinguish who such are when they appear, this will render your Government to evil reputation, both in this present time and in ages to come; and therefore consider it, if Drunkards, Gamesters, and prophane persons have more toleration and liberty in their wayes of open vanity, then sober temperate persons in the exercise of their Consciences in Religion, which if any such do err in prin∣ciple (which is not infallibly known to you) it is only to their own hurt in the sight of God, and he onely and not you ought to punish them in that case; but prophane persons as a fore-mentioned are easily judged by all to be such, and their error inpractise is hurtful to the whole Kingdoms and pertains to you to punish; as Dr. Taylor now a Bishop in Ireland hath said, his words in this ase are worth observing, why are we so zealous, saith he, against those we call Hereticks, and yet great friends, with Dunkards, and Swearers, and Forni∣cators, and intemperate, and idle persons; I am certain a Drunkard is as controy to God, and lives as contrary to the Laws of Christianity as a Heretick, and I am also sure that I Know what Drunkennesse is, but I am not sure that such an opinion is heresie, &c. And these things I do in all meeknesse and due respect both to your places and persons, present to your serious considerations, that ye may prevent these evil effects that are so destructive unto you and these Kingdoms, which abso∣lutely must follow, upon not allowing free Liberty of Conscience in the Exercise of Religion; if any shall object, That to tolerate and allow Liberty of Con∣science in Religion is inconsistent with the safety and peace of the King and these Kingdoms; I shall be desirous to hear from wise men what such objections are, stated by them, and wherein they say it is not Congruous
with the Happiness and Peace of these Nations, to grant and allow the Premi∣ses: And on such Occasion, I should make clearly to appea the contrary; and that it is only consistant with the Peace and Prosperity of these Kingdoms (consi∣dering them in their present Estate) To grant and allow Free Liberty of Conscience, as aforesaid, in the Exercise of Religion unto all Christian People. O! Remember, ye Mighty Men of the Kingdom, That the Great and Migh∣ty GOD takes notice of all your Doings, and accordingly will he reward you in his Dreadful Day, which is near to come upon all the World; and Wo unto the Wicked in that Day. O! Remember that ye your selves not long since were a Suffering People, and now you are raised up again; and therefore be not too zealous to afflict others, especially for the Cases of their Consciences, in re∣ference to their Faith and Perswasions about Religion; but be Gentle, Meek and Long-suffering towards all; for that is the way to make Peace, and preserve it with all men, that will gain the Affections of the Contrary-minded; but Force and Rigour will exasperate the more, and never truly reconcile differences among men: And make no Laws contrary or different to the pure Law of God; but let pure Consciences go free, without Force or Restraint in the Exercises of Religi∣on, and let God have his Prerogative and Lordship in the Exercise of Consci∣ence; but let your Authority be extended over the outward man, in the matters between man and man, to preserve Peace and Right in all outward relation: And be Wise and Learned, ye Rulers of the Earth, and kiss the Son, lest he be Angry, and ye perish; and if his Wrath be kindled but a little, blessed are they that trust in him. This is your Time and Day, happy are ye if it be given to you to do the Work that God requires of you only. The 26th of the third Moneth, 1661. By a Lover of Truth and Just Government, E. B.
A DISCOVERY OF Divine Mysteries; VVherein is Unfolded Secret THINGS of the KINGDOM of GOD: Being a TESTIMONY 1. Concerning Life and Death, with their several Fruits and cts Di∣stinguished. 2. Concerning the Mystery of God, and Godliness; and concerning the My∣stery of the Devil and Iniquity. 3. Concerning True Liberty of Conscience, what it is in it self, and how obtained, And what the▪ True Guide and Rule is of the Exercise of Conscience. 4. Concerning the Diversity of Judgments in Religion, the Cause and Effect thereof, and the Means to bring to Unity. All which are Published for the Edification of such as desire to know the TRUTH. The PREFACE. THE Light of the Day of GOD Almighty is arisen upon us in our Day, and the Shinings-forth thereof is with great Clear∣ness and Force, even as the Sun at Noon-day; and many are come to the Glorious Appearance thereof, and to walk in its Light with much Ioyfulness; for, as the Wise-Man said, The Light is Sweet, and a Pleasant Thing it is for the Eye to behold the Son. And so fully is our Morning-Son now appeared, that the Upright in Heart may Walk, and not stumble; and the Poor in Spirit may Run in the Path of Life, and not fall, For, indeed we may say; The NIGHT
is spent, and the DAY is come; therefore let us Walk in the Day, and put on the Armour of Light, as many as are made the Children thereof. And where the Light of this Son is arisen, and in whose Hearts it shi∣neth, it cannot but give some Testimony through such an one, of its own Glory, Vertues, and Excellency, to them that sit yet in Darkness, and in the  of Corruption, that they also may  the same Light and Glory arise on their Tabernacles: For 'tis the Property of this Spiritual Heavenly Light, to shine forth out of Darkness, and to give Light to such as have long sate in Darkness, that their Souls may live, and be refreshed with the Light of the Living. And for this Cause do we Labour, and Spend, and re Spent; accounting nothing too dear for us, that the Light of Truth may shine abroad, and guide the Upright in the per∣fect Way, till the Elect be gathered into the Pasture of Eternal Life, and the Son so elivated on the Firmament of Joy and Praises never to go down; but the Saying fulfilled, There shall be no Night, but the Light of the Son shall be as the Light of seven dayes. These following Testimonies were written at divers Times, as the Lord drew forth my Spirit through the Motions of his Life in me; some of them some years since; and being cast by among Bundles of Manuscripts, and now lately coming to my sight, and looking them over, I have thought good to send them abroad, as being of service to many: And this is the Occasion and End of my present publishing these things. And to the Iudg∣ment of the Spirit of God in all the Saints, do I commend my Labours, and myself to be approved. Westmoreland the 25th of the 7th Moneth, 1661. Who am a Friend to all Men, E. B.
A DISCOVERY of DIVINE MYSTERIES, &c. CHAP. I. A Testimony concerning Life and Death, and their several Fruits and Effects Distinguished. THere is only Life and Death, and there is but only Life and Death in the whole Creation, that Ruleth and Raigneth in, and among, and over all the Children of Men; and all the Children of Men upon the Face of the Earth are under the Government and Dominion of LIFE or of DEATH, in whatsoever they are, and in whatsoever they do; and Life or Death hath the Rule and Government in every Creature in every Exercise, whether of Works or Words; and all people upon the Earth are subject to the Government of one or the other, and bring forth the Fruits and Works in obedience to Life or to Death, and shews them forth in visible appearance. Now these two (to wit) Life and Death, are contrary one to the other in Beeing, in Nature, in Works and Fruits; and each of these are known and distinguished the one from the other in Beeing, in Nature, in Fruits and Effects, which diversly they bring forth in this World; and each of them hath a Kingdom and Government in himself, distinct from and contrary each to other; and each of them have their several Subjects, which also are contrary in Birth and Generation, in quality and kind, over which they Rule and Govern, and to whom they give distinct Portions and Heirships in this World, and here∣after: and where Life Rules and reigns, Death is held in Captivity and Bon∣dage; and where Death lives, the Life dies; and where one of these brings forth Fruit, the other is Barren; for they agree not in one, but are in all things con∣trary; and the Subjects of the one are alwayes opposing and striving against the Subjects of the other: And between Life and Death there is continual War and Strife among the Creatures, who are the Subject of the one of them, in whatsoever man is, and in what he doth. First, Concerning Life I will speak; Life was in the Beginning with God, and is without descent; and God is Life in himself, without beginning or ending of Time, Place, or Matter; and Life put forth it self out of its invisible Beeing into Work and Action in the beginning of the World, and appeared in visible Operations and Works, and brought forth all Creatures, and all things into visible Appearances; and Life was the Author of all, the Beginning and Foun∣dation of all; and Life was and is that Beeing and Vertue of all things that are, and it was the Ioy and Delight of all things that it self brought forth; for all Things and Creatures subsisted through it, and it gave Breath and Life to all Crea∣tures, and Life blessed them all, and in it were all Creatures at Unity, being framed and brought into Visibility, and for the Pleasure of Life, which was all in all in the Beginning; and there was a sweet Concurrance and Harmony in the whole Creation, through the Power and Beeing of Life in the midst of
all Creatures, through which the whole Creation was made and framed by the Eternal Word of Life, and through which they stood and did remain  ∣sedness; and Life ruled and raigned in every Creature that was brought forth, and was the Glory and Substance thereof: For Life was and is that only be∣gotten of the Father, the Son and Heir of the Everlasting Father, his express Image and Brightness; being one with the Father, not separated or divided from him. And as for Death, it was not yet known, nor had it any place in the Creati∣on; it had yet received no Power, nor Kingdom, nor Government, neither was it in beeing: But Life was all, over all, through all, and in all in the Be∣ginning, before Disobedience and Transgression entred to war against Life: But Life was Prince, Ruler and, Governour, in and over all the Works of the Creator. And Life in its beeing is God, and God is Life; and in its Govern∣ment, and Fruits and Effects is Purity, Righteousness, Truth, Holiness, Meek∣ness, and all the Works that are Just and Equal according to God, and like him, and which shews him forth in the Creation; and this was, and it was thus in the Beginning, before Death entred into the World, or had a kingdom. But it is writ∣ten, The Devil abode not in the Truth, but went out of the Truth; and he is the King of Death, and hath the Power of it; he went out of the Power of God, and out of the Life, by which all things was made and created, and abode not in the Truth, nor in the Life, to live, and act, and speak in that; but desired to be, and became to be some∣thing of himself without God; and he spoke of himself, and acted of himself, with∣out the Power and Life, and also contrary to the Power and Life of the Creator, being separated from it, and become a distinct Beeing of himself; and then, having lost his State and first Condition, thus became an Enemy to Life and Truth, and be∣came the King of Death; and he was the first of Death's Race, and he holds the Power of it unto this Day; he being gone out of the Truth, and out of the Power and Life of God, and become a distinct Beeing of himself, having a king∣dom of his own to promote in Opposition to the Kingdom of God: Then he drew Mankind out of the Power, and Truth, and Life, and beguiled Eve and Adam, as you may read in the Scriptures; and they lost the Life and Power, (even all Feeling of it, and Comfort in it) by which they were Created and made, and they also transgressed and acted contrary to the Life and Power, and acted of themselves, and spake of themselves, without the Power and Life of their Creator, being separated from it; and were, and did something of themselves, without God, the Creator: and then the Power and Life cast them out of all Peace, Joy and Happiness into the Earth, and into Death; and Death became the King and Prince over Mankind: and they had no more possession of Life, nor. Blessedness by it in their separated Estate, neither did it any longer raign in them; but they having transgressed against the Life, and acted of themselves, and spoken of themselves, without the Leadings and Movings of the Life, this was their Transgression; They went out of the Power and Life in all Motions and Actions, and then Life drove them forth of its good Pleasure into the Earth, separate from its Vertues and Peace, and into Death, which is contrary to it self, to live in Anguish and Sorrow: And so, when the Devil was gone out of the Truth, and had led Mankind out of the Truth, and out of Life, and there∣by they were all separated from Life, and drove out from God, out of his Plea∣sure into his Wrath: Then became Death to have a Beeing in Mankind, and great Authority, and not before; and then Death began his Kingdom in the World, and over it, and he set up his Rule and Government in, and among, and over all the Children of Men. And so, from Transgression came Death, that was its Beginning, Man having Transgressed against the Life that brought him forth; and being separated from Life, then Death took place, and its kingdom was established over the World, and in all the Children of Men, in opposition to Life, and its Government and
Kingdom; and Death reigns from Adam, (so saith the Scripture) and the Life was transgressed against, and so provoked into an absence, and to with∣draw it self into invisibility from the enjoyment of Mankind, that it should not be felt nor perceived of Him to comfort him; and then the whole body of Death came upon Man, to load his Conscience and vex his Soul: and Death and only Death hath a preheminence over all in Transgression, and is established into a Kingdom, over sinful Subjects, who are under its Command; and hath its Rule and Goverment, and brings forth its Works and Fruits in Mankind, contrary to Life, and in opposition to it, and to its Kingdom and Power, and opposeth the Kingdom and Power of Life (the Creature) and in its Nature, and all its Fruits and Works, it is contrary and opposite to Life and its Works and Fruits; and through Death is the whole Creation in its exercise by man perverted from the right use and end ordained of God; and out of Death proceedeth all evil, as Lying, Swearing, Drunkenness and Whoredom, Pride, Strife, and every evil work and word: These things are the Fruits and Works of Death; and Death governs the Children of men in the practice of all these things; and in transgression Death lives, and acts, and speaks through Men and Women; and Death rules in them, and hath perverted them in all their wayes; for they have given their Power to it, and it wholly Captivates them, and is established over them, and hath the dominion in them, and Life is swallowed up of it: And this Kingdom of Death opposeth God, and the Kingdom of Life, and exalts it self against Life, and hath its operation in the Creature, in all manner of unrighteousness, bringing forth daily such words, works, fruits and effects, as doth oppress and is a burden unto the Life, and unto the God of Life; and Death and its Kingdom doth continually war and strive against Life and its Kingdom, and the one opposeth the other through all Generation since the beginning: for the Devil is the King of Death, and hath the Power of i, and he is King in its Goverment, and Ruler in its Dominion; and this is the state of all the Children of men in Trans∣gression, Death rules, and the Kingdom of Death reigns in them, and it brings forth cursed fruits through them, and they are subjects thereof, and in obedience thereunto in all things: And through Death, which hath Power over them, are they separated from Life, and have no part nor portion therein, because of Death that hath separated them, and vailed and clouded them, and loads their Consciences. But now the Promise of the God of Life, is to restore Mankind out of Death and Darkness, and that Life shall reign again, and subdue Death, and destroy it and its Kingdom, and swallow it up; and this is the Promise of the Father: For in Transgression Death hath subdued Life, and overcome it in Mankind; But in the Restoration, Life shall swallow up Death, and subdue it, and overcome it: and this comes to pass through the rising again of Life from under Death which hath held it in bondage; and Life that made the World in the begin∣ning, and gave to all things Life and substance, as I have said; which Life, in its measure in Mankind hath been overcome and swallowed up in Transgression: That Life shall appear, though in another manner of appearance than it did in the beginning; for then it appeared freely of it self without opposition, and brought forth the first Creation; But now it doth appear, through great opposition, and through all that doth oppose it in this second Creation, when Life comes again to reign over Death, and swallow up and overcome and subdue it; and who comes to witness this (the new Creation) they know Life appearing through opposition, and through the destroying of Death, and all its works and fruits: for CHRIST is the Life, and he is the Seed of the W, which bruiseth the Serpents head, who hath the Power of Death; Life bruiseth his Head, breaketh his Government, and destroyes his Works, as it appeareth and riseth in the Creature; and Death and its Works opposeth Life and its manifestation and appearance, and gainsayes it, and often quencheth it i its app.
Now the first Appearance of Life in the Creature, it convinceth and reproveth the works of Death, and the words that proceed from Death, which are unrighteous words, and unrighteous works; and Life when it rises, it reproves them and con∣demns them: and though Death doth oppose and gainsay the Operation of Life; yet Life works through, and overcometh, subdueth, and swalloweth up Death, and destroys all its works in the second Creation; and Life again comes to take possession of the Creature, which it made in the beginning; and Life comes to reign again, whose Right it is to raign; for, by it the Creature, Mankind, and all Creatures were in the beginning formed and brought forth, and therefore it is its Right to reign, and to have the dominion over the works of its own hands, whom since the beginning in Transgression, the Devil and Death, and his seat of Government has had the possession of; and CHRIST the Power of God, and the Life, hath been as it were dispossessed: and thus the first Creation hath been defaced, and lost its Glory; and it hath been corrupted and de∣generated quite from the perfect state as it was created in; and Mankind hath been servant to another Power, and led captive by another Power than the Power that made him, and another Government hath been established over him, and another Law hath exercised him than the Government and Law of the Creator, (to wit) the Power, and Government and Law of Death have had the Rule, Government and Exercise of Man, and of the old Creation, and hereby all things have been diverted from their proper and perfect place and service, to which they were ordained in the beginning, by reason of Trans∣gression and the reigning of Death; and Man hath been held in Captivity, and in sore bondage, and subject to all misery and distress, deprived of unity with his Maker, and deprived of the comfortable use and benefit of the Creation; so that of all Creatures he hath been the most miserable, being held in Bondage and Captivity under the power of Death, which hath ruled and reigned over him, and in him, being always subject to Death, and subject to the Curse and Anger of the LORD: and subject to doubtings and fears, and subject to con∣tinual misery and sorrow; and all this is, because Death hath reigned, and had dominion; even that which at first in the beginning of Transgression be∣trayed him of the Life and Fellowship with God, that got possession it self to reign, and to have the Power, which ever since hath reigned, and alwayes doth till the appearance of the Life again, which doth appear in the Creature for this end, to overcome and subdue Death, and destroy his works, that it self may reign, and free the Creation from its degeneration and corruption, and free Man∣kind from his bondage and captivity, and from his misery and all his trouble, which is come upon him by reason of Death. And this came to pass in the New Creation when Life is born again, to rule and reign again, and to swallow up Death, and to subdue it wholly, and its Kingdom and Government. And then Man again is become a Son of GOD, an Heir of Salvation, and no more Death reigns in him, nor hath Power over him, when he is restored out of Transgression; then as Death hath reigned and had power in Transgression, Life shall so reign in and over the Creature, in the New Creation, when that is brought forth, as Death hath reigned in the Old Creation in Transgression and Disobedience: And Life will arise to reign and rule over all, and in all, though it be through great opposition; the Body of Death shall be put off, and the Government of Death shall be subdued, and all the Works Fruits and Effects of Death shall be destroyed and done away, and its place shall no more be found, so as to bring forth Fruit; for its sting shall be taken away, and shall no more wound, nor pierce, nor hurt the Creature: For the sting of Death is Sin, and that hath wounded and hurt the Creature; and when this comes to pass, then there is glory and rejoycing over all, for Life hath swallowed up Death, and overcome it, and the cause of Sorrow is removed and taken away, and the Kingdom of Life is established in the Creature, and is set upon the top of Death's Kingdom, and keeps it under; and if there be but
a Motion of Death, that would spring up, or appear in the Creature, Life judg∣eth it down, and condemns it. And this Kingd is Righteousness, Ioy and Peace, full of Iustice, Righteousness and Equity, and there is nothing in it that doth defile or destroy, or bring Sorrow or Misery; but Life rules over all that, and subdues the Cause thereof, and removes every thing that would imbondage or captivate the Creature in Evil. And this Kingdom is not of this World, but from Heaven, and Heaven∣ly; and the Birth Immortal is Heir thereof, which receives the Crown, and the Kingdom of Eternal Life. Now the Kingdom of Death is of this World, which is defiled and degenerated; Gain was a Subject of this kingdom; and Esau, that was a Reprobate; and Iudas, that betrayed the Life; and all the Ungodly, and Generation of the Wicked since the beginning, they were all of the kingdom of Death, and the kingdom of Death ruled in them, and brought forth its works through them, and its exercise in their hearts and in their lives: and through its power they opposed and gainsay'd the Life, and they fought against the Kingdom of Life and Righteousness; and such were the Pharisees, who put Christ to death, who is the Life. Death raigned over all these, and they were of the stock of Death, and they were of this World, and had their Conversa∣tion below, in the earthly things; and knew not the Life, nor its Government, but were Strangers to it, and Enemies to it, as all are at this day, who are Transgressors against the Life; and all such are subject to the Curse, to Sorrow and Misery, and the Anger of the Lord; but who come to feel the Life, and the Obedience to it again, Death is destroyed through Death; for, through the death of Death, Death comes to be destroyed, and no other way, which the Life works; and the Life works through Death, and overcomes it, and swallows it up; and this is the second Creation, and the new Creation, where Life raigns over all, and doth possess the Creature, as it did be∣fore transgression. The Life is the Light, and the Life is the Law, and Life lives, moves and acts the Creature; and Christ, who is the Life, becomes all in all; and Blessed are they who wait for this, and do witness it, to such am I known in these things, where the kingdom of Death is overcome and swallowed up of Life. CHAP. II. A Testimony concerning the Mystery of God, and Godliness; and concerning the Mystery of the Devil, and Iniquity. THere are two great Mysteries in their invisible Beeing, and in manifestation to us in the world (that is to say). The Mystery of God, and Godliness; and, The Mystery of the Devil, and Iniquity: These are two great Mysteries, which do disco∣ver and act themselves forth in, and among, and through the Children of men in this Creation; and these two Mysteries are contrary one to the other, in Beeing, in Na∣ture, in Works, in Fruits and effects; and they are in strife one against the other, the one continually opposing the other, and striving for the Creature, Mankind, to be the In∣strument to display themselves through in visible Appearance; for the Creature, Man and Woman is a Vessel wherein these Mysteries are contained, and whereby these Mysteries do shew themselves forth in the world; and all the Sons of Adam upon the Face of the Earth are possessed with and of one of these (that is to say) The Mystory of God, or the Mystery of the Devil, do manifest themselves forth through every Man and Woman, and through all the Sons of Adam upon the Face of the Earth the Works, Fruits and Effects of one of these are brought forth. And as for the Mystery of God, it is Infinite and Eternal in Beeing, and which was, and is, and is to come, without Beginning or End; and this Mystery reach∣eth it self forth more or less in every Creature upon the Face of the whole Earth, and is the Life, and Beeing and Substance of all things; and all Creatures upon
the face of the earth, whether movable or inmovable, is a Partaker of this Mystery, & this Mystery is vailed and hidden secretly in & under all things that have a Beeing; and whatsoever the Creature brought forth even in the greatest appearance there∣of; and its goodness and vertue, in what form or apparance foever, is but the Production, or the, manifestation of the Mystery [God] for the life of every Crea∣ture, and the vertue of every Creature is a Mystery and proceedeth out of the great Mystery of God, who is Life it self, Vertue it self, Goodness it self, and Being it self; and is the Goodness, and the Vertue, and the Life and Being of all Things and Crea∣tures upon the face of the Earth; so that every thing that hath a being, even the Wicked and Ungodly, are not without this Mystery in some manner or other; for by Him every Creature is, and hath its first being. But now more perfectly doth the Mystery of God appear in his Servants, and in his Children who are born of Him, and begotten by Him, and they have the sence and feeling, and understanding of this Mystery more than any other Creatures; and this is their Glory and Crown above all other Creatures upon the face of the whole Earth; for they only, I say, who are redeemed to God, and born of the Spirit, they are them that have the sence, and feeling, and understanding of this Mystery, even of the Mystery of God, infinite, endless and eternal. And though this Mystery he hid in all other Creatures, and manifesting it self through them, yet this Mystery is not known to them, nor understood of them, nor of any other Creature (I say) besides the Children of the Lord, in whom this Mystery is only revealed; for they are them through whom more manifestly and plainly this Mystery is made mani∣fest, and to them revealed, and known, and felt in their Understandings; and they have the enjoyment thereof who know God, and are known of him, and are enter∣ed into Covenant with him, into Everlasting Covenant of Ioy and Peace; and through them doth this Mystery display it self, even in the sight of all Creatures, in works of Righteousness, of Purity, of Goodness, of Mercy, of Truth, of Peace, and of Wisdom, in their exercise of all things: and in this manner, and by these fruits and effects doth the Mystery of God shew itself forth through his Children, in whom the Mystery is opened, that is hid in all other Creatures: And this is the Crown of the Children of the Lord, that are born from Heaven, and from above, that the Mystery of God is felt and enjoyed by them, and more manifest to them than in any other Creatures: And to know this Mystery of God is Life Eternal; and to have the understanding of his Leadings, of his Judgment, of his Mercy, and of his Counsel, and of the operation of his Power; to feel this in the Un∣derstanding, this is Ioy and a Crown of Glory, where the Mystery of God is revealed in Spirit. And as for the Mystery of the Devil, it is darkness, and in darkness; and it shews it self forth in the Ungodly, and in the sons of Adam in transgression; and in such only doth this Mystery of Iniquity, and of Sin, and of the Devil display it self forth in all unrighteousnesse and sin, and that which is contrary to the Creator in works, words and thoughts; All these things are the manifesta∣tion of the Mystery of the Devil, and its fruits and effects, who is out of the Truth, who is vailed and covered, and hidden in the hearts of the Ungodly, and in the hearts of the sons of Adam in the Fall: This Mystery was not from the beginning, as the other, but when the Devil went out of the Truth, and had led Man's mind out of the Truth and taken possession of the heart of Man, and become Ruler and Lord there, having gained Authority over Man, through Man's obedience to him, then began this Mystery to discover it self, and act it self through the Creature; and this was since the beginning: And though no other Creature be an Agent to manifest forth this Mystery but Man, yet Man in his exercise of all Creatures, or all Creatures through the exercise of Man in transgression, there is shewed forth this Mystery of Iniquity, that secretly lurks in the spirits of ungodly men; which spirit of unrighteousness, the Mystery of the Devil, leads Man into all sinfulness, of drunkenness and uncleanness, and such like, and hath polluted the Earth, and defiled all Creatures through Man's exer∣cise
in them: and this is truly an appearance of the Mystery of the Devil; yet he hath other Appearances, and other makings-out of his Mystery (to wit) in a way of seeming Righteousness, and seeming Holiness, and seeming Purity; and these shew the Mystery of Unrighteousness, the Mystery of the Devil, who deceives the Soul that is Immortal of the enjoyment of the Creator, who is the desire of the Im∣mortal Soul; and so through a form; and likeness, and appearance of a thing is the Soul Immortal deceived and beguiled with that which hath appearances in it, but no Life nor Substance. And though the Mystery of Iniquity be but one in it self, yet it manifests it self divers wayes; sometimes in open Prophaneness and Wickedness, and sometimes in seeming Righteousness and Holiness, and in a form of Religion without power: But the Lord is arisen to confound the Mystery of the Devil and Iniquity, and will disco∣ver it, and destroy it; for it is the Mystery of Iniquity that worketh in the Chil∣dren of Disobedience, that are Strangers to God; and through the operation of this Mystery are People kept at a distance from the Lord, and out of Unity and Covenant with him: and this Mystery of Iniquity worketh hiddenly, not known but in the Eternal Eye, which sees through the spirit of Creatures, and compre∣hendeth and fathometh over the nature of things, and can judge beyond the ap∣pearance, even in the ground, before the action appeareth: for while people are pro∣fessing and acting Holiness and Righteousness visibly, and yet not changed by the Power of the Lord, nor renewed in nature, mind and spirit, from the first Adam to the second, the Righteousness and Holiness, brought forth in that state, is but the acting of the Mystery of Iniquity, and the Woolf putting on the Sheep's-Clothing; and this God will judge, and all Appearances without Life, and all Shews without Substance; all this will the Lord judge and confound, and bring to nought; for it is but the working of the Mystery of the Devil, who is out of the Truth. And this Mystery hath more abounded since the dayes of the Apostles, then in Ages since the Beginning, inasmuch as this Mystery hath operated and dis∣played it self forth in a higher appearance and fairer shew than ever it did before; for this Mystery hath sate in the Temple of God, and shewed it self to be God, and been worshipped above all that is called God; this Mystery of Iniquity, the Man of Sin, which hath put on the Sheep's-Clothing, and shews it self as the Sheep of Christ, and as Christians, and Churches; all which hath been for many Ages the Manifestation of this Mystery, while that the Mystery of the Devil hath not been destroyed: but now is the Lord arisen, who will discover and destroy this Mystery, and save the Creature; and in the destruction of this Mystery, is the other Mystery revealed, (to wit) The Mystery of God and of Christ; and that is the Mystery of Christ, that destroyes the Mystery of Antichrist and of the Devil: And now the Sons and Daughters of the Lord Almighty are coming into this Mystery of God Eternal, who is blessed for ever; and all that is coming to be overthrown which doth oppose it, and gainsay it; and there is nothing that can destroy or discover this Mystery, but the appearance of Christ the Son of God; for it is he that doth discover and destroy the Mystery of Iniquity by the Spirit of his Mouth, and by the Brightness of his Coming; and this are people coming to. The Man of Sin is to be thrown down, and the Man of Righteousness, the Manof God is revealed, and Sons and Daughters shall shew him forth in the World; and the Mystery of God shall shew it self forth over the World, and in Nati∣ons; and blessed are all they that come to the opening of this Mystery of God, which is the Mystery of Life and Eternal Salvation.
CHAP. III. A Testimony Concerning true Liberty of Conscience, what it is in itself, and how it is obtained; and what the true Guide and Rule is of the Exercise of Conscience. THis is my Testimony, as I have received from the Lord; true Liberty of Conscience is, Liberty and Freedom of the Conscience from the Bondage of Sin, and all Transgression past and present; and from whatsoever hath been or is a Burden or Oppression upon the Conscience, whether inward or outward; the Conscience, I say, is at Liberty when it is freed from the Burden of the Guilt of Sin past, and from the present Temptation unto Sin: And till this is witnessed, there is no true Liberty of Conscience; for every thing whatsoever, which is Sin and Transgression against God, in Works or Words, brought forth by the Creature, is Bondage and a Burden, and oppresseth the pure Conscience: and therefore perfect Freedom from all Sin and Transgression is, Where the Body of Sin and Death is put off, and where the Evil is crucified, and the guilt of it taken away, and where the Conscience is truly exercised by the Spirit of Christ, which lead∣eth into all Truth, and preserveth from all Evil; then is the Conscience at Liberty, and this is true Liberty of Conscience, when this is brought forth in the Creature: For, where Sin is brought forth, and Transgression lived in, there the Conscience is bound, and the Cord of Iniquity imbondageth the Conscience, and it hath not its Liberty in the Service of God, nor from the Service of the Devil, because the Spirit of God doth not exercise it; but the spirit of Unrighteousness leadeth the Mind into the Lusts of this World, into Lying, Swearing, Pride, Drunkenness, Hypocrisie and Idolatry; and the guilt of these things burdeneth and presseth down, and is a Bondage upon the Con∣science: And where the Conscience is bound by Unrighteousness within, and by the spirit of the World, which leadeth contrary to the Lord; there is no Power of Man without can set that Conscience free, or give Liberty to it; because the Cord of Iniquity hath bound it within, and the Burden of guilt is upon it, and Conscience lies under Bondage, unexercised with the Spirit of God, which is free, and setteth free the Conscience in the practice of all Good, and from the Power and Captivity of all Evil. Therefore, before true Liberty of Conscience be witnessed, or any have true Liberty in Conscience, Iniquity must be purged out, and Sin crucified, and the Body of Death put off, and guilt washed away, and the Annointing received that leadeth into all Truth, and the Blood of Christ (the Seed) felt, that sprinkle∣eth the Conscience from all Sin and Works of the Flesh, and washeth away all that which staineth and defileth the Conscience; and then the pure Conscience hath its true Liberty from the Bondage of all Evil, and from the guilt thereof, and in the Exercise of all good; and this is true Liberty of Conscience, and thus it is attained, and by no other Way nor Means, than by the Sword of the Spirit of God, which cutteth down the contrary: And where Conscience is thus freed within by the Power of the Lord, and delivered from the bondage of Evil, and from the burden of all guilt, and exercised in all good by the Spirit of God; Then nothing without, nor any Power of Man, which may work against such by Per∣secution, and act in opposition to such whose Consciences are thus freed, can imbon∣dage the Conscience to God-wards, or bring it under a burden to God-wards, I say
for it is not altogether Bondage of Conscience, or the Burden or Oppression upon his Conscience, that is set free, as aforesaid, though he is outwardly per∣secuted by men; for that doth but hinder the Exercise of his Conscience to Man∣wards, but not to God-wards; for there his Conscience is free, in Joy and Peace, though, by reason of Persecution, he cannot have the Exercise of it to men: I say, Though such be put in Prison, Banished, or whatsoever Suf∣fering be laid upon them, by any Men, or Laws without, yet their pure Con∣science is Free, and at Liberty in it self to God-wards, through all this, and over it all; for the Lord hath set them free from all that Bondage and Guilt of Iniquity, which hath been a Bondage upon their Consciences within: And whether they do Suffer, or have Freedom or Captivity in their Persons from men, yet is their pure Conscience at Liberty to God-wards, and in perfect free∣dom in it self, and to themselves, though for the Name of Christ and his Truth they be persecuted, and all Evil done against them by evil men, and the exercise of their pure Consciences prevented, as to Man-wards. For that which defiles the Conscience, doth bring it under Bondage; but that which keeps it pure and free from pollution, that keeps it in Liberty, and in perfect freedom to God, over all Persecution, and Evil Men, and Unjust Laws, which would exercise dominion in and over the Consciences of the Saints, and bring them into Captivity, as sometimes their Persons are by Evil Laws and Persecutors. But who stand in the Power of the Lord, and in the exercise of the Spirit of God, which freeth the Conscience in their own particulars (as I have said) doth not come into Bondage in Conscience to God-wards by Laws or Men, but en∣joyeth Freedom and Liberty therein, as much in Sufferings and in Persecutions under all the Cruelty of Men, as in doing and practices when they are not per∣secuted; for in Sufferings the Conscience is exercised, and hath its Liberty in Patience and Forbearance; and at Liberty of Persons in practice it is exercised, and hath its Liberty in doing and performing whatsoever the Spirit of the Fa∣ther moveth and leadeth unto. And thus, where God hath freed the Conscience, and it is Free and at Liber∣ty in him and to him, nothing without can bring it into Bondage or Captivity; but in all Conditions and in all Exercises, whether doing or suffering, the pure Conscience is in Liberty in it self, and in perfect Freedom in God, through all, over all, and beyond all. But now there hath been a great Cry among many (that have professed Righ∣teousness and Religion) For Freedom of Conscience, and begging and craving from the Powers of the Earth to Tolerate Liberty of Conscience, and that they might have the Li∣berty of their Conscience in Religion: And thus some have been looking too much without for Liberty of Conscience from Men, and from Powers without them, before their Consciences were set free by the Lord within, & the Bond of Iniqui∣ty broken, and that Burden of Iniquity and Guilt done away, which hath been a Burden & Bondage upon the Conscience: For, as I have said, No Man nor Powers of the Earth can truly Free or give Liberty to the Conscience, which is bound by the Cord of Iniquity within. But 'tis evident, The Cry for Liberty hath not been so much for the Exercise of Conscience, truly so, as for the freedom each one of their Sect, and for their Liberty in the practice of their own Worship and Con∣formity; and thereupon have divers men of divers Sects sought to the Powers of Men and of the Earth, to grant them Liberty of their Consciences; whenas it hath been rather for the Freedom to and Defence of their Sect, and of their Practices in their Worship, than for Liberty of Conscience, truly so; for while they have cryed for Liberty from without, yet Sin, and Iniquity, and Transgression have lain upon their Conscience within; and they have sought from Men for the Liberty of their Sect, to practice their own Worship, which they have called Liberty of Conscience: And to this Intent by some hath been the
Cry for Liberty of Conscience, that their Sect and their own Wayes of Wor∣ship might be defended from the Violence of others, who have opposed their Practices and Worships: for People of divers Wayes of Worship, and of di∣vers Sects, have all been at Strife one with another, and divided one against another, and yet all professed good Conscience, and cryed for Liberty thereof from the Powers of the Earth; not but that the Powers of the Earth ought to grant free Liberty of Con∣science in the Exercise of every Sect of Religion, and to suffer all to profess and practice their Religion, while they walk justly and Peaceably in a Land: But here hath lodged the Deceit and Deceivableness of the spirit of Satan in the Hearts of men, from the least to the greatest of all those divers false Sects and Worshippers; they have therein zealously gone on, and pleaded for their Sects and Worship, though never so gross or dark, and contrary to Truth, under the denomination of Freedom and Liberty of good Conscience; and the very Title and Name hath been the Colour, and deceived many, while a false Worship and false Sects have gone under the Name of Liberty of good Conscience; and Thou∣sands have been deceived, and blindly led into such a false Sect, and into such a Profession, to act and perform with great Zeal false Practices in a false Wor∣ship, falsly supposing it to be out of a good Conscience, and that they have acted in the Liberty thereof; yea, and many may suffer great and grievous things, and some the loss of their Lives, for the very Practice of false things and false wor∣ships in a false Sect, and yet under the name of good Conscience, and for Liberty of Conscience, as they may profess and believe. But this may seem strange to be spoken to some, who may enquire how it comes to pass, and how this may be, That many may suffer great and grievous Cruelties, and some the loss of their Lives, for the Practice of false Things, and the Exercise of false Worships, which they may suppose to be out of good Con∣science, and for good Conscience sake; whereas it is not truly so, nor rightly so: But how happeneth this, may some say? I Answer. This cometh to pass after this manner; Because Conscience is made of that, and of the Things and Performances which God requires not; and so there is a great Zeal in the doing and performing of such a Practice and such a Worship, whenas the Lord doth not require these things at their Hands; and this is, because the Mind, and Heart, and Conscience is dark, and not truly in∣formed nor guided with the Spirit of Truth, and of the Father; but a false spirit ruleth and leadeth the Conscience, and it is not exercised with the Spirit of the Father, that leadeth into all Truth. So I do acknowledge, that Conscience may be mis-led, and mis-guided, and mis-informed; and Conscience may be made of doing such and such things which the Lord doth not require; and there may be a Fear not taught of the Lord, nor received by the sence of his Presence, but only received into the Heart by the Precepts of men, Example of others, Custom of Times, or the like: and here the Conscience being not truly informed, nor guided by the Spirit of the Lord, there is a false Fear and Zealousness in the performing of such things which the Lord doth not require, nor his Spirit lead into the practice of; but only the Traditions and Precepts of men, hath placed a false Law and Commandment, which requires a false Obedience; which many, whose Understandings are blinded, and being without true Knowledge, they zealously perform and practice as the Worship of God, thinking themselves bound in Conscience to practice such things, and not to leave them undone; whenas the Lord and his Righteous Spirit leadeth not to them, nor yet his Just Law doth require the doing thereof; but only a false Law and Commandment is received by Precepts and Traditions of men, or from looking upon the Practice of others: By such means as this there is a false Fear in a blind mis-guided Con∣science, and a Zeal without true Knowledge. And thus it was amongst the Iews in the Prophets dayes, They Sacrificed their Children, and cut themselves, and caused their Children to pass through the Fire, and did many things zealously; whenas saith the Lord, Who hath required these things
at your hands? for they come not into my heart. And Paul witnesseth the same of the Iews in his dayes, and bore them record, that they had a Zeal, but it was not according to True Knowledge. And thus the Iews were zealously performing that, as their Duty, and as out of a Good Conscience, which the Lord required not at their hands; and so they made Conscience to do that, which the Lord required not, and their Consciences were mis-led, and not righly informed; and as it was amongst the Iews in this case in the dayes of old, so now is it amongst the Christians in the Apostacy, their Consciences being mis-guided by a false spirit, they are doing and performing the things in great Zeal, and for the exercise of their Consciences, which the Lord doth not require of them: Thus do the Papists; they do and practise the things in great Zeal, and through a false Fear in their blind Consciences, which things are in themselves Idolatry, and not commanded nor required of the Lord; as in many particulars I might shew, even in many parts of their Worship and Religion, which out of a Fear, and blind Zeal, and mis-guided Conscience they practise; which is in it self but Idolatry, and not required nor accepted of the Lord. And many things in relation to the Protestants Worship, and amongst all the several false Sects upon Earth, which are done and practised in great Zeal, and out of a false Fear, and as in pretence of a good Conscience, and yet are things in themselves Idolatrous, as done and practi∣sed by them: And this comes to passe, as I have said because, the Consci∣ence is mis-informed, and a false spirit guides and rules in the exercise of Conscience, and the understanding of the People is blinded, and they know not but they do well, though their minds are captivated, and their minds and judgments in error; and though there be a sincerity to God-wards, and a desire of Him in the bottom, among some People of all Forms and Sects, and some of all are zealous towards God in their practices, in their Reli∣gion and Worship; yet among all People, and the Churches that have been for many Generations there hath been great Error in Judgment, and much blindness in mind, and the Conscience falsly exercised towards God, and the Superscription hath been, To the Unknown God; and He hath been igno∣rantly worshipped, and the Spirit of the Lord hath not truly exercised Peoples Consciences, nor guided their Zeal, nor been Ruler in the Judgment; And by this means the sincerity and humility towards God hath been eaten out, and always quenched, and the bare practice of things and profession of Religion in the outward appearance, hath been more lookt at, than the presence of God felt in the Practices: and the Zeal hath been more for the performance of such things, than for God purely enjoyed through them: And thus it hath been through Chri∣stendom in the Apostacy since the dayes of the Apostles and true Churches; Many have erred in their Judgments, and the Zeal for God hath proceed∣ed out of the error of Iudgments, and out of mis-information of Conscience, some other things, than only the Spirit of God, hath ruled in the Iudgment, and been the exercise of Peoples Consciences. And this is a hint of things, about true Liberty of Conscience; and about the Error in Iudgment; and the blind Zeal in captivated sincerity. Now it may be objected, What is the only absolute Rule of the right Exercise of Con∣science; and when are Mens Consciences truly guided? To this I answer, The only chief and perfect Rule of the right Exercise of Conscience, both to God and all men, is The Spirit of Christ: for it is only that which can truly guide the Conscience, in Faith, Doctrine and Worship, and in all things towards God; even the Spirit of Christ, which is the gift of the Father, it only leadeth into all Truth, as it is written; and all, whose Consciences are guid∣ed and exercised by it, are in unity and Peace in their Worship, Doctrine, and Religion; for the Spirit of Christ is but one in it self, and guideth the Conscience into the exercise of one Truth and Faith; and in this same Spirit is true nion and Communion of SAINTS in Religion and Worship, and this is
manifest through the Scriptures; for the Apostle exhorted, To walk in the Spirit, and by it; and as many as walked by the Rule of the Spirit Peace be upon them; and it is the Spirit of Christ, the Everlasting Comforter, that teacheth all Truth; and the Holy An∣ointing of the Spirit that dwelt in the Saints, taught them all things; and they need no man to teach them, but as the Anointing that dwelt in them. And then are mens Consciences truly guided in all the Ways of Righteousness, when the Spirit of God guides the Conscience, and is the Rule of all Faith, Doctrine and Practices. So that Traditions of Men, Prescriptions of Councils, Antiquity of Time, Command∣ments of Men, nor Example of others, without the Spirit of Christ, cannot be the only true Rule of the Exercise of Conscience; for all these things are changeable, alterable and subject to variations, and therefore cannot infallibly guide the Conscience in the Duty towards God, nor rightly exercise the Conscience in Unity and Peace; but while a Nation, or Kingdom or People walk by the Rule of Traditions, Pre∣scriptions, Commandments of Men, Example of others, or the like, they err in Judgment, in Faith, Doctrine and Worship, and are all divided, & in Contention about these matters, because their Rule of Conscience and Judgment is doubtful and alterable, and not infallible; and therefore they have no perfect assurance of Gods acceptation to them in their Faith and Religion, nor perfect Peace and Unity in their Faith and Worship: But as the Rule of their Consciences in their Duty towards God is divers, some make one thing, and some another their Rule; so are they divers and divided in what they hold, profess and practice, and are but of great Babylon in their Religion: And because that something besides the Spirit of God exercises the Conscience, therefore it is that here are so many Wayes and Sects of Religi∣gion, and kinds of Worship in Christendom and amongst Christians, while the Spirit of Christ only is not the Rule of Iudgement and Exercise of Conscience to God and Man; for the only perfect Rule of Conscience in the Exercise to God, is the Spirit of Christ, and not any other thing. And now, Whosoever shall persecute the Exercise of Conscience, when guided by the Spirit of Christ, such persecute Christ Jesus: And this is Persecution for the Name of Christ, when Sufferings are inflicted, as Reproaches, Imprisonment, or whatsoever, for the Exercise of Conscience towards God by his Spirit: but and if any are persecuted for Religion-sake, only so; if that in such their Exercise of Religion they are not guided by the Spirit of Christ, yet that suffering is a kind of Persecution also: if, I say, the Suffering be only for and because of their Religi∣ons-sake, and they walk Justly and Righteously, as men; so that (as is signified about the middle of this Chapter) though some may profess good Conscience, and cry for Liberty thereof in their false Sect and Religion, not taught them by the Spirit of Christ; yet the Civil Magistrate ought not to punish and use Violence to such for their Religion; but if they do, they persecute, and the Lord will lay it to their charge. But yet, this is safe for all, first to obtain true Liberty of Con∣science to God-wards, and to receive the Spirit of Christ, to be taught only by it in the Exercise of Conscience and Religion that they may not err in Conscience and Judgment in spiritual Matters, nor suffer Wrongfully under pretence of Righteousness sake, whenas it is not truly so. CHAP IV. Concerning the Diversity of Iudgments in Religion. TO all ye that are of divers Judgments and Opinions in and concerning Spi∣ritual Matters, who are divided about Faith, Doctrine, Worship and Church Go∣vernment; some of you holding one thing, & some another different and contrary to that, being diversly divided in mind and heart concerning the matters that are
one in themselves, & to which you all assent, as to the things in themselves, and yet are different & contrary minded about the self-same things: To you all I am moved to write, that so ye may be informed perfectly; First, What the Cause is of your Divisions, and why it is thus amongst you: And Secondly, Of the bad Effects and Fruits such Divisions have brought forth: And Lastly, The Meant and Way of Reconciliation, that ye may come into Love, and Peace and Unity with God, and one with another, in all things pertaining to his Kingdom. First, The Cause of your Divisions, and of the Diversities of Judgments and Opinions that are amongst you concerning the Things and Matters of God's Kingdom is, Because you want the Spirit of God to guide you, and it is not the Rule of your Knowledge and Iudgment; and you wanting the Spirit of God, in which is U∣nity among Saints, therefore is it you are so divided, and divers, and different, and contra∣ry one to another in these things; it is, because ye want the Spirit of God, I say, which only teacheth the true Knowledge of God, and gives an Understanding in all his Wayes and Matters: It is the Spirit of God that teacheth true Faith, true Doctrine and true Worship, and all things about Church, Ministry and Religion; and if that you had the Spirit of God in you, and were taught and guided by it, it would teach you into one Faith, and one Truth, and into the true Worship, and into the true Church-Government, and you would be in Unity and Peace: And if you all had the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures, and by which Spirit the Saints of God were guided in dayes past, it would teach you into Unity, and to be of one Mind, one Heart, and one Soul, in all the Matters pertaining to God's Kingdom, in Faith, Worship, Doctrine, and all things else: If you had the Spirit of God, I say, and were taught by it, then you would have Unity with God, and one with another in all his Wayes, and there would have been no Division nor Contention amongst you about spiri∣tual Matters; but because you want that, therefore you have Strife and Division amongst you, even throughout all Christendom; Here's a Nation and a Kingdom holding such a Faith and Worship, and there's another People holding Faith and Worship contrary to that; and here's one Sect of People, and there's another different in Faith, Judgment and Opinion; and this is a Shame to whole Christen∣dom, That all should profess Christ Iesus, and Faith in him, and Salvation by him, and his Doctrine and Worship, and yet be in strife & division, and in great contentions con∣cerning the same; some holding and practizing one manner of Faith, Worship and Doctrine, and others holding contrary and different; and this shews, that ye are all fallen from the Life of Christianity, as it was held in the Apostles dayes amongst the true Churches; for, they were of one heart, mind, soul and spirit, as it is written; they were of one Faith, of one Worship, of one Doctrine, and had one way of Church-Govern∣ment; and this continued amongst the Churches of Christ, till there were some that had Erred from the Spirit of God in their own Consciences, and then they also Erred in Faith, in Doctrine, and in all other things relating to God: and these were the Apostate Christians, that had erred from the Spirit, and divided themselves from the true Church, and differed in Judgment amongst themselves; and this was, because they had erred from the Spirit of God, which would have kept them in Unity with God, and one with another; for the Spirit is the Bond of Peace, and the Seal of the Covenant of Love amongst the Saints. So now, All ye who are divided in your Knowledge and Iudge∣ment, and are in contention one with another, about the matters pertaining to God's Kingdom, you are the apostate Christians, and you are without the Spirit of Christ: The first apostate Christians erred from the Spirit, and so became divided from the true Faith, and from the true Worship, and also among themselves; and you never yet received the Spirit of Christ, that you might come into Unity and Fellowship with God, and one with another; and that is the Reason of all your Divisions in Religious matters, because you have not received the Spirit of Christ, to teach you, and to unite your Hearts to God, and one to another: but you having the Scrip∣tures traditionally, by discent through Ages, which do describe and declare of that Faith and Doctrine, and of the Worship and Church-Government, which were among the Saints of old, which they held and practised, and from the
Scriptures which declare of the things, from thence you take up a Conceit and false Judgment, and an Imitation, and a false Conformity; and then each sort of you call that your Faith, and Church-Government, and some after one man∣ner of form, and some after another; and thus you are divided, because you want the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures; which Spirit did work true Faith in the hearts of them that gave them forth in dayes of old, and it taught them Worship, Faith, Doctrine, and all things concerning Gods Kingdom, for the Spirit led them into all Truth; and now you wanting the same Spirit that wrought in them, and taught them; and you having but their words (to wit, the Scrip∣tures) from thence, in the Wisdom which is below, and in the carnal Reason, and in the first mans understanding, each Nation takes up a conceit, that it is so and so, and takes up an Imitation of Worship and Church-Government according to their own sensual wisdom, and according to the breadth and depth of their Con∣ceits; and then imitates, and that severally and diversly, and in a divided manner; and this is amongst Kingdoms, and amongst Neighbours and Brethren, this Divi∣sion in matters of Faith, Worship and Doctrine, and Church-Government; and yet all these have had the name of Christians, and Church Members, and Worshippers of God, but yet are of many wayes of Worship, holding different and contrary Princi∣ples of Faith and Doctrine, and also of Worship and Church-Government, and thus have Nations Cities and Countries been for many Ages; and thus hath it been, and is at this day amongst the Apostate Christians, that want the Spirit of Christ to be their Rule of Knowledge, of Iudgment, and Worship, and of their Faith and Practices in Religion. And this is a shame to whole Christendom, amongst whom the spirit of Antichrist hath entered, which hath thus divided Nations Cities Neighbours and Brothers; for all these Divisions about Religion amongst the Apo∣state Christians, are of Antichrist, and not of God; it is that spirit of Antichrist that hath wrought all these Divisions, and planted them in the minds of People. 2dly, Concerning the bad Effects of these Divisions in matters of Faith and Worship, as I have said, This Division in Religion hath begotten and brought forth very much Evil throughout the World, much heart burning, envy, hard heartedness, strife and contention between Kings and Rulers, and between Nations, between Cities, between Neighbours, and between Brothers; this Division hath bad Effects amongst all these; so that it hath brought forth much War and bloodshed between Kings, and great Persecution between Rulers and their People, and great Debate and Strife amongst Neighbours and Friends; so that great Murders and losse of many Lives have been produced and brought forth upon this Quarrel, about Difference in matters of Faith and Reli∣gion; and Antichrist hath not only divided People in Iudgment, but hath also Provo∣ked People into rage and envy, to the killing and destroying of one another; and even that Division about Spiritual things, begotten by Antichrist amongst false Christi∣ans, hath been turned into personal enmity, and brought forth in the end murdering and killing the bodies of Thousands, when the original debate hath arisen about Church-Government, or Points of Religion; and this is the woful Effect that Division of Religion, hath brought forth in all Christendom; And all this Fruit and Effects, as well as the Cause of it, hath been of Antichrist, and of the Dragon and the Devil throughout the World; all this Persecution and spoyling of Goods, Imprisoning of Per∣sons, taking away of Lives, and Banishment, and whatsoever Persecution otherwise that hath risen and been inflicted upon any, for and because of Differences in Reli∣gion, and about Faith and Worship, all this hath been of Antichrist; and even all Laws made for that end, and all Executors of such Laws, and all Penalties of such Laws, and all Wars and Bloodshed whatsoever that have ensued only and upon the account of Differences in Religion, that being the first, and the only ground of the Quarrel; All this hath been of Antichrist, and it came out of the bottomless Pit, and never rose from the Spirit of God, but from the Antichristian spirit of Envy and Wick∣edness, that hath first divided People about matters of Faith and Religion, and then Provoked them to envy and malice, stirring up Kings to fight one against another, that was not of their Religion, but different and contrary to it: And so the hearts of
Rulers have been stirred up to persecute all under them, that were different & con∣trary in matters of Faith, Worship, and Religion; and this the spirit of Antichrist hath effected throughout Christendom: and so each King that hath been strongest, would maintain the Principles of his Faith, and the Practice of Religion, accor∣ding to his own Conceit, in his Dominions: And thus hath Religion, Worships, and Church-Government been set up & stood amongst Apostate Christians throughout the World, by Force and Power, and by violent Laws, and through Persecutions and Murders; and all this hath been by the spirit of Antichrist, and the Spirit of God has had no hand in those matters, for setting up and contriving of false Faith, false Worship, and false Church-Governments; all this hath depended upon the Powers and Authorities of the Earth, through many Ages: and what Religion, and Church-Government, or Way of Worship, that Kings or Queens have set up, that only hath been promoted; but all the rest Persecuted and restrained by force and vio∣lence; and all this hath been of Antichrist. And now to all ye that are of divers Judgments in matters of Faith and Worship in Religion, this is a Caution to you all; and I do warn you all in the presence of the living God, that though ye be divided in the belief and practice of Spiritual things, yet live in peace and unity with all men, in all outward relations, and do not envy nor hurt one anothers Persons; though you are in diffe∣rence about Religion; yet suffer not that Difference to grow into persecuting or envying one anothers persons, but seek to inform one another, and instruct one another in the Spirit of Meekness, and perswade one another out of that which is evil, to that which is good, by pati∣ence, gentlèness, and long-suffering, and do not force one anothér by violence, nor persecute one another, neither by words, evil-deeds, nor actions, but live in love to the persons every one of another; and fight not with Persons, nor kill one anothers Persons with carnal wea∣pons about Religion, but take the spiritual weapons, & war with the spirit against the evil one in one another; and love persons though they are enemies, & this is Christs Doctrine, & neer hereafter let your divisions about Spiritual things grow into personal quarrels, to the envying or killing one another: And this is a Charge to you all in the presence of the living God. Lastly, The Means and Way to be reconciled and to come out of all Division and Strife, and to come into Peace with God and one with another, about Faith and Church-Government, is by the Spirit of God; and every one of you in particular must receive the Spirit of Christ, that it may work in every one of your hearts, true Faith, and teach every one of you the true Worship of God, and the way of Do∣ctrine and true Church-Government; it is the Spirit of Christ in every one both male and female, that must reconcile and bring into unity with God, and one with another in all Spiritual things; for it is that which is the bond of peace and love among true Christians; and it is that which reconciles Peoples hearts into oneness: And if you receive that Spirit every particular person of you, it will bring you to be of on Faith of one Worship, and then your Doctrine and Church-Government will agree: if you receive the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, it will work in you the same Faith, and lead you in the same way of Worship which the Scriptures speak of, and then you will cease taking up Conceits, and making Imitations of Church-Governments from the Letter, but the same Spirit will work in your hearts Faith and Knowledge in the fulfilling of the Scriptures; and this is true Christianity, and the other is the way of all Apostate Christians, all Imitations from the Letter without the Spirit as gave it forth: for there is a great deal of difference between making a Con∣formity in the Imitation of a Worship, and Church-Government, from the Scriptures without the Spirit, and between the Spirits teaching and leading into the same Truth, and same Worship and Church-Government which the Scriptures speak of; the one is of Christ, and is in unity, peace, and everlasting fellowship; the other is of Antichrist, and is in division, strife and contention: so you must all wait for the Spirit of Truth, that you may receive it, to work in your hearts, to teach you, and lead you, or else you will never come to true Union and everlasting Fellowship with God, and one with another; neither can you be of one true Faith, in one true way of Worship, nor in one way of Church-Government, except you receive the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit, And these be the words of the Lord God unto you all
Now as concerning the Way of Uniformity in Faith and Church-Government, imposed upon Nations, and Countries and Cities, by cruel Laws of Kings and Rulers, as hath been the practice through Christendom, to cause a whole Nation and Kingdom to bow and conform to such Principles of Faith, and Worship and Church-Government, according to the Will and Pleasure of a King or a Ruler, such Uniformity, and Union and Fellowship among Christians hath not been of Christ, where people have walked by Imitation and conformed to the Commands of Men in such a Faith, or to such a Worship, or Church-Government; this hath not been of God, neither could this Unity stand or remain forever; but it hath perished, and will perish where-ever it is: and that Faith, and Worship, and Church-Government, which is so set up, and so held, will never save the Soul, nor comfort it; but it is blast∣ed of God: Whilst a Nation, or a Kingdom, or a People have Uniformity, or hold Faith, Worship or Religion, either in the ignorance of their Consciences, or contrary to their Consciences, by the force of mens commandments, and not by the perswasion of the Spirit of God in their own Consciences; such Conformity, I say, is of Antichrist, & not of the Father, neither can it stand in the Day of the Lord; but the Fire of his Wrath will consume it: All the apostate Christians, in their uniformity of Faith, Worship and Church-Government, which is some other way, or by some other means, than only by the Spirit of God, is of Antichrist, and will be confounded; for there is no true Unity and Fellowship in the ways of God and his Truth and Worship, but what is in the spirit, and that Unity will stand forever; for it is in God, not feigned, neither be∣cause of the Love and Fear of this World, as the other is. That Uniformity in Faith and Worship which is forced upon people, is all but Hypocrisie and Deceit, both to God and man, and God will judge it in the Imposers and Imposed: There∣fore no true Unity in Faith, nor Worship, nor in Religion, but what is in and by the Spirit of God; for as Christians come to divide themselves into many Ways, and into divers Sects, when they went from the Spirit of God, and lost it, and whilst they have been without the Spirit, they have remained in Division, Strife and Contention about Religion; so now the means and way to come into Union, and Fellowship and Faith is, by receiving the Spirit of God again, and not any otherwise; and as Christians are brought again to receive this Spirit, and walk therein, all Division and Strife about Religion will cease, and the cursed Fruits & Effects thereof will also wither, and be no more, but then Unity, Peace, Blessedness, Everlasting Fel∣lowship and Comfort with the Lord, and one with another, in all his Wayes, will be witnessed amongst all People.

The FIFTH GENERAL EPISTLE: Being A Tender Salutation OF PERFECT LOVE, Unto the Elect of God, the Royal Seed, the Saints of the Most High; who have Believed the Testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Walk in the Light that hath en∣lightened every man that comes into the World. IN the Name and Power of our Lord Jesus Christ blessed forever, the Ten∣der Salutation of my Immortal Life is daily abounding towards you, who are the true Flock of the Father's Love and Care, who hath begotten you to himself by his Word that lives forever in us and with us, that ye should be a People Chosen and Elected of him unto Eternal Blessings, and to be a Praise and an Honour to him throughout the World, by and through the vertue of his Life and Power, and in the Fruits of his Spirit brought forth by you all, who are the only Children of that Birth which is only the Lord's. Well, Dearly Beloved, My Heart at this time is filled in the Father's Love, with the dear Remembrance of you, whom the Lord hath gathered with his Arm of Power; and in his Spirit do I desire the encrease of all Mercies, and Peace and Blessings unto you, that you may be Rich, and Strong, and Wise, and Mighty through the Lord Jesus Christ, and receiving daily of his Grace may ever be preserved constant and faithful in the Heavenly Calling unto the End. And forasmuch as the Lord hath began his Glorious Work in the midst of you, and gathered you out of the Darkness, and Ignorance and Unbelief of this World, where some time your Converse hath been, while ye knew not the Lord, and raised you up into the Light, and Power and Wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ; having largely tasted of the same in the Experience of his Leadings through di∣vers Operations and Manifestations of his Spirit, so that many of you have at∣tained to a good measure of Peace and Rest with the Lord in your inward Man: Dearly Beloved, seeing it is thus, these things the Spirit of the Father in me travelleth to bring forth unto you, for the End to Comfort you, and to Con∣firm you; and to Edifie you in the saving Truths of the Gospel of Peace. 1. Consider what your former Estate hath been, an Estate scattered like Sheep without a Shepherd; some of you dispersed into one false kind of Profession
of Religion, and some into another, walking in such Wayes as the Lord led you not in; but ye were Driven from God, into the pathes of Death and Darkness, and were led by blind Watch-men in the Hypocrisie and false pretences towards God; Honouring Him with the Lips, while the Heart was far away: this was the Condition of some of you; and others of you were wallowing in the open Prophaneness of the Sinful World; and such was your Estate, wherein you were all Strangers to God, and were without him in the World, and served the spirit which leadeth Captive to Destru∣ction, and in that Way you were strayed, even in the Separation from GOD, being in the State of Enmity against Him; till the Lord Jesus Christ, the good Shepherd of ISRAEL, found you out in the Estate of Darkness, and brought you Home from your strayed Condition, even unto the Sense and Feeling of his Power and Spirit in you, which called you out of the Wayes of Sin and Death, and also changed you and rege∣nerated you into the Inheritance of a better Kingdom and Glory, than that which is of this World: And ye now know Christ Jesus to be your Shep∣herd, his Spirit to teach you, his Wisdom, and Righteousness and Sanctifi∣cation to dwell in you, being Partakers of the same through the Eternal LIGHT, which once shined in Darkness, and the Darkness could not comprehend it; but now it is risen in much Glory and Power, and Death and darkness is swallowed up of Life and Light, and the Fruits thereof subdued. These things are True and Faithful unto many; let all such Rejoyce and be Glad in the Lord, who have thus seen his Day, and tasted of his Power, and are Witnesses, That the Kingdom is come which never fadeth away. 2. Consider what the Tender Dealings of God towards you, and his Gentle Leadings have been since he hath called you out of your forme strayed Estate: Hath not his Light shined upon your Tabernacles with much Clearness, perswading your Hearts fully of his WAY and TRUTH? Have not your Hearts often been Refreshed, and Souls truly Comforted by the Refreshing Presence of the Lord? Hath not the Way of Life been made so clear unto you, and the way of your Peace so perfectly disco∣vered, that no Occasion hath been left of Unbelief or Stumbling unto the Upright in Heart? Surely the Lord hath not been wanting to you in any of these things; but he hath so reached Home by his Word and Spi∣rit to your Hearts and Consciences with such full Convictions and per∣swasions in the Wayes of Salvation, that no sincere Heart can doubt or waver concerning the Things pertaining to his Soul's Peace and Com∣fort  For, so Large and Evident hath God's Testimony been unto you, even since he first called you by his Grace, that no Man, having Sense and Experience thereof, but must bear witness, That the Lord hath been Good, Long Suffering, full of Mercy and Righteousness towards all that feareth him. I am perswaded ye know these things, and that the Taste and Vertue of the Lord's Mercies and Power remaineth stedfest in your Remembrance and Enjoyment, even his Mercies and Loving-kindness that have been made manifest to you since ye have known the Lord, who hath d you by the Hand, as a Father doth his Children, and carried you in his Arms of Pre∣servation, and born you on his shoulders in all your Afflictions; inso∣much that through his Power and Wisdom only we are yet alive, and the Adversary hath not prevailed against us, though his Attempts have often been great to Destroy us.
3. Consider what i now your present state and standing; How is it with your inward Man? In what Life, and Strength and Dominion is he? Is he ong over all the Corruptible, or is he Weak under Corruption? Is he in e growth of a Perfect Man, of the Stature of Christ Jesus? Is he so begotten and born in you, that Life hath swallowed up Death? Hath he Victory over the Grave? And doth he Raign in you, even the New Man, the Spiritual Man, the Immortal Man, Christ i you? Is he come in Pow∣er and Dominion to dwell with you? Derly loved, mind each particu∣ in what state you are, and what is your present standing to God ?  ye had Faith in God, and Love to God, and Boldness for God? And are ye firly continued therein? Or, Is any such Weakened and Decreased in these things? Is your Love grown cold, and your Zeal lost, and your Confidence decayed? If, it be thus with any, their pre∣sent state is not ght before the Lord; but they must Repent, and return to their first Love, and return again to the Witness of the Spirit of Christ  in them, that their Strength may be renewed, for they only that dwell with the Lord in Faithfulness, and abide in Covenant with him,  see his Glory, and be fed daily with the Bread that comes down from Heaven, and refre with the Foun∣tain of endless Mercies; if so be ye be perfect with the Lord after your inward Man, Strong, and Lively, and Zealous, Faithful, and constant, having a clean Heart and a pure Conscience, guiltless and undefiled before God, this is to be perfect with the Lord; and if ye are thus, blessed are you, if ye be encreas∣ed daily in the Love and Life of the Father; if your inward Man grow in the Wisdom, and Power, and Knowledge of the Creator; if ye receive the assurance of Eternal Life in your selves; if this be your present State, Oh happy People! Who is like unto you, because ye are saved of the Lord? 4. What is the present work of God in your own hearts? Ye must al∣wayes feel the Word of God abiding in you, even the Word in the heart; hear that Word and do it alwayes, and your souls shall live by the Word of God; that Word beats down whatsoever tempts and draws from God which would defile you, and load your Consciences, and vex the Spi∣rit; for if any obey the Temptations; they become darkned, unbelief enters, and the fruits of it grows, and then there is a falling from the Lord; and a departing from his way of Salvation; therefore mind the Power and Spirit of Christ in you, and be constant and faithful therein, that you may be Preserved unto the finishing of the WORK of the Lord in you, that at last ye may sit down in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus, in places of Peace, and Comfort, and Assurance for ever, where the Lord is enjoyed all in all, which you must wait for to be ac∣complished in you according to the promise, and you must wits the work of Christ in you, he must work in you by his Spirit Regeneration, Reconon, Sanctification, Justification, and all good things;  it is not sufficient to profess, that Christ in his Person hath  the works of God, but every one in particular must witness at th day the work of the Spirit of Christ in his own heart, even the Work of Recon∣ciliation and Salvation, that ye may in each mans particular receive the Knowledge and Experience of the Lords Work, of his Love, and Life, and Sal∣vation, and Redemption in particular; for though never so large Testimo∣nies in general should be given to you, or received by you concerning Christ Jesus, and his Salvation, yet the particular feeling of  Love and Power of the Lord God in your own hearts must you sta by, in the Day o Tryal, for that alone can uphold in the Day of Trou, even
the Testimony of the Spirit of Christ unto Salvation, felt in each particular heart. And seeing the Lord hath brought you to the knowledge of his truth, so in conversion and regeneration, that many can say, the Way of the Lord is so made manifest, that we look not for another, nor are doubtful of the Way of Eternal Life; therefore be established stedfast and constant in that way, not easily moved nor tossed too and frô with men, nor new Doctrines, nor changeable things, but approve your hearts in uprightness before the Lord by being faithful to the end, faithful I say to be and do according to the measure of Light and Grace and Knowledge that God hath already committed to you, that ye may not offend against the Grace of God, but may glorifie the Lord in your Souls and Spirits, being joyned in your hearts, and mar∣ried to the Living God, and the Lord becomes Your Husband according to the Promise; but if any be of a changeable Spirit, such will receive Temptations, and go out of the Covenant of God, and abuse the gift of God, if their heart be not meek, and lowly, and humble, and perfect in the sight of God, though there may be a taste of the Love of God, yet there can be no assurance of it if the heart be not aright before the Lord, and faith∣ful and constant in his Truth; and therefore all must wait to receive the assurance of Eternal Life in themselves, even such an assurance of Life, and Peace, and Joy, and Comfort, that there can be no departing away, being established in the Heir-ship never to loose the Crown, Heirs of the power of God, of his Wisdom, of his Righteousness inheriters and Possessors of the Eternal Life, that ye may dwell in the house forever, not onely as Ser∣vants, but as Sons; not onely as such that have tasted of the Love of God, but as such as are born Heirs thereof, and must inherit the same forever. Now dear Friends, if this were my last unto You, more then this the Lord hath not to say by me; and last of all in the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, I charge all the Saints to be faithfull to the Principles and Doctrines which Ye have heard and received, and been taught of Christ through his Gospel. Oh be not inconstant and unfaithful in those Principles and Doctrines which the Spirit of God hath perswaded your Consciences of the truth of; for if a∣ny are unfaithful, they deny the Lord of Life before men, and must be deny∣ed of him before the Father; therefore let us put on strength and courage to be faithful and constant in life or death, to follow the Lamb wheresoever he goes, and if we must suffer for our profession and practice of those truths which God hath perswaded our Consciences of the verity of, we shall never be ashamed nor confounded before the Adversary, though we gaom Tribula∣tions, Persecutions, yea death it self for the Name of the Lord and his Truth, yet we shall obtain the Crown of Glory which never fades away; and ve∣rily all the Suffering; and afflictions of this Present time, are not worthy to be compared to that weight of Peace and comfort, which is and shall be reveal∣ed amongst us. And as concerning our Obedience to Government, ever since we were a People, Ye know what our Principle and Practise in that case hath been, even to obey all men in all things, either by doing or suffering, if at any time ye are required to do any thing by any in Authority which is not agreeing, but contrary to the Scriptures example of the Saints, and the Spirit of Christ in your own consciences, then ye are to suffer whatsoever, if it be death it self rather then to obey and submit to the doing of that which is contrary to a good conscience, this hath ever been our Principle and Practise since we were a People, agreeing with the practise of the holy Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs in all ages, who rather did suffer grievous oppressions and persecu∣tions, then to obey any command of men in power, by doing any thing con∣trary to the testimony of the Spirit of God in their own particulars; let us all be
like-minded this day, not to do, nor bend, nor be in any wise contrary to the Spirit of Christ that dwels in us, but rather suffer whatsoever may be imposed, then to sin against that Light and knowledge of the Spirit of Christ which he hath given us, but let us keep a clean heart and a pure Conscience to God∣wards, and therein we shall triumph over all in our inward Man, though our out∣ward man be afflicted, and in this we shall have peace and comfort in God over all our Adversaries. And as concerning your meetings, the Lord hath given you the testimony of his Spirit in you for the verity and righteousness thereof; though ye should suffer persecution for the same, yet ye have the Spirit of Christ testifying in your hearts that this Way and Practise of meeting together (as our practise hath been) is of God, and he Justifies us in the same, and we have sufficient of assurance by the holy Spirit to stand faithful in that practise of assembling together to Worship God. First, we have the testimony of Scriptures and example of Saints in the Apostles daies, to prove this practice of Meeting together; The first Christians they met together in this manner and way as we do now, they met in private houses, and from house to house separate and apart from the Publique Syna∣gogues and all other Sects; and it is clear that we have the example of Saints and Scripture Proof for this our practise of meeting together. 2. We have our own experience for these divers years, how that the Spirit of the Lord hath moved our hearts to assemble together, and the presence and power of the Lord Jesus Christ hath been amongst us, and we have tasted of the goodness and love of the Lord, being so met together: how often hath the Lord met with us and his countenance shined upon us, and our souls have been refreshed, strengthened and comforted in this practise of meet∣ing together? these things are true, and may confirm us in this practise of meeting together, and to be faithful to the end. 3. We have the full perswasions of the Spirit of God lively and fervent in our hearts at this moment, that we ought not to neglect the Assembling of our selves together, but that God requires it of us, and it is his will that his People meet together to worship him in Spirit and Truth, separate from all the world even in one Spirit, and in the Name and power of Jesus, I hope ye are all like-minded herein, and that the Spirit of Christ perswades your Con∣sciences in the Truth of that practise; therefore be faithful unto God herein, and sin not against the testimony of Scriptures, and example of the first Chri∣stians, nor against your own experience, nor against the admonitions of the Servants of the Lord, who are the first fruits unto God since the Apostacy, and have again and again in the Name and Spirit of Christ exhorted you to meet together; wherefore be faithful to perform your duty to God in that particu∣lar, whatsoever sufferings should be infflicted upon you by the men of this World. And as concerning refusing to take any Oath, ye know it hath been our Principle and practise so to do since the Lord hath given us knowledge of his wayes, and the spirit of the Lord that dwels in us, perswadeth our hearts to deny all swearing, both as it was practised under the Law, according to the command of God, and in the Types and Figures, and as it is practised among the Christians since the Apostles daies, which is, as now practised, Idolatry and Superstition; And I say the Spirit of Christ doth confirm our hearts in this trut, even to deny all swearing; and also we have the express command of Christ, and of the Apostle Iames forbdiding all swearing by Heaven, and Earth, and all other Oaths, which bears witness to the truth of our refusing to swear at this day; likewise we have the Testimony of many holy Martyrs and Prophets since the Apostles daies, who denied to swear on any wise, who suffered for such their Testimony. All which evidences may justly confirm the hearts of Gods people at this day faithfully to hold out their Testimonies of refusing to swear at all, seeing we have a cloud of witnesses that testifie with us, the express
Command of Christ, and the Apostle th Test of divers ges, who suffered for the same and the present Spirit of Christ in our own Hearts▪ All which are sufficit to give Courage and Boldness under all Sufferings and Afflictions that we may  withal for re∣fusing to Swear. Well Friends, Be faithful to God in these and all other things which God hath given you Light and Knowledge in, and I do Conscience, and not to sin against the Light and Knowledge that God hath gi∣ven you, either by denying to profess and practice that Truth which the Lord hath perswaded your Heart of or by conforming to anything which ye know is not of the Truth, and this is the Way of Eternal Peace with God: But if any shall, through the Temptations of the Adversary, and for the    of this World, deny the Lord, and renounce good Conscience , such must bear the Burden of the Lord's Anger because Revoltings from the Wayes of God. True it is▪ This is a Day of great Tryal, yet the Lord is strong, and gives Strength unto all his People that  upon And let us be mindful what our Controversie is, and , this Day our Controversie is for the Lord, and his Truth, to Do Faithfully, and Suffer Patiently whatsoever the Will of the Lord is unto us, and not to renounce and deny the exercise of our pure Consciences in those things that God hath perswa∣ded our Hearts of the Truth of: For, if any this Day should be Unfaithful, either by doing what they should not, or leaving undone what they know they should do: If any deny the Lord and his Truth, and conform to the false Ways and Worships of men, such lose the Controversie, and give the Cause of God into the hand of your Enemies, which is a fearful Abomination; and the Contro∣versie is with that spirit, which opposeth us in these things, which we know are of the Lord. It is with that spirit that we must contend, contend (I say) by the Spirit of the Father, in Long-Suffering, and Patience and Good-will to∣wards all men, and not with the Weapons of this World in envy to any, even with that spirit which doth oppose our meeting together to worship God, and would impose Oaths and Things upon us contrary to our Consciences: And these things are the main Matters of Controversie this day, which the Spirit of Christ in us must oppose, being imposed on us by the spirit of the World. So all Friends are to mind to be Faithful to the Spirit of Christ, and its perswasi∣ons; and against that spirit which is not of him; For the Opposition is be∣tween the two spirits; and none must say, the things required to be forborn, or to be done, are but small matters in themselves, and may be done or not done without Offence; this kind of Reasoning may be dangerous, and may easily di∣vert from the Obedience of Christ; for we are not to look so much at the things in themselves▪ which are required to be done or to be forborn, as at the spirit which doth impose upon us in such cases against pure Conscience; if the spirit be not of God, we must not obey it in the least things; for this is indeed the matter of Conscience, not so much particular things or actions, as the spirit that is not of God, where it requires things against good Conscience; for what∣soever that spirit requireth, be it little or much in respect of the Action, it must not be obeyed, and that for Conscience sake; for this is a good Conscience, that cannot do nor conform to any thing which the spirit that is not of God enjoyes, though therefore suffering be inflicted on the outward man. And last of all, I do advise and exhort, That ye have Love and Unity in the Spirit of the Lord and one with another, that oneness of Heart and Soul and Spirit may be amongst us, being bound up in the holy Covenant of the Father, even willing to do or suffer one for another; and in this Spirit of Unity the Lord will bless us, and make us strong and able to go through joyfully all our Afflictions; but if any Strife or Division be in the Body, it weakens the whole; if one Member vex another through discord, this is not of the Father, but con∣trary to him; this is not for the safety of the Body, but bruises it and wounds it,

Antichrists Government JUSTLY DETECTED, OF Unrighteousness, Injustice, Unreasonableness, Op∣pression and Cruelty, throughout the Kingdoms of this, WORLD; Wherein Antichrist hath had his Seat and great Authority for many Generations, in the Apostacy from the Spirit and Life of True Christianity: Shewed and Declared, First, In the Case of Imposing upon Conscience in Matters Reli∣gious, by Force of outward Violence, or Pains and Penalties on the Per∣sons and Estates of Men; which is proved Unrighteous, and Dan∣gerous, and of Antichrist, &c. Secondly, In the Case of Heresie; shewing what it is in it self, who a Herteick is, who are the true Iudges of it, and what Punish∣ment pertaineth to such as are truly convicted thereof; and that, To Kill, Burn, Bannish, or to punish Hereticks (as such) corporally, is of Antichrist, &c. Thirdly, Concerning Antichrist, and his Mystery of Deceiva∣bleness; what he is in himself, and how he appears in the World; what his Works are, and what his Government is; and where it is, and who are the Subjects of his Kingdom. The EPISTLE; Dedicated to all the Rulers (of what degree soever) in the (so called) Christian World. O Friends! in the perfect Love of God Almighty towards your Souls and Bodies, and towards all Mankind; which Love is as a Fountain opened in my Heart, and kindly issueth forth in Soul-breathing-de∣sires
of Good unto the whole Creation: In this Love (joyned with an Hum∣ble, Meek, and Lowly Temper of Spirit) do I present this little quantity of Substance unto you; not so much for your approof of my Work, as if I cra∣ved your Licence and Approbation for this small Piece to pass under your Iustification (as is usually the manner of such Epistles thus directed) but much more for your serious and weighty Considerations of the Cases (though Briefly, yet Truly) unfolded, which are things of very great moment to you, and wherein all of you, from the Least to the Greatest, are less or more concerned. And I do present this Work unto you, as Wholsome Advice and Good Councel for you (which ye ought verily to read and receive as such) ra∣ther then to Flatter you, by begging a Pass-port from you, that this may be read and received where it shall come; for, the Truth and Verity of it, the Weight of the Matter contained, and the Soundness and Substance demonstra∣ted, shall plead its own Worth for acceptation in the Hearts and Consciences of all sincere Men. The Truth and Verity, Weight and Substance of Matter; I say, these Termes I may justly present this small piece under the denomination of, unto you, and all the World. True it is, I do not study pleasing Stile, nor have I endeavoured to clothe and trim the Matter with Flattery, Curious Termes, Words of Man's Wisdom, or some Rare Method, that it might appear more in Shew than in real Substance, (as the way of too many Writers have been in such Cases) Nor do I promise to please the Wordly Wisdom in Men, by a Delightful Sound, so much as to an∣swer the sincere Consciences of Men by Sound Truths; declared more in Home∣ly broken Terms of Speech, than in the rarity of Phrase, or well-compacted Rhe∣torick: For I have alwayes desired to be known and approved of God, and those that fear him in Sincerity, Humility, and down-right Truth; and for this I study daily and labour alwayes, even to have Praise, Peace and Comfort of God, rather than men, in what I am, and in what I do: And there∣fore it is my desire, that ye would look beyond the Method containing, to the Matter contained; and that your Eye may be fixed on the Substance intend∣ed, which is verily and in Truth, That ye may be informed the Way of your Peace and Happiness in this World, and in that which is to come; and may never hereafter Impose by Force and Violence, in the Matters of Faith and the Worship of God, upon the Consciences of any, through Penalties and Pu∣nishments upon Men's Persons and Estates; but that ye may allow and tollerate freely Liberty of Conscience in all Religious Matters; and may not by Cruelty Destroy Men in their Persons or Estates, upon the account of their be∣ing supposed to be, or if really Hereticks, and because of difference in Iudgment and Practice in Spiritual Matters. These are the Particulars (for substance) held forth unto you, and all the World; and I have judged it most proper to direct these Cases to your View and Consideration, as being the Persons most chiefly (though not wholy) con∣cerned: Therefore blame me not, but rather receive my Love, though but little in Quantity, yet real in Quality, and that ye will find one day, when ye have truly tryed the Effects of the two Cases plainly laid before you; which are, Im∣position
upon Conscience; and Free Liberty of Conscience: These are the two Causes, which will have their different and contrary Effects upon all the Rulers in the World; Peace, Blessings, Prosperity and Happiness are the Effects of the one Cause; and Wars, Tribulations, Contentions, Misery, Sor∣row and the Curse are the Effects which have and will unavoidably follow the other Cause; and this ye will all find in the Experience of Time and Transactions com∣ing to pass in the World. And therefore I cannot but (in homely plain words, as my manner is) assert the Causes, and the Effects of the Causes unto you again and again, for the very End, to Inform you, Advise you, and Warn you to follow the Good, and to forsake the Evil; to do the Right, and hate the Wrong; that the Effects of Righteousness and Liberty of Conscience, even Peace, Love, Mercy and Pro∣sperity may ever be with you; and the Effects of Cruelty, and Oppression, and Imposition upon Conscience, which will be your Misery, Downfal and Destruction (if ye continue in the Cause which works this Effect) may be turned away, and ye delivered. Wherefore O ye Men, Be Advised, be Warned; this is the Day of the Lord's Dawnings; we have seen his Power and Glory; he hath wounded us, and healed us; he hath killed, and made alive; he hath Proclaimed Liberty in eur Squls and Consciences from Death and Darkness, from the Grave and Hell; and he hath set his People free from Bondage, to serve Him with a pure and perfect Heart; And if ye (Mortal Men, made of the Dust of the Ground, whose little measure of Breath is in your Nostrils) will not ap∣prove of, and joyn with this Blessed Work of the Lord; but shall gain-say his Doings, and set your Power against his Power, and will not let the Peo∣ple go free in the Exercise of their Consciences in Holy Performances, whose Consciences God hath made free; then shall the Most High reward your Opposition with his Cup of Vengeance; and he will make you know, He is the Lord, against whom ye thus raise Contention; and he will dissolve your Substance, and bring down your Glory, and subdue your Pow∣er, if that (I say) ye oppose his Work, and will seek to bind and limit his Spirit in his People, and will yet force and impose upon Conscience by out∣ward Violence, and Kill and Persecute unto Death and Banishment for matter of Conscience, and because of difference in Iudgement in Spiritual Things; then thus it shall be done unto you, Ye shall Fall, and Perish, and be Troubled, and Blessings and Prosperity shall not be unto you. If it be not thus, the Lord hath not spoken by me. Well Friends, even all ye that have Authority and Power in the Govern∣ment of this World, are nearly concerned to take special notice of these things presented unto you; seeing the Effects of these two Causes are both very weighty, and infallibly certain, even to you-wards particularly: Very weigh∣ty, because Peace, Prosperity and Happiness; or Misery, Distractions, and Downfall to you is depending upon the Effects of the Causes; infallibly cer∣tain, because the Iustice of God Almighty is such, that he must bring Reward upon all according to their Deeds, and his Iustice cannot be diverted.
But if ye permit Free Liberty of Conscience in the Exercise of God∣liness in Faith and Worship unto all People under your Power, then shall Peace and Prosperity be unto you, according to the Purpose of God: But if ye impose upon Conscience in any wise, by Force in Religious Matters, and will not be instructed and advised, to the contrary, Then shall Misery and Destruction certainly be unto you, according to the Justice of God's Vengeance. These things are so; as a Servant of God I present them to you, and not upon Fiction or Fancy, but as I have received them from the Lord God, by his Spirit, which signifies the Verity and Certainty of those Things in my Soul. Friends, Doubt not of these things; for verily the Time is at hand, and it must surely come to pass, my Spirit shall see it, and rejoyce therein, if in this Body I may not behold it, That imposing and forcing of Conscience, by Laws and Ordinances of Men, upon Penalties on Mens Persons and Estates, in Religious Matters, shall be expunged, subdued, and aban∣doned in these Nations and Kingdoms of the World, and it shall be no more: But Liberty, Liberty shall be Re-planted, Embraced and Renowned amongst Men; and Truth and Righteousness, Mercy and Peace, True Liberty and Freedom, Justice and True Judgment, with all the Causes and Effects thereof shall flourish, and grow, and pro∣sper on the Earth; and the contrary shall fall, and rise no more. This Day is dawning nigh, its at the Door; Blessed are they that are prepared for it. Wherefore let all Flesh Hear and Fear, Bow and Tremble, and let the Hearts of the Righteous rejoyce and be exceeding glad; let all the Upright in Heart put on the Garment of Praises and Deliverance: For the Day is at hand, that Antichrist (with all his Strength and Power, Force and Policy) shall be a Hissing, and Reproach, and Shame, Contempt unto the Saints of the Most High, and amongst whom the Lord God Omnipotent doth and must Raign and Rule in Dominion, and Glory, and Power over all, forever, and evermore.

Antichrist's Government Justly Detected, &c. CHAP. 1. Concerning Imposing Religion, the Case stated, and the Unrigh∣teousness thereof shewed, with the Danger thereof also made appear by manifest Proofs. Presented unto the Rulers and People of our Age, throughout the World. TO Impose any Kind of Religion, any Way of Worship, or Form of Faith, and outward Conformity, in any Practices of Duty to God∣wards, by an External Authority of men, through force of Laws, commanding and requiring such Conformity in Faith and Worship upon Pains, Penalties and Forfeitures on mens Persons and Estates, as hath been practiced in the World since the dayes of the Apostles, amongst the Nations professing Christianity: This thing is not of the Lord, nor according to Commands of Christ, and Example of the Apostles and Primitive Christians, declared of in the Scriptures; but is of Antichrist, and Unrighteous, Unequal, and Dangerous, to the Destruction of the Souls and Bodies of both the Imposers and the Imposed. 1. Such kind of Forcing and compelling by force of outward Laws into such outward Conformity of Religion, Faith and Worship, Church-Go∣vernment and Ministry, was never in beeing, nor ever practiced in the true Christian Churches, amongst the Apostles in their dayes; nor ever was such a thing known among the Primitive Christians: There was no such kind of Laws made nor executed amongst them, nor such Force exercised on mens Persons and Estates in such Cases; there was no outward Violence used in the Pri∣mitive Times, to compel any to Conformity to Christian Faith, Worship and Practice of Christian Religion: None of the first Christians were made truly Religious, and converted from the Way of Error to the Way of true Christia∣nity by such means of outward Force, and Commandments of Men put upon them; They were not I say converted themselves to the Christian-Faith and Re∣ligion, nor made Conformable Worshippers of God in his Spirit by that Way and Means; nor did they seek to convert others into Conformity to Church-Government and Christian-Worship by force of outward Laws upon Pains and For∣feitures: These things were not in the true Church of Christ, in the Apostles dayes, amongst the Primitive Christians. 2. But the true Way of Conversion among them, to the Christian-Faith, and Worship, and true Church-Government, whereby people were made rightly con∣formable to the true Christian Religion, as it was amongst the Apostles, was by and through the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, preached amongst them in the Power and Demonstration of the Spirit of God, of such as were truly called and sent of him, which did turn People to the Spirit of God; and that Ministry wrought in them to receive it, by which their Consciences were convinced, and their Hearts perswaded in the Love of christ to believe in him, and receive him, and follow him; and thus were they drawn, and begotten,
and converted into the Faith, and Worship and Practice of the true Christi-Religion, and made conformable to the Government and Order of the true Church of Christ in all things, by this Means and Way only; and not at all by any outward Force and Compulsion exercised upon them they were conver∣ted to the true Christian-Religion, and to the true Worship of God; and by the same Way did they convert and turn others to the same, and this only is the Perfect Way of Christian-Conformity to the true Christian-Worship and Church-G∣ment; it ever was since the beginning of Christianity in the World, and i n∣to this day, even to perswade the Heart and to convince the Conscience in∣wardly by the sound Doctrine of the Gospel, through the Operation of the Spirit of Christ, and by Love, and Meekness, and Patience, and all the Fruits of Righteousness, held forth in Doctrine and Conversation, which may answer the Testimony of God in all mens Consciences. Hereby, and in this Way is true Conversion wrought in the heart, to the turning men from all Error, unto the Truth, and from all false Worships, and Heresies and Evil Ways, unto the true Christian-Worship, and Conformity to holy Church and Re∣ligion. This (I say) was the Way among the primitive Christians d Apostles of old, and is the same among the true Christians in this Age; and they that would conform others, and are conformed themselves otherwise in this Case of Religion and Worship to God-wards, are not in the Example of Christ and his Saints; but out of the Life, and contrary to the first Christians, and President of the Holy Scriptures, as hereafter is manifested. The Way and Practice of Imposing Religion, and Conformity in Worship and Church-Government, by Force (as aforesaid) is so far from being according to the Practice and Example of the Apostles and the primitive Churches of Christians, that they are even contrary to the Commands and Exhortations of CHRIST and his Apostles, and Example of the Scrip∣tures. 1. As in the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares, Mat. 13. when it was desired of the Servants, that they might go and gather out the Tares, that the Enemy had sown, from among the Wheat, it was commanded to the contrary by the Husbandman, even that they should suffer the Tares to grow among the Wheat till the Harvest, and not pluck them up, lest they hurt the Wheat thereby. Now though there be an invisible Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven secret∣ly signified in this Parable, more then may here be said; yet 'tis also clearly signified, That Christ would have no Imposition nor Violence used upon th Tares, nor that they should pluck them up by Force; but that the good Corn and the bad  grow together in one Field till the Harvest. And thus much this Parable bears the Proof of; Suppose there be Heresies, and Hereticks, and Prophane Persons, that are not in the Truth, but in Er∣rors, who are bad Corn, even as the Tares to the Wheat; in that Kingdom, City or Family, where there is also converted Saints, and holy Persons, and true Members of Christ, who are as the Wheat to the Tares; yet such Hereticks and Prophane Persons, that are in Error, ought not to be plucked up violently, to wit, Imprisoned, Bannished, and put to Death, Burned and Destroyed from amongst the Righteous, though they grow amongst them, even in the s Field: The converted Saints ought not (I say) to destroy by nnishment or Death the Hereticks, and Unconverted and Unconformable Persons from amongst them; but they are to let them live, even grow amongst them in the same Field, in the same Kingdom, City or Family, till Harvest. And thus much the Parable may truly signifie, Even a Liberty to live for the Tares, the bad Corn, the evil Persons, among the Wheat, the Righteous Pers, with∣out being imposed upon by Cruel Force and Outward Violence, to compel into Conformity.
2. As in the Case among the Saints and true Believers; where some believed,  might  all , others did  Hs, and some esteemed one day above , nd othe esteemed every day alike, Rom▪ 14. Here was some difference in Judgment and Practices amongst the Believers, about Mts and Des (abou which thi there hath been much Imposition and Force used in the World since the Apostle dayes) Well, But what doth the Apostle Paul , and advise in this Case? Doth  threaten Violence towards any of them, or signifie any forcible Commands or Impositions to be used to bring them into Conformity and Unity in the things and Matters about which they were divided? No, no; but this is his advice to the Church of Christ (of which he was a true and able Minister) Iudge not one another about such things, nor do not impose any Practice upon thy Brother; for to Christ Iesus is Master every Believer stands or falls. And saith the Apostle, L every Man be fully perswaded in his own Mind, vers 5. And hereby it is manifestly proved, That in the Churches of Primitive Christians, the Saints and true Christians were not imposed upon by Com∣mandments of Mn, or outward Laws, in the matters of their Religion and Pra∣ctice of Conscience; there was no signification of force to be used for Conformi∣ty; but why contrary, even every Believe had the Liberty of the Spirit of Christ, and as he was by that perswaded in his own mind to do, or leave undone in such cases; and every one was to mind the Teachings of the Spirit of Christ in himself; for to that he was to stand or fall, and not to impose upon another, no, not so much as to judge his Brother in any case of difference in Judgment or Practice; but they were to leave one another to the Perswasions of the Spirit of Christ in their own minds. 3. As in the Case where the Apostle exhorted the Saints to be Like-minded. il. 3. But saith he, If any  Otherwise-minded, God shall reveal even this unto you: By which Saying it is mnifest, That the Unity and Conformity of Saints in Mind and Practice was not by Imposition, or any outward Force threatned or exercised upon their Persons or Estates; but contrary-wise, if there was any Difference in Mind and Practice amongst any of them, that was to be amended; and Unity made up, when God revealed the same Truth in all, as he had done in some: if any were not so minded in any thing as others were, they were not to be imposed upon; but let God reveal the same, and bring into Conformity; this was the Apostle's Counsel. And vers. 16. Never∣theless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule; that is to y, so far as the Rule of the Spirit of Christ is made manifest, or in wh mea∣sure the perfection thereof is attained unto, let every one walk in the same mea∣sure, and by the same Rule; and if any have not the self-same measure of the Spirit, and know the self-same things, let such alone, without imposing upon them, leave them to walk in the measure of Light and knowledge that they have received, though it be not the self-same measure that others have received, and if they want any Knowledge, or be in any thing otherwise-minded, God shall reveal the same unto them, even the same thing, as they grow in the same mea∣sure of Grace and Knowledge: And here is the perfect Way of Unity and Con∣formity, as the Primitive Christians were exercised in the true Faith and Worship, and true Christian Religion in their dayes. And so to impose by Force upon Paint and Forfeitures in Religious Matters, is clearly contrary to all these Scriptures, and to many more in the New Testament. 4. In that Case, 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. where the Apostle exhorts the Elders, To take e Overght of God's Flock, not by Constraint or Force, but Willingly; not for  by Luc, but of a ready Mind; neither  being Lords ver God's Heritage: which cly signifies against Imposing upon the Flock of God, or forcing in Religi∣ous Matters; for ye see the Elders might not be constrained or forced to take the Oversight of the Flock; neither (having the Oversight of it) might they be
y, no  Heritage, nor use any  the Apostle; and the con (saith he).  Lov,  g El or upon them in igor or Elders and Ministers, overseeing oversee God's Heritage, self-denial, and in all th hereby with the Word of wards; and not ruling over them as Lordship; by forcing and imprisoning nd as hath been ver the Heritage of God, Lords over the Flock, exam∣ple of Scriptures; and Gentleness, and good Example Peter's Instructions. Thus it is clearly manifest throughout the way of imposing Religi, and Worship and Church-Government, in the dispens of  Gospel, as aforesaid, is contrary to the commands of Chri example of Scriptures, and is not of God, nor according unto him; And now I shall w in the fourth place, of whom it is  y whose Example this violence used, and prsecution unto on, and also the beginning of impo  force ongst Christians. 4. All this persecution been in the world, as imprisoments, unto death, and grievous Afflic, hath been of through the   Envy of the Devil, against God that Persecution before the   Christ in the , it the particulars of it, as it is signified Transactions in wledged by all, that such cruel Persecutions were of the Dil. And again in the days of Christ and his Apostles,  was the force and  by  practised on the true  Christians by e Je and which was in licted upon Chri Apostles, and the Christians, was imposiion and Religion; so much for comping them to any thing, as from that way of Ri and which they walked; they were ded in the Name of Isus, and were prisn anished, and greatly  by the Is, (that  pro People) Religion, for the : I need  mntion the par∣ticular profs for this thing, 'tis so clear and elsewhere, how the Primitive Christians were forced and impo upon by cruel Laws, and violent Persecutions for their Christian Religion sake; all out of  and in the heart  wicked ,  Go by all. t 5. This Way and Practice of imposing up  Pesecu∣tion
the same was gst Chr, nor cticed by any called Christians,   Faith, which some did after∣terwards: For even in the Apo  some were gone ou from them into the Way of Ci, that killed  ; and into the Way of Balaam; that went for Gift and Rewards,  these were Apostates  the true Church; and they were  and uch li, as Paul to  ; such as these were aldy sprung up in the first Age, and they grew   in the second Ages And these were the Antichrist and lse Pro whith Iohn  were gone out from the true Church into the World, in his , and these deceived the World by the Form of Godliness, and   ,  the Power and Spirit of Christ: And the Apostates from the  , which were over spread in many Nations, and grown , were  Sea, and the Earth, out of which the Beast arose. Rev. 13. And it was War with the Saints, and to overco worship him; and he should CAUSE the rth, and  that dwell therein, to worship; and  should CAUSE  should be kil∣led; and  should CAUSE all,    , Rich and Poor, Bond and Free, to receive s Mark, &c. And this Beast was the Authority of An∣tichrist, that arose among the Aposta and the false Prophets, that thus Cau∣sed and Compelled all to worship the Beast and his Image: Mark how of∣ten the word CAUSED is used in that Chapter, which is, Compelled, or Forced; and it was the Antichrist, the Beast, that did it, the Authority that arose among the Apos Christians, that were gone from the true Church: and this was the first that we read of any Forcing or Compelling to Worship, or persecuting about Worship, and Imposing about the same, since the dayes of the Apostles, through Ages, amongst them called Christians: and here was the beginning of Imposing by , and Violent Laws, in the matters of Worship and Religion, amongst the People called Christians, and one Sect and Sort, according to its Authority, imposed by Laws and Force upon another, causing and compelling one another to worship and believe according to his Form and Image; and as any Sect of Christians gained outward Authority over others, that same has caused and forced all others by outward violence into Con∣formity to its Way and Worship; and this hath been amongst the People called Christians in the Apostacy, ever since Antichrist and his power rose up amongst them: and thus, and at this time begn first the imposing of Worship, and per∣secuting about the same amongst Christian: And thus 'tis manifest to be of An∣tichrist, and of the Wicked one, and not of the Lord. 6. By what is said, it is plain, That all in this present Age who impose by force of Laws, and compel to worship, and persecute about the same, are not in the Example of Christ, or his Apostles, or any the good Primitive Christians; but in so doing are in the Example of the Persecutors of the holy Prophets, and in the Example of the cruel Iews that killed Christ, and persecuted the Saints; and in the Example of the cruel Heathens, that violently persecuted the Christians in diver Ages and Countries, and are indeed of Antichrist, and of the Beast, that arose up against the Saints, and made War against them; and such are all they that do impose upon the Persons, Estas and Consciens of n at this day upon the account afores: And this is worthy of ll me serious Consideration. And now, in the next place I shall proceed to shew, how  and Un∣reasonable it is, for any called Christians to impose pon the Consciences of others, and to force them by Laws and Commandments in the Matters of , and to persecute out the se. 1. I it unrighteous, because it is an intruding upon the  and Pri∣viledge
of God, and seems to be a derogating from his Honour Power and Domi∣ which properly is in himself and pertains to him alone, and not unto mortal man, which is to give Laws to Conscience, nd to exercise it in all  of Religion respecting his Worship Duty and Service, and to perswade   Conscienc by his Spirit to follow him, and observe all things which he ∣quires in Faith and Worship: This Power is only proper to God alone, and to him pertaineth, and to no other: And therefore for any man, or earthly Powers of man, to give Laws and Rules to Conscience, and to impose upon men in the matters of God's Worship, forcing, Conformity in Spiritual Exer∣cis by violent Commands, upon Forfeitures and Punishments, seems to be, and really is an assuming and presuming upon God's Authority, which belongs only to him, and tends to rob him of the same, and is an entrenching upon his Soveraignity, and is wholy Unrighteous; and inasmuch as it is a g in the Seat of God, and forcing the Exercise of Worship, and intruding up∣on his Blessed Priviledge, and a presuming into his Authority, which he com∣mits to no man, a robbing him of his Honour and Spiritual Dominion; there∣fore to Impose, in Matters Religious, is Unrighteous on their parts that do pra∣ctice it. And. 2. It is Unrighteous, because it is contrary to the Command of God, D   others   would be done unto; but this Imposing in matters of Worship, is a Practice done by others, which others would not be done unto by any▪ and therefore 'tis Unrighteous: For no one Sect or sort of Christians would be imp∣sed upon in that case by any others, not forced and compelled by outward Vio∣lence against their judgments and Consciences unto such a Conformity of th and Worship; to do thus is not to love a man Neighbour as himself, nor to do to all men as men would be done unto: For if at any time and place, the Papists (so called) impose upon the Protestants (so called) in this case of orcing them un∣to Conformity, or Persecuting them about Religion, 'tis cryed out against by such as are so imposed upon, to be Tyranny, Oppression, and Exacting Unrigh∣teously; and thus every Sect of Christians cry out against others, that do impose upon them by Force in things Religious, contrary to their Judgments and Consciences, each sort when they suffer saith of others, They are Unrighteous in such Impositions; though many cannot see it to be Unrighteous in them∣selves, when they have the Oportunity to do it, and do impose upon other; but this is where Self-advantage killeth and choaketh the Witness of , though however in it self imposing, as aforesaid, in Religious Mars is contrary to the Holy Law of God, and a doing to others as men would not be done unto by others: And therefore 'tis Unrighteous, both before God and all just Men. 3. It is Unrighteous to impose Worship by Force, because it is an exerci∣sing Dominion over men's Faith by Force of outward Power, which the Apo∣le renounces, and seems to forbid, saying, They had not dominion over mens Faith: d if the Apostles themselves had not power and dominion over men's Faith, that is to say, To Command mens Faith, to believe or do this, or the other, but  the holy Spirit of Christ perswaded their Consciences inwardly; then no outward Power of Kings or Rulers whatsoever can Justly or Righteously cha∣lenge h priviledge as to have dominion over mens faith, by imposing upon them through force, which is to take dominion over men's faith, which is un∣righ, because it is contrary to the Scripture, and to the example of the Apost , inasmuch as it is exercising dominion and Lordip over the stock of Christ, and not leaving them to Christ the true Shepherd, who onely ought to teach his people by his Spirit into all truth both of Doctrine, Faith and ,  hath not given power or authority to any Rulers of this World, to impose by force upon the consciences of his tender stock, nor to rule them in y , exercising outward force upon them; but whosoever doth this, it is unrighteous.
4. It is Unrighteous, in respect of the Fruits, and Effects which alwayes have and ever will be produced by such Imposition upon Conscience in Religious Matters, as aforesaid (to wit) Persecution and Cruelty of Men exercised in that Case, which ever hath been, and will be brought forth in Nations and King∣doms, where such Impositions are: For if we look into Ages past, what Strife and Contention, what Enmity and Bitterness, what Wars and Bloodsheds, what Dangers and Mischiefs, what Persecutions and Cruelties have been brought forth among men, between Kingdom and Kingdom, between City and City, between Kings and their Subjects, between Neighbours and Neighbours, be∣tween Brother and Brother, upon this very Unrighteous Account of Imposing upon Conscience by Force in respect of Worship? and every Nation and City at this day is in the same Danger of the same Mischiefs, where such impositions are in Force; and therefore needs must the Occasion of these so unjust and un∣righteous Effects, which doth administer the Reason of such Contentions Wars, Persecutions and Cruelties be Unrighteous, and such is imposing in Matters Religious, as aforesaid: and this is partly manifest, and will be mor and more through the World, That that Kingdom, City and Country will not be free from these Dangers and Mischiefs, but will alwayes be liable unto them while this kind of Imposition by Force on the Conscience is unremoved; and that which is the Occasion of such continual present Dangers, to destroy King∣doms, Cities and Peoples is Unrighteous; and such is Imposition in the Mat∣ters of Worship and Religion. 5. It is unrighteous in any King, Prince, or Authority of this World to Impose, as aforesaid, because it diverteth, confoundeth and destroyeth the End of Just Rule and Government amongst men one over another, which is only to Rule well in outward Affair, and over the outward Man, to keep that in Peace and Good Order, and to be a Praise to them that do Well, and a Terror to all that do Evil in the Outward Man; this is the only End of Government and Rule amongst men in this World, To Rule well over the Outward Man, in things between man and man; but not to Rule over men's Consciences, and to exercise Lordship over men in the Spiritual Matters of Christ's Kingdom, this pertains not to the outward Worldly Government of Men; and therefore whosoever do take it upon them, and thereby do oppress the Conscience of any, by forcing in Spiritual Mattters, doth Unrighteously, inasmuch as they do diver the End of their Authority, and use their Power to another End then God hath appointed them: and while they should only pre∣serve and defend the outward man by good and wholesome Laws, made for that purpose, they vex and oppress the Inward Man, even the Conscience, by forcing up∣on it, and Imposing through Violence in the Matters Religious, which is con∣trary to the End of Just Rule and Government in the World; and therefore is wholy Unrighteous. 6. It is Unrighteous, because it effects no Good End, nor begets people into the true Faith and Worship of God; but on the contrary, makes many Hypocrites, even through fear and terror; such Laws forcing Conformity, do make many hypocritically conform to such or such way of worship, which the Spi∣rit of Christ doth not perswade their Consciences of the truth of; nay, it may be against their Conscience; and that (Imposition as aforesaid) which is the cause of this, is surely Unrighteous; unrighteous, because the End pro∣pounded by the Imposers (which is, to make people true Worshippers of God) is utterly frustrate and void; and none are made true Worshippers of God by such Imposition and Force, but many are made Hypocrites there∣by, and sinners against God; for what any performs to God-wards by Force, and not of Faith (given into the heart by God) it is sin; For whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin, as saith the Scriptures; and that which is the occasion of hy∣pocrisie and sin, is unrighteous, and temptation; but such is imposing on Conscience by force in religious Matters.
7. It is Unrighteous and Unreasonable to Impose by Force upon Conscience, because it is the Occasion of absolute Eremity put upon many that are Dear and Precious to the Lord, even such a Extremity as may force (unavoidably) the ruin of either Soul or Body (or both) in this World, and hereafter, For, suppose such Laws be made for the forcing of Confority, to comm men to Worship upon the Forfeiture of whole Estate, Banishment o Death, which is contrary to the Spirit of Christ, and good Conscience: And if such Laws be not obeyed, and such Conformity made, but the Conscience kept clear to God, then the outward Man in his Person, Estate and Family is ruined in this World: and if such Laws be obeyed, and such Conformity yielded, contrary to good Conscience, then the Inward Man is ruined, and the Soul and Conscience woun∣ded and grieved, because God is Offended, and Christ is Denyed, and the Law of Men obeyed rather then the Law of God; and this is by an Extremity occasion'd, through imposed force in the Cases of Conscience, by Authority and Laws of Men. And that which is the Occasion of such Ruin and Destruction to the Souls and Bodies of such as fear the Lord, is an Unrighteous Thing, which administers that woful Extremity, To deny God, and so to be liable to his Wrath and Judgments; or, to deny the Authority of Men, and so to be liable to Destruction of Person and Estate in this World; and such is Imposing of Worship. 8. It is Unrighteous and Unreasonable, because it may destroy the Faith of some, even of such upon whom Imposition is laid, against their pure Conscien∣ces: For, Suppose a Person (or People) being truly perswaded by the Spirit of Christ in the true Way of Religion and Worship of God, having therein true Peace with God in a clean Conscience, and by force of Law, and through cruel Imposition, should be forced from that Way of Worship which they have had Peace with God in, and which the Spirit of Christ perswaded them of the truth of, un∣to such a Way of Worship which they could not have Peace with God in, nor the Comfort of his Presence in such Conformity forced upon them; this were certainly Unrighteous and Unreasonable, that a People (or a Person) should be forced by Laws from that way wherein they have Peace and Blessings with God, to that Way wherein their Souls are famished for want of the Presence of the Lord: Like as if a Person of such a Calling, following the same in a certain City or Town, whereby he maintained himself in all good things, and wanted nothing; and yet the chief Magistrate of the said City or Town should forci∣bly compel (by Violence) the said Person of so good a Calling, from that his Calling, (whereby he so well maintained himself in the World) and should force upon him to follow another Calling, of which he could not live in the World, but by it he might Perish and Starve; Would not all reasonable men conclude, the same Imposition of the said Magistrate upon the said poor Man were Oppression, Cruelty, Unrighteous, and Unreasonable: And the case of imposing Religion, as aforesaid, is the greater Oppression and Cruelty, inasmuch as it respects the Im∣mortal Soul, which is more worth then the Body; and the other respects but the Body, which is of less worth (with all that concerns it) then is the Soul, which is Immortal. Lastly, 'Tis Unrighteous, inasmuch as it is contrary to the Scriptures (of the New Testament in the Dispensation of the Gospel) which are before cited, and contrary to Christ and his Apostles Example in the Primitive Churches of Christians: And thus it is manifest, That Imposing by Force upon Conscience in Religious Matters is Unrighteous and Unreasonable, and is not of Christ, but of Antichrist, as is by plain Reasons demonstrated. And now I shall in a few words shew, The Danger of Imposing Worship,  aforesaid, and how Dangerous it is to any King, Prince or outward Authority, that are or may be the Imposers on the Consciences of Men, by Force, in the Case of Worship and Religion. 1. It is Dangerous to cause the People to sin, to cause them to conform in Appearance, when the Heart is not devout to God; and this makes them Hypo∣crites:
Dangerous to cause People to perform Duty to God-wards, without Faith in God; and this makes them Sinners against him; For whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin: Dangerous to cause some to deny Christ before men, for the Fear of this World, and Terrors of Violent Men, and to forsake that Way which they know is of the Lord, and to follow that Way which they know is not of him; and this denying the Lord of Life, and a great Abomination against him: And the Cause of that cause is, Imposing by Force upon Conscience in Matters Religious; and the Reason of all this is, The Imposers, such as make and Execute such Force; and this Danger all such are involved in, even the Danger of causing People to sin against God, of Denying Christ, of making Hypocrites, and so even in the Danger of Destroying Souls, which is a desperate Danger: Oh! that all the Imposers of Religion by Force would consider it, and look upon the Danger which they are deeply fallen into, and involved in, by reason of such their Imposing upon Conscience; Alas! they are in the Danger of destroying Souls, of causing a Nation and People to sin against God, and to deny the Lord of Life. And how great is such a Danger! even to be avoided of all, if they love their own Souls, and not to be the Occasions and Cause of destroying Souls by causing People to sin; and this Danger all the Imposers upon Conscience are captivated in. And 2. It is Dangerous to be a Means to destroy that Kingdom, City or Coun∣try, and the Rulers thereof, by begetting and nourishing Discontents, Heart∣burnings, and Envying among the People, one against another, and against their Rulers, because of such Unrighteous Force and Violence, exercised by Imposition upon their Consciences. Dangerous, I say, to raise into Conten∣tions, Strifes, Broyles, and Blood-shed it self, in a Kingdom amongst People. And this is a Danger violently impending upon such Rulers or do impose, as aforesaid; even a Danger to ruin their own Power and Authority, and to ruin the People under their Dominion, by raising the People into Discontents and Broyles, through the Cruelty of the Oppression of Imposing Religion; and the Example hereof may be read in Nations and Countries at this day; what Discontents and Contentions have arisen dangerously among people one to∣wards another, and towards their Rulers, upon this Cause and Occasion of Im∣posing Religion by Force Unrighteously; and 'tis a Danger this day that all the Ru∣lers of the World are exposed unto, and deeply involved in, where this Cause of Imposing Religion is extnt in Force. 3. It is Dangerous to Impose Religion by Force, because it must needs produce Oppression, Persecution, Violence and Hatred in the prosecution thereof; and this is dangerous to any Kings, Rulers or Governours, to be reputed Oppressors, Perse∣cutors and Violent Men; this is Infamous, and of bad Report amongst men, and Abomination and Wickedness in the sight of God, for any Rulers upon Earth to be Oppressors, Persecutors and Cruel Men; and such consequently must they be, that are Imposers upon mens Consciences in Matters Religious. And this Danger all the Rulers of the World are in, that do Impose Religion by Force, even to render themselves Infamous by Oppression in the sight of men, and to render themselves Sinners against God; and this Danger falls upon the Impo∣sers of Religion, because of such their Impositions by Force upon the Consci∣ences of men. Lastly, 'Tis Dangerous, because 'tis of Antichrist, and not of Christ, as before proved; and all that do Impose by Violence on the Consciences of Men in Religious Cases, are of Antichrist in so doing, and because thereof, liable to God's Indignation and Heavy Wrath in this World and hereafter; and 'tis Dangerous to bring the Wrath and Judgments of God upon Men that are guilty thereof; for God will be avenged upon such his Enemies, that exercise Violence and Per∣secution upon Men for their Conscience sake: And this is a Danger unavoida∣ble, which all that impose Religion are liable unto, even to be Cut Off in the
Wrath of the Lord, and to undergo his Indignation for all the Reasons be∣fore shewed. These, with many other Dangers are they involved in that are Imposers in Religious Matters; Therefore, Oh that the Rulers of this World would be Wise now in their last day; and would consider the Unjustness and Unreasona∣bleness of their Imposing Religion, and the many Dangers that attend the same! Oh that they would learn God's Counsel, and Rule only for him in Justice, Mercy, Truth, Equity and true Judgment, exercising the same in the Meek and Lowly Spirit of Jesus among men, and over whom they are set to Rule in this World, and would give to God Almighty his Due, and Right, and Priviledge, in exercising the Consciences of Men by his Spirit in all Cases of Christ's King∣dom; for it only belongs to him to be Ruler in the Inward Man: Oh! that the Rulers of this World would give this Power and Dominion unto God, and would from henceforth never more exercise Lordship over Conscience by Imposing Religion through Force; but would only Rule well over the Outward Man, in the things pertaining to Man, and would leave to God the Rule and Exercise of Conscience: Oh! then would it go well with them, and Happy and Blessed should they be in such their Authority; and Peace should be unto them if that they only took the Government (as appointed of God) over the outward Man, and did not impose upon the inward man by Force in Religious Matters, but committed that Authority to God; Then, I say, should Peace and Blessings be unto them: But while it is otherwise, even while they exercise Dominion and Lordship over Conscience, as aforesaid, they do unjustly and Unreasonably, and bring upon themselves many Dangers, and are liable to Con∣tentions, Oppositions, Wars, and many Mischiefs in this World, and to the Anger and Wrath of God in the World that is to come. CHAP. II. Concerning Heresie, the Case Stated, What it is in it self, and who a Heretick is, and who are the absolute true Iudges of it; and what Punishment pertains to such as are truly convicted of Heresie. 1. THere is such a thing as Heresie in it self, even many Heresies and Errors abounding amongst the Sons of Men in the World at this day; and there was Heresie in the dayes of the Aposties, and amongst them, brought in by such as erred from the Truth, after they had once known the Truth, and received it, as ye may read; the Iews they cryed out of Heresie in their time, which caused the Apostle to say to them, Acts 24. 14. After that Way which ye call Here∣sie do we worship the God of our Fathers: And the Apostle said (1 Cor. 11.) to the Church, There must be also Heresies amongst you, that they that are approved of God may be made manifest: And (2 Pet. 2. 1.) it is spoken of some who should privily bring in Damnable Heresies into the Church: By all which it is manifest, there was in the Apostles dayes Heresie and Heresies, as there is at this day, even many Heresies and Errors in the World, held, professed and maintained by the Apostate Christians, that are gone into the Form of Godliness without the Power, and are turned from the Spirit of Christ, and the soundness of his Doctrine, into the formal Profession of Religion, and of the words of Christ and his Apostles, and among such are the Heresies and Errors.
2. Heresie is somewhat believed and professed in Practice of Worship, and in Point of Faith and Doctrine, that is either contrary to, or different from the per∣fect Truth of the Gospel of Christ; something (I say) held and practiced in Point of Worship, Faith and Doctrine, which is not justly according to the pure Truth of Jesus, but either in whole, or in part different from, and contrary there∣unto; and whatsoever Practice of Worship or Point of Doctrine, as is so held, professed, believed or practiced is Heresie and Error, because it is different from and contrary to (in whole or in part) the perfect Truth of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, and because thereof it is Heresie; and such is Heresie in it self, different from and contrary unto the Gospel of the Kingdom of Christ; though as for the particular Parts and Points of Heresie, in Worship, Doctrine and Practice, which are at this day held, professed and believed among Apostate Christians are so very many, that they would be too large here to ennume∣rate; but my present Intention is only this, To shew at large what Heresie is in it self, and who is a Heretick. 3. A Heretick (one that is properly so) is such a Person as hath sometime believed in the Truth, and made Profession and Acknowledgment of the Way of true Christianity, and hath received and held the true Faith of the Gospel of Christ, and been in some measure united to Christ, and a Member of his Church, but is fallen and degenerated in whole or in part from the said Faith and Ac∣knowledgment of Christ Jesus, and the Way of Christianity, and hath erred from the Truth of the Gospel once believed and received, and so is divided (in whole or in part) from the true Church of Jesus Christ, and from being a Member of the same; and not only so, but hath received also, and doth hold some False Principles, Opinions, and Practices, either different from, or contra∣ry to the Truth of the Gospel before believed in, known, and professed; such a man is a Heretick (though generally, yet) truly described: Not such as are Heathens, Unconverted, who never believed yet in the Gospel, such who have alwayes resisted the Truth, and never yet were convinced of the Way of the Lord, nor ever tasted of his Word and Power; but have alwayes been Stran∣gers to the Israel of God, and Enemies to the Church of Christ; such are not properly called Hereticks, though they do err in Mind, Heart, and Practice; but such only as have believed in Christ, and Professed his Truth, and been of the Church, and yet are fallen away from the perfect Truth, into some false Principles and Practices, and are become unsound in Judgment, and erroneous in their Understandings, and have forsaken the Way of Truth (in whole, or in part) and are corrupted, and lost their Love to God and his Wayes, and are obstinate, and hardened against the Truth (which once they believed) and with False Doctrines, Principles and Practices do gainsay and oppose the Truth, and them that are stedfast in it: These are Hereticks, and truly so cal∣led; Men that have erred from the Faith, that have made ship-rack of it, and of a good Conscience, that are turned against the Lord and his People, and gainsay the Truth that once themselves have believed and professed. These are Erroneous Men, and Hereticks; and such Hereticks there were in the Church, and among the Corinthians; and there were such who did creep into the Church, and privily brought in Heresies amongst them, as before is proved. And these Hereticks were such as had once been amongst the true Members of the true Church, and been convinced of the true Jesus, and had sometimes walked with them, but were departed from them, and had forsaken the Truth, and received false Principles and Opinions, and therefore they were truly nominated He∣reticks, and all such at this day are truly so called. And this is the Description in general of a Heretick. 4. Now I come to declare who are the true Judges of Heresie and Hereticks; Not every man can judge in this case, in his own Thoughts, Imaginations, and Suppositions, who are Hereticks, and who are guilty of Heresie; though
it hath been the practice for many Generations amongst the Apostate Christi∣ans to reproach, traduce and accuse one another to be Hereticks, and each sort and sect of false Christians, to judge, censure and condemn others that are not of their Judgement and Opinion, but different from them, to be Hereticks and Erroneous; and this hath been usual among many; but this is not the true Judgement, not the way to try and judge truly who Hereticks are, by one Sect and sort slandering and accusing others to be such, because they have not conformed to their Way and Principles, but been different from them; true Judgement hath not been brought forth in this case, on this wise, but rather Envy and Enmity hath judged, and men's thoughts, imaginations and jealousies have falsly judged in this matter, and no sound judgement deter∣mined who have been Hereticks; for men have judged of one another by their private jealousies and evil conceivings, and censured one another to be Hereticks, without the Spirit of sound discerning, and just Judgement; and all that Judgement brought forth in that case, without the infallible Spirit of Christ Jesus, which is onely true Discerner and Judge in the matter, hath been false Judgement, and men have judged one another falsly upon envy and evil suppositions, and without the Spirit of the Lord; and it hath often hap∣pened by reason hereof, That such so judged for Hereticks, have been more righteous, and more in the truth, then they that have so judged them; and the Judges have been more out of the truth, and more Hereticks themselves, then they whom they have falsly Judged: And this might be made appear through several Times and Ages since the Apostles dayes, among the false Christians. 5. None are able to dilcern of Heresie, nor to try and judge justly who are Hereticks, none but they (I say) that have the infallible Spirit of God in them, to guide them, and have infallibility and perfect certainty of Judg∣ment and Knowledge in that case of Heresie; none else are rightly able to judge who are Hereticks, but such (I say) as have the infallible Spirit of Christ, and are infallible and certain in their Judgments; these onely, and none else, are able to judge, they onely are competent Iudges in this case of Heresie, and who are Hereticks; and if any judge in that Case, it is but out of Envy and Enmity, and in the evil Suppositions and Conceivings, as afore∣said, and must needs be false and unjust Judgment, if they have not the in∣fallible Spirit of God, and infallibility of Judgment to discern by, and de∣termine with in that Case; for no man nor men, may, or can justly judge another in the matter of Heresie, as a Heretick, by their own thoughts or suppositions, out of their enmity, and for their self-Interests; but the Judgement in that matter must be just, equal, holy and true, and onely by the Spirit of Christ Jesus which is infallible, and gives infallibility of Judgement and discerning into all cases and things; for it was Christ Jesus and his Apostles, and the Saints that had the infallible Spirit of God, and infallibility of judge∣ment, that could onely judge justly of such things, who were Hereticks, and who were not; and it was not the Iews nor Pharisees that could justly dis∣cern or judge in God's Spiritual matters; but they alwayes judged of Christ and his Apostles, and of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God falsly and unjustly in their evil suppositions and envy; and this was because they had not the infallible Spirit of Judgement, nor the certain, infallible knowledge and discerning of different things in Spiritual Cases; and so it is now at this day amongst them called Christians; there is none can discern truly, nor judge justly what Heresie is, nor who is a Heretick, but such as are guided by the infallible Spirit of God, and have infallibility of Judgement; nor none can make Laws whereby justly to judge of Heresie and Hereticks, but them who have the same infallible spirit of God guiding them, and have received in∣fallibility of Judgement: So both the Law-makers, and the Judges of the Law, must be infallible in knowledge and judgement in this case of Heresie, otherwise
the Law made for that purpose, and the Judgment given by that Law are both False and Unjust, and not according to God and his Truth, but are to be justly judged and condemned of the Lord God in his day and season. 6. Now it remains to be enquired into, Whether there is any Punishment pertaining to Hereticks, as such, for such Heresies held by them: Being first convicted truly thereof, as aforesaid, by the true Church of Christ, in whom there is infallibility of Judgment, Knowledge and discerning in that case; for in the true Church of Christ doth infallibility of true Judgment and Knowledge dwell, and every true Member of the true Church hath its particular Measure of the in∣fallible Spirit of Christ, whereby he is certainly perswaded of the Way of Truth in which he walks, and knows and believes the infallibility of the Truth he professeth, and is certain and secure of the Way of his Peace and Assurance in God, which he hath received and believed; and also, hath certainty and infallibility of Judgment, and Discerning who are out of the Truth, and in the Way of Error, and are Hereticks; such are infallibly known and discern∣ed by the Spirit of God in the true Church of Christ, and by every Member of the same, according to his measure of the same Spirit, and Gift of Knowledge and Discerning by it. And to such as are so convicted by the infallible Spi∣rit of Christ, for such their Heresies, there is a Punishment pertaining; for Hereticks were to be punished in the Apostles dayes, according to Paul's Instru∣ctions, 1 Cor. 5. 5. which was, That such a one as had erred from the Truth which once he knew, should be delivered up unto Satan for the Destruction of his Flesh, that the Spirit might be saved in the Day of the Lord: Here was a Punishment described by the Apostle for this Heretick, that had erred and gone from the Truth, and acted against it, though once he believed in it, and knew it. And again, Tit. 3. 10. he exhorts and advises, That a man that is a Heretick, after the first and second Admonition, should be wholy rejected, and turned away from, and judged with the Holy Spirit of God. And thus it is clear, there is such a thing as dealing with men that are Hereticks, and punishing them for such their Heresie, according to the Apostle's Doctrines and Instructions: And without all controversie, such as do err from the Faith which once they have received, and turn from the Truth in prin∣ciple or practice, must not escape unpunished, but must receive the sentence of just Judgement from God, and from his Saints that continue faithful. 7. But what kind or nature this punishment is of, in what way and manner such as are Hereticks, may be, and ought to be punished, is doubtful to many, and is a case at this time to be inquired into; for that way and practice of punishing such as have been supposed to be Hereticks, as among the Christians (so called) for many generations; (to wit) the way and practice of burning, banishing, kil∣ling, imprisoning and afflicting corporally the persons of them that have been called Hereticks, for their heresies, and laying forfeitures and penalties on their bodies and estates, as hath been the practice of Papists and Protestants towards one another since the Apostles dayes; this way and practice hath not been of God, nor by any example or precept of the Apostles, or first Christian Churches established in their dayes; they did not practise or prescribe such dealing towards them that were truly Hereticks, and were erred from the Faith and Truth of Jesus Christ; not Killing, Burning, Banishing and Prosecuting the Persons of He∣reticks, this was not the way of the Spirit of God among the Primitive Christians, they did it not, nor gave institution for the doing of it at any time; but this way of dealing towards Hereticks, in such cruel proceed∣ings as hath been in practice for many Ages, is of Satan and Antichrist, and is down-right Murder, Robbery, and Wickedness in the Eye of the just God; while one Sect or Sort of Christians (so called) have punished and enviously persecuted another Sort different from them as Hereticks, with grie∣vous Afflictions in Body and Estate, even unto Death and Banishment; this hath not been of God, nor true Christian-like, but of the wicked one, and
Cruelties and Murders before the Lord; neither are the same proceedings at this day, in any part of the World, where they are extant, any just legal Righteous, Christian-like way of proceeding according to Apostoli∣cal example; but are of Antichrist, and of the Wicked one, as I have said: And this Way and Practice of proceeding towards Hereticks, hath been so far from effecting the return of any to the Way of the Lord, that have been erred from it, (as the end of proceeding toward Hereticks should effect) that the way and practice of Killing, Banishment, and Persecuting by violence Here∣ticks (so called) hath hardned men in their evil way, and made such as have been Hereticks more bold, confident, and obstinate in their Way, Heresie and Errors and many that have been more righteous, and clearer from Heresie then such as have so judged them, have been destroyed by cruel dealing, and many others have been destroyed in their Iniquities and Errors, by being so proceeded against: And thus true Judgment and Justice in this case have been perverted, and turned backwards, and because of Ignorance and Cruelty the Righteous have suffered unjustly, as the Wicked, and the Wick∣ed have suffered by unjust proceedings; and thus the Way of Righteousness hath not been known in the Earth, but Error upon Error, one evil upon another hath come, onesin added to another among the Sons of men in the Apo∣stacy, amongst the false Christians. 8. But the perfect Way of the Lord in proceeding towards such as are truly Hereticks, so discerned and infallibly judged to be by the true Church of Christ, is this; Let such first be admonished, advised, instructed and warned again and again; to beware, return from, and renounce such false Principles, Doctrines and practices held by them, and this in the spirit of Christ Jesus in perfect love, and in meekness, and in the wisdom of the Lord God; such, I say, as are erred from the way of the Lord, and from the faith of Christ once received, into error, ought thus in the first place to be dealt withal, by the Way of Admonishing, Instructing, Warning and Reproving, that there may be a Returning and Repentance towards the Lord, and his Truth again, from whence they have erred; and if such shall not receive the Instructi∣ons, Reproofs and Admonitions of the true Church of Christ, then such Hereticks shall be rejected and cast out, according to Titus the 3. 10, 11. saith the Apostle, A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second Ad∣monition, reject, knowing that he that is such, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself; here is the Description of the punishing of an He∣retick; if he will not receive Admonition, after being given him again, and again, but doth harden his heart against the Church, and against the truth of Christ, and will not repent, but persicts in his errors and heresies, and that after reproof and admonition, then he is to be rejected; rejected, what is that? but a casting out from the unity of Saints, a departing and absenting from such an one, and a depriving of him of the peace and com∣fort, joy and felicity of the Assembly of God's People and Servants; a turn∣ning from such in Converse and Fellowship, and a separating from them, and judging them by the Spirit of Christ Jesus; and this is rejecting an Here∣tick, and delivering him to Satan, according to 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5, 6. When the Church (The Saints) were met together, with the Spirit of God, and the Power of the Lord Iesus Christ, such a one as had erred from the Truth, and sinned against it, and was truely an Heretick, should be delivered unto Satan, for the destruction of the Flesh, that the Spirit might be saved; Delivering unto Sa∣tan, what is that? but to let him be cast out into the wicked World, re∣puting him as such an one, and that he partake not of the sweet, heavenly and blessed Union and Fellowship of Saints in their Assemblios and con∣verse with the God of Heaven, in his Spirit and Life; not to be numbred among the righteous, nor a partaker with them in the holy Union of the Elect; to pass judgment upon him eternally, in the estate he is now in, ha∣ving
both erred from the Truth and rejected and despised the reproofs and Admonitions of the Church of Christ, and as such to give him up to Sa∣tan, to give him up to that Spirit that hath led him aside from the Truth, and hardned his heart against it; to deliver him up to it, seeing he refuseth to be reclaimed from it, and hath chosen to follow it rather then the Truth, let him be left unto, delivered up unto that Spirit, even unto Satan in the wicked World, let him be cast out thither among the unclean; and not reckoned among the record and line of the faithful People; and separated from, and cast out so, as he expresseth it, vers. 11. If any man that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, a Railer, a Drunkard, &c. with such a one not to accompany, no not to eat: and this is to deliver a Heritick to Satan, for the destruction of the Flesh, and is the proper punishment of Heresies and Here∣ticks, according to the Apostles Advice and Precept; but not to kill or punish the persons of men by corporal Afflictions and Penalties on the Bodies and Estates, for their Error sake, this the Apostle gave no Commission for; but that such as erred from the Truth, and walked contrary in Principle or Practice, should be rejected, and delivered up unto Satan, in the way and man∣ner before declared. Again, in Matth. 18. 16, 17, 18. it is signified by Jesus Christ to the self∣same purpose, in these words, If thy Brother trespass, go and tell him alone; if he repent, forgive him; if not, take one or two, or more with thee, and tell him again: if  still neglect to hear, tell it to the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let such a one be unto thee (as hath offended and rejected Reproof and Admonition again and again) as an Heathen man and Publican: In which words of Christ is truely signified the right and proper way of proceeding towards Hereticks and Offenders, even that they be first again and again admonished and repro∣ved; and if they resist the same, then to be cast out, separated from, and not enjoy the union and comfort of the Saints amongst them, but as an Heathen man and Publican; but here is not a word signified of laying corporal Punishments, & Burning or Banishing persons for their Errors sake; and though they may offend, no proceedings of this kind are authorised by Jesus Christ or his Apostles in their day, but in another way and manner, as I have shewed, is the pro∣per way ordained of God to deal with Hereticks, according to the Testimo∣ny of holy Scriptures, signified by Christ and his Apostles in the Primitive Churches. 9. This is Punishment according to the nature of the Offence; for as the Offence is Spiritual, erring in the mind from the Truth, and a going astray from the Spirit of Christ in a man's own particular; so the Punishment is an∣swerable thereunto, even to be separated from the Truth, and not to enjoy the Vertue, Peace and Comfort of it, nor to be partakers thereof amongst the faithfull People: And this is truly according to the Iustice of God, whose Wayes are just and equal altogether, and hath appointed just Rewards for Transgressors, according to the nature and merit of the Fact and Deed that is evil; and 'tis righteous and just, that men that sin against their own Souls, should be deprived of the Peace and Comfort thereof; that all that do de∣part from the Truth once known, and sin against the knowledge thereof, hould be no more a partaker of the Vertue and Felicity of the same; and that they who offend the Lord's People, and revolt from the union thereof, should be cast out from them, rejected of them, and not enjoy the Blessings and Peace with them; even that all they that will not hear the Repooofs of the Spirit of God, nor be drawn with the gentle movings thereof, should be judged and condemned with the same, and not inherit the Assurance of the Saints: And this is God's Iustice, That all that love Evil, and walk in Iniquity, and despise the Lord, should be cast out into the sinfull World, to have their Portion with the Ungodly, and all the Workers of Iniquity; and this is just Punishment according to the nature of the Offence of Error aad Heresie: for
in my Iudgment, (and I have the Spirit of just Iudgment in this Case) it is great Punishment, and sufficient for a man that hath once tasted of the Vertue of God's Presence among his People, to be cast out from the Feeling and En∣joyment of that Life, Vertue and Assembly where it is enjoyed; this is Pu∣nishment, and a Wound to the Soul and Conscience, for a Person that hath been turned from Iniquity, and witnessed the Peace of Christ in the Church, to be left in Iniquity, and to witness the Wrath and Anger of God daily smiting him in his spirit, and upon his heart; this is indeed great Punishment: And to have the holy Spirit of Christ in his People (now) to judge and condemn him, whom sometimes it hath comforted and refreshed; and to be dis-united and separated from that Spirit and Power amongst the Saints, which once gave Life and Joy amongst them: This man thus judged and condemned by, and thus separated and dis-united from the Spirit and Power of Christ, and his People, is punished and afflicted sufficiently for his Error and Heresie; even in his Conscience, Soul and Spirit he is wounded, grieved, pierced, vexed and punish∣ed, though yet his outward-man, and his person be not corporally afflicted by Punishments; but he is afflicted within, he is dealt withal by the Anger of God in his Conscience, he is separated into Darkness, and from the Light and Glory of God in the Assemblies of his People; he is at a distance from the Lord God, and the Spirit which should comfort him, doth daily vex and judge him; and the people among whom he should be saved, he is separated from, and cast out to Satan; is now among the Sons of Belial, the Children of Wickedness and Ignorance that must be condemned: And this man is now rejected of the Saints, that once was embraced of them, and thus he is punished; for it is the greatest Punishment and Vexation for a man that hath once tasted of God's Love, Mercy, Peace and Blessings, amongst God's People, and to be for∣saken of God, and without his Love, in his Anger, in his Judgment, and in the Curse, amongst the Wicked, without Peace and Blessings amongst the Saints, this is Punishment indeed, from which the Lord deliver all his People that fear him. Yet notwithstanding this kind and manner of Punishment pertains to He∣reticks as such, most properly, and not to be destroyed in Person or Estate by outward Penalties; this I onely mean and intend, where the Error of a man, and his Heresie in his Mind and Judgment doth only extend to the hurt of his own Soul, and against God, and not to the harm of his Neigbours Person or Estate; in that Case he ought only to suffer as before-mentioned, To be de∣livered up to Satan, and to be rejected, &c. But if his Error and Heresie do extend further then onely against God, and his own Soul, even to the wronging, injuring and defrauding of his neighbours person and estate, and outward wrongs, or evils, or violence, or visible mischiefs be committed, as Murders, or other the like visible crimes against men, to the injuring of others, then I forbid not outward external punishments to be corporally inflicted upon the person and estate of such a man; but it ought to be done, and that by Laws of men, provided for the same end; even such a mans Error in such his wrong dealing, may justly and lawfully be punished with death banishment, or penalties, according to the desert of the crime, if his sin and er∣ror be against men, let men deal with him, and punish him accordingly: If his offence and error be onely against God, and his own soul, let God deal with him, and punish him by his wrath in his Conscience, which one day will be ex∣ecuted upon all that err from the Truth, and tribulation and anguish shall be upon his soul that doth evil, as it is written: But it is utterly unlawful, and sin against God, for men to kill, burn, or banish men for the error of their minds and judgments in Spiritual matters, while they do walk just∣ly and truly (as men) in the things pertaining to men, and are not injuri∣ous to the Persons or Estates of any, by reason of such their Error, but they only sin and err against God, and their own Souls, to the hurt thereof, and not man by any outward Punishments or Violence executed upon their Persons, but God
and his People in the way and manner of the Spirit of Christ, as afore de∣clared, ought for such their Errors and Heresies to deal with them, and proceed towards them in respect of Punishment for the same. Lastly, These things are but said in general concerning Error and Heresie, how they are to be judged and Punished, and by whom, and to manifest that there is Error and Heresie, Hereticks and Erroneous Persons in the World; for (as I have said before) it was not now my work to ennumerate the particular parts of Errors and Heresies, that are held in Principle, Doctrine and Practice, in the World at this day, they are so many and large; but yet more particularly, thus I would in brief define Hereticks and Heresie: That man (whatsoever he be) is in Error in all parts of his Principles, and practises, held and maintained by him in point of Religion and Worship of God, especially that is not Perswaded of the Truth and verity of his Way by the holy Spirit of God, and led, guided, and taught in the performance and practice thereof, by the same Spirit of Jesus; if the holy Spirit of God dwell not in him, and doth not preswade the heart in the belief of the Truth, and teach and lead the man in the practice of it; such a man, even that man Errs, and is in Error in all what he is, and what he doth, in point of Religion and Duty to God-wards, and that because the Spirit of Truth and Righteousness is not the only Leader and Teacher in the things pro∣fessed and practised, but either Traditions, Example of others, or Custom of Places and Times, or something else besides the Spirit of God, which only per∣swades into the belief of Truth, and teaches into the performance of the same, and thus is distinguished and known: A man that is Erroneous in his Faith and Pra∣ctice, not taught and perswaded by the Spirit of Christ in what he is, and in what he doth, he is in Error, and in a degree of Heresie, erring in Mind, and Judg∣ment and Conscience, in Principle and practice, and subject to err in all things: Now as for the Case of Error and Heresie, as the matter hath stood (in distinguishing of Hereticks and Heresies, in judging of the same, and in proceeding with Hereticks in the manner aforesaid) for many Generations in the Apostacy, since the Apostles dayes, all this hath been wrong, and not in the Spirit and Power of Christ Jesus, but Men, Cases and Proceedings all have been perverted from Truth in that matter, because the spirit of darkness and ignorance hath ruled (and not the Spirit of God) in the Hearts of men; and the spirit that is not of the Father (which Spirit of the Father is only pure, perfect and infallible, because it is of God, and can truly judge and determine in these Cases) has been Lord and Judge in this matter; and men out of their Envy and Hatred one towards another, have judg'd one another to be erronious and Hereticks, and proceeded against them thereupon; and such as have differ'd in Iudgment or Opinion, one Sect and Sort from another, and would not conform to one another in their Wayes, Practices and Religion; it hath been common for all different sorts of men to cry out one upon ano∣ther, and against each other, Heresie, Heresie, Hereticks, Erronious Persons, and the like; and proceeded against one another, men against men differing from them, and sect against sect contrary to it self, and especially that sect or sort of People that hath had the Government of Nations and Countries in their Power, could, and hath easily proceeded against all others dissenting, upon the account of Error, to the destroying of many, absolutely through envy, hatred and prejudice, and not upon the Truth, Soundness and Verity of Judgment in that matter; and this hath been common for many Ages; Sometimes (according to the occasion offered) Papists have de∣stroyed Protestants, and sometimes Protestants have destroyed the Papists on this account of Heresie and Error: All which proceedings have been in the Enmity and Ignorance, and not in the Power and Life of Jesus; whereby it hath come to pass, that many men hath been destroyed for the cause, of which they have been more innocent then they that have destroyed them:
And thus by false Judgment and cruel proceedings in the matter of Heresie and Error, many have been destroyed unjustly, and the World filled with Enmity about difference in Religious matters, and with Murders and Cruelties, upon the false Judgments of men about Heresie; and this is weighty, to be truly considered, a Case to be lamented and grieved for, by the Righteous: Oh! what strife (in the Christian World) hath been for Ages on this occasion, each sort of People exclaiming against, and persecuting others as Hereticks and seditious persons, onely for difference in Judgment in Spiritual Cases, and each particular person (almost) raging with fury, and intending his Neighbours destruction, and onely for being contrary∣minded in point of Doctrine and Worship. Oh! the view of these things, and woful effects produced in the World for Ages in these occasions, makes my heart grieve, because of the destructions of men, yea, of the destruction of many upon wrongful judgments and proceedings on these occasions: I am troubled, I am troubled; and ever since I have known the Right hand from the Left (in God's matters) my Soul often in the deep search of these things hath cryed out, How woful are they! And when shall it once be, that these things shall be no more in the World, but that every man may sit at rest and quiet with his God in the Way, Faith and Practises of Righteousness, as his heart is perswaded of, and not be tossed with false Judgments, cruel Afflictions, and hard dealing, because of his Judgment and Conscience in the belief and Knowledge of Heavenly Matters? Thus hath my Spirit been framed with zeal against these things; this imposing of Religion by force, these procedings of killing and destroying men upon the account of Heresie; these things my soul hath loathed, and I am weary of them, and my zeal is kindled against them: Oh I when will the Rulers of this World learn Wisdom, and forsake false Judgment and Oppression! And when will it be that they will onely rule and judge for the Lord in their state and compass of Worldly affairs between man and man, in the matters of outward wrongs and injuries! And when will they leave it to the Lord to be Judge, King and Ruler only, in all the Cases of his spiritual Kingdom! Then should it be happy and blessed unto men, unto Kings, and their Subjects, to Rulers and their People, and to all sorts of Persons, if Judgment were onely ascribed unto God, that he only might judge and determine of these Cases, and punish men according to the desert of their Offences of Error; then should it be well with them: But in the mean time, whilst men are judged and supposed to be Herericks, and thereupon sentenced to Death, Banishment, or corporal Pu∣nishment for their (supposed) Errors sake in matters of Iudgment and Con∣science: Tribulation, Misery, Distractions, and wofull Consequence will fol∣low upon that work, to Kings, Rulers and People, in every Nation and Countrey, and no Peace, true Comfort nor Happiness, shall be in the midst of men. And this is the Judgment of the Spirit of God in him who hath obtained favour from God, to receive Knowledge and Understanding in these matters. He that can receive this, let him.
CHAP. III. Concerning Antichrist and his Mystery of Deceiveableness; What he is in himself, and how he appears in the World; what his Works are, and What his Government is, and where it is, and who are the Subjects of his Kingdom. 1. THese things are great Mysteries; and though in the World they are very much abounding, and extant throughout all Nations, yet for the most part unknown unto the World, and not discovered among the sons of men, but secretly hidden, and veiled under false covers, and in much deceivableness dwelling and working upon Earth, in the deep Mysteries of Iniquity, to the deceiving of multitudes of People, who are indeed of Antichrist, among whom he dwells, appears, rules, reigns, and hath his Authority and Government, and yet they know it not, nor do they dis∣cern him in his Wayes and Works, though they are under his Power, and subjects of his Kingdom; such indeed is the Mystery of Antichrist, his hidden, false covered pathes, in which he works, and walks amongst the Sons of men in the World, that he easily beguiles and betrays men, and deceiveth them unto perdition, while yet they know not that they are beguiled and deceived, but think they are altogether well, and do well, and are in the way of Salvation, being led of that wicked one, and blinded by him, and are bewitched into the false faith, and deceivable pretence of goodness, righteousness, holiness and sanctity, as if they were indeed Mem∣bers of the true Church, and Saints of the Most High, and had a right to Eternal Life, and were the very Sons and Servants of the Almighty, wher indeed and in Truth they are yet in the estate of Enmity against God, in the Degeneration and Bondage of Corruption, unconverted, and unsanctified, and Sinners and Ungodly, the very Children of the Devil, and Servants of unrighteousness, and have no assurance nor right unto the Kingdom of God, to rest in his Peace and Glory: Such (I say) is the working of Antichrist, that he appears to be in the World, contrary to what he truly is in his own beeing and nature, and deceives men and People into the apprehensions and conceits of what they are not, even contrary to what they are in their present State and Standing; even so deep and Mysterious is Antichrist in himself, and in his working among the Children of men. 2. That there is such a Man or Spirit in the World as Antichrist, this is not doubtfull, but confessed by all, and proved by the Scriptures; for the Apostle wrot to the Church, They had heard that Antichrist should come, and even now (saith he) are there many Antichrists come into the World, 1 John 2. 18. and also 2 John verse 7. saith he, For many Deceivers are entred into the World, and this is a Deceiver, and an Antichrist, &c. and 2 Thes. 2. the Apostle speaks of the Man of Sin, and of the Son of Perdition, that should be revealed in the World, and should exalt himself above all that is called God: These with many other Scriptures, do prove that there is such a thing in the World, already come into the World, and now dwelling and walking in the World as Antichrist, Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition; and as I said, 'tis confessed by all that there is an Antichrist, such a Man, or Spirit now extant in the World; though there are great Debates and Contenti∣ons amongst many called Christians, what this Antichrist is, and who he is, some holding one thing, and some another about him, and also there
is much Difference amongst men concerning this Matter; and 'tis the ge∣neral way of People, one sort to accuse another, that are different from them in Profession and Religion, That ye and ye are of Antichrist; but this hath been for the most part in Enmity, and in the Spirit of Wrath and Con∣tention, and is not from true Judgment and Knowledge: now therefore it re∣mains to be made manifest, according to the Gift of Grace, Knowledge and Understanding, what Antichrist is in himself, and how he appears in the World; seeing we have proved, That there is such a thing as Antichrist now Ruling and Raigning somewhere amongst men, throughout the Nations of the Earth. 3. Antichrist is not (as some suppose) a particular visible Person up∣on Earth, Distinct and Divided from all other Persons, as if none besides such an one were Antichrist; but Antichrist is rather an Invisible Spirit, a spirit, I say, dwelling in Persons, even in many Persons throughout the World, which makes them all of Antichrist, or to be many Antichrists, according to 1 Iohn 2. 18. There are many Antichrists (saith Iohn) where∣by we know it is the Last Time: So that it is plain, There are in the World many Antichrists, many Men of Sin, or many Sinful Men, many Sons of Perdition and Ungodliness; not onely one man that is such, but many men in the World, even all such in whom the spirit of Antichrist, or Antichrist that spirit dwells and walks, they are all Antichrists, or of Antichrist, because of that spirit of Antichrist which doth possess them, and rule them in the Wayes of Sin and Death, in Idolatry and false Wayes, and in opposition to and against Christ Jesus the Lord of Life; even all the Deceivers in the World, all that are erred from the Spirit and Power of CHRIST, and are not of the true Church, Gathered into his Name and Power, but bringeth another Doctrine than that of Christ and his Saints, and truly confesseth not in Word and Practice unto JESUS come in the Flesh; all such are Antichrists, and of Antichrist, according to 2 Iohn 7. even all the Apostates, who profess Christ, and his Truth, and his Church, and are not in the Spirit and Power of Christ, but in the Form of Godliness, without the Power, professing God in Words, but in Works denying him, all such are Antichrists, by reason of that spirit of An∣tichrist which dwells in them, and into which spirit they are leavened and moul∣ded, and are one with it, and bring forth the Fruits of it in the World; and therefore they are Antichrists, more than one, even many Antichrists, as I have said. 4. Antichrist in himself is the Man of Sin, the Son of Perdition, which is indeed and in Truth the very Devil in his Nature and Kind, and in his Power and Spirit, and of him; and yet not divided, nor distinct from him, but is him (to wit, the DEVIL) as he is in himself: And he is against Christ, and wholy contrary to Christ, and bringeth forth Fruits and Works to the Dishonour of Christ, and opposeth Christ, and is in all things of a contrary Nature and Quality to Jesus Christ. And he is cal∣led Antichrist, to wit, before, or against, and contrary to Christ. And this is Antichrist in himself, An Adversary to God, an Enemy to all Righ∣teousness, a Perverter of the Wayes of God, a Hater of all Good, a Despiser and Persecutor of God's People; and indeed a certain Spirit and Power Distinct, Divided, and Separated from the Living God, and his Son Jesus Christ; and contrary in Nature and Quality, in Fruits and Effects: And there is no Fellowship in any thing between Christ and Antichrist; but they are di∣vided and separated one from the other, contrary and opposite one to the other in all their Wayes and Works, and in their Kinds and Natures: For, as I have said, Antichrist in himself, in his nature and kind, is the Devil, and no other; he is the Man of Sin, the Sinful Man, that conceiveth and
worketh all Evil, the Son of Perdition, the Son that is lost from God, and Reprobate forever; he that is fallen, diverted and cast out from the Presence, Glory and Power of the Creator; he that is sealed unto Vengeance in the Wrath and Enmity against God and Christ Jesus, as being contrary irreconcilably to the Nature and Works of Christ. This is said of Antichrist, as what he is in himself, as that particular spirit, and not of the many Antichrists, which are only Vessels retaining this one spirit, and Members of him, through his Power dwelling in them, and by which they are one with this spirit, and one in Action, and bring forth the Works and Fruits of it: For 'tis possible, some that are such in their present stan∣ding, even under the power of Antichrist, may be converted and turned from him, and changed into another Nature, and so saved: But as for the Antichrist in himself, as such, he is the Devil, and sealed up in the Anger of God, never to be redeemed, nor saved, nor changed into another Nature. 5. Though Antichrist in himself be the Devil, yet his Appearances in the World are divers and many; and he appears in outward and visible Actions a∣mongst men diversly; somtimes he appears in the way and form of open Prophane∣ness, by the Works of Men, in all manner of Unrighteousness and Iniquity; for all Sin, of what kind soever, in every appearance of it, is of the Devil and Antichrist, even all prophane Wayes and Works of Evil Men; Lying, Drunkenness, Whore∣dom, Double-dealing, Envy, Malice, and every Evil Work and Word brought forth by the Sons of Adam in the Fall, are all of Antichrist and the Devil, and is his visible Ap∣pearance in the World; though sometimes his Appearance is in another way and manner, even in a way of seeming Righteousness and Holiness, and in the Professi∣on of Christ and Christianity, and pretence of Faith towards God, and Worship of God, and crying up Church and Fellowship in the same, and Forms of Godliness; as if Antichrist were a Saint and Servant of God: thus, and after this manner doth Antichrist appear in the World amongst men now in these latter dayes, since the Apostles time, in the Apostacy of Christianity. Antichrist (I say) though the Devil in himself, yet hath he often appeared as a Saint upon Earth, in the pre∣tence of Holiness, Righteousness, Worship and Religion; such hath been his Policy and Deceivableness, that he hath put on the Appearance of Gospel, Doctrine, Ministry and Ordinances, and covered himself thereby, that he might the better beguile, entangle, and deceive Mankind in the Form and Profession of a Saint, and Member of the true Church; he hath put on the Sheep's-Clothing, hath made use of the Saints words and Practices, and hath exalted himself in the Temple of God, as if he were God, shew∣ing himself to be God, and hath been lifted up above all that is called God, ac∣cording to 2 Thes. 2. 4. and Christ himself said to his Disciples, That there should arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and should shew Signs and Wonders, if it were pos∣sible to deceive the very Elect, Mat. 24. 24, which doth signifie, that the Antichrists and false Prophets should come into the World after his Prophecy, which are al∣ready come since that time: They should pretend to be Christs, and should shew Signs, and should deceive many with the Profession of Christ, and Signs of Godliness; and they should have upon them and be covered with Sheep's-Clothing, that is, with the Saints words and practices in outward appearance; but inwardly, that is, in their own proper Nature, Fruits and Works, should be ravening Wolves; that is, Destroyers of the Flock, Mat. 7. 15. and the Antichrists which Iohn speaks (1 Iohn 2. 19.) they were such as went from the Saints that were in the Power of Godliness, they went out of the true Church, and carried with them the Form of Righteousness and Truth, and the Professi∣on of Christianity, but without the Power, and had lost it, and were departed from the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Antichrist had possessed them, and now led them and ruled them, and they were Antichrists (to wit) against him, and contrary to him: And these were the false Prophets and Deceivers, that went out into the World, and deceived it, and led many aside into Error, and many followed their pernitious and hurtful wayes, as Peter saith, 2 Pet. 2. 2, 3. And Paul speaks of such as had the Form
of Godliness, but denyed the Power; and in Words professed God, but in Works denyed him: Such were the Antichrists and Deceivers in the Apostles dayes, and such they are this day in the World; whereby it is manifest that Antichrist often appears in the World as a Saint, as a Righteous one; and the many Antichrists they have gotten the Form and Appearance of Church, Ministry, Worship and Ordinances; and thus they appear deceiving the World, and them that dwell therein, with the Appearance and Vain-shew of Faith, Worship and Religion, without the Power of Godliness; for unto that Antichrist is an Enemy, even a Destroyer, a Persecutor, and Gainsayer of Christ and his Works, and the Power of Godliness and true Faith brought forth by the Spirit of Christ, though to deceive the World he can transform himself into, and appear as an Angel of Light. 6. Again, So Deceivable and Mysterious is, and hath the Appearance and Working of Antichrist been in the World, that he hath not alwayes dwelt in one kind of Form and Profession of Religion and Righteousness; but he hath dwelt in many Appearances, and removed out of one false Form into another, according to his Oportunity and Advantage, whereby he could deceive; and sometimes dwelling in one Form, with pretence of Zeal, and performance of Duty to God, he hath envyed, Persecuted and destroyed many others in other Wayes of Profession, more Zealous, Upright and Sincere to God than them∣selves have been in the other Form; and by the colour of Zeal and Perfor∣mance of Duty hath Antichrist clothed himself in his Envies, Persecutions and Murders of others, as if he did not persecute nor impose upon the Consci∣ence of any, nor exercise that Rigour (or Justice, as he hath named his Pro∣ceedings, though never so Cruel and Unjust) towards any, upon any terms or account of Wrath, Bitterness, Envy, or Cruelty, but Zeal, Duty, and Love to Religion, and to entinguish Heresie, &c. This hath been the Pretence and Cloak of Antichrist in his cruel and hard Dealing with many men that have differed in Principle and Practice of Religion; he hath often shewed him∣self in his present Form of Godliness, so zealous and dutiful for the truth of his Way (though never so Idolatrous) against all that have opposed it, and gainsayed his Form and Vain Shew, that he hath killed, slain, and exer∣cised Cruelty towards all that have been contrary or different-minded: and though this hath been brought forth by Antichrist, as he is the Devil in him∣self, and in down-right Envy, Malice, Persecution and Wickedness; yet it hath been acted and effected under the Cloak of Zeal, Duty, and Sincerity, and out of Pretence of Love to Christ and his Church, and out of Pretence of Hatred against the contrary. Thus hath Antichrist (though the Devil, that Wicked One, as he is in himself, in his own Nature, Kind and proper Sphear) appeared in the World as a Zealous Church-Member, as a Saint, as a Promoter of Righteousness, and a Destroyer of the contrary: With these false Covers hath Antichrist been cloathed and hidden from men, and ap∣peared to be in his Works and Transactions, as a Good Man, as a Lover of God, and Hater of Iniquity, while in the mean time he hath been deceiving Men, and destroying the Innocent, and leading the World to perpetual Mise∣ry and Destruction. 7. Again, So Deceivable hath the spirit of Antichrist been in the World, that he hath alwayes put the Name of Christ, and the Name of his Church, and the Pretence of Duty to God, and the Name of Gospel, Doctrine, Or∣dinances, Ministry and Worship upon whatsoever False Way, Feigned Wor∣ship and Deceitful Profession, that he hath gone about to set up and promote in the World among men: I say, Upon the Worst and most Idolatrous Wayes of Superstition, and the most false, Feigned Formal Worship that ever hath been in the World, Antichrist hath put the Name of Christ, his Church and Worship upon them; and Imposed and forced the Belief and Practice of much false Worship, false Doctrine and formal Wayes, under the Name and Title of the true Christ, his Doctrine and Worship; and upon Pains and Penalties
hath enjoyned and commanded the Belief and Practice of such things, not as if they were of Antichrist, Superstitious, Evil, False or Feigned; but as if they were of Christ altogether, and must be believed and practiced, as by his Name, and under his Authority: Thus hath been the working of the Mystery of Iniquity of that Man of Sin, the Antichrist; all the Evil Wayes he hath conceived and brought forth in the World; all the Idolatrous Wor∣ship, and false Faith, and Doctrine, and all the Cruelties Murders and Unjust Dealing, to the very destroying of the Saints, and all the Unrighteousness and Deceivableness exercised by Antichrist in the World, hath put all this on the Name of Christ, and pretended Christ for it, as if it were indeed and in Truth of him and from him, when indeed and in Truth it hath been contrary to the true Christ, and tended to kill and destroy him: Thus hath Antichrist the Devil been cloaked with false Covers and deceitful Pretences in his working among men; that wicked spirit hath falsly called the greatest of Pride and Ambi∣tion, Decency and true Honour; Covetousness and Deceitful Dealing hath he stiled, Good—Husbandry and Prudent-Walking; and the most Cruel and Unjust Iudgment, the Oppression of the Poor, and the Grinding of the Face of the Innocent, hath that spirit fals∣ly titled Equal Proceedings, Iustice, and according to Law, and the like: Yea, and the Persecutions and Murders that ever have been acted against the Saints of God in all Generations, though Cruel and Unrighteous, and of the Devil, yet all this hath An∣tichrist titled to be in Honour to Christ, and for the destroying Hereticks, and out of Iustice and Zeal for God, and such like: yea, and the most Gross Idolatries, and most Deceitful Wayes of Worship that ever hath been set up in the World, have been named after Christ, and pretended to be done in Honour to him, and for his Glory, and so forth; so deceivable hath Antichrist been in the World, and walked and wrought among the Sons of Men in deceiving of them, that he hath used and taken upon him the very Name of Christ; and all his Evil Works of Iniquity of all kinds, hath he put the Name and Honour of Christ upon them, and so deceived the World by his false Wayes, Worships, Doctrines and Persecutions, through covering these things with the Name of Christ, and pretending his Honour and Exaltation, whenas his own true Nature and Property is to kill Christ, and gainsay him. And this indeed is Antichrist, who under colour and pretence of Worshipping and Honouring Christ doth seek to Slay him: This is that Crafty and Deceitful Fox, that Man of Sin that hath been exal∣ted, that Antichrist that Wicked One, that hath deceived the World for many Ages; But the Lord is now discovering him, and destroying him by the Breath of his Mouth, and by the Brightness of his Coming, according to the Faithful Promise of God in his Servants; and Antichrist shall be discovered and destroyed; the Day of the Lord is at hand upon him. 8. Again, It hath been the way of Antichrist, that he might the better deceive the World, to transform himself into the likeness of the best Way, and strictest Profession of Religion, and so to remove from one Way and Form unto another, as I said before, that he might the better deceive men, according as Paul writ, 2 Cor. 11. verse 13, 14. for such are false Apostles, de∣ceitful Workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ; and no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an ANGEL of LIGHT; by which it is plain, That Antichrist did change and transform him∣self, and remove from one Way to another, even till he appeared as an Angel of Light, and in the very Way and Form of the Ministry of Righteousness; Thus did Antichrist work and transform himself in the dayes of the Apostles, and ever since unto this day in all Times and Ages; for it hath been his manner and way, when he could no longer co∣ver himself, nor be hid in such a Way of Worship and Religion, in which he hath sometimes dwelt and walked, but that his Wickedness, Cruelties, Persecutions and Deceits must needs be seen, and made appear unto men by the Light of the Lord shining amongst them, then he hath transformed
into another likeness, and removed his cruelties and persecutions into another form and appearance; it may be into the very way (in the outward prosession and practice of it) in which sometime the Lord hath dwelt and walked, and there hath he dwelt deceiving the World by his new form and appearance, and exercised his wickedness, cruelties and persecutions, in some new way, having quitted the Last Form in which he dwelt, because he was there too publikly seen and discovered: And now in his new likeness into which he is Transformed, he can plead the example of Saints; they did such things, and held such Doctrines, and Performed such Practises as now he is found in; and this did the Devil sometime to Christ, he pleaded Scripture against him: And thus Antichrist can Change himself into divers appearances, that he may deceive men: Well, but and if he be again discovered, and his cruelties and wickedness made appear in his Last and Newest Form, he can transform again into a more strict Way and zealous Performance, even into an Angel of Light, as if he were indeed the true Christ, and were in the Truth altogether, and no man needed to doubt of the Truth of his Way; and then under that Form, being covered with more Zeal then ever, with more pre∣tence of Duty to God then before, he blinds the World, and deceives them, and leads men to Perdition; and though changeable in his Appearance, yet is he in himself Antichrist still, in his own proper nature a Murderer, Destroyer, and a Fountain of Mischief and Evil. The Truth of this is plain, if it be considered through the course of Scriptures in Generations past, and Transactions of Time, as in the Prophets dayes of old, this spirit (which is no other but the Devil) sometimes opposed, gain∣sayed, and persecuted the Prophets, reproached them, and with-stood them, and imprisoned them, and killed them. And sometimes we find the same spi∣rit transformed it self into the way of the Prophets, and acted by some decei∣vers and false Prophets, in the same words and practices which the true Prophets had said and done; and as the true Prophets used their Tongues, and said, The Lord saith it; so the false Prophets (in whom the Devil was transformed) they used their Tongues, and said, The Lord saith it (also) when God had not spo∣ken to them: So here was this spirit of Antichrist changing and transforming himself, that he might the better deceive. Also, in the dayes of Christ and his Apostles the Devil and Antichrist apear∣ed against them, and persecuted them, and killed them, and used Cruelty and Injustice towards them; and (as before I said) this was done to Christ and his Apostles by the wicked Iews, under colour and pretence of Love to their God, and Zeal for their Law, and for the Honour of their Ordinances and Priesthood, which they supposed Christ and his Apostles made void: which shews, That the Devil and Antichrist appears in the World as a good Man; as a Lover of God, and his Laws, and the like. Well, But though the Envious Men and Wicked Persons (through the spirit of the Devil) did for some time oppose, gainsay and persecute Christ and his Apostles, yet the same spirit (possibly some of the same Persons) transformed into the Profession of Christ, and into the Profession of the Words and Works of Him and his Apostles: For we find Envious men, and Wicked men, such as had persecuted Christ, and killed him, were gotten to preach him in words, and had gotten and taken upon them the Form of Christ's Doctrine, and preached him out of Envy, and for Self-ends, and the like: So that 'tis plain, The same spirit that sometime opposed and persecuted the Prophets, Christ, and his Apo∣stles, other times was transformed into the Profession of the Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles words: And this is the way of Antichrist to deceive men upon Earth, and to lead them to Perdition; For when the Devil and Antichrist perceives that his Envy, Malice and Cruelty cannot prevail to subdue and keep under the Way and Truth of Christ Jesus, as it appears in the World, then he transforms into the Likeness and formal appearance of the Way of the Lord and
his Truth; and when the Devil cannot kill Christ so, but that Christ will rise again, appear, and live for ever, contrary to all the malice and enmity of the Devil; then, (rather then he will submit to be no more) he will transform himself, and take upon him the Name of Christ, of his Honour and Glory, and profess him in words, and seem a Friend to Christ and his Kingdom: And this he doth, that he may live still in the World, and by deceiveableness beguile the sons of men into perpetual destruction. 9. And the very work of Antichrist this day in the World, is to deceive, beguile, seduce and betray the World and all mankind; 'tis his only work and calling, as I may say, to deceive; 'tis his nature and property to work deceitfully; and thus it ever was with him, it hath been his Property and his Work in all Ages, and in every Age since the beginning of the World, to deceive and beguile, to lead men from God, and to lead them into Perdition: this I say hath ever been his work in the World, and by the means aforesaid, (to wit) by transforming and changing himself into the likeness of Righteousness and Verity, and put∣ting the pretence of Goodness, Vertue and Holiness upon his Actions and Do∣ings, though never so evil and unrighteous, he hath always, I say, by this means, and in this way deceived the World, by appearing as a Saint, as a Well-doer; as an Angel of Light, pretending Wisdom, Righteousness and Vertue, and colouring his Deeds thereby, as is proved in the Case of the first deceiving of Eve; What said Satan to the Woman? Not that I am such a one, and do intend to deceive thee with Falsity; but, Thou shalt be as God; Thou shalt be wise of thy self, and know, and be, and do as God: Here was a fair pretence, by which he deceived the Woman. And the false Prophets and false Apostles in the dayes of old, did not de∣ceive the World into an absolute denial of God, and Christ, and Truth, but did deceive them into the false Profession of the same, holding out the Form of Godliness without the Power; and by feigned words, and good Speeches, did deceive the hearts of the Simple; and by false Doctrine, and Ordinances, and Form of Religion, did the Antichrist deceive the World, in dayes past, as he doth at this day: For if he did appear to be as he is in his own nature and property, a Devil, Deceiver, and wicked one, a Leader to Perdition and Destruction, and should vindicate himself as such, and entice and tempt People as such; then none would believe him, nor follow his Wayes, for none would willingly be destroyed. But he appears not as such in the World, but alwayes transforms him∣self into the Likeness of God and Goodness, still pretending the same: And by this means is he more capable to deceive mankind; for he can∣not so readily deceive and lead men to Perdition, in his own proper Na∣ture, if he appear as he is such; but therefore he appears contrary to what his own nature is, and transforms himself. And thus doth Antichrist deceive the Christian World (so called) at this day, even by his false Wayes of Religion, false Worship, false Doctrine, false Humi∣lity, false Faith, and false Church, pretending Zeal and Sanctity, and such like: Herein, and hereby (generally) doth Antichrist that Man of Sin, deceive and beguile the World unto Perdition and Destruction. Oh! how many thou∣sands of Peoples, of Nations and Countries are at this day deceived on this wise, thinking they are in the Truth, and true Way of Religion, Faith and Worship, professing and performing these things with much Zeal, as if they were indeed the wayes and Ordinances of Christ, when as they are but false, feigned, formal, and of Antichrist, and deceivable to the souls of men, even Shews without Substance; Forms without Life and Power; of Antichrist, and not of the true Christ. And thus, and after this manner, with the very likeness of Righteousness, and appearance of Godliness, and profession of Faith and duty to God, hath Antichrist deceived the World, and doth at this day delude Nations, to the perdition of thousands: And Antichrist
doth not generally deceive men in his works and appearance as he is in his own Proper Nature; but in his appearance and works transformed and changed into another likeness, even into the likeness of Truth and Righteousness: By this means and way Satan, Antichrist, and that Man of Sin, doth delude and deceive the Nations of the World. 10. What the Works of Antichrist are, by what is said, doth partly appear: His Works are all deceivableness, to deceive and delude the World, to lead mankind captive in the wayes of sin and death, unto the destruction of their souls, and to be cruel and hard-hearted, envious, malicious and perverse, a hater and persecutor of goodness and good men, and to murder and work wickedness, to do all evil, and to oppose, gain-say and deny all good: This in general is the work of Antichrist; though as to particulars I now intend not to mention, saving as I have before shewed, to impose upon Conscience in Religious matters, by outward force and violence, is a main principle work of Antichrist; and to kill and destroy Persons on the account of Heresie and Error, and to use violence, and cruel impositions in Spiritual Cases, contrary to the Spirit of Christ Jesus. These are works and wayes of Antichrist, which he brings forth in the World, as also the promoting of all the false and Idola∣trous Worships, and false Church-Governments in the World; and in short, every evil work and word brought forth amongst the sons of men, are the Works of the Devil and Antichrist, which he seduceth the World into the working and doing of; and to consider the state of the World as it is at this day, and how it is deceived in many grievous and abominable wayes of Error, Superstitions, Idolatries and Wickedness, it makes the hearts of the Righte∣ous sad and mournful, because of the deceivableness of the working of the Mystery of Iniquity, of Antichrist, that Man of Sin in the World, who deceiveth Mankind with the appearance and shew of godliness, and leads the Children of Men in the wayes of Ignorance, Death, Blindness and Error, yet holds them under a false pwerswasion of safety and security, as if they were in the right way, and walked in the pathes of Happiness, when indeed and in Truth they are beguiled and deceived, and nigh unto the pathes of per∣dition. Oh! how hath Antichrist prevailed in these latter Dayes, since the dayes of the Apostles, and deceived the World with the very Formal Profession and practice of such Doctrines and Things as the Apostles held and Pra∣ctised in the Power of God in their dayes: But now Antichrist he holds the Form in his False Spirit, and hath the appearance and likeness of Righteous∣ness, Truth, Faith and Worship, without the Power of God, even like∣ness of the things that the Apostles and Saints held in the Power of God: And hereby is the World deceived, though Antichrist hath taught them to Plead Scriptures, and Prove by Scriptures, t the Apostles did the same things, and held the same Profession; yet being now held and professed out of the Power of God, and not in the same Spirit that the Apostles were in, 'tis but of Antichrist, and deceivable, and leads captive the souls of men into destruction. Oh therefore that the World, and all that dwel therein, would consider the danger of that deceivable Spirit of Antichrist, and how he deceiveth mankind, and would turn from him, and forsake the wayes and works of Antichrist, that they may be saved, and not destroyed. Oh! all ye called Christians, 'tis time to consider what Spirit ye are of, and what Spirit leads you, and how ye may escape his delusions; for the Day of the Lord is come, and he is gathering People out of the wayes of Antichrist, and set∣ting them free from his cruel Bonds, to serve the Lord in Liberty and Freedom of the Spirit of Christ Jesus; and blessed are all they that witness this, where Christ reigns, and Antichrist is subdued with his works and fruits, and discover∣ed and destroyed by the Spirit of the Lord, and the brightness of his Coming, who comes to judge the World in Righteousness and Truth.
11. These things are said in general of Antichrist; Now it remains to be shewed, What the Government of Antichrist is in it self, and where it is in beeing, and who the Subjects of his Kingdom are. That Antichrist the Man of Sin hath a Government, a Kingdom, a Power, an Authority, a Rule and a Dominion (which is indeed his Government) this is not doubtful to any, but acknowledged by all; but what this Kingdom and Govern∣ment is many are Ignorant. Now the Kingdom and Government of Antichrist is not the Government and Authority of some particular man, in some particular Countrey and Nation upon Earth, distinct from all other persons and Nations, as if such a particuler visible Kingdom and Authority, were An∣tichrist's Government, and none besides: But the Authority, Kingdom and Government of Antichrist is more invisible, more hidden, as it were more spiritual and undiscernable unto the sons of men, then any visible, outward Kingdom is: And indeed, the Kingdom of Antichrist is the Authority and Power of Spiritual Wickedness, of Spiritual invisible Iniquity, or the Rule and Dominion of the Son of Perdition, of the Man of Sin, exercised in the hearts and Spirits of all ungodly men: This is the Kingdom and Government of Antichrist, an Authority of Spiritual Wickedness, a Power of the Mystery of Iniquity, and of invisible prevailing of the Son of Perdition in, and over the hearts of the Sons of men; not onely of one person, or in one Nation or Kingdom of the World, but in all sinful persons, and over all Nations of the Earth; Antichrist's Government is such throughout Kingdoms of this World, even a Spiritual Power of Wickedness, a Dominion and Authority of the Mystery of Iniquity, ruling and raigning in the hearts of many men, even of all sinful men, of all unjust men of all unconverted men through all Nations in the World: So that it may not truly be said, that Antichrist's King∣dom and Government is onely the particular Authority of any particular man, in a particular Nation of the Earth, and all others (Men and Nations) are free; but it is (as I have said) the Authority, Power and Rule of the Spirit of Wickedness, of the Mystery of Iniquity, in the hearts of all evil men, in all Na∣tions through the World. And this is truly the Kingdom of Antichrist in it self. 12. This Government is placed and set up, and chiefly the place and beeing of it, is (not only in all Nations at large, but) in the Hearts, even in particu∣lar Hearts of the Sons of men, in the Heart and Inward Parts of man, is the place where Antichrist's Government is; his Authority, Power and Dominion is in the Hearts of the Ungodly, in the inward Parts of Transgressors; in the Heart Antichrist (that Man of Sin) dwells and works, according as it is written, 2 Thess. 2. 9, 10. speaking of the Man of Sin, Whose coming is after the working of Satan with all lying Wonders, and with all Deceivableness of Uurighteousness in them that perish: His dwelling and working is in them that perish, in the Un∣godly, in the Hypocrites, in all aters, in all false Worshippers: Thus it is manifest, That the Government of Antichrist is in the Heart, not only to one man in some Nations, but in the Hearts of all such men mentioned in all the Kingdoms of the World, even the Mystery of Iniquity, the spiritual Wickedness, the authority and power of that spirit that is against Christ, and contrary to him (which is the Rule, Kingdom and Government of Antichrist) dwelleth and worketh in the hearts of the Sons of men, even like as Christ Jesus dwelleth and walketh in his Saints, as it is written, so accordingly doth Antichrist dwell and walk in all that are the Subjects of his Kingdom: Yet notwithstanding, the Government of An∣tichrist is in the hearts of men, originally there, as having got dominion and Power over the seed of God, and placed it self in the heart, which is its seat, and where Christ should reign, yet the Government of Antichrist is not so spiri∣tual, so hidden and invisible in the heart, but that it appears outwardly and visi∣bly in the actions and fruits of men; so that the outward actions and works of men are  and sinted with the spirit of Antichrist, and his government apaears visible in Antichristian Ways and Works brought forth by men; the Sinfulness of men,
the Hypocrisies of men, the Idolatries of men, and the false Principles and Do∣ctrines of men, which appear visibly, are the Works of Antichrist, and his Go∣vernment stands in these things, in these Works he Governs men; and to the doing of them, he leads and rules men by his authority and power, which is in the Hearts of men. And thus Antichrist's Government appears visible and out∣ward, and is in the outward Actions and Works of men to be seen in the World, as well as the working of his Power and Authority is in the Heart inwardly. And also, Antichrist's Government is extended not only, as first, dwelling and working in the Hearts of the Ungodly; nor secondly, as over the Works of men particularly; but over the Governments of many Nations and Coun∣tries in general is Antichrist's Power and Rule extended, so that the Govern∣ments of the World are leavened and tasted with Antichristian-power and autho∣rity in many Nations; even the spirit of Antichrist hath possessed many hearts, many Works, and not only so, but many Governments amongst men; and this hath appeared and broken forth visible in all the works of Unrighteousness, Injustice, Oppressions and Persecutions brought forth in Worldly Government; for so much as hath been brought forth in any Government, in any Nation, at any time of Unrigh∣teousness, Injustice, Oppression, Idolatry, false Worship and Persecutions, and of any othor Evils, even so much of Antichrist's kingdom, government and power hath been in that Kingdom and Government: and that Kingdom and Government wheresoever, in what Nation and Country soever, hath been Antichristian, even in so much and by so much as Injustice, Wickedness, Cruelty, Persecution, or any Acts of Sin and Wickedness have been, or are brought forth into action in that Government. And thus it is mani∣fest, what, and where Antichrist's Government is; Now I shall briefly shew, Who the Subjects of his kingdom are. 1. All the ungodly unrighteous and unconverted Persons in general throughout the World are the Subjects of Antichrist's kingdom; all the Sons of fallen Adam in Trans∣gression, all that are in the first Birth, in degeneration, in the alienation and separation from God, even all that are wicked, and do wickedly, that are in the Enmity against Christ, and unholy, unsanctified and unregenerate, these are a of Antichrist's kingdom, Subjects of it, and Servants to it, and it rules in them, and over them, and Antichrist is their Ruler in all these their wicked wayes, and in this their present state and condition. 2. All Hypocrites, that profess God in words, and in Works deny him; that make a shew of Religion and Worship, when their Hearts are far from the Lord; that with their Mouthes profess much Love to God, and with their Lips honour him, but are departed from his Fear, and stand not in his Counsel; all such are Subjects of the Goverments of Anti∣christ, even all false-hearted and dissembling Hypocrites, that profess more of God then they know of him by the operation of his Spirit; that have an outward conformity in appearance of Worship and duty to God-wards, and their hearts are not conformed to the Power of God, by his Spirit, all such are of the government of Antichrist, and his king∣dom and power dwells in them, and they are under the dominion thereof. 3. All Idolaters, false Worshippers, Hereticks and erronious Persons; such as cry up Church and Ministry, and profess Faith and Godliness, and yet are not guided by the Spirit of Christ, nor led of it into all Truth, these are Subjects of the aforesaid Go∣vernment of Antichrist, even all they that are sensually-minded, and have not the Spirit of Christ guiding them in the Way of Righteousness and Truth, who are not converted, and born again, and renewed into the Image and Likeness of Christ Iesus; and yet practice Holiness, and Duty to God-wards in outward appearance; and are in the profession of the words of Christ, and his Prophets and Apostles, but have not the same Spirit and Power of the Lord Iesus Christ, as the Prophes and Apostles had; these are covered with Sheep's-Clothing, and profess Christ and his words, but are against Christ, and contrary to him in kind and nature; and all such are of the government of Anti∣christ, and he governs them, and rules over them. 4. All Backsliders, and them that have forsaken the right Way of the Lord; all that are turned against the Truth of God, which once they knew and believed, and were convinced of, and sometimes professed, these are all Subjects of Antichrist's raign
and authority, even all the Unfaithful and False-hearted, who are treacherous to God and men, and unconstant & unchangeable, Time-servers & Hypocrites, who have denyed Christ before men, and turned against him, and his Saints, such are under Satans power, and he works in their hearts, and Antichrist deceives them, and they are under his power and dominion, and are Subjects of his government. 5. All Persecutors of the Saints, all violent and cruel Men, all that persecute such as are contrary-minded to themselves, are of Antichrist, and Subjects of his kingdom; even all that kill, and burn and destroy for difference of Faith and Religion, who themselves profess Love to God and his Way, and yet will persecute others, and destroy them by cruel dealing, and that would not suffer any to live but themselves, and will not do to others as they would be done unto; but hate the Neighbour, and per∣secute Brother, and impose upon his Conscience in things against good Conscience, and are violent Doers; all such men are Subjects to Antichrist's kingdom in all Nations throughout the World. Therefore let all consider, This is the Day of the Lord, God will discover and destroy Antichrist and his kingdom; let the Wicked and Un∣godly turn from his evil way, lest God destroy him with perpetual Destruction. Lastly, 'Tis the Property of such who are Subjects of Antichrist's kingdom, to profess and cry up much of Christ in words, of what he said and did, of his Life, of his Death, of what he hath been, and what he shall be, and do deny the present enjoyment of Christ, to that Antichrist is an Enemy; he can well away with it to speak of Christ at a distance, but he cannot bear it if any hold forth a present enjoyment of Christ; That Christ takes away sin, and forgives it, and that his Blood cleanseth from it, and that he is the Iustifier, and Redeemer and Saviour; the Profession of all this in words from the Letter without, and that they are things true in themselves Antichrist can bear and make a shew of in Profession; but if any of the Saints of God do wit∣ness these things, and shall testifie in the Power of the Lord the enjoyment of these things, and that they are at present in this Life possessed (to wit) Christ now lives in us, and is come, and his Blood hath clensed from sin, and he hath forgiven it, and he hath justified, redeemed and saved: I say, if any do witness these things in present enjoy∣ment, and that they are now in this present time witnessed in the Spirit of Christ, and not onely professed from the Letter without, but experienced by the Work of God within; Antichrist opposeth this, and gainsayes present enjoyment: And such in∣deed are Subjects of Antichrist's kingdom, who have the profession of Christ in words, but no present enjoyment of him, but want his Nature, and are in the Nature con∣trary to him, and feed upon Reports of things done by him without, and upon the expectations of what he shall do hereafter, and in this present state are without Christ, and are Sinners and Transgressors against the Life of Righteousness, unconver∣ted and unregenerated by Christ; all such as these are the Subjects of Antichrist's king∣dom. And as concerning the Rise and Fall of Antichrist, the Beginning and Ending of his Kingdom; these things in season may be declared, if God permit. E. B.
A Hue-and-Cry AFTER THE FALSE PROPHETS AND DECEIVERS Of Our AGE: And a DISCOVERY of them by their WORKS and FRUITS; And who they are in this Age that follow the same spirit, and act the same things, as did the false Prophet in former Gene∣rations. FOrasmuch as in the World at this day, and through all Christian Nations, there is a great Cry concerning False Prophets and Deceivers, each one Sort and Sect of People accusing and charging the Teachers and Ministers that are of others, and not of their Way, to be Deceivers and false Prophets: Thus the Papists cry against the Protestant Ministers, and the Protestant Mini∣sters do the like by the Papists, each one sort of people cryes the like against the Ministers of the others. And without all controversie, there are in the Christian-World (so called) and in these Kingdoms, many false Prophets and Deceivers even at this day, and hath been for many Ages since the dayes of the Apostles: And the World, and Nations and Multitudes have been deceived into the way of Error through the means of the Deceivers, who have done much Hurt in the World by their Divinations and Antichristian-wayes that they have walked in: But though it is acknowledged by all sorts of Christians, That there are and have been many Deceivers and false Prophets; yet the great Controversie is at this day, Who are the Deceivers and false Prophets? seeing (as I have said) that every sort of Men are accusing others to be such: But now it remains to be sought out [and that carefully by all] who are the Deceivers and false Prophets? whether Papists Ministers, or Protestant Ministers, or whether any others? and who such are in this day? Now therefore for this very End, that it may be made manifest unto all, who the Deceivers are, and that they may be turned from, and their Wayes eschew∣ed by all People; thus I try them, and bring them to right and true Judgment, and shall not charge the Papists, the Protestants, or any others, by their Name, or because of their Name, that therefore they are Deceivers: But seeing that
all sorts of Christians do profess the Scriptures, and that they own them; Therefore according to the Scriptures, and by the Spirit of God, I shall lay both Papists, and Protestants, and all others to the Line of Judgment by the Rule of Scriptures, and the Spirit that gave them; and if Papists, Protestants, or whose Ministers soever come under the Judgment of that Rule, they shall be con∣cluded by the Rule of the Spirit of God and the Scriptures, to be false Pro∣phets and Deceivers. Therefore come out Papists, Protestants, Anabaptists, Quakers, and all others; come forth and hear your Tryal, and receive your Judgment. First of all, It is concluded (and that I hope by all reasonable men) That whosoever they are at this day through the World, whether Papists or Prote∣stants (so called) or whoever, that shall be found walking by the same spirit, and in the same Wayes, and doing the same things that the false Prophets of Israel did in the dayes of old, and that the false Brethren and false Teachers among the Churches of the Christians in the Apostles dayes walked in and fol∣lowed, such may at this day be adjudged, deemed and taken to be false Pro∣phets and false Teachers; Deceivers and Seducers, and this without respect to any Name or Title whatsoever that they bear in their Religion. And this is the Rule of Tryal and Judgment, in which I may Justly and Righteously proceed. 1. They were false Prophets and Deceivers in the dayes of the true Prophets, Isa. 56. 11. That were Greedy Dumb Dogs; which could never have enough; and that sought every one of them for their Gain from their Quarter; and that Preached for Hire, and Divined for Money, Mic. 3. 11. The Priests that Taught for Hire, and the Pro∣phets that Divined for Money; against such as these Isaiah and Micah cryed, and that by the Spirit of the Lord, being commanded of him so to do. Now whosoever, whether Papists or Protestants of any sort, Independents, Presbyterians, Quakers, or any other, that have a Quarter, from whence they seek their Gain for Preaching, and Teach for Hire, and have Hire for Teach∣ing, (viz.) Tythes, or Sums of Money, and Divine for Money; such, what∣soever they be, without respect of their Names or Professions, walk by the same spirit, and in the same way, and do the same things as the false Prophets did, and are false Prophets and Deceivers. And therefore all People, it is left to the Witness of God in your Con∣sciences, and that you may give Witness in this Case, who are they now, and where they are that can never have enough, but are greedy after Gain, and Covetous, and that seek for Gain from their Quarters, or Portions of a Coun∣try or City? and where are they now, and who is it that Preach for Hire, and Divine for Money, that take so much Money or Gifts by the Year or Moneth for Preaching? who is it, or who are they now that walk in these Wayes? such, whoever they be, whether Papists, Protestants, Sectaries (so called) are false Pro∣phets and Deceivers. 2. They were false Prophets and Deceivers, That stood not in the Counsel of the Lord, and that did not turn People from their Iniquities and Evil Wayes; but spake a Vision of their own Hearts, and not from the Mouth of the Lord: And that cryed Peace to them that walked Wickedly, and Prophesied Lyes, and used their Tongues, and said, The Lord saith it, whenas the Lord had not spoken to them; and that se∣duced the People by crying Peace, when there was no Peace; and saw Vanity, and spok Vanity and Lyes in the dayes of the true Prophets: I say, such were false Prophets and Deceivers. Now whosoever, whether Papists, or Protestants, or any others, that do not stand in the Counsel of God, and that do not turn People from their Iniquities, and their Evil Wayes; but speak a Vision of their own Hearts, and not from the Mouth of the Lord; and that cry Peace to them that walk wickedly, that prophecy Lyes, and use their Tongues, when the Lord hath not spoken to them; and that seduce People by crying Peace, when there is no Peace; and
that builds the Wall, and daubs it with untempered Mortar, and that do not Pro∣fit the People at all, but cause them to err; Such are false Prophets and Decei∣vers at this day, wheresoever and whosoever (without respect of Name or Title in their Profession) Such now walk by the spirit of the false Prophets, and are in the way of the Deceivers, which the Lord sent true Prophets to cry against. And now to all People of what Name soever, it is left to the Witness of God in you all to give witness, who they are now, and where they are that are guilty hereof. Who is it now that stand not in the Counsel of God, and that do not turn People from their Iniquities, that do not convert them to God by their preaching, But speak what they have studied for, even a Divination of their own Brain, and not what they have received from God; and that use their tongues, and take other mens words, the Words of Christ, the Prophets and Apostles; when as they have not the same Spirit of Christ and his Apo∣stles; Nor have they heard the Voice of God speaking to them, But take Chap∣ter and Verse, and say, Hear the Word of the Lord, when the Lord never spoke to them, nor sent them. Who is it now, and where are they that are guilty hereof? and that cry Peace to the Wicked, when the Lord speaks no Peace to them; and that are light vain persons, and covetous and greedy persons, and that see Vanity, and daub with untempered Mortar; that cry Peace unto People, and say they shall have Peace by Christ, while yet they kill Christ, and are not Changed by Him. Where are there such now, by whom People are not converted to God, although they preach time after time? Let all People bring in their Wit∣ness: For whosoever are such at this day, whether they be Papists or Protestants, Anabaptists or Quakers (so called) or whosoever, Such▪ (I say) are led by the spirit of the false Prophets, and are in their way and practices, and all such are to be judged, deemed and taken for Antichrists Ministers, false Prophets and Deceivers, without respect of Persons or Titles of Religion. 3. They were false Brethren, and false Teachers, that taught for filthy lucre; that professed they knew God in words, and in works denied him; being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate; who had a Form of Godliness, but deni∣ed the Power; and were heady and high-minded men, and lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; that were ever teaching, and never able to bring people to the knowledge of the Truth. And such were false Prophets, and false Teachers, that through covetous∣ness and feigned words did make Merchandize of People; that beguiled unstable Souls, and that had hearts exercised with covetous practices; being out of the right way, and following the way of Balaam, who loved the Wages of unrighteousness: These, and such as these, were Deceivers and false Teachers in the Apostles dayes, Tit. 1. 11. 2 Tim. 3. 5, 7. 2 Pet. chap. 2. Now whosoever, whether Papists or Protestants, or of what Sect soever they be that do these things, that teach for filthy lucre; that profess God in words, but in works deny him; and that live wickedly, and are disobedient to God; and have the Form of Godliness, but want the Power; and are heady and high∣minded men, and love pleasures; under whom people are ever learning, but not able to come to the knowledge of the Truth; and that through Covetous∣ness and feigned words make Merchandize of people; that are unstable men, and do exercise themselves in covetous practices; and are not in the right way, but do follow the way of Balaam, who loved unrighteous Wages: Whosoever are such, whether they be Papists or Protestants, or Quakers, or whomsoever they be, they follow the Spirit of the false Prophets, and are in the way of the false Teachers, and are Ministers of Antichrist, even false Pro∣phets and Deceivers. And now to all people whatsoever I appeal for Evidence to the Witness of God in your Consciences, that you may judge in this case: Where are they now, and who is it? are there not some such present amongst you this day in your Cities and Towns and Countries, even such as teach for filthy lucre; that will preach where they can get gain for preaching, but not otherwise; and that
Profess God and Christ with their lips, and shew much love, but deny God in works; who live unholy lives, and in evil wayes, and give bad Examples to People, and that are reprobate to good works; and that have the Form of God∣liness, but not the Power; and that are heady and high-minded, and ambiti∣ous persons; and that are teaching many years together, and People cannot come to the knowledge of the Truth by them, but are alwayes ignorant and wicked. And do not your Teachers exercise covetous practices among you, and go in the way of Balaam for Gifts and Rewards (viz) so much for a Ser∣mon, and for a years Preaching: Such who are made Ministers by man, and not by the Lord, and who do not profit the People at all: Whosoever they are, that are such [now in this Age] are False Prophets and Deceivers, and follow the spirit and walk in the steps of the Deceivers of old; and whosoever they are, whether Papists, Protestants, or any others, they may lawfully be taken, judged and deemed to be false Prophets, Ministers of Antichrist, and Deceivers. 4. The false Prophets and Deceivers in the dayes of old, were feigning and flattering men, and cryed peace to the wicked; and cryed Peace, peace, to every one that put into their mouthes; but Prepared War against every one that did not, Micah 3. 5. And they respected mens persons, and held mens persons in Admiration because of Advantage, Jude 16. Now whosoever, whether Papists or Protestants, or any else, that are Feigners and Flatterers, and that cry Peace to the Wicked, and cry Peace to them that put into their Mouthes; but are Bitter, and Angry and Perverse against such as will not, or cannot give them Hire and Money for Preaching; and that respect mens Persons, and turn every way, from one kind of Worship to another; and have mens Persons in Admiration for their own Gain and Advantage: who∣ever are such now in this Age, are false Prophets and Deceivers. And therefore all People, bring in your Evidence; Who are such now? and where are they that are flattering men, that cry Peace to all that will give them Means, and put into their Mouthes, and that Admire the Persons of Great Men, and that respect the Persons of Great Men for Advantage? If there be any such now amongst you, whether they be Papists or Protestants, Anabaptists or Quakers (so called) you may justly take such, and let such be deemed, judged and reputed false Prophets, Seducers, and Ministers of Antichrist. And now all People upon Earth, try, learn and examine your Teachers and Mi∣nisters, lay them to the Line of Iudgment; For if they are such as are here de∣scribed, if they bear these Marks and Fruits declared, and if they follow the same spirit, and do as the false Prophets of old did, according as 'tis declared in the Scriptures; then may you justly judge them to be Deceivers, and false Prophets and Ministers of Antichrist: For whosoever they be that are amongst you, as Preach for Hire, and that have a Quarter from whence they seek their Gain, and Divine for Money, and go a Preaching for Gifts and Rewards, and that teach for filthy Lucre, and that are Covetous Persons, Heady and High∣minded Persons, and Ambitious Men, that do not profit the People at all, nor turn them from sin by their Preaching; and that Prophesie Lyes, and that are Flatterers and Changeable Persons, and will turn from one Way to another, and have mens Persons in Admiration because of Advantage: Whosoever he be that is one of these above described, who hath these Marks and Signs upon him, of this Physiognomy, of this Nature and Feature, as before described; wheresoever such a one shall be found, or whensoever you see him, or meet with him, or if such a one be amongst you, or pass by you, let him be suspected, taken, deemed and judged for a false Prophet and Deceiver, without respect of his Name and Title in his Profession of Religion. Again, Christ Jesus prophesied and said, That Deceivers and false Prophets should come, who should have the Sheep's-Clothing, but inwardly Ravening Wolves. And John said, The false Prophets were already come into the World [in his dayes] even the false Prophets and Antichrist, whom Christ said should come; and the False
Prophets and Deceivers that Christ said should come, John saw were come into the World in his dayes. Now, who is it, and where are they that are Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, that are those Antichrists that Christ said should come; and Iohn said were come? Even such are they that have the Outside (viz.) Christ's words, and the Apostles words, and the Saints practices; they have the Sheep's clothing, but inwardly are the Wolves in the evil nature; and their evil nature is covered with the Saints words and pra∣ctices; and such are the Wolves in Sheep's clothing, that have the outside of the Sheep, but want the Nature of Christ, and are in the contrary nature. And to all people that are upon the Earth I do appeal, and ask, where are they that are such now? and who are they? whether they be Papists or Protestants, or whomsoever else that are such, that have the outside, the sheeps cloathing, but inwardly are wolves of a devouring nature; such are they that Christ said should come, and Iohn saw was come; And such are Ministers of Antichrist, whosoever they are, and such are in the World, and have over-spread it since the Apostles dayes; and whole Christendom hath been deceived by such Wolves in Sheeps clothing, even by such as have got the Outside, the Saints words and Practices, but wanted the Life, and have been in the Evil Nature, and not in the Nature of CHRIST JESUS: And such now in this Age, are to be taken, judged and deemed false Prophets and Deceivers, Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, and Ministers of Antichrist. E. B.
TO THE Friends of Truth In and about LONDON. DEarly and well-beloved in Christ our Life and Glory, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and at this time quickeneth my heart into the lively remembrance of you all, herewith sending the hearty and fer∣vent Salutation of my dear and perfect Love, unto all the Faithfull amongst you; for the Fathers Love filleth my heart, and hath raised up my spirit into an holy frame and temper of gladness and rejoycing, of great joy and comfort in the remembrance and feeling sence of what the Lord hath wrought and made manifest among his People, and the fulness of his Love and rejoycing floweth out in praising and magnifying the Lord our God for evermore. Oh what hath the Lord wrought for us in our day! How hath his out∣stretched Arm been made bare again and again for our Salvation and Deli∣verance? How many have his Mercies been, and how numberless have his Lovingkindnesses been shewed to us? How hath his power and wisdom been discovered amongst his People, by which we are quickned and revived into the Life of Righteousness and Peace, to be Servants and Heirs of the Everlast∣ing Father, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, being called by him out of Dark∣ness into his marvellous Light? And how glorious is the Light that hath ap∣peared upon our Tabernacle, and shined in our hearts, and that hath led us in the Way of Peace, and taught us in the Path of Righteousness: Thus, and much more hath the hand of the Lord wrought for us, having raised us up to be a Poeple, that in times past were not a people; but now he hath formed us for himself, and created us for his praise, having gathered us as a Shepherd doth his Flock from our strayed estate, in which we were strangers and afar off, inhabiting in death and darkness, but now raised up to sit together in heavenly places, and to feed in the fat pastures of his fulness that filleth all in all. This hath been effected by the Hand and Power of the most High, who hath also preserved us unto this day through many tryals and tribulations; and again and again, when our enemies have risen up against us to destroy us, even then hath the Lord been our defence, and confounded our Persecu∣tors, so that we yet live, blessed be the Name of the Lord, the remembrance of which infinite tender Mercies from the Father, that we have received, have a Heavenly influence upon my heart at this time, which causeth me to say, What manner of Love is this! Oh the hight, and depth, and infinite∣ness of the same! the Beauty thereof hath ravished my heart, the Strength thereof hath overcome me, and the Vertue thereof hath overcome me, and the Vertue thereof hath filled my Soul: And this is the present frame of my spirit; full of Love and Good-will to the Lord God, and to all his Saints, and particularly unto you, unto whom my spirit desireth in the Lord the
increase of Peace, and Mercies, and Blessings, and all Heavenly Vertue un∣to you all, for I am under particular Engagements unto you more then unto many. 1. Because my labour and service in the work of the Gospel hath been more amongst you then amongst others; even for divers years have I been conversant among you, in the administration of the gift of the Gospel, by dispensing the Word of Life, to the Converting of some, and to the Strength∣ning and Confirming of others in the way of the Lord. And let the Just God bear witness of that faithfulness, and integrity and sincerity of heart, in which he hath carried me amongst you, while many precious dayes I have passed away with you, and have not sought yours but you; nor do I desire ought concerning you, but your Faithfulness to the Lord, and your growth and establishment in the Wisdom of Christ Jesus, and that blessings and Peace may ever rest with you. And seeing it is thus, that some of my precious years in the service of God have been spent amongst you; therefore is my heart and spirit engaged to you-wards, even while I live, to advise you, and exhort you, and to pray for you, that you may be sound in the Faith, and established in the Truth, and Confirmed in the Possession that never fades away. 2. In respect of that place of your outward Residence, (that great City I mean) where Satans Seat is, and where wickedness abounds, and many temptations and provocations which may attempt to draw you from the Lord; I do know the dangers are many which may easily be met withall in that place; There is both the love, glory and excellency of this World near unto you; and also the terrours, threats, losses and persecutions of this evil World even dwelling with you, all which may work upon some many fears and doubts, and begat temptations to the denying of the Lord; and seeing the danger is such to you-wards in that place, even more then to some others, therefore is my soul engaged to admonish, and instruct, and Pray for your preservation unto the end, that ye may walk as the Lords, and to his glory. 3. And also my desires are for you, that blessings and Peace may be multiplied unto you, and that you may walk in the Wisdom and Power of the Lord in this respect, that Truth may be honoured, and crown'd with dominion and Authority, and good report in that great City, by your faithfulness, and patience, and diligence, and all the fruits of righteousness; for as many temptations do attend you (as I have said before) so also many eyes are upon you, beholding what you are, and what you do, and what will become of you; and if you Walk in Faithfulness and Righteousness, and be preserved unto the Lord in boldness and valour for his Names sake, this will magnifie the Truth, and crown it with honour, and strengthen and comfort many that are weak, and be a joy to all the upright; and it will confound your Enemies, and put them to shame, and limit the unreasonable spirit of the power of darkness, when our enemies see your just, faithful, righteous and inoffensive manner of walking in all things. And therefore for this cause, my heart is engaged to pray for you, seeing the eyes of many are upon you to mark your wayes and doings, and what will be the end. And now, dearly beloved, as by the free grace and kindness of God ye are called unto this Calling, and are renewed and changed into the Life of Righteousness; so it is by the same Grace and Power of the Father, that ye must stand and be preserved unto the end; for by Grace and Faith we all stand, even through Diligence, Faithfulness, and Watchfulness in the same Grace, being obedient unto its teachings, and fruitful in its motions, and walking by its Rule, in meekness and lowliness of heart, in sincerity and godly
Fear, not being or doing any thing of our selves, distinct or divided from this Grace; but being and doing all things, through the Grace of God dwel∣ling in us; and this is the highest Perfection of Saints. Every ones highest state admits of Watchfulness, and Faithfulness, and Obedience, and to Hearken to the Lord, and do his Will in all things; and whatsoever is of our selves, and related to the outward World, may be kept in Subjection by his Power, that he alone may Rule, and be exalted in Heaven and Earth, and in all things, what we are, and what we do. And wait upon the Lord, that ye may be established and settled in the Truth, and that ye may be confirmed therein forever, as being natural Heirs of the possession of Grace and Truth, to do, and walk, and live according to his will, being so inherited never to go forth any more; and able to say, No∣thing can separate us from the Love of God, not Death, nor Life, nor any other thing. For I would put you in mind, and ye also know it, How that many have been touched in their Heart with the sense of the Lord, and his Love, yea, and many have enjoyed of the good Gift of God, and walked with us for a time, that have not remained unto the End; but have started aside from the Lord, and been overcome with the Temptations of this World, even to the forsaking of the Way of Truth and Righteousness; and such have dishonoured the Lord, and forfeited their Peace and Inheritance in God, and become hardened in their Hearts, and dead to God, and the Latter-end of such hath been worse then their Beginning; though yet for a time such walked with us, and tasted of the good Gifts of God, yet are become Reprobate, because their Hearts have not been firm, and constant, and sound, and approved to God; but of an Evil Frame and Temper of Spirit, Ambitious, Vain-glorious, Self-seeking, and such like, which spirit could not retain the Gift of God, but abused it, and perverted it from it proper End. And therefore, dearly beloved, it is exceeding precious to have a Heart and Spirit tryed and approved of the Lord; a good and honest Heart, an upright and contrite Spirit; for that will abide in Faithfulness unto God through all Tribulations and Tryals; if the Heart be right in the sight of God, whatsoever the Knowledge be, or whether the Gifts be little or great, yet the Lord's Pre∣sence is there, and such are blessed: so that its not enough only to have a touch and taste of the Loving kindness of God; but every one must be esta∣blished therein, in an approved Heart and tryed Spirit, which can endure all things, and not be shaken nor moved; and its only that kind of Spirit, which is Meek and Lowly, Sincere and Upright, which is established in the Truth, and which only can remain unmovable. And according to the ancient Doctrine of Christ, which ye have believed, every one must look to your own particular standing, and must feel your own particular Joy, Peace and Comfort, and must receive the assurance of Life in your own Souls; for it is an Everlasting Word: Every one must stand by their own, by what they feel and enjoy of Eternal Life in their own Hearts, that on∣ly is every ones Security and Assurance in the Kingdom of Peace and Glory: And it is the height of Perfection, To have the Seal of the Spirit of God in our Consciences, witnessing to us, That we are the Lord's; and Blessed are they that have this Testimony, even that of the Spirit of the Father, which is the Everlasting Comforter against all Sorrow; and the Perfect Seal against all Doubts, and the sure Guide against all Opposition: This is the Office of the Spirit of the Lord, and its Work in the Hearts of his Children. Therefore my Advice is to you, as from the beginning, Look to your own, to your own Measure of the Gift of Grace and Truth; that only stands, when all Wandrings after men and things fall; and in that is your security, as I have said.
And let your Conversations and Walkings be such as becometh the Gospel of Christ, in all Faithfulness and Righteousness, that you may be an Honour to the Lord in your Generation; for this only have we to do in this World, even to shew forth his Praise and Glory, who hath created us in Christ Jesus. All things in relation to Truth are well in these Couies; the Dominion of Truth is set up over the Heads of the Wicked, and it is a Terror to its Enemies, and the Joy of all Good men; and Friends are Faithful in the Power of the Lord, and look over this World, to the World that hath no End, and their Hope and Confidence is in that; and Meetings are generally quiet, and the Pre∣sence of the Lord is amongst his People. And thus to the Grace, Power and Wisdom of the Lord God are ye committed, who is the only Preserver of his Children. Grace and Peace be with you all. Edw. Burroughs. Underbarrow, the 18th day of the 8th Mo∣neth, 1661.
THE CASE Of the People called QUAKERS (ONCE MORE) Stated & Published TO THE WORLD: VVith the ACCUSATIONS charged upon them, and their ANSWERS. WE are an afflicted and Suffering People in these Kingdoms at this day; Mocked, Reproached, Haled before Magistrates, Violently abused, and Imprisoned, and much Hard-dealing exercised upon us: This is apparently visible to all people, and needs no further Proof. But whether these Afflictions and Sufferings, Imprisonments and Hard-deal∣ing, be Just, or Unjust, according to our Deserts, or out of the Malice and Enmity of our Adversaries; this is the Question to be enquired into: Unjust, and Unrighteous, and out of Malice and Enmity; and not of true Desert (say we) are these Sufferings imposed on us. But, Justly, and according to De∣sert, and the Laws of the Land (say our Adversaries) Who shall be judge in the Case between us? Even the Law of God, the Gospel of Christ, the Scrip∣tures of Truth, the Example of Primitive Christians, our Neighbours, and the Witness in every Mans Conscience; and to the Judgment of all these we appeal, and shall abide their Sentence. First, We are Accused of an Heinous Crime, and as if we deserved the greatest Punishments, Because we are Dissenting and Differing from the Church of England, and cannot Conform to all Her Worships and Ceremonies; therefore are we said to be Hereticks: Because holding and practizing Different Things from Her, &c. Plea. First, The Scriptures of Truth (which are according to both Law and Gospel) do say and Judge, That they who sometimes did Dissent, and Differ
from some of the Church of Christ, in some Principles and Practices and could not practice in all things, what some others did, as Romans 14. where it is signified, That some of the Church of Christ believed they might eat All Things; some others of the Church did eat Hearbs, some esteemed One day above Another, others esteemed Every day Alike; this kind of dissent∣ing, and difference, about Meats, and Dayes, and Ceremonies, were amongst the Members of the True Church; but What is the Judgment of Scripture in this case of Difference amongst them? Not that the Dissenters one from another should be Punished, and Imprisoned, and Banished, but ver. 5. Let every man be perswaded in his own mind. And One was not so much as to Judge Ano∣ther in this case of Difference, and Dissenting; much less to Imprison one another for that Cause. And in Phil. 3. 15. it is there signified, That if any persons were dissenting, and different in Judgment, or in the growth in Grace, from the rest of the Church, every one was to walk in that measure of Truth, as he had attained to; And if any were otherwise-minded, (viz. Different in the Growth in the Grace of God) then God should reveal the same unto them; And notwithstanding their difference in Judgment, whether in cases Substantial, or Ceremonial, yet, they were still to be in Love and Unity, and walk in their measures, to which they had atained, and they were not to be Imprisoned and persecuted, as we are at this day: Hence observe, That the Judgment of Scriptures, which the Law of God, and Gospel of Christ are according to, is clear for us, and against them that hate us, that imprison us, and afflict us, for dissenting and differing in some Doctrines, and Practices, from the Church of England. But Secondly, If we were indeed Hereticks, and Erroneous People; suppose so, which never yet was truly proved of us, nor can be; What Judgment do the Scriptures (which are according to the Law of God, and Gospel of Christ) give in that case? Not that we should be thus imprisoned, and Afflicted, with corporal punishments; but according to Titus, Tit. 3 10, 11. we should first be Admonished in Love, and Exhorted once and again; and then, if we gain-say, and will not hear Reproof, to be Rejected, cast Out, and Denyed of the Assembly of Saints; but not imprisoned, and banished: and according to 1 Cor. 5. where it is signified, That some, in the denomination of the Church, did Offend against Christ and the Church, and were Hereticks, and Dissenters, because of their Evil deeds, from the True Church; yet, these were not to be imprisoned, and persecuted in their persons, but delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the Flesh, that the Spirit might be saved in the Day of the Lord; they were to be Spiritually dealt withal; and they were to be cast out into the Wicked World, anong the Ungodly, to have their portion from God, with the Wicked, to be delivered to Satan for the destruction of the Flesh, that it might be destroyed, and the Spirit saved in the Day of the Lord. So, if we were indeed such as these were, Dissenters, and in Difference from the true Church, because of some Wickedness, yet the Judgment of Scriptures are against our Ene∣mies in this Case, who persecute and imprison us; for thus it ought not to be done unto us, if the Church of England were the true Church of Christ, and we in difference from her, by False Principles, or Evil Conversation, or any thing else. Thus you see the Judgement of the Scriptures, and of the Law of God, and Go∣spel of Christ, is against our Persecutors. Thirdly, But suppose we doubt, That the Church of England, and its Ordinan∣ces, Discipline, its Worship and Ceremonies, be not according to the Scriptures of Truth, but are in the Form of Godliness, without the Power; suppose we in Conscience believe this, and think we can prove it, which is the very truth of the Case, and therefore do deny Conformity to her, lest we should sin against God, and wrong our own Consciences, at least, as we believe. What Judgment doth the Law of God, and Gospel of Christ, give in this Case?
We are Exhorted and Comanded in Scripture, 2 Tim. 3. From Covetous Men, and Proud Men, Lovers of themselves, false Accusers, Despisers of them that are Good, High-minded Men, and Lovers of Pleasures, they that have the Form of God∣liness, but deny the Power, from all such we are to turn away. And there∣fore we believe we are Justified by the Scriptures in turning away for these divers years past (and till we be otherwise perswaded by sound Doctrine) from the Ministry and Churches that are in England, or lately have been (and sound Reason hath not been yet shewed us to the contrary by you) because they are such as the Scriptures exhort us to turn away from; and because we have judged, that they have had the Form of Godliness, but not the Power; so we are not to be imprisoned and persecuted though we differ, and dissent, and turn away from all them that are Covetous, Proud, Boasters, Lovers of themselves Despisers of them that are Good, High minded Men, and such as have a form of godliness, but not the Power. But we are Judged Just, and our Case not condemned by the Law of God, and Gospel of Christ, and by the holy Scriptures, but rather such as inflict Sufferings upon us: And for any of our Principles and Doctrines that we hold, we deserve no punishment nor persecution, because hereof; for we testify before God, Angels and Men, That we hold and maintain, no principles of Religion, nor practice of Wor∣ship, nor Doctrines of Gospel, but what are according to Scriptures of Truth. And we are ready to be tryed, and proved in that case, and to bring the matter to Issue, in fair proceedings with any man, that shall object the contrary; And thus the Judgment of Scriptures are for us, as we sup∣pose (at least) and if we are in Errour, either by denying any thing on the one hand, or affirming any thing on the other, we have not been hitherto, well Proceeded against, in order to our Conviction. Secondly, We are accused as for a great Crime, and Imprisoned, because we meet together, in the Name and Power of Iesus Christ, to wait upon him, and to Worship him in Spirit and Truth; in Prayer to God, and Exhortations one to another, to Righteousness and Holiness: But, what Iudgment doth the Law and Gospel, and holy Scriptures give, and our Neighbours also, between us in this Case? Lets come all to their Barr and receive Iust Sentence. Plea. First, The Judgment of God's Law, Christ's Gospel and holy Scrip∣tures, are not against our meeting together, but on the contrary, do com∣mand us, and Exhort us, with promises of blessings, to meet together in the Worship of God, and to wait upon him; And it was the practice of the primi∣tive Christians, to assemble themselves together, in that form and manner as we do at this day, (to wit) in a private manner, and separate from the multitude, and all the Iews Synagogues, as in Acts 1. 17. The Saints and Disciples, both Men and Women, to the number of one hundred and twenty, (which were far more then five) went into an upper Chamber, being a private place, and no publique Synagogue, and their waited upon the Lord in Prayer and Supplication, according as we do at this day: Thus the Scriptures justify the way and manner of our Meetings, and condemns them not. Again, in Acts 20. 8. the Saints and Disciples were gathered together in an upper Chamber, and Paul Preached unto them until mid-night. Here was a private Meeting, far above the number of five and out of any Publick Synagogues; and Christ Iesus said, Where two or three are met together in my Name, there I am in the midct of them. And He and his Disciples, often met together in private places, apart from the Jews publick Worships, sometimes in a Ship, and sometimes in Desarts, and on the Mountains, and in particular Houses, and Preach∣ed, and Prayed; this the Scriptures Prove. And also; in Heb. 10. 25. we are expresly commanded, not to neglect the Assembling of our selves
together, but to exhort one another and so much the more as the day ap∣proached. By all which Scriptures, with many more that might be quoted, it is Evident to all the World, That our meeting together for the Wor∣ship of God, in that form and manner as Practised by us, is according to the Law of God, the Gospel of Christ Jesus, and the holy Scrip∣tures: And all these give Just Judgment for us, and Justify us, and there∣fore consequently condemn such as do violence to us, for this practise of Meeting together, for the Worship of God. And thus, though we are Accused and Imprisoned as Evil doers, yet, such our practise of meeting is manifestly according to the Law of God, Gospel of Christ, Scriptures, Example of Saints, and President of primitive Christians; all which give Judgment for us. Secondly, What Judgment do our Neighbours give in this Case? they say, concerning our Meetings, That they have known us to meet together in such manner, for diverse years, in their Towns and Villages, and never knew, nor understood of any harm or danger herein, nor ever were any way prejudiced, either in their Persons or Estates, by our meetings. The very witness of God in all our Neighbours do Testify, and give Iudgment, that our Meetings have alwayes been peaceable and quiet, and that we come together in peace and good order, and parted in the same, and no person hath been harmed by such our Meetings; enquire of the Nighbourhood, and they will tell you, they believe in their Consciences, our Meetings are for good, and have good effects, and are not evil, nor brings forth any evil to any. And as for the manner of our Meeting and and sitting together, it's orderly and decently, and of good report among men; and for any Doctrine that ever was there held, or heard by any, none can truly accuse it to be either Error, or Heresie, or Sedition; but on the contrary, they know it witnesseth against all Sin and Iniquity, and tends to the turning of people from Ungodliness and Unrighteousness, to Truth and Holiness: And many can tell, this is effected, by our Doctrine Preached in our Meetings; and our Neighbours can witness, that we part again in Peace and Good order, and in convenient time; and they can shew you, they are not terrified, nor the peace of the Land disturbed (on our part) by our Meetings, which are in God's fear, and to the Glory of his Name, which all sober men know, are according to the Law of God, and Gospel, and primitive Christians Example. And thus our Neighbours give Judgment for us, and in their Consciences do not Justify them that Imprison us, for this matter of meeting together, which Gods Law, Gospel, Scriptures, and our Neighbours, do thus clearly justifie. Thirdly. We are Accused, as guilty of a heinous Crime, and Imprisoned, Because we refuse to Swear at all, or take any Oath in any Case. Plea. First, The Judgment of the Law of the New. Testament of God, and Gospel of Christ, and Scriptures in this case, is clear on our behalf. As in the express Command of Christ, in his Law and Scriptures Recorded, Mat. 5. where he saith, Swear not at all, by Heaven, nor Earth, nor by Ierusalem, nor by the Head; but, let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay; for whatsoever is more comes of Evil. And again, Iam. 5. the Apostle commandeth the Saints in these words, Above all things my Brethren, Swear not, by Heaven, nor Earth, nor any other Oath. And many holy Martyrs since the Apostles dayes did deny all Swearing. Thus you see, the Judgment of Christ Jesus, and of the Gospel, and of the Apostle, and of Scriptures, are so far from Condemning of us to Imprisonment and Banishment, for our refusing to Swear, that we are Commanded and Exhorted by them, not to Swear at all; and therefore conse∣quently, justify us in our refusing to Swear; and thus, give not Judgment for
such as do Imprison and Persecute us for not Swearing. Come to the Judg∣ment of Christ, his Gospel, and holy Scriptures; Let you and us appear together be fore their Judgment Seat, whether they give judgment against us, that deny all Swearing, or against you, that Imprison us for that Cause: And let the Lord God, Angels and just Men, give their Judgment in this Case; we a poor Afflicted people, do appeal to you, for just Sentence of Judgment, between us and our Opponents. Secondly, Let our Neighbours, give their Judgment, though we do refuse to take any Oath, because of the Commands of Christ and his Gospel, as aforesaid; yet, what harm hath this ever yet been to any of our Neighbours, let them speak; or what detriment ought this to be to any of them, they will tell you: Though we cannot formally take an Oath, yet we are ready at all times to do the Truth, and to speak it on all good occasions, as much as if we did Swear upon a Book; and they can trust us upon our words, as much, if not more, then they can do any that Swear upon their Oaths; and therefore they shall give judgment, that accor∣ding to their best knowledge, we ought not to be Imprisoned and Banished; though we cannot Swear formally upon a Book, being the Truth is not suppressed, nor yet the administration of justice ought to be obstructed for our refusing to Swear. Thus the Neighbourhood bears witness for us, and against such as deal hardly by us, and Persecute us because hereof. Fourthly, We are accused as Heinous Offenders, and imprisoned, because 'tis supposed, We do not submit to obey the known Laws of the Land, but break them, and will not conform to the Church, pay Tythes, take Oaths, leave meeting together, &c. though we know the Laws of the Land command these things. Plea, First, As to submitting to all known Laws of the Land; this is known to God and our Neighbours, that our Principle and Practice is, and ever hath been, to submit to every Government, and to submit to all Laws of men, either by doing or by suffering, as at this day, we resist not the greatest of Afflictions and Tribulations that can be imposed on us; and this is well known to our Neighbous and all People, that we are submissive to all Laws of Men, by patient Suffering without Resistance, even when any Law requires any thing of us which we cannot perform for Conscience sake, that Law we fulfil by pa∣tient suffering, resisting no man, no rendring Evil for Evil to any. And the Judgment of the Scriptures, which are according to both Law and Gospel, and the Presidents of Saints justifie us in this Case, in chusing patiently to suf∣fer the greatest Penalties of the Law, rather than to obey by doing any such Law, as requires things contrary to our pure Consciences; as in the Example of the Three Children, Dan. 3. who were commanded, To fall down and worship the Golden Image, at what time soever they heard the sound of the Musick, upon the Penalty of being cast into the midst of the burning Fiery Furnace: which Command∣ment they could not obey, nor could Truth fall down to worship the Image; but rather chused to suffer the Penalty of being cast into the midst of the burn∣ing Fiery Furnace, which accordingly was done unto them. Again, in the Case of Daniel, chap. 6. who was commanded, To make no Petition to any God or man for Thirty Dayes, save to King Darius, upon the Penalty and Affliction of being cast into the Lyons Den: But Daniel did rather chuse to suffer the Penalty, to be cast into the Den of Lyons, than to obey the Commandment; and was cast into the Lyons Den. By these Examples of holy Men, with many more that might be given out of the Scriptures, 'tis evident, That Righteous Men will rather chuse to suffer, than to obey any Law of Men contrary to their Consciences. So the Law of God, and Example of Saints, and holy Scriptures give Judgment for us in this Case, of rather chusing to suffer, than to obey Laws contrary to our Con∣sciences; and consequently must needs condemn such that Persecute and Im∣prison
us, because they require Obedience of us in Things against our Con∣sciences. Secondly, Though we do disobey Laws, and cannot actively obey every Law of man, when it requireth and commandeth things contrary to a good Consci∣ence; yet herein also are we justified, by the Law of God, Example of Saints, and holy Scriptures, and they give Judgement for us, and consequently against our Enemies in this Case; and in particular in the two Examples before menti∣oned in Daniel, the Three Children were expresly commanded, To fall down and worship the Golden Image; and Daniel was also required by the King's Decree, Not to pray to any God or Man, save to King Darius; yet all these Holy Men of God did absolutely disobey the Law and Decree so requiring of them, and did con∣trary to the Commandment; for the three Children did not how, nor Daniel cease to pray to his God, but prayed as at other times, and yet were justified of God in so doing. Also, the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 4. 18.) were commanded, To Preach no more in the Name of Iesus; but the Apostles did disobey their Commandment, and went on and preached in the Spirit and Pow∣er of Christ, contrary to the Commandment of the Rulers, and appealed to them. Whether it were not better to obey God than man? Many Examples we might collect out of the Scriptures, that the Servants of God did disobey the Commands of Kings and Rulers, and could not obey (by doing) any Command contrary to God; but rather choosed to suffer Afflictions, and Death it self, than to obey such Laws and Decrees, as required any thing contrary to a pure Conscience; and this is our case at this day, we cannot obey (by doing) any thing against our Consciences, but must break the Laws of men, and disobey their Command∣ments, rather than break the Law of God, and sin against their own Consci∣ences, whatsoever we suffer because hereof; and yet the Examples of Saints and Scriptures justifie us in this behalf. And let all our Enemies cease to cry out, Rebellious and Disobedient to Laws and Government▪ for we are not such as do wilfully and obstinately disobey any Laws of Men, but for Conscience sake, and that we may not sin against God, nor offend his Witness in us; therefore we cannot obey Laws contrary to our Consciences, whatsoeve we suffer, which we resist not, nor rebel against any in this Case: So that our Principles and Practices are to obey every Law and Government, either by Doing, or Suffering. And though we dis∣obey such Laws as are not according to the Law of God, and rather do chose to suffer; yet herein we are justified by the Law of God, and the holy Scriptures. Thirdly, And as for our Conversations among men, in respect of our daily walking and converse with them in our dealing, in respect of Honesty and Faithfulness, and Truth, and Justness in Works and Words; our Neighbours shall give Witness for us: We will not justifie our selves, 'tis God that justifies us, and the Law of God, Gospel of Christ, Scriptures, Examples of Holy Men, our Neighbours, and the Witness of God in all mens Consciences, shall bear witness to us; And all these do give Judgement for us in these Cases, to whom we do appeal for Judgment. And, O Lord God Everlasting, do thou judge our Cause; do thou make it manifest in thy due Season to all the World, that we are thy People, that we Love thee above all, that we fear thy Name more than all, that we love Righteousness and hate Iniquity; and that we now suffer for thy holy Name and Truth, and for thy Honour and Iustice, and for thy Truth and Holiness: O Lord, thou knowest we are resolved to Perish, rather than to lose one Grain hereof. Amen, Amen. Our Accusations and Answers truly compared, and weighed in the Ballance of Justice and Truth in every mans Conscience, let all the World judge of the Case▪ Do we deserve to be Ruined, Destroyed, Imprisoned and Banished, and that to be devoured of Wild Beasts, as our Enemy threatens us he will do?
Is it so? Are we Hereticks? Are we Seditious? Are we Drunkards? Are we Double∣dealers? are we such as the Law of God condemns? what Evil have we done in the Land? do we hurt any Body? are we not Innocent before the Lord & men? we ap∣peal to the just Witness of God and Men, let it be answered; and though no man will hear and consider our Cause this Day, yet the Lord will plead our Cause in his Time and Season, and make the World to know, We are his People; in the mean time we are willing to suffer the Reproaches of Ungodly Men, till the Lord works Deliverance in the Earth. But now it may be objected by the Magistrates and Rulers, That we have now a Law against you, and you must suffer; for we cannot but put the Law in Execution, ac∣cording to our Oaths and Offices; and it is not we that persecute you, but it is the Law of the Land by which you now suffer; and we cannot be blamed for your suffering, we only Execute the Law. And after this manner is the Reasoning of some at this day, &c. Answ. To all which I do Answer; It is true, there is a Law now Enacted against us, which is pretendedly made the ground of our Suffering; but whe∣ther that Law be in it self Just, or Unjust, I shall not now demonstrate, but shall leave it to the Judgment of all Christian Men, that know us, our Prin∣ciples, Doctrines, Wayes and Conversations, and let them judge whether we deserve the Penalties and Punishments therein described, for any Principle or Practice held and maintained by us. And though there be a Law against us, yet the Magistrates that are Executors thereof, may execute the same with Mo∣deration or with Violence, with Discretion, or too much Rigour; and it will be well for them to use Moderation and Discretion in this Case: Hereby may they save themselves from that weight of Anger and Indignation of the Lord God, that will come upon all Violent Doers, who seek to destroy the Inno∣cent, and Rejoyce in the Occasion administred. And though this Law be Enacted against our Meetings; not ours, I may say, but such Meetings as are Dangerous to the publick Peace, and to the Ter∣ror of the People: But our Meetings are not such, and therefore this Law may not justly extend in its Execution to the breaking of our Meetings, nor to Banish us because of our Meeting together, which is for the Worship of God, and are Peaceable and of good Report among all good Men; and are not for Disturbance of the Peace, nor Terror of the People, and therefore justly free from this Law, as aforesaid. And though this Law is pretended against us, for to Banish us, and to rid the Land of us, as some vainly suppose; Yet, must it needs be executed to the height of it, without Limitation or Restriction? Must this Law be Exe∣cuted to its height more than some other Laws, that are as truly Enacted, and as fully in Force as this Act can be: Yet some such Laws there are, which better deserve Execution than this, yet they lie dormant, as is visibly appa∣rent at this day, as in 4 Iac. cap. 5. in these words, Be it Enacted, &c. That all, and every Person or Persons, which after Forty Dayes next following the end of this present Session of Parliament, shall be Drunk, and of the same Of∣fence of Drunkenness shall be lawfully convicted, shall for every such Offence forfeit and lose Five Shillings, &c. to be paid to the hands of the Church Wardens of that Parish where the Offence shall be committed, who shall be accountable therefore to the use of the Poor of the same Parish. And if the said Person or Per∣sons so convicted, shall refuse or neglect to pay the said Forfeiture, then the same shall be levied of the Goods of every such Person or Persons, by Warrant of Precept from the Court, Iudge, or Iustices, before whom the same conviction shall be: And if the Offender be not able to pay the sum of five shillings, then he shal be committed to the Stocks for the space of Six Hours. I pray you read the Statute at large, 'tis worth
a sober mans pains to read over, and then judge whether that Law be duly execu∣ed at this day; and also, whether it deserves not more strict Execution than the present Act against us. Also the 1 Iac. cap. 7. in these words, That all Persons calling themselves Schollers, going about Begging; all idle Persons going about in any Country, either Begging, or using any subtil Craft, or unlawfull Games or Plays, or faigning themselves to have knowledge in Physiognomy, or pretending that they can tell Fortunes, or such other like phantastical Imagina∣tions; all Fencers, Bearwards, Common-Players of Interludes and Minstrels, wandring abroad, shall be taken, adjudged and deemed as Rogues, Vagabonds, and sturdy Beggars; and shall suffer such Pains and Punishments as is expressed, 39 Eliz. cap. 4. (viz.) That every such Person shall be stripped Naked from the Middle upwards, and shall be openly Whipped until His or Her Body be Bloody, &c. and shall be forth-with sent from Parish to Parish, &c.And read the Statute at large, and then consider how duly it is Executed now, and whe∣ther it deserves not the Execution as much as the late Act against us, though in some places the one is more executed than the other; where many of our Friends, being honest sober Persons, and of good Conversation, and yet are haled out of their Meetings, where they are met only to Worship God, and for no other End, and sent to Prison; and persecuted to the very height of the said Act; whenas idle Persons, following unlawful Games, and Playes and Bearward, Common-Players of Interludes and Minstrels of divers kinds, do wander up and down City and Country, and having their Play-Houses publick, where their Wickedness is acted; such Persons, and such things, though appearing publickly, yet are permitted, and little or no notice taken of them by some of the Magistrates, so as to punish them for Breach of the Laws, for the prevent∣ing of these Evils: But such Wickedness is too much suffered, though there be divers Acts of Parliaments against such Persons and such Actions, as well as there is one against our Meetings, yet the Act against us is more put in Execution some Places for the breaking of out Meetings, which are for the Worship of God, than the good Laws for suppressing Wickedness, though there is better Law for the one than for the other. Divers other Laws and Statutes made for good Ends, for the suppressing of Wickedness in the Land, there are, which are but easily Executed at this day; but here is one Act against Peaceable meeting together for the Worship of God, which is violently prosecuted and executed upon Innocent Men; and let all just Men judge of these things: Though there be a Law Enacted against our Meetings, so there is against Drunkards and Drunkenness, and Unreasonable Tippling in Ta∣verns and Ale-Houses, and against Minstrels, Fiddlers, Pipers and Players, Common-Players and Stage-Players, that go up and down the Countries, and have their Play-Houses in publick Cities, which Statutes ought rather to be Executed, though they are not: But these things we shall leave to all sober People to judge of. And seeing that the Law against us is more put in Execution, than these other Laws, it doth appear, That there is more Envy against us, and our Peaceable Religious Meetings, than there is against Prophaneness and Wick∣edness, Drunkenness and Stage-Playing, and such like; and such Magistrates, wheresoever they are, are not excusable in the Sight of God, though there is a Law against us, while they prosecute it against us, and not these other good Laws against Prophane and Ungodly Persons and Practices; And therefore see∣ing we do suffer, we must say, It is not only because there is a Law against us; but it is also, or rather, Because there is Enmity, and Wrath and Wickedness in the Hearts of Men against us, which is the main Cause of our Sufferings at this day. And let the Magistrates compare this Law, made against us, with that Saying in Doctor and Student, Chap. 2. speaking concerning the Law written in the Heart, teaching every man what is to be done, and what is to be fled;
And (saith he) Because it is written in the heart, therefore it may not be put away, nor is it ever changable by any diversity of place, or time; And therefore against this Law, Prescription, Statute nor Custom may not prevail; and if any be brought in against it, they be not Prescriptions, Statutes, nor Customs, but things void, and against justice, and all other Lawes; as well the Law of God, as the Acts of Men, ought to be grounded upon the Law written in the Heart. And in cap 4. of the same its said; Every mans Law must be consonant with the Law of God, and therefore the Lawes of Princes, the Commandements of Prelates, the Statutes of Commonalties, nor yet the Ordinances of the Church are not Righteous, nor Obligatory, but as it is consonant to the Law of God. And we are sure the Law of God and holy Scriptures do justifie our Meeting together, as afore is expressed. Also in the Statute 28. Hen. 8. chap 7. it is said in these words, That no man, of what Estate, Degree, or Condition soever he be, hath Power to dispence with Gods Lawes, as all the Clergy of this Realm, and the most part of all the Univer∣sities of Christendom. And we also Affirm, and think these things truly compared one with another, We leave them to the Judgment of the Law of God, Gospel of Christ, holy Scriptures, and our Neighbours; and let Truth determine: So be it.
