THE STRANGE FORTVNES OF TWO EXCELLENT PRINCES: IN THEIR liues and loues, to their e∣quall Ladies in all the titles of true ho∣nour. Imprinted at London by P. Short, for Nicholas Ling. 1600.
To the woorshipfull my verie good friend the fauourer of all good actions, and nouri∣sher of good spirits Iohn Linewray Esquire, Clerke of the deliueries and the deliuerance of all her Maiesties Ordenance, and other munition as well within and out of the Tower of London, as all other her Highnesse Stores within the Realme of England, health, hap∣pines and heauen. SIR, vnthankefulnesse is so neare to vnhonestie, as to auoid the touch of both, I haue been often desirous of some good meane, to deserue some one of your many receiued fauours, which loath to burie in such obli∣on, that I should be thought vnwor∣thie the regard of so good a minde, I haue thought good to acquaint your kindnesse with such occurrents, as haue lately come to my hands, though they bee no matter of this state, yet were they such tracts in the fortunes of two Princes, as being read with that discretion, which, in your good leasure, can iudge of the labour of wit, in the ho∣nour of vertue, I doubt not but that you will fauourablie patronage this first apparant proofe of my loue, till in some better occasion of employment, you maie haue a more sufficient triall of my affection. The substance of my
historie being loue, the subiects Princes, the nature ho∣norable, the aduentures dangerous, the fortunes strange, and yet the ende happy: will suffice I hope, to perswade the wittie to reade, the wise to fauour, the learned to al∣low, the honest to commend, and your good mind to ac∣cept of: which being no more then I desire, nor lesse then I hope of, leauing my booke to your kind patience, with my selfe to your commandement I rest. Yours, very much in assurance, N. BRETON.
TO THE READER. COurteous Reader, for so I hope to find you, or else shall I bee so∣rie, to haue bestowed so good a tearme vpon you: Writers in these dayes haue so manie hu∣mors to censure their laboures, that it is easier to runne mad with seeking to please euery body, then to be wise with displeasing of any: but since this is nothing to that which followeth, let me tell you, that if you will kindlie reade, that is friendlie offred you, and part with a little mony, for a matter of more worth; it maie be you shall haue more contentment, then you looke for: in briefe you shall reade of much varietie of matter, the fortunes of Princes, the true honour of Ladies, the vertue of loue, and the life of honor, the subtlety of a knaue, and the rewarding of a villaine: the constancie of
affection, and the ioie of comfort. But I feare if I goe a little further I shall tell my storie without Booke: and therefore leauing you, through a little Doore, to go into a great House, hoping of your kind patience, to take al wel, that is ment no worse; and to speake as well of my labours, as my good will would be glad to deserue, I rest Your friend, N. B.
The Historie of two Princes, Fan∣tiro and Penillo. IN the Ilandes of Balino, neere vnto the Citie of Dolno, there liued a great Duke named Firento Sanelli, a great Lord I saie, for that he was great both in honor and possessions: he was wise, and therfore much honored; honorable, and therefore much beloued; with his wealth he was full of charity, and ther∣fore enuied of none, but the courtous: hee was valiant, and therefore feared of the wicked: but couetous, and therfore fol∣lowed with the kinde: and vertuous, and therfore blessed by the highest. This Lord had to wife a swéete Ladie, called Merilla, a creature of much worth, in the best construction of commen∣dation; and if a woman might be like an Angell, she might be saincted for her vertues: her modestie with his grauity, her pit∣tie with his valour, her loue with his charity, her bountie with his wealth, and her zeale with his vertue, made such a coniunc∣tion in perfections, as that vnder the heauens, there were hard∣lie found such creatures on the earth. This blessed Lord and Ladie had issue male, onelie one sonne named Penillo, and female one onlie daughter named Merilla: the parents of these two children, liued till they sawe them both to followe their course in the best content of their affections: Penillo was of the age of foure and twentie yeares, of stature tall, ruddie of colour, well complexioned, but not too faire; his haire not blacke, but somewhat-inclining thereto, his counte∣nance
milde, but not effeminate, his proportion in no part im∣perfect, & for his minde, it was of an excellent temper: he was silent, but vpon good cause, and then not to learne what to speak; resolute, vpon good aduisement, but not rash vpon anie aduen∣ture: he was well read in histories, and well qualified in manie points, but especiallie in the varietie of languages, wherin he exceeded maine of his fathers court: he was stated for his wit, gentle in nature, kinde with discretion, bountifull in rewards, not vaine in affection, and constant in friendship; in somme, he was amiable among Ladies, affable among Courtiers, so∣ciable among souldiers, and honorable among all: such a one, as was a ioie to his Parents, a spectable to his Court, a com∣fort to his friendes, and an honour to his country. Now for his sister, as shee was excéeding faire, so was shée admirably wise, yet with such modest kindnesse, that she was so honored for the one, that she could not but bee loued for the o∣ther: For euerie part of her proportion, let it suffice, that na∣ture shewed her Arte, in leauing nothing imperfect; for her stature not tall, nor verie low, but in a swéete meane; her coun∣tenance sober with such a swéetnesse, as rauished the loue of much discretion; her spéech not much; but vttered with such go∣uernment, as amazed the hearers, that could iudge of the wor∣thinesse of commendation; her affection chiefely carried vnto vertue, and her loue knowne but vnto one, of whome depen∣deth a great part of my historie, as hereafter you shall heare. But I will leaue further to talke either of her, or her louer in this place: and onelie entreat of another Duke, who dwelt in the Ilandes of Cotasie, confining vpon the aforesaid Ilandes of Balino. This Duke had to name Ordillo, a man famous for much worth as well in wit as valour: who in all his warres against his enemies was neuer knowne to turne his backe, but with aduantage, vpon retire, gaue ouer no assault till he had entred the strengths, nor surceased his warres till he had the honour of the field: he was at home a Lambe, and abroad a Lyon, where wisedome with clemencie so gouerned the nature of his dispo∣sition, that his subiectes no lesse loued him, then his enemies
did honnor him: In particular, to laie downe his commendati∣on were but tedious, and therfore in somme let it suffice that he was a Prince of that worth, that made him held worthie of his gouernment. This Duke had to wife a gratious Ladie, whose goodnes was such in the worlde, as made her soone fit for the heauens: for such was her delight in diuine contemplations, and so little her foie in anie earthlie substance, that languishing in the worlde with longing after heauen, shee liued not manie yeares with her louing Lord on the earth, but the Lorde of all loue tooke her vp into the heauens: yet before her departure from this life, she had by her Lorde the Duke, two blessed children, a sonne and a daughter; her sonne, named Fantiro, and her daughter Sinilia. The young Lord, a man of excellent partes, both for bodie, and mind, whose particular perfections, would requre a volume to describe in their true kindes, but for that by a little light, mai the whole daie be considered, let thus much suffice, that both for valour and vertue, he might well be called the Souldiers Dic∣tionarie,  the Courties Looking glasse: And for his sister, if I coulde as briefelie set downe her excellencie, I would not thinke it the least point of eloquence; but for all those rare per∣fections that maie dignifie the name of an earthlie creature, I maie saie, shee was in the honour of reason, the wonder of na∣ture. But least in my introduction into my historie, I  more tedious then pleasing, I will leaue this Duke Ordillo with his blessed children for a while, and I will returne to the Duke Firento, of the Ilands of Balino, and his sonne Penillo, one of the most gallant gentlemen in the world. This Duke Firento finding his sonne of so noble a spirite, a could not containe his content, within the confies of his fa∣thers countrey, but that as well by his delight in the reading of histories, his forwardnesse to the warres, his conuersaon a∣mong strangers, and especiallie such as professed armes, noting I say his disposition  to the trauailing life, that he feared he should not long keepe him at home, vpon good ∣ration, how best to aduise him either for his staie, or trauaile to his liking, finding him one daie by chance all alone walking in
close arbour in his garden, commanding apart all his atten∣dantes, tooke occasion in great kindnesse thus to deale with him. Penillo, what fondnesse it were in mee, to flaster thee, with thy much worthinesse of my loue, I had rather thou shouldest conceiue, then I explaine, although I reoice therein more of my knowledge, then I would haue thee prowd of my content: but my déere sonne, let me tell thee, that as I thinke my selfe not a little happie in my hope of thy good, as well for my priuat comfort, as the profit of my whole countrey: so, if by the indis∣cretion of thy disposition, or by the crueltie of fortune, crossing alwaies the course of vertue, thou shouldest not onely deceiue my hope, but destroie my happines, to the sorrow of mine age, and cutting off my daies, thinke with thy selfe my deare sonne, if it may lie in thy power to preuent the worst, and performe the best, shouldst not thou find thine owne vnkindnes, in proo∣uing so vnnaturall, as to grieue the soule of him that deerely lo∣ueth thee, and to be an occasion of his death, who vnder heauen was the originall of thy life? Be not appauled my son, speake freely I giue thee leaue; if thou canst imagine the cause of my speech, and as thou best likest, without the least doubt of my dis∣pleasure, I praie thee giue me thy answere. The young Lorde, little expecting this kind of gréeting with his good father, and neuer vnprouided to answere the darkest demand that might be made him, especiallie from his father, in whom he could not haue anie thought of the least dislike of him, with a staied humble countenance began thus to frame his re∣plie. My gratious Lord, as I reioice not a title in the greatnes of your more naturall, then deserued loue, which looking onelie into your owne goodnesse, haue builded your hope of my happi∣nes, so if I could finde in my selfe the least thought of vnthank∣folnesse, whereby I might iustly purchase your harde opinion, surely, I should thinke my selfe worthy of death, that shoulde liue, to giue offence vnto the fairest comfort of my life: But, as my conscience doth assure me of no such criminall conceit, so do I protest that I doe not a little marueile what should leade you into this manner of question: for as I cannot bee vnnaturall,
so will I not feare you to be vnkinde, but humbly beseech you for the better accomplishing of your content, in some plainer method to acquaint me with your good meaning. The olde man loath to mooue griefe in his sonne, whose deser∣ued loue he was fullie assured of, and yet willing to be satisfied of his true resolution, touching his humour of trauaile, with much adoe brake into this spéech with him. Penillo, I haue of late noted in thee, as well by thy studie in the languages, as by thy conuersation among strangers, and thy loue to souldiers, that the aduenture of thy fortune abroad will be more pleasing to thee, then thy best contentment at home: but if I might by the aduise of my experience, perswade thée to the care of my knowledge, I should easily make thée finde the sweete of the old prouerbe, that home is home, be it neuer so homely: The row∣ling stone gatheresh no mosse, & that prospereth in one ground maie perish in another. Aduentures are dangerous, the seas boistrous, and the warres perilous, and great is the difference betweene strange companions, and home friendes: what canst thou sée abroad, that is not here? The same earth, and little dif∣ferent in nature either for heat or cold; the same sunne shining there that shineth here; men and women in the same shape that thou séest here; in their vniuersities, the same kinde of schlers, in their cities, marchantes, and men of trade and traffique as we haue in ours; in their villages, such farmers and labourers; in their tribunall seates, such iudges; in their warres, such men of armes; in their court such Lords and Ladies, and in all pla∣ces such kinde of people as in some places of our dominion, thou maiest take notice of, if thou be circumspect: what shall I saie to perswade thée rather to staie at home, then stray abroad? Thou hast a father that loues thee more déerely, then any friend can doe; a sister, whose vertue with her beautie, deserueth an honorable fortune, and which I thinke not thy least charge in conscience to haue a care, in as much as maie lie in thee to ac∣complish, thy mother holdes thee so deere as her life, thy friends make a iewell of thy kindnesse, thy followers in thine honour settle the hope of their fortune, and my subiectes in thy wisdome repose the happinesse of their whole state: All this and manie
more particular causes of content, thou hast here at home, like∣lie euery daie to encrease, where abroade, how bitter wil be thy change, I feare to thinke, should sorrowe to heare, and shall not liue to dilgeste, though perhaps such maie bee the mercifull na∣ture of the glorous height of the heauens highest grace, as maie fauour thy disposition, prosper thy aduentures, and blesse thee in all thy actions. But as it is ill to distrust God, so is it not good to tempt him: answere me therefore truly to that I demand of thee, whether thy desire be to trauaile, or not, & what are ye rea∣sons that perswade thy resolution, howsoeuer it be, y• shalt find in me that kindnes, that the condition of thy loue deserueth. The young Prince caried no lesse in obedience to the loue of his father, then willing to aduenture his fortune, to atchieue the honor of his hope, in as good tearmes as he coulde, vppon the sodaine made his father this answere. If it maie become so vnworthie a son as my selfe, to so honourable a father as your maiestie, to stand vpon argumentes of controuersie, for the di∣rection of his course of life; crauing pardon for what soeuer I shall speake, that maie perhaps be vnpleasing to your expecta∣tion: I will not only deliuer you the truth of my intent, but the reasons that haue induced me into the determination of my resolution. I haue heard your maiestie often saie that nature begetteth no deformitie, but rather the true image of it selfe; and as in outwarde proportion, so do I thinke in the qua∣litie of the spirit, the sonne may participate with the father; and although tha vertue be the gift onelie of God, yet in the incli∣nation and disposition of the mind, the sonne maie take some∣what of the fathers spirit. For proofe whereof, I haue often heard you saie that yo were your fathers sonne, such was your de∣sire to see the world, for till he was maried he had no desire to siue at home, harde fare, colde lodging, bitter stormes, sharpe  in a forreine soile, or in the Ocean sea, were more plea∣sing to him, then the most daintie banquet, the softest bed, the calmest weather; and the sweetest peace, that either his fathers court, his own chamber, or the most pleasant Paradise that his whole countrie at home could yeeld him: and such were your de∣lightes, rather to heare a Trumpet in a fielde, then a Lute in
chamber, and to see the assault of a forte, then the dauncing of a maske. Your maiestie would euer preferre a trotting courser, before an ambling lootecloth, a peale of ordinance, before a ring of belies, and a bloudie sword before a painted looking glasse: in somme, if in alsuch courses of your conceit, you followed the inclination of my Grandfather, will you think it strange in me to follow the steps of your affection? Haue you not allowed my reading of histories, and how many of any account are written onelie of home actions? Haue you not wisht me to make much of strangers? and shall I not studie languages where with to entertaine them? I must confesse there is no friend to a father, whose loue cannot be separated from the fruit of his own body. Home dwelling is full of ease, but not of honour, which is rather purchased by aduentures, then by nature inherited: friends are kind, so maie strangers be full of courtesse, and he that looketh not into the world, wanteth much wherein to glorifie the Lorde God. My sisters fortune I had rather leaue to the effect of your wisedome, then my weaknes: and knowing her discretion wil nothing feare the honor of her affection. My mothers tender care of me maie be more kind then commodious, for though I will not liue but to bee in all humblenes her childe, yet mus I haue a care for my countries good not to be a babie to my : for to reade of the noble aduentures of diuerse honourable  rits, what perilles they passed, what conquests they made  they inriched their countries, enlarged their kingdomes. ∣nanced their followers, increased their , and left  to their houses; shall I as one dull of witte not to vnderst  what I réede, or fearefull of spirit to followe the pathes of  passages, not like your sonne lie still at home, and blowe  banquet, dance in a chamber, or tumble in a bed, where  sléepe maie dull my sences, musike maie browne my spirite,  sufeiting maie kill my stomacke: farre e it from your  to shew so little of his fathers nature for dangers, they are the ∣als of the valiant; for aduentures they are the honor of the re∣soluto, and for labours, they are the praises of the patient,  where are these at home? No, by trauale is gotten knowledge, and to answeare to some points of your propositions:
the same sunne shineth in one place that shineth in another, but not at one and the same time; men and women are of the same proportion, but not of the same disposition, which is a note of great regard; the diet, apparell, deineanour, and inclination of euerie countrie is to be deserued, and the obseruations well taken maie fall out to be commodious, so I haue heard you say, my selfe haue read, and verely beléeue: by trauaile I shall learn who are our friendes or foes, and so either to estéeme them or be∣ware of them: My friendes that you maie spare will followe me in my course, or allowe of my content, my seruantes will attend the issue of my fortune, and my countrey I hope shall be benefited by my trauaile. I intend no long voiage, nor anie at all without your liking, but if with your leaue I might haue my desire, I must confesse I would willinglie a little set foote abroad into the world, and for that there are, as I am certainlie informed, a great number of gallant young gentlemen, short∣lie intending to attend the Emperour in his warres against the Turke, wherein, who performeth the true parts of valour, shall returne with the badge of deserued honour, I humbly be∣séech you, with as little charge as it shall please you, to furnish me to this piece of seruice, from whence I am assuredly perswa∣ded, I shall neuer returne with discontentment. Now hauing reuealed vnto your maiestie both the nature of my inclination, the grounde from whence it grew, and the reasons that haue there to induced me, I leaue to your fatherly loue to consider of my dutie, and your discréete consideration, to thinke of my stay or frauaile. The good old Duke, finding that the colte of a courser would hardly be brought to the harrow, a lapwing would runne as soone as it was out of the shell, & a bird of his own fether would take after his owne slight, though it could not but grieue him, to haue him far out of his sight, yet knowing the quarrell good that he went to fight in, with the Emperour against the Turk, and that manie princes had sent their sonnes to gaine honor in that piece of seruice, after a few words of some vnwillingnesse to want the comfort of his presence, was not only contented to like well of his desire, but promised, with his blessing to furnish
him for his voiage: And so, leauing him with his father the Duke, going into his pallace to perswade the Duchesse pati∣ence to his departure; I will returne to the Duke Ordillo of the Ilandes of. Cotasi, of whom when I haue tolde you what hap∣pened of his son Fantiro, I will returne againe vnto the Duke Firento, and the young Prince. But touching the Duke Ordillo, you shall vnderstand, that one daie in the heate of sommer intending to take his pleasure in a forrest neere vnto the sea side, and hauing a stately redde déere so long in chase, as had almost spent all his whole crie of houndes, wearie with following the crie, and knowing that the young Prince his sonne was of so strong a bodie, though but a childe in years, that he would bring him the newes of the death of the Déere, with a soft pace breathing his horse, with a prettie traine of his attendantes, retired himselfe to his pallace in a parke neere vnto the forrest, where I will leaue him for a while expecting the returne of his sonne, and I will tell you what be∣came of the fruit of his expectation. The young Prince sole heire male vnto his father, and so lit∣tle beloued by his vncle brother to the Duke, and one of his pri∣uie Counsaile, that to aduance his owne children, he cared not what became of his brothers sonne, was by a villaine that hee had hired for the purpose, trained aside from the chase, some∣what neere vnto the sea, where hauing him alone, farre enough from companie, either to heare what hee said, or to sée what hee did, drewe out his sword, and with a terrible countenance fra∣med for the purpose, after he had made him to lightdowne from his horse, vsed this spéech vnto him: Howe now young master? You dined well, but you had no good sauce to your meate, but I must make you such a dish of sauce to your supper, thir all the cookes in your fathers Court neuer sawe the like: For to make short worke with you, I must see what bloud is about your hart, and I must sende it to your vncle to his venison: nowe, if you can come and beare him companie, you shall tell me if it be not worth the tasting. The young Prince Fantiro, hauing in his heart no little spark of his fathers spirite, séeming nothing at all dismaied at his
shreates, nor as it were, making ante fearfull account of death, throwing off his cloake, and vnbuttoning his doublet, with a serne countenance, made him this answere: Thou saucie ras∣call, what art thou? a man? a dogge? or a deuill? that darest to thinke so villanous a thought, or to vtter so impious a spéech, as to murther the innocent, or to luie a violent hand vpon the least haire of my head? am not I sonne to thy master? and master to thy selfe? did I euer hurt thee? Naie, haue I not béen too boun∣tifull in my good will, vnto so vngratefull a villaine? Looke a∣bout thee, séest thou not a God in the heauens? and knowest thou not there is a deuill in hell? that vpon the instant of thy vil∣lanie, standes not readie to receiue thee? Oh worst of all crea∣tures, how canst thou looke towards the heauens? and dost not hang downe thy head, to think of the villany of thy hart? Looke thou wretched slaue, my brest is open for thee, thinke I feare not death, for I knowe I shall not liue one minute past the houre that is appointed me; and therfore doe thy worst: and for mine viscle, God forgiue him the vnnaturall villanie that hee hath shewed in this action. The intended murtherer, not a little amazed at the spirit of so young a bodie, vnwilling to returne to the Court without performance of his promise, as well for the want of his promi∣sed rewarde, as for feare of his displeasure that had set him to worke, and yet loath to embrue his handes in the bloud of so swéete a creature, replied vnto him with these wordes: My Lorde, the Lorde of lordes knoweth how loath I am, to fall into the lapse of the diuell by this hellish action; and therfore as wel to saue your life from the murtherous malice of your vncle, who will neuer leaue by all deuises to séeke your-bloud, as to saue mine owne assured to be lost, if I returne without his content∣ment: I beséech you giue eare to what I say, and I hope it shall be for both our good. In the next hauen néere adioining, liesh a shippe readie to put to sea towardes the citie of Dolno, in the Ilandes of Balino, the Merchant that hath fraight and victua∣led her is one Mario Duronte, a friend of mine, to whom I will put you as my sonne, entreating him to carrie you shither, and there to leaue you either-with some Courtier or Merchant that
he is acquainted with for some terme of yeres, for that I would haue you to learne the languages; Now there, if your fortune be to doe well, I shall be glad of it, if otherwise, wo bee to me, though vnwillinglie to be the author of it. This spéech though it were no little griefe to him to leaue his fathers Court, and to abandon his countrey in so poore a sort, and vpon so hard a fortune, yet willing of all ils to chuse the least, was contented rather to accept this little kindnesse, to be put seruant to an vnfit master, then to trust anie longer to the courtesie of so wicked a creature; & therfore with great thankes, assuring him that God would regarde his pittie, and that him∣selfe would neuer forget his honestie, giuing him a purse of golde that hee had about him, kéeping verie fewe crownes for himselfe, tooke his waie toward the hauen, and by the way mee∣ting with none that knewe him, passed vndescried vnto the shippe, where being aboord, and entertained into seruice with Signor Mario, they put to sea, the tide seruing filie for their pur∣pose, leauing the villaine to returne to his wicked master with the newes of his Nephew, whome I will leaue at the Court, telling him in secret a deuised lie of the drowning of the young Prince, and I will tell you what became of him, and his for∣tune. The winde seruing well to their wished shore, it was not long till Mario Doronte arriued, at the cittie of Dolno, where he had not lien many daies, but hauing occasion to go to the court, tooke with him his young seruant Rantifo, for so was the young Prince nowe miscalled by the villaine that had intended his death: Now being come to the Court, and there well entertai∣ned by some not of the meanest sort, with whom he had to  with in his businesse, crossing the Court, there happened a No∣ble man of the Dukes chamber, to cast his eie vpon this young Prince, the Merchantes imagined prentise, whome calling to him, after a fewe wordes had with him, affecting verie much both his person and spirit, made such meanes to the Merchant, that for a small summe of crownes, with promise of a greater friendship, he obtained him at his handes, and entertaining for his page, and finding in him such fine qualities, as did much
deserue the encrease of his good liking of him, he helde him in such account, as was not commonlie séene nor by him expected, vpon so little knowledge: But the Merchant after the dispatch of his businesse returned to his country, and the young Prince now a page caried his seruice with such care, as was not a lit∣tle regarded in the Court, nor vnrewarded of his master; who in few yeares, hauing perfected his forwardnesse in many good qualities, by maintaining his desires in all good instructions, with true commendations of his worthinesse, preferred him to the Duke his master, who in a little time, tooke so due a regard of his seruice, that to the viewe of his whole Court, hee made shew of his excéeding fauour. But I will leaue him for a while in the beginning of his fortune, in the Court of his fathers ene∣mie vnknowne to him, and himselfe vnknowne to the Duke what he was, and I will returne to Pinello, the young Prince, sonne to Feronte. The Duke of Dolno in the Ilandes of Balino, who hauing obtained leaue of his parents for his voiage into the Emperors Court, and so to attende him in his warres against the Turke, had no sooner set foote aboord, but a sudden storme tooke him scarce out of sight of lande, and draue him for sauegard of his life, and all that were with him, to put in at a hauen within the Ilandes of Cotasi; where the Duke Ordillo his fathers ene∣mie was chiefe gouernour: who though he were in his debt for a summe of mony lent vnto his father, and therfore by lacke of paiment had purchased his displeasure, yet hauing heard of his sonnes arriuall, sent to entertaine him in such good sort, as be∣fitted the honour of his person, who being met in great solem∣nitie, by diuers of his Lordes, was after he had béene feasted by the Gouernours of his chiefe cittie, with a great troupe of Nobles attended vnto the Court of the Duke, of whome hee quicklte receiued such an vnexpected welcome, as in the roialty of his spirit, would haue remitted both all debt and displeasure: not to stande too long vpon néedlesse discourses, let it suffice that the Dukes kindnesse, the Nobles attendance, the Ladies sweete fauours, and the welcome of the whole Court, was such, as made him manie daies longer then he determined, to make
aboade in that countrey: but aboue all, the gratious kind coun∣tenance of the Dukes onely daughter, not a little affected by this gallant young Prince, was not the least cause of his state, of whom since a great part of my storie dependeth, I will tell you, what I reade fell out betwixt them. This young Princesse the onlie daughter of Ordillo, not a lit∣tle affecting the outward person, & inward vertue of this young Prince, who was nothing behinde with her in great content∣ment with her much worthines of his good liking, tooke occasion one morning, séeing him walking out of his lodging into a garden, right against her chamber windowe to take a priuate waie through a gallerie downe into the same garden, where in a close walke néere vnto the gréene alley where the Prince was walking vnséene of him a pretie while, fell into this talke with a gentlewoman an attendant of hers, whom she held in great account, and to whom she reuealed the secret of all her hart: Oh Delina quoth she (for so was her name) little doest thou know the cause of my ate melancholie, but I dare trust thée with my life, and for that I know thou hast past through the Labyrinth, that I am nowe in, I will hope the better of thy aduise for my comfort: Since the comming of the Prince Penillo, into my fa∣thers Court, thou hast not séene me hartely merrie, for though I conceale much of my passion, yet will I somwhat ease my hart, with telling thée somewhat of my minde. Some foure or fiue daies before the newes came to our court of the arriuall of this worthy Prince, I had a dreame that held me all the time of my sléepe, the most part of a whole night: the remembrance whereof in the morning and euer since, hath troubled mee verie much: which as néere as I can remember I will tell thée. Me thought I was going thorough a thick wood, where were a number of nettes and snares, layde in euerie pathe where I shoulde passe, yet me thought I passed thorough them so easily, as if they had beene of no strength; till at last I came towarde a great water, where neere vnto the shore laie a great Boate, and from the Boate laie a long line, made all of golde & pearle, within the compasse whereof, treading yer I was aware, mee thought some thing gaue a snatche, wherewith the line whipe
about my middle, and caried mee into the Boate, with the so∣daine fright whereof I awaked. Now what saiest thou to this dreame? Delina, no lesse witty concetted of her dreame, then noting the cariage of her humor, made her this answere. Ma∣dame if a blind body may catch a Hare, I may happen to come somewhat néere the expasition of this night fansie. The wood you went in, is the court, the nettes, the eies and tongues of your sutors, that had no power to take sure holde of your affection; now the great water maie be the Sea, and the golden line, the young Prince, that may cary you away from your father: for if I be not much deceiued, he hath you by the heart, whatsoeuer it was that helde you by the middle. Unhappie wench, quoth the Princesse, thou rouest too néere, that hittest the marke so right: but yet maiest thou bee deceiued in one point, thoughe not in some other; I haue past the nettes, that is true; and I am caught, it is not vntrue, but that he either wil, or shall carie me awaie, that I feare will not fall out: But God knoweth all, tò whose onelie will I leaue it, as farre may come as neere, foes maie be friends, and loue where he doth light doth more then all the world besides. His presence maie please the purest eie, and for his wit, I heard my father woonder at it, for his bountie, our court speaketh of it, and for his vertue, who doth not see it? but for his loue, happy is shee that shall enidie it: for princesse wise∣dome, with honourable bountie, shewes a diuine spirite in an excellent nature, and of such a temper I hold him, and for such a one I loue him, and will euer honour him, though I neuer haue him. The young Prince hearing this pretty parly betwixt the La∣die of his loue, and her handmaid, with a voice lowde enoughe to be heard of them that were so neere, fell thus to talke to the aire: Oh heauens, who can withstand the force of the fates? was I going to the wars to gaine honor in the fielde, and am I dri∣uen to seeke a peace, by being vanquished in a chamber? Did I go to fight with the great Turke, and am I now afraide of a little Christian? Is this the fruit of a storme at Sea? to come into this kind of calme at lande? Well what shoulde I talke to the trees that heare mee not? or to the birdes that vnderstande
me ? or to the aire that helpes mee not? Oh Bilanta, blessed werte thou borne, if thy beautie haue beene the beginning of my happines; and happie, if thy vertue ioine issue with my af∣fection: for though our parentes be at iarre, we maie be at one, and what anger in them cannot yéeld vnto, loue maie effect in vs, an ende of heartburning in our patentes, and a beginning of quiet in our countries. But howe shall I hope of thy loue? my fathers displeasure maie brééde a doubt of my loue; besides she maie be affected otherwise then I know: where at the young Princesse in her close walk replied no. What quothe the young Prince, is there here such an eccho? The Ladie againe replied, oh. The young Prince amazed at this eccho, went on with this speech: Oh that I knew Bilanta indeede would regard my loue; she answeared loue: Loue quoth the Prince, but whome doeth she meane? I would I knewe his name; she answeared name: name quoth the Prince, but who maie it be? If it be one onelie, shee answeared onelie: Onelie quoshe hee, onelie happie in déede, would so were Pinello; she made answere Pinello: With that the Prince putting the wordes of the eccho together, made vp this speech: Oh loue, name onelie Pinello. And musing a lit∣tle vpon his conceit of this sound, looking aside, espied the young princesse, with her attendant walking out of the Arbour into the Garden, whome meeting with, at the ende of a crosse alley, he saluted with this gréeting. Sweete Princesse, when there bee two Suns shining at one instant, it cannot be but faire weather: one in the skie, and an other on the earth, both which meete so sweetelie in this blessed péece of ground, that let him die in his bed, that will not walke in such a morning. The Lady not fully perswaded of his affectiō, for al his playing with ecche, and yet hoping wel of his words, till his deedes fell out otherwise, with a modest smile made him this answeare. My Lord, if your spéeches were not so high in the cloudes, that poore soules on the earth know not how to gesse of your meaning, I shoulde bee the better able to frame an an∣sweare to your salutation; but howsoeuer the sun shine in the heauens, the shadow of your imagination, if it were a substance of that worth, that might answeare a far lesse figure, then your
fauour, would be loath that anie fowle weather shoulde hinder the happines of your faire walke: but I perceiue such mor∣ning Astronomers can plaie prettilie with their owne humors. Prettie Lady (quoth the prince) the best plaie that I know, is at, be you pleasde, where hee that lightes vppon a good carde were vnwise if he woulde change: the princesse rouing vnhappilie at his conceit replied againe, and yet my Lord, to be afraid of good fortune, is sometime cause of much losse: yea Madame answe∣red the Prince, but fortune is so fantasticall, that there is no trust to be had in her▪ and therfore I hold my opinion; rather to kéepe a good choise, then to aduenture a bad change. I am no gamster answered the Princesse, and therfore can speake but i∣dlte of the sport, but they that are pleasde are happie, and they will not hold themselues so, are vnwise. The Prince playing vpon this word pleasde, went forwarde with this speech: Good Madam, mate it then please you to be pleasde, with the seruice of my affection? which no further then desart, will seeke the ho∣uour of your fauour. The Ladie with a modest smile somewhat concealing her content,  him this answere: My good Lord, I am glad it pleaseth your greatnesse to be so merry with your poore friends: but such seruice, as your fauour, must be graced with greater honour then my vnworthinesse can accomplish. The Prince not a little contented with her spéech, replied a∣gaine in these words: Madam, to make a long haruest about a little corne, were but a weake piece of husbandrie; and therfore not to hold you with a tedious discourse in plaine tearmes, you are the card that I meane, my plaie is no iest, your loue is the stake, that I would be glad if I could to win, you are the choise, that I haue made, and that I would bee loath to change: and therfore if a souldiers eloquence, maie haue fauour in your au∣dience, let my heart and hand in your honour speake for my de∣sart in your affection. The Ladie not able to couer the fire, that was now past kindling, brake sodainlie into this answere. My Lorde, to reape the corne ere it be ripe, maie prooue more haste then good spéede, and yet to let it grow till it shedde, were great losse to the farmer; and therfore the taking of time is profitable to the prouident. I will not teach your honour what to doe, but
if my loue be the prize of your pleasure, you cannot loose the hope of your patience, assuring my selfe, that the reach of your conceit, excéedeth not the roialtie of your spirit; which in the regard of vertue deserueth nothing but honour: and for that the heart of a souldier, is frée from the tongue of a dissembler. I will rather beleeue the truth of valour, then giue eare to the falshood of a weaker spirit: But for that manie crosse fortunes, maie hinder the happinesse of the most honorable resolutions, let me intreat your patience to make triall of  constanci, ere you make my vnworthinesse, mistresse of my content∣ment. The Prince nothing disliking this good motion in her good minde, kissing her hande, made this kinde conclusion: Faire Princesse, the discretion of your good motion, I exceedingly like of; for your credit to my truth, I cannot but thanke you, for the honour wherewith you entitle me, I returne it fully▪ vpon you, for the nature of my loue, let your vertue discerne it, and for the faith of my affection, I vow you shall command it: but as you know I haue resolutely intended to attende the Empe∣rour in his warres against the Turke, where if I gaine honor, the garlandd shall bee graced in your wearing; if I die, let it suffice thy selfe to knowe the honour of my loue, with, whome howsoeuer be my fortune, I vow to leaue the faith of my affec∣tion: and so, thinking to procéede in their further conference, spying certaine Ladies, and Gentlewomen with their friends and attendants comming into the garden, they singled them∣selues one from another, hee retiring himselfe to his lodging, and she to her close arbour, where I leaue them for a while to meditate vpon their muses, and I will returne vnto  late Page vnto the Duke Feronte. Fantiro sonne to the Duke Ordillo, preferred by the Mer∣chant before spoken of, vnto one of the Duke Ferontes Court, and after by his Lord and master vnto the Duke himselfe, ha∣uing so well caried himselfe in his seruice, that he was not on∣lie beloued of the Duke his now Lorde and master, but of all his whole Court, and especiallie of Senilla the onelie daughter of the Prince, of whom he had often receiued such secret tokens
of honorable fausurs, as except he would hide both his eies, he must néedes perceiue some part of her affection: But among al, this was not the least, that one daie among other, in the after∣noone, the Duke being disposed to haue some , and dan∣cing in the presence, falling out in a daunce, that euery knight was to take his Ladie, and euerie Ladie her seruant, on whom she would bestowe her fauour; in the presence of her father the Duke she tooke Fantiro by the hand and accompanied him in the measure, till the dauncing was wholie ended. Which was noted of manie, especially of one, who hauing more wealth then ho∣nour, thought to buy loue with drosse, which ilfauoured dogge, vnworthe to bee called a man, yet attended with farre better then himselfe, séeking in what hee might to disgrace this vn∣knowne Prince, came one daie by chance into a galleris néere adioining to the presence, where he found the yong Prin∣cesse walking all alone, and vpon the sodaine standing as it were in a muse, looking vpon a picture of an Ape playing with an Owle, where smiling to her selfe which was the best shaped creature, shee sawe comming towardes her the onelie hobby horse of a man, that euer disgraced a coate of veluet: whome, rather for the fauour that he helde with her father, then for anie affection, that the had reason to carrie him, she for ill fashions sake thus saluted Signor Sperto, for so was hee called (whether christened or no, I know not) God giue you good morrow: The flouch of a slouen with a slauering smile, vpon a slubbered con∣ceit, after manie good  began to trouble her with this tattle. Truely , I am glad it was my good happe, to méere so conuenient  lie with your , as well for the ho∣nour that I wish you, a for the seruice I would be glad to doe you: for though a Quince bee a tree of no straightnesse, yet it beareth a faire  wholesome fruit, the fallow  is rough, yet it beareth the best , and the Ore hath but an ill hue, yet is there pure golde to be had in it, so maie it bee that in me you maie ūnde some cause of discontentment,  you haue made triall of more then I will protest: but emploie me in your ser∣uice, consider of my desart, and doe me iustice in your fauour: Let your fathers loue be an ingression into my Grace, and the
endeuour of my dutie, the encrease of my good for tune: The   is commended for shining as well vpon the val∣leies as the mountaines, ye sea is beloued as well for a Pinnis as a proud ship, and is not the pearle in a shell, more worth then the oyle of a Whale? then thinke it not vnpossible, to find that spirit in me that you maie perhaps finde in a fairer faced erea∣ture: a Diamonde is the brighter for his foile, a faire horse, is the more beautifull, by the deformitie of a fowle iade, and how can you bee better graced, then in fauouring the disgratious? for my loue, I will compare it with anie liuing; and for my seruice I would it could expresse my louing. Good Madam par∣don my boldnesse in acquainting you with my suit, which hath no life but in the onely fruit of your good fauour. The Ladie so little liking the outward dogge, that shee had no patience to thinke of the inward Deuill; little studying for an answere, brake of a sodaine into this spéech: Sir, for your kindenesse I thanke you, but for your paines I would be loath to trouble you: for though your eloquence be great, yet all is but a sound, and when the stringes are once slipt, the lute is but a piece of wood: the Diamond is to be loued for his fire, not his fotle, a comelie horse with a iade, will make an lfauoured con∣iunction,  to grace the vngratious, is against the haire of a good wit. My fathers loue, and my liking maie differ vpon cau∣ses, and your seruice and my command not méete in anie occa∣sion of emploiment: for the sunne shining on the valleies, it is a blessing of the heauens; and for the Pinnis sayling thorough the seas, it is by the bearing nature of the water, but for the pearle in the shell, indéede I must confesse it is farre better out, of it, then in it; and to conclude, for the inwarde sharpenesse of your witte, if it were not in so grosse a person, I could per∣haps take patience with my fauour, to make some emploiment of your seruice: but for that I would not féede you with vaine hopes, to hang vpon the skirtes of my faire spéeches, let  suffice you not to abuse you, that I could bee content of ten to heare you, but neuer to see you. Whereat the wicked wretch, like a galde horse kicking at the noise of a currie-combe, fret∣ing at his owne deformitie, where a squinte eie, a halfe nose,
and a wrie mouth had no grace, in a great rage,   his cold entertainment went awaie with these wordes: Well, if you like not that you see, you maie pull out your eies, and softlie muttering to himselfe, I will méete with you ere you be, aware, and crosse you in your most comfort, meaning with Fantiro her loue, now in that Court called Rantifo. But I will leaue the wretch to his wicked inuentions, go∣ing from the Ladie to the Duke her father, and I will tell you a fewe wordes of the Lady and her louer, whose good hap it was presentlie after the departure of this sweete Gentleman, to come into the gallerie where his Ladie and mistris was, verie solemnlie walking, but fearing that he had offended her fauour with pressing into her presence, begā to retire himselfe towards the doore, as not willing further to moue her patience; which the Ladie espying, and willing a little to embolden his dutie in her fauour, called him vnto her with these wordes: My good ser∣uant, what meanes this too much good manner? or shall I call it strangenesse? or found you them not here that you looked for? or are you displeased with them that you see? Truely I wil not hurt you, and to put you in further comfort, if you haue any suit to my father or affection to any friend of mine, assure your selfe I will not hinder you, though how much I will further you I will not tell you. The young Gentleman, in this Court vnknowne what hee was, and therefore carrying no greater title, not a little glad of this kinde gréeting, made her this humble answere: My grati∣ous Ladie and mistris, I feared nothing but your displeasure, nor ioie in anie thing vnder the heauens but your fauour: my suit to your father, is but his imploiment of my seruice, and for my affection to your friendes, it shall be wholie in the honour of your vertue: Now therefore I humblie beséech you pardon but my truth, and regard my triall, which shall make me no∣thing my selfe more then I shall be happie in your seruice. Oh seruant (qd. the Princesse) I sée you study not for nothing, I be∣leue you read Ouid, you would séeme to make such a Metamor∣phosis of your self, of late a soldier altogither in the field  now a louer fall to courting in a chamber. Rantifo not vnprouided
of an  replied in this manner: Good Madam, my af∣fection is no fiction, what soeuer it maie please you to thinke of my studie, but when the honour of a souldier is the fauour of his mistris, giue me leaue to serue your father in the field, and ho∣nour you in the Court: and though the meanenesse of my estate make the vnworthinesse of my fortune, yet thinke a star in his right place, maie hap to prooue to be a planet. The Princesse of the sodaine began thus to replie, for starres  planets, I leaue the proprietie of their places, to the studie of Astronomers; but if your minde be heauenlie, the highest prosper your humor: and, as she was going onwards with her spéech, vpon the sodaine she espied certaine Ladies comming in to entre at her companie into the garden, wherewith leauing her praier to her seruants Amen, with a fauourable glaunce she left him to his muses, & with the Ladies that came to her, went downe into the garden; where I will leaue her in the pleasant walkes to take the benefit of the sweete aire, and I will tell you, what did follow of Fantiro, and his fortune. Fantiro now called Rantifo, no sooner had left his mistris, but with a concealed oy gat him presently to the Dukes cham∣ber, where taking his place of attendance, espid comming from the Duke, Signor Sperto the swéete gentleman that I be∣fore spake of, who comming by Rantifo, with a fleering laughter, as one that had plaied the Iew with him behind his back, gaue him a wrie mouth good morrow; which he taking verie kindle, not yet knowing his cunning practise, returned him very hum∣bly: but after his departure finding the Dukes countenance, as it séemed to him vpon the sodaine somwhat altered, from his former kind of kindnesse, began so suspect, that Iacke an apes was not without his trickes, and that his being with the Duke had done him no good; as hee did shortlie after perceiue: for within few daies after, it was his happe lying vnder a pale of the parke néere vnto the pallace, where the Duke with this wic∣ked horseleah was walking, to heare the talke that passed be∣twixt him and the Duke, which was as followeth. My gratious Lord (quoth this vngratious lubber) the many fauours where with your highes hath bound me vnto you, in al
the sernice that I can deuise to  you, will not suffer  to conceale the least cause that I knowe  bée an occa of your discontent, and in what I can humble to aduise your fa∣uour in the preuenting of al that may endanger the iust weight of your displeasure. The Duke better acquainted with his wit then his conscience, minding to make vse of the one,  soeuer he should finde of the other, replied vnto him with thse words. Good Sperto, thy carefull regard of my content, I cannot but kindlie thinke of; and thy prouidence in preuenting all occasion of my dislike, I will not let passe vnrewarded: and therefore I praie thee playnelie deliuer mee thy minde in euerie pointe of thy meaning. Signor Sperto, hauing studied vpon purpose, to pla she d∣laine in his kind; began thus to vtter his . My gratious Lord, for that you shall sée how indiffer entlie I will deale, in giuing reason his due, as I would bee no aduancer of pride, so woulde I not be anie backe friende to the honour of vert▪ in the skie you see there is but one Moone, which hath her light from the Sun: now on this Moone attendes a number of stars, but if anie one shoulde presume past his place to step within the circle of the Moone, thinke you not the higher powers woulde not thrust him quite out of the heauens? I am no Astronomer (quoth the Duke) but I thinke it were it it should be so: but I praie thee trouble me not with figures, while I would haue thee more plainelie tell thy mind. Then answeared Signor Sperto, maie it please your grace, by the skie▪ I meane your court, the Moone your daughter, and the Sunne your selfe, from whome and the Almightie, she taketh all the vertue of her honor▪ Now if any attendant in your courte shoulde presume further then your pleasure, to presse into the fauour of her affection, were he not worthie to be banished your court? Yes, and shall (quothe the Duke) whatsoeuer he be without exception: Then my grati∣ous Lord, said Sperto, you know, you haue long fauoured, and by your fauour aduanced Rantifo, a stranger in your countrie, and such a one as though I must confesse by his much worthe manie waies, deserueth no little honour▪ yet if for your fauour ustlie extended vnto him, he will presume to wrong your kind∣nes,
in  at your Crowne, or robbing you of your chiefe comfort, I leane to your wisedome to iudge of his reward. The Duke marking well euerie part of his spéech, and with∣all ing to minde the open shewe of her fauour in taking out of Rantifo from all the companie, both of friendes and stran∣gers, to leade her in the measre of her dance, thinking well both vppon the man and the matter, made him this answeare. Signor Sperto, I sée well thy watchfull care of my comforte, and do suspect no lesse then perhaps thou dost better perceiue, but to preuent all mishappe, and giue no cause of offence; let vs ad∣ what is to be done. The man hath serued faithfullie, and in manie good seruices hath deserued honourablie, our friendes in a manner all do loue him, I heare almost no man speake ill of him, and if our daughter affect him, shall we therefore hate him? God  , vertue will haue honour in despight of for∣tune, and loue hath caused princes to fauour verie poore people, I speake not this either to pardon his presumption, or to fauour his procéeding, for I will deuise in what I can, to remoue him farre enough from my daughter, howsoeuer my selfe shall re∣gard him. But let me haue thy aduise how so to worke it, that he maie rather be glad of our countenance, then mistrust our discontentment. Signor Sperto, fearing to be thought malicious, and yet not able to couer the llanie of his humor, made this answeare to the Duke. Maie it please your highnesse, to consider of what mle  out in he euent of this fortune, if it wore not fore seen▪ If your daughter shoulde o disgrace your hole Court, as to cast her affection vppon a stranger, and leaning to looke vppon manie noble per , shoulde fall in liking with I knowe not whome, nor of how  a parentage; it cannot bee but a discomfort to your heart, so to see your ewell, that you hould of the highest price in your Crowne, to be set in so base golde, as maie perhaps proue but copper: and if it bee as pure as the pu∣rest, that he should proue honourable in birth, wise in conceite, valiant in , vertuous in disposition, and euery way wor∣thie of as much honour, as the greatest of your fauour coulde a∣forde him; yet what a heartburning woulde it bréede in your
countrie, that a stranger should    of  , and carie awaie the garland of your Duke ▪ yea,   not only all the actions of your noblest  would lie as dead, or not spoken of, while the Trumpe of ame would▪ sound onlie the honour of his fortune; and so in processe of time, not onelie your Court and countrie woulde bee disgraced▪  agrieued, but your highnesse shoulde see a greatfall of your  , when by the fresh memorie of his fortune▪ all former honoures woulde be forgotten; but to preuent all misfortune. Stay there a little (quoth the Duke) and let mee tell  a little of my minde: my daughter, is but a part of my selfe, that is now from my selfe; in affecting the vertuon, I must com∣mend her disposition, and in fauouring the honorable▪ I cannot mislike her discretion; and that he is honoured by me, hee maie the better be graced by her: Now, if a stranger deserue wll it maie giue an example to our Court,  to barre him his right, is a bot in courtesie: shee maie like though not loue, and hee serue though for no such reward. Moreouer, what he is we know not, and therefore let vs thinke the best, and such maie be his worth, as maie be worthie our regard. Fame is not partiall  sounding the honour of deserts; and therfore who runneth , let him winne the Bell, and weare the Garland▪ hee hath little grace in himselfe, that feareth the fortune of another, and the fresh memorie of one action bringeth in the honour of another: and for my selfe, while I liue, I will kéepe my sword, when I am gone let my sonne keepe my scepter. For Rantifo, I finde so much good in him, that I cannot but loue him; and yet not so well, but to prefer my daughter to a better fortune, and to con∣tent such of my Court as maie be agrieued at him, let me heare thy aduise for the remooue of him both from our Court, and countrey. Signor Sperto biting th lippe at thse speeches, and yet glad to heare this conclusion, made the Duke this answere: Maie it please your Maiesty to think of y• embassage you meane to sen to the Duke of the Ilands of Cotasi, touching the sum of , that hee hath long detained from you, and the disgratious an∣swere that he latelie sent you: This Gentleman your

Signor Sperto (quoth the Duke) I will not flatter thy witte, though I will loue thy counsaile, and follow thy aduise, which shall he knowne onlie to our selues: To morrow we will grace him in all we can, both in worde and countenance, so that hee shall mistrust nothing of our meaning, and forth with we will  furnish him forth in this embassage: and so Signor Sperto I will bidde thee farewell, I will for a while be priuat heere in mine Aour, I praie thée giue commandement to the Porter, that no man come to trouble me, till I returne into my cham∣ber. With which command, Signor Sperto taking his leaue left the Duke one in a close walke, vsing these few words to him∣selfe: Oh the miserie of time, what doth this wicked world bring forth▪ nothing but sinne and iniquitie: vertue more pittied then beloued, honour more enuied then accompanied, valour more commanded then rewarded, and charitie more vanished then embrased▪ Strangers should be relieued, vertue honored, honor  , and charitie beloued, but that good world      feared, or hated, vertue scor∣ned▪ honor disgraced, valour vnrewarded, and charitie vnséene. Princes cannot be themselues, for the greatest powers haue not  greatest peace, a  will trouble a Lyon, a Louse an

Oh Spo, though the  of thy deuise I will follow, for the quietof my Court, et mu I needes aie. I finde thy  against Rantifo▪   rea∣son is I knowe not, but that an     an Eagle; I know my daughter cannot affect the howsoeuer she fauour him, but would to God my sone   ome: And with that word vsing no more spéech ose vp from the seate; & r∣tired himselfe into his pallace, where I will  him to deter∣mine of his embassage, and Rantifo to   of the  of his close enemie; and I will returne againe to Penillo, sonne to the Duke Feronte, whome I left in the Courte of Ordillo his fathers enemie, fast by the heart in loue wish his   young Princesse Bilanta. Penillo the young Prince  to  he Duke of Ba∣lino, after a few daies of roiall entertainment in the Court of Ordillo, wish much contentment in the honourable secr kind∣nesse of his loue the Princesse Merilla, receiuing a fauour of her which he sware to weare in his , en he was in the field against the enemie, leaing th  a heart of golde, set full of Diamondes, tooke his iourney towards the Emperours Court, and so with him towardes his wars against the Turke, where in the face of the hole Armie, he wonne such honor by his valour, that the Emperour to shew his oue vno him, em∣braced him in his armes▪ calling him , and wishing that he were so happie as to haue a daughter  such a Prince. Well to be short, such  so honorable was his  with the Emperour, as well in his ware, as his Court, that with his valour he wonne she loue of the Emperour, and wih his kind∣nesse, the good will of all his followers, in the predicamen of which happinesse, after his roiall entertainment    he Court as all other places of the Emperours , ∣uing receiued from the Emperour two rich iewels,   a iewell of great value, which the Emperour himselfe  out of his owne hatte; the other a , the  of  there of
lately taken from the  in that seruice, with all humble thankfulnesse  making homewards with all the spéed he could, , but that he would take the Court of Ordillo ▪ where vnto his mistris he would first recount the  of his fortune▪  sweete soule as one langui∣shing for the lacke of her new loue did in his absence spende the most part of her time in praier for his prosperitie. But I will leaue further to te of their fortunes for a while, and I will re∣ , now called Rantifo, in the Court of Feroute the  of Balino. hauing set downe his determination for the sen∣ding awaie of Rantifo in his embassage, according nto the ad∣uise of Signor Sperto, walking one date into his garden, cer∣taine of his Counsaile  with him, among whome Signor Sperto cou not be spared, caused Rantifo to bee called before  with a pleased seeming countenance, he vttered this spéech; Rantifo, the loue that I haue long borne shée, the faith that I nd in thy seruice, and the much good, that I manie waies note in thee, haue made me desirous to aduance thee to that ho∣nour, that I know thou wilt deserue. I am determined to send to my vnkinde neighbour Ordillo, the Duke of the Ilandes of Cotasi, he hath béene long in my debt, and I thinke meanes to laugh me  with my money: a million of crowns will main∣taine a prettie Armie, for a sodaine piece of seruice: and since he  not , bu maketh delaies the excuse of his   I  ende thée to him, with this resolution, either to  my money, or to  him know my mind which in briefe shall e this, that I will fet  perforce, or set fire of his pal∣lace: nowe hough shou ar a stranger in our Court, yet being beloued of o selues, if thou  take it vpon thée, let vs see who dare  at ur . Rantifo   to lyg vnder a ple, the deuise of this plt in the parke,  the Duke and Signor Sperto, séeming not to know any thing thereof, and fearing the Dukes displea∣sure, if he should refuse it, made him this humble answere: My Gratious Lord, though  of your owne honour, proceede so
much goodnesse, a  so xtende your fauour vpon so smal desert, as I cannot but blush to confesse  let not the honour of your fauour towardes me, be a cause of your Nbles eart∣burning against me for though my studie hath beene somewhat in the languages, yet hath my trauaile béene so little in  so courses, as I rather feare o deiue your expectation, th i discharge the desire of my dutie: et if it please you to iose this charge vpon me, though it were with the losse of my  I would thinke it well laied downe in your seruice. Well (quoth the Duke) let it suffice the, that my loue vnto thee shall put off all causes of discontentment, that mae be in this seruice; if I fauour thée, which of my Court, that will not befriend thee? and therefore prepare thy selfe for this iourney, for I will make choise of no other: and thus ending his speech rose vp from his seate, and walking into the garden mt with his daughter the Princesse Meilla, accompanied with diuers Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court, whom saluting very gra∣tiouslie he passed by them, and taking his daughter by the hand walking aside with her into an open gréene walke, fell into this talke with her. Merilla, my loue to  I knowe thou doubtest not, and my care of thy well doing is not the least charge of my loue, and the effect thereof not the least happinesse of my life: thy brother▪ thou knowest is trauailed, God knoweth whither,  hen to returne, if God blesse him not the better: now if the perishe either in the seas, or the warres, what comfort haue I on the earth? but in thee, and in thy well doing. Thou ar now of yeares to make choise of thy happinesse in placing thy affection, and is there none in our Court that can please the in that point make thy choise where thou wilt, I will leaue thee to thy selfe, and will not crosse thee in thy comfort▪ onely be not base in thy affection, and thou shalt be grations in thy kindnesse. The Ladie (as it should seeme) hauing had some priuat con∣ference with her seruant Rantifo, of whome she had some noti of her fathers talke with Signor Sperto, about the dispatch of him from the Court, made him this humble answere: My Grati∣ous father, your carefull loue of e doth so farre binde me to
you, besides the duetie of nature, that if I should not be obedi∣ent to your will▪ I should thinke ill of mine owne; and to bee a discomfort to your kindnesse, I wish I had rather neuer béene borne; for my brother, so long as you heare no ill newes, hope of the best of him: and for the placing of my affection, it shall be onelie▪ gouerned by your fauour. But I am glad to heare you giue mee warning to beware of basenesse; for Signor Sperto would haue perswaded me not long since, that I could not bee better graced then in gracing y• vngracious, wt a world of dle wordes spent to verie little purpose: for indéede father, his wit maie be full of cunning, but I feare he is like a false apple, rot∣ten at the heart: for assure your selfe he is not ound to you in loue, that séekes to robbe you of my seruice: but wheresoeuer it shall please your Maiestie to command my content; in the heauens and your honour shall be the direction of my affection: thus hauing a little quitted Signor Spertocs kindnesse, she ended her spéech. When the Duke in some kinde of discontentment, to thinke of Iacke an Apes his moris▪dance, thus replied to his faire daughter: Well Merilla, regard euerie man in his kinde, and for that I finde him fit for some seruices, I will not suddenlie put him out of fauour, though I will thinke of him as I haue cause, and finde a time to vse him accordinglie: in the meane time laugh at his follie, & keepe thy affection for a better friend, I will a le leaue thée here among thy kinde friendes, to sollace thy selfe in this garden: and I will walke a little about my parke, with some of my counfatle. So will I leaue him a while gone into the parke, till his returne againe, into the pal∣lace, and I will tell you what fell out with the Ladies in the garden. There were thrée young gallantes of the court that had de∣termined to trie their wits to lae this ladie aboorde for her loue; vpon this agreement betwixt them that he that woon her fauour shoulde commande the other as his seruantes, and so euer after should call them. Whereupon finding now a conuenient time to trie the fortune of their aduentures, singling themselues one from the other▪ one of them hinking himself not the worst wit∣ted,
began thus to salute her. Fare Princesse how well to en∣title your worthines I know not, but if my vnworthines may haue fauour in your patience, my seruice should bee made hap∣pie in your emploiment. The Ladie not making anie shewe of disdaine, with a mo∣dest smile made him this answere. Truth néedeth no eloquence; for your kinde offer of your seruice, I wish you a better prefer∣ment, but if I should be so vaine as to trust you, wherein would you giue mee leaue to commande you? The gentleman with this sweet seeming speech halfe perswaded of nothing lesse then her fauour, with all humblenes fell into protestations so far of his affection, that if he disobeied her command, or not fulfilled her request, let him die with his ill fortune, or bee disgraced in her fauour: whereupon with great thankes she made him this answeare. Syr, for that finding the greatnes of your good wil, I would not bee thought vnkinde in my requit all, marke well what I saie vnto you. You shall neither drawe your purse for a penny, your sword against an enimy, nor your foote from this place, so that you shall be neither at cost, in feare, nor danger for me, and yet performe my request, and you shall bee assured of my fauour. The gentleman fearing that she had mocked him with some matter of small importance, made her this answere. Madame though by the slightnes of this seruice, I feare the weaknes of my fortune, yet expresse your commandement, and consider of my desert: for be it hard or easie, I will either die or do it. Then (quoth the Princesse) without further talke, you see yonder is a diall vpon the wall of my fathers window: you see the shadow vpon the diall, stand here till you see the shadow moue, and then call me to the sight of it, I desire no more for your seruice. The poore gentleman there bound by his oth to performe his protestation, fell to stare out his ees, and nere the better for his looking: whome shee had no sooner left in that poore taking, but she was set vpon by the second, whome after a great deale of i∣dle talke to little purpose, shee tooke vp in this manner. If I should thinke that you could not dissemble, I should thinke you lacked wit, and if I shoulde trust you without triall, you might
condemne me of follie, but if in regard of your protestations I should make proofe of your affection, might I presume of your performance, in making proofe of your sufficiencie. The poore man as proude of his hope, as his vnhappy friend, would refuse nothing, make no exceptions, but command and it was doone, or let it cost him his life: whereupon to abridge the tediousnes of their discourse, the put him to this péece of seruice. Sir (quoth shee) you see this Apple-tree before you, I praie you watch the ripening of them, the heate of the Sun I heare will change their colour, and fill them full of redde streakes, I praie you when you see them begin to change coloure call me, that I maie see it, and I will require no more seruice for the assurance of my fauour. The poore gentleman sworne to his taske, tooke him to his worke; where losse of his labour could get him nothing but re∣pentance: but in that gazing maze he had not stood long, but the thirde followed his fellowes, whome after much néedles talke, shée put likewise to this seruice. Sir (quoth shée) I am easilie perswaded that vpon easie pointes you woulde performe an ea∣sie péece of seruice, but had I neede of your helpe in any matter of difficultie, I maie perhaps faile of your performaunce: hee poore man as well deceiued as the rest, in the pride of his opini∣on, making the worlde but a walke, the seaes but a brooke, and wonders but trifles, in respect of that which he would do for her, receiued this commandement for his emploiment. Sir (quoth shée) you see here this tufte of grasse, watch the shooting of any one of them, and call me that I maie see the growing of them: and it is all the seruice, that I meane to put you to for all the fauour that I can afforde you. The gentleman forced either to falsifie his fayth, or to pru the third foole, tooke him to the ground where he sate downe in vaine, to see that was not possible. But while they were thus standing either in muses or mazes returned the Duke into the garden, where marueyling to beholde those gallantes in those tunes, hauing heard ye cause told his daughter, it would be some disgrace to her greatnes to offer such discourtesies, as to charge her seruantes with impossibilities▪ yet smiling at their follies,
desiring her to rolease them, which she soone granted: he called Rantifo vnto him not far off walking with a gentleman of his chamber; to whome being come before him, being disposed to be merrie with him, tolde him of his danghters handling of her sutors: but (quoth he) let me intreate thee not to make report of this qualitie in her, least it bee a hurt to her great happinesse, when such as maie be worthie her fauour, maie take dislike at her vnkindnesse. Rantifo not a little pleased to sée her so put off her gallant sui∣tors, and yet much discomforted in conceit of his departure, told the Duke, that such trials of her wit, would encrease the titles of her honour; and for himselfe, he would not wish to liue, but to honour the roialtie of his house: which the Duke séeming to take verie well at his handdes, after a fewe ordinarie Courte words, leauing his daughter with her friends and attendants, in the garden, retired himselfe into his chamber and so into his closet: where I will leaue him for a while, at his study, and his danghter in the garden faine into some talke with her seruant, wherof I will speake hereafter, and I will returne to tell you what followed of Penillo and his fortune. In this time of Penillo his being vpon the sea, comming from the Emperours Court, he met with a shippe going for Ba∣lino the chiefe cittie of his countrey, and in the shippe found one Mario Doronte, the Merchant that first brought ouer Rantifo, the Duke Ordilloes sonne into that countrey, of whom, making the shippe a while to attend him, after that hee had enquired of him of the health of the Duke Ordillo, and his faire daughter the Princesse his mistris, writing a few humble lines to his father, with a token of kindnesse to his sister, giuing somewhat to the salers, & like wise to Mario Doronte making himselfe towards the Ilandes of Cotasi, left them to the heauens blessing. This Mario Doronte being by misfortunes at sea decayed, and ha∣uing some summes of money due vnto him, in the Ilances of Balino, with his wife and two children, determining to leaue his owne countrey, and so take his habitation in some of the ci∣ties of Balino, put to sea in the shippe then going for the chiefe ci∣tie in the Ilandes: not to stand long vpon néedlesse pointes, the
winde and tide serning well, within a few daies they arriued at the Iland, in a hauen néere vnto the cittie Dolno, néere vnto the Court of the Duke Feronte. Where they had not lodged manie daies, but the decaied Merchant hauing occasion to make peti∣tion to the Duke, for meanes to come by his mony of his Cxe∣ditours, taking his wife and children with him, as well for com∣fort of their companies, as to mooue pitty in the Duke the more for their sakes, met at the Court gate with Rantifo going abroad into the parke with his mistris the young Princesse; who loo∣king well vpon the olde man, and his little familie, after a fewe questions of his fortune, and the cause of his comming thither, tooke his petition, with promise not onely to deliuer it to her fa∣ther, but in what her power coulde doe with him, to effect the spéede of his suite; and in the meane time for his reliefe gaue him a purse with two hundreth crownes. Rantifo not a little commending this gratious bounty in the young Princesse, cal∣ling to minde the crueltie of his owne fortune, and noting the miserie of his; not willing to make himselfe knowne vnto him, gaue him yet these wordes to comfort him: father, if I were not suddainly to depart hence into the Iland from whence you came, I would assure thée, much of my friendship, but I will entreat this Ladie in mine absence to followe and effect your comfort: which she willinglie promised, and after happilie effected. But ere I go anie further with the discourse of their fortunes, I will leaue them for a while, and returne to Penillo, the Duke Feronte his sonne. This gallant young Prince was no sooner landed at the coast of the Ilandes, but with great rosaltie hee was attended, and with great loie welcomed to the Court, where, how his nustris reiosced let the hearts of true louers conceius, for I can not ex∣presse: but let it suffice that, though both their contents met in one coniunction, yet fortune the sworne enemie to all felicitie, fell now to deuise crosses to their comforts: for not long had he béene there making merie with his faire mistris, but the Duke his father hauing by the decaied Merchant receiued a letter of his sonnes making toward those Ilands, whither he was forth∣with to send Rantifo vpon a discontentiue message, wrote a let∣ter
in all post to his sanne for his spéedie returne into his coun∣trey: vpon the sight whereof, not a little agrieued to leaue the Court, where he was so kindlie entertained, and especially his faire mistris the young Princesse of whom he was so déerely be∣loued, and yet preferring his fathers fauour before his owne pleasure, concealing anie cause of discontent, with thankes to the Duke for all his Roiall kindnesse, and secretlie assuring the young Princesse of his kinde, and constant affection towardes her, tooke his leaue of the whole Court, and returned home to his country. But I wil leaue him vpon his tourny homewards for a while, and returne againe to Rantifo, who was sent embas∣sadour to his owne father. Rantifo taking leaue of the Duke his master, and the faire Princesse his mistris, was now put to sea, for the Ilandes of Cotasi, leauing the decaied Merchants suit to the fauour of his afore said mistris: but ere I tell you anie further of the Mer∣chant, and his suit, I will tell you what became of Rantifo, and his fortune. Rantifo being now come to the Ilandes, and so to the Court of Ordillo, at his first comming was honourably entertained, but after the deliuerie of his message, not so kindlie welcome, yet whether for feare of a further mischiefe, or hope of vnlooked for kindnes, all discontentment was concealed, and he brought vnto the Duke, who setting his eie well vpon him, began in himselfe to finde some what in his aspect that did so much content him, that his embassage did not so dislike him, but his presence did much more please him: wherupon he gaue commandement to haue him well lodged and to his place in all duties entertai∣ned. But Rantifo after that he had deliuered his embassage, be∣ing answered that the Duke desired time to determine of his answere, writ home to his master of the Dukes answere to his demand, and vpon answere that he should stay the limits of his delaie, he tooke his lodging as néere as he could to the Court, where he might sée out of his window the Ladie Bilanta his si∣ster the young Princesse, walking in the garden of a Ladie that had a house neere adsoyning to the Court, whose doore ope∣ning into the garden of the house where he was lodged, he tooke
occasion one faire euening to stand in the doore where she passed by, and noting a kinde of gratious glaunce toward him, he ad∣ventured to saute her with this kind of gréeting: Swéete aire, sweete flowers, and so swéete a creature, is not this a Paradise if there be anie on this earth? Indéede my Lord, answered the Princesse, a swéete spirit in a sweete nature, can finde sweete humour, but I praie you what hath mooued you to this sweete kinde of salutation? Her vnknowne brother, not minding yet to be knowne, replied againe, Madame, your selfe is the grace of all the good that I speake of: and if you would let me flatter you with particulars I would tell you as much as you alreadie knowe; but if the worde of a stranger maie go currant in your Court, will you vouthsafe my seruice the fauour of your enter∣tainment? The Ladie smiling at his plaine kinde of loue ma∣king, and yet loath to put him to silence with a sulle in kinde of answere, tolde him, that men of his place had their wits other∣wise emploied, then in trying the weak humours of weomen▪ yet quesh she, my Lorde, if I were worthie such a seruant, I would not doe dishonour to a stranger; but is it possible that your Lordship can spende thus much breath, but to passe awaie idle time? Truely Madam, answered the embassadour, though I desire not to bee thought a wanton, yet I assure you for my vnfained affection to your worthinesse, since the first houre that I saw you I haue not left to thinke of you, and am so glad here to sée you, that wherein my seruice mate purchase your content, it shall not be slacke in your commandement. My Lorde an∣swered the Princesse, Cupid hath but a blinde sight, and hot af∣fections are soone quenched, but if your word and thought agrée, you maie in time be quited in your kindnes. When as the Lord embassadour was about to replie vnto her spéech, a messenger came suddenlie vnto her from the Duke her father, presentlie to come to him, whereupon with humble thankes for her kinde fauour they brake off their talke for that time, she going to the Duke, and he backe againe into his lodging, where I will raue them for a while, and returne againe to tell you what fell out in the Court of Feronte the Duke of the Ilads of Balino. The young Princesse gladde that this decaied Merchant had
such a suite to her father, tolde him that if vpon he dispatch of his petition, and receipt of his money, hee would returne into his country, and conuaie her ouer with him as a seruant to his wife, she would effect such expedition as should be fullie to his content: The poore man hauing receiued such bountifull reliefe at her handes, as bound him much to her seruice, putting all feare aside of what hurt might befall him, if it were descried, pro∣mised her to doe his best in all the seruice hee could deuise her: whereupon to be briefe, she became a suter to her father for the Merchant, and by her humble importuning his comfort, gat his grant dispatched, which no sooner was effected, but with all the spéede that might be, carrying crownes enough to defray all charges, in the apparell of a prentise, that the Merchant had got for the purpose, finding a shippe ready to put to sea for that coun∣trey, stole awaie in a night tide, and with a merrie Gale soone gat to the shore that they made for. But nowe will I leaue to talke further of them, for a while, and I will tell you a fewe wordes of the occurrents in the Court of Feronte the Duke of the Ilands of Balino. The young Prince being now returned home, and with great ioie receiued of the whole Court, the Duke in no little maruell that his daughter was so long absent, sent vnto her lodging to knowe the cause of her staie, but the messenger returning with no bodie there, and now fearing that his strange embassadour had stolne awaie his faire daughter, caused present search to be made for her in all his prouince; but hearing of no word of her, grew into such a rage, as not able to haue patience to heare his sonne touching the Roialtie of his entertainment, sware pre∣sentlie to leuie an Armie, and in regard of his indignitie to bee reuenged of the whole countrey: and with this resolution went forward. But I will leaue him in his choler nowe bent to no∣thing but reuenge, and I will tell you a few wordes of the mer∣chant and his companie. The decaied Merchant nowe by the meanes of the young Princesse hauing made a happie voiage, comming on shore with his familie, and this new page or rather prentise, mette by great happe with the Lord embassadour that was sent from the
Duke Feronte, in a discōtentiue message, walking with the La∣die Princesse his sister, and an attendant or two of hers onelie going forth of a Castle of the Duke her fathers néere that place, onlie to take a little pleasure in séeing the comming in of the shippes: and doing reuerence to the whole troupe the young Prineesse called the Merchant vnto her with these wordes. Alas good Mario, how doest thou, how hast thou sped with thy businesse: what? didst thou carrie thy wife and children with thee, how daredst thou to aduenture them? Truely I am glad thou art come home safe againe with them, I knowe thou arte poore, and for my selfe thou knowest I am yet not my selfe, but if I liue I will doe thée and thy kinde wife some good, for I haue knowne yée both of a childe, and haue had manie a prettie iewel of yee, for which, I hope one daie to requite thee: Thine honesty will be pittied, and shall not bee forgotten, my remembrance maie doe thee good; and for that I know not how thou art furni∣shed for money holde thee, take this purse at my handes a h∣dreth crownes will doe thée no hurt, though not the good I wish thée. But what prettie boy is that thou hast with thée? The mer∣chant with teares of thankfull kindnesse receiuing her bounty, tolde her that it was a prettie youth of the Ilands of ,  hauing a desire to sée that country came with him in the , desiring him to put him to some good master; at which wos, he embassador looking stedfastly vpon him, & remembring his ∣stris, asked of the Merchant if he would bestow him vpon him. The Merchant knowing the Pages minde, was verie well content with his demande, and asking the Page if hee woulde make choise of him for his master, séemed verie willing to agr thereto, when the Ladie no lesse firing her eie vpon the Pge then the embassadour, and no lesse affecting him then hee did, with a modest countenance made this speech vnto him. My Lord, you know your aboade in this countrie is not cer∣taine, and this prettie wagge comming hither, either to se he countrie, or to learne the languages, if he should returne with you, he might be little benefitted by his trauaile; but if it  please you to bestowe your good will on me for him, I will tae that regarde of him, that he shall not repent him of his seruice.
Madame (quoth the embassadour) if I should deny you so smal a request, hauing so great an interest in my seruice, you might well mistrust me in a matter of more importance, if I shoulde faile you in this. The page vnknowne to anie but the merchant and his familie, who had sworne secrecy in her behalfe, hauing no time to meditate what to doo, and seeing her seruaunt the embassadour, now as it were in loue with an other Ladie, was content to accept the Ladies kind offer, and so leauing the mer∣chant well recompensed for all his kindnesse; attended them to the Dukes Castle: where I will leaue the embassadoure after leaue taken of his mistris the young Princesse his sister, yet vnknowne, going to his lodging, and I will tell you a little of the Ladie and her new page, as great a person as her selfe. The Princesse looking of tentimes vppon her page, and fin∣ding in his feature a great resemblance of her loue her brother, willed a tailer to be sent for, whome shee commanded against the next morning, to bring her a péece of white satten, of which should be made a sute of apparrell for the page, and so comman∣ding the boie to attende her vnto her chamber, shee called for a lute, which, hearing of him vpon demand of his qualities, that hee had some little skill in, willed him to make her a little mu∣sick, which both in his touch, and voice, she liked so well, that she began excéedinglie to fauour him: but after musick donne she willed the boie to walke into the garden, and there gather such flowers, or such fruites, as best might like him, and in the mor∣ning she would put him out of his prentice sue, which hee wil∣linglie did, and hauing gathered a handfull of roses, & plucking off an apple called a Pomeroie; hee returned in to his mistris the Princesse lodging, who at a windowe noting his solemne kind of walking, and the fruit that he gathered, after his com∣ming vp called him into her chamber. But first let me tell you a little of the pages spéech that he had to himselfe in the garden, per he went vp. Oh poore Merilla, what a misery art thou falne into? left thy countrie, thy father, thy friendes, and all thy home fortune, to followe a stranger, who hath betraied thy affection, and abu∣sed thy fauour: women are said to haue their willes wauer as
the wind: but oh false Rantifo, no sooner come to the Sea, but thy loue is gone into an other worlde; Rantifo, no thou art Fan∣tiro, the Dukes sonne, whatsoeuer be shy conceit to conceale it from thy father, and Bilanta is thy sister, howsoeuer thou hast made her thy mistris. But alas, what will become of thée? when thy mistris shall know thée to be thy selfe, how will shee vse thée? if I reueale what I am, can she other then disdaine the? our pa∣rents being scarce friends, if thou reuealest the cause of thy com∣ming, will shée not laugh at thy foslie, & make it knowne to the worlde? if she do not, it is more of the heauens blessing, then thy merite, and of her good nature, then thy wit. Saie that now shee doth somewhat like of thee, shee maie bee then out of loue with thee: and yet it maie be that for her loue to her brother she maie be kind to me, and at my humble entreatie, conceale my follie from the worlde: well, I will hope the best, till I sée the worst▪ And so determining to make her selfe knowne to her mistris, she went vp into her lodging, where being come to the princesse she fell againe to her musike, wherein she did so please the Prin∣cesse, that she thought euerie houre a yéere till she had some pri∣uate conferance with him, for which she stated not long; fo af∣ter that she had commanded all her attendants out of the cham∣ber but the page, willing him to laie downe his lute,   aboore with him in this maner. My prettie wag, if thy  should haue occasion to employ thee in a secret paece of seruice, wouldest thou so late it vp in thy bosome, that no man shoulde perceiue it? Madame (quoth the page) for my secree, I holde it not the least part of mine honesty, and therefore make you no doubt of it, but if my sufficiencie answeare not your expect∣on, I beseech you let mee entreate your pardon, assuring your honour that I shall hate my selfe in slacking my dutie in your seruice: but good Madame be not angrie if my good will bee not fortunate; for my heart I protest, you haue bound it to you, in the faith of much affection. The Ladie not a little pleased with this spéech gaue him this hind answeare. Thy affection is the best part of the seruice that I will desire at thy handes, for to tell hee trueth, I neuer same the face, but one that I liked so well, or could thinke to loue but
thine, and for him, hee was a noble personage, son and heire to the Duke Feronte of the Ilandes of Balino, who is latelie gone home, and I feare will neuer come againe; such heartburning is growne betwixt our parentes, vppon the paiment of a little monte, vngodlie kind of drosse, the cause of much mischiefe in the world; therefore I must haue patience with my passion, for euer hoping of comfort at his hands: but for his sake whose fea∣ture me thinkes I beholde in thy face, I did first affect thee, and do nowe for his, and thine owne sake I must confesse entirelie loue thée: be wise therefore I charge thée, for in reuealing my loue it maie endanger thy life, & in concealing thy comfort, thou shalt finde the honour of thy fortune. The Page with a great sigh at his brothers absence, but more agrieued at the discord of the two Dukes, with her eies readie to shedde teares, made her this humble answere: Good Madam, shall I humblie begge this fauour at your hands, that you will vouchsafe to keepe secret, what I will commit vnto the onelie care of your honourable kindnes, wherein you maie ei∣ther saue my life, or procure my death? Sweete boie, quoth the Princesse, let me not liue, but I will doe more for thy loue then I will speake of: and for my secresie, suspect nothing that maie hurt thee, and speake freelie, wherin I maie do thee good, thinke I cannot vse thee vnkindlie. Then good Madam, answered the Princesse, I will tell you a strange yet true tale: The em∣bassadour that seemeth to bee your louer, is your brother, sonne to the Duke your father, his name is Fantiro, sought to be slaine by a murtherer hired there to by your vncle lately dead, but to saue his life sought by the malice of your vngodly vncle, was deliuered vnto the decated Merchant Mario, who brought him as a Page to our Court, I meane the Court of Feronte, the Duke of Balino my father; whose daughter I am brought ouer in this habit that you sée, onlie to come to the sight of your brother my onlie beloued Lord on this earth. Your brother for my loue, was by a wretch in our Court wrought hither to this embassage, but such was his cariage in our Court, as from his first setling foote into fauour, he dailie encreased it, by his much well deseruing; so that there was no man of good spirit, but lo∣ued
him, and were sorrie to part with him, and for my affection to him, let my trauaile witnesse my truth: Nowe for the loue that in nature you beare your brother, for the kindnes that you maie finde requited in my brother, for the honor that you beare vnto loue, and for the loue that you beare vnto honour; let me humblie beseech you to conceale my follie, and in what you may to be a friend to my affection. The Princesse with a modest blush smiling at her discourse, made her this kinde and gratious answere: Sister, for so will I loue thee and estéeme thee, as I cannot be happy in any thing vnder heauen, but in thy brothers loue, which I holde as déere as my life, so if my brother doe not in all honourable seruice ei∣ther requite or deserue this thy kindnesse, I protest to renounce him for my brother, and detest him as mine enemie: be there∣fore of good chéere, an feare no euill: thy fortune shall be mine, my bedde, my table, my purse, yea and my heart shall be all at thy disposing to doe thee good. And thus will I leaue them togi∣ther in their kinde talke, and I will tell you a little of the Duke Feronte, and his sonne. The Duke Feronte, in no little rage to thinke of the losse of his daughter, notwithstanding that he had heard his sonnes re∣port of his Roiall entertainment, followed on his determina∣tion, for his intended warre against the Duke Ordillo, where his embassadour was too well to returne, and his faire daugh∣ter was taken loues prisoner, and therefore calling his sonne before him vsed these wordes vnto him: Penillo, I haue made thee acquainted with my resolution for my reuenge of y• wrong, that I haue receiued of Ordillo; out of whose countrey, I will fetch my fond daughter thy vnhappie sister, either dead or aliue, and therefore prepare thy selfe to put off all conceit of his kind∣nes, and gaine the encrease of my loue, by the honour that thou shalt get vpon mine enemie. The young Prince, sorie to haue such cause to carrie armes against the father of his faire mistris, and yet vnwilling to be disobedient to his father, though it were the aduenture of his death, did humblie frame him this answere: My Gratious fa∣ther, I would be loath to disswade you from your setled resolu∣tion,
but yet let me tell you, that although loue hath in my sister wrought a follie, shall the malice of a wicked spirit so poison your eare, that such a furie possesse your heart, that no sparke of patience can haue place in your conceit? It will bee thought to the greatest part of your Court, yea and almost to your whole countrey, that Signor Sperto hath béene the kindler of all this fire, and the bréeder of all these warres: I wonder not a little that your Grace coulde endure to heare of his presumption, in making loue to my sister; who I thinke bee rather runne into another countrey to trie the fortune of her affection, then to liue at home to abide the vnfitting suite of so ilfauoured a crea∣ture: whom, but that he hath the name of a man, if I did not the better know him, I should surelie take for a monster. But if I maie begge so much fauour of your Grace, as to grant me my humble suite, I beséech you beginne iustice at home, and I hope we shall prosper the better abroad: Let Sperto in regard of his malicious practise against a stranger, and presumption in trou∣bling the patience of your daughter, be openlie called before you, reprehended for his follie, and banished your Court for his offence, and I doubt not but your maiestie shall sée the venome of his vile nature droppe out in his right kinde, my sister hono∣rablie returned to your good fauour, and your warres turne to such a peace, as all that loue you shall be glad of. I speake not this like ye Prince of Pigmeies that should be affraid of Cranes, but that I will attend you in your warres, where I hope an ho∣nourable triumph will be better then a bloudie conquest: but fall what will, I will not liue but to bee obedient to your loue: and therefore will be readie, when it shall please you to attende you. The Duke not a little noting the good counsaile of his discréet sonne, willing his son to be in readines, against a daie shortlie after appointed him, caused Sig. Sperto forthwith to be brought before him, to whome with a sterne countenance he vsed this spéech: Sperto, I haue long giuen eare to thine vnsuspected sub∣tiltie, but of late hauing sounded the reach of thy conceit, I will laie open thy cunning: in the time of Rantifoes being in our Courte, thou couldest neuer cease to ring in mine eares some
couse of dislike in him, which I tooke well at thy handes, in re∣garde of thy imagined care of my good; but nowe I finde the ground of thy vngratious working grewe from the malicious feare in thee, of his fauour from my faire daughter, whom thy vnworthie selfe wouldst haue bewitched wt wicked eloquence, let me tell thée, for that I haue in some occasions of importāce, made good vse of thy seruice, thou shall not be vnregarded, for I will make thee receiuer of my customes: but for thy saucines with my swéete daughter, driuen out of our countrey by thy dogged meanes, I will out of hande, haue thee made an u∣nuch; and so commanding one of his Surgeons, to take him to his charge, to dismember him of his implements, fell in hande presentlie with his Counsaile, to go forwardes with his resolu∣tion for his warres: while Sperto with the conceit of his mise∣rie, crauing leaue of the Surgeon to spare him till the next morning, when his griefe being put a little ouer, he should with the more strength endure his torment, rather desirous to go to hell quicklie, then to hope for heauen with repentance, with a paire of his owne garters hangde himselfe in his owne cham∣ber. But leauing thus the wicked wretch to his wofull end, and the furious Duke in his inerorable anger, procéeding onwards with his warres: I will tell you a fewe wordes of the two La∣dies Merilla and Bilanta, the imagined page that I left togther in their chamber within a Castle of the Duke Ordillo. The Ladie Bilanta, after she had secretlie conferred with the Ladie Merilla, touching both their loues, minding to make her selfe merrie with a prettie conceit, after that they had past a night or two in priuat talke togither how to bring all matters about to their best contentment, sent for the embassadour her brother, in all kindnesse spéedelie to come to her; who no sooner receiued the message, but laying all businesse apart, came to his sister, whom he then called mistris, little thinking indeed to haue found his true beloued, and louing mistris so neere. But being come into her lodging and well entred into her chamber, com∣manding apart all her attendantes, shee thus fell into talke with him. Seruant, though perhaps it maie séeme immodestie in a
Uirgin of my sort to giue such entertainment to a stranger of what sort soeuer he maie be, as I am perswaded your honoura∣ble kindnesse will deserue; yet let me entreat you one fauour to tell me without dissembling, if I am the first obiect of your dée∣rest affection, or whether you neuer haue had anie mistris that you haue helde anie especiall account of, and hath worthilie had the promise of your loue? Truely Madame answered her bro∣ther, as hee thought vnknowne to her, I must confesse I had a mistris whom I so deerely loued, and so duelie serued, that had I anie possible hope to enioie the fruit of her fauour, I shoulde hate my selfe in the loue of anie other, but shee being so farre from the comfort of all such conceit, I thinke it no dishonour to my loue, to doe seruice to the vertue that I finde in you: for if I coulde be so vile as to thinke you a base thought death bee the rewarde of my desire, and to presume further in the best na∣ture of honour, then maie stande with your good fauour, might condemne mee of follie, and perhaps ouerthrowe my fortune, but in such good termes to doe you seruice as maie please you to accept, I thinke it a duetie in Chiualrie: but for my mistris I protest had you euer seene and knowne her, you would haue thought as much good of her as I do, and wish her as much hap∣pinesse as I want. The Ladie smiling at this answere, would néedes know her name, and whence she was: who tolde her that she was the on∣lie daughter of his master the Duke Feronte, her name was Merilla, and she was the likest vnto the Page that she lately had from the Merchant, that euer she sawe: Well (quoth the Lady) no longer my Lord embassadour, but déere brother, I am glad to sée thee heere, for thou art my brother, and that shall my fa∣ther knowe ere long: thy mistris is more worthie of honour, then our whole countrey and thy life can giue her: and with that worde, Page quoth she to the Ladie Merilla, I praie thée take thy lute and play and sing thy wish: which she being in the cham∣ber vnséene by meanes of a curtein of Crimsin damaske drawn betwixt them, tooke her lute and plaied a note to a dittie, which she sung as followeth.
The song. I Would thou wert not faire, or I were wise: I would thou hadst no face, or I no eies: I would thou wert not wise, or I not fond, Or thou not free, or I not so in bond. But thou art faire, and I cannot be wise: Thy sunlike face, hath blinded both mine eies; Thou canst not be but wise, nor I but fond, Nor thou but free, nor I but still in bond. Yet am I wise to thinke that thou art faire, Mine eies, their purenesse in thy face repaire; Nor am I fond, that doe thy wisedome see: Nor yet in bond, because that thou art free. Then in thy beautie onely make me wise, And in thy face, the Graces guide mine eies: And in thy wisedome onely see me fond: And in thy freedome keepe me still in bond. So shalt thou still be faire, and I be wise: Thy face shine still vpon my cleered eies: Thy wisedome onely see how I am fond: Thy freedome onely keepe me still in bond. So would I thou wert faire, and I were wise: So would thou hadst thy face, and I mine eies: So would I thou wert wise, and I were fond: And thou wert free, and I were still in bond. The song was no sooner ended but Fantiro (for so wil I hence∣forth giue him his right name) oftentimes changing coloure, as one in many passions at the hearing both of her voice, which
was so like his mistris the Ladie Princesse Merilla, as might be; and remembring the dittie to be of his owne compiling, and that in secret he had giuen it vnto her when hee first perceiued her fauour, alter he had commended her voice, as he was about to speake somewhat of his passion, his sister vppon the sodeine caused the curtein to bee drawne, when hee might see in a riche suite of her apparrell, the imagined page; but in deede his mi∣stris standing by a windowe, with her face towards him: when his sister seeing him stande as one amazed, vsed this spéech vnto him. Why, how now brother? doth thy heart faile thee? how dost thou like this sight? thou hast I knowe often heard that a girle will turne to a man, and is it then vnpossible, that a boie maie as well turne to a woman? What ailest thou, dost thou feare thou seest a shadowe and not the true body of thy mistris? or hast thou beene false vnto her in thy faith? and therefore art feareful of the heauens displeasure to plague thee, with some worse spi∣rit, then thine own? for shame go to her, bid her welcome, it is thy mistris, I do not dissemble, be thankfull for her kindnesse, and deserue her loue. The young Prince ashamed anie longer to stande in his maze, séeing his mistris in little better tune, to behold her ser∣uant,  assured louer so strange vnto her, as if he either had not, or would not haue known her, went vnto her with these words. Madame, thinke it not strange to see me in this perpleritie of minde, that I am in, so much is my vnworthines of this, and manie your honourable fauoures, but especiallie this triall of your affection hath so bounde mee to your seruice, as if the ad∣uenture of my life maie make proofe of my loue, let me die like a villaine, if I do not honour your vertue. The sweet Lady with modest kindnes as much as she could concealing the greatnes of her ioe, as well in beholding her loue, as hearing his vndoubted true protestations, made him this sweete replie. My deare loue, for so dare I heere tearme you, when I had no knowledge of that title of honour, that now I heare and am glad to vnderstand dulie belongeth to you, my loue was in the same nature that now it is: your vertue wonne my affection, and your kindnesse continued my content, your
noble cariage assured me of your constancie, & al togither haue brought mee hither to receiue my comforte, not caring to loose the loue of father, brother, & friend, honour, wealth, ease, & all o∣ther worldes happines, that Balino could haue procured me, to aduenture the Seaes, in the poore habite of a Prentise, in the ser∣uice of a poore decayed Merchant, to come into a strange coun∣trie, to abide what fortune soeuer might befall me, onelie to ac∣quaint your kindnes with my loue. Nowe if your greatnesse haue not altered your goodnesse, nor my immodesty haue with∣drawne your affection, thanke your honourable sister for her kindenes towardes mee, and bee your selfe, your selfe vnto me. The young Prince with as much adoo as could be to abstaine from teares of kindnes, to thinke of this seldome seene fayth∣full affection in so faire a creature, made her this comfortable replie. Sweet Princesse, in whome nature vnder the heauens hath shewed the pride of her perfections: how shoulde I liue to counteruaile the least part of this your exceeding honorable f∣uour. Had I ten such Dukedomes, I would lay them al at our feete, and were I the greatest Prince on the earth, I would  gladde to bee your seruant: but as in regarde of your first af∣fection, I am bounde to honour you with my seruice: so for  your last honour, my loue I vow shall euer serue you:   laie by all thought of strangers: this land is youres, my father I know will reioyce in you, my selfe vnder heauen, will haue no oie but you: for I protest without dissembling my  ioie is wholie in you. And thus will I leaue these louers with the other Ladie in this their secret hinde conference,  I will tell you, what followed of Mario the decayed Mer∣chant. This Mario the Merchant, hearing newes in the Citty, that the Duke Feronte was comming from Balino, with a great Ar∣mie against the Duke Ordillo and his country, thought good no longer to conceale the Embassadoure his sonne from him, and therefore comming to the Court, and hauing obtained meanes to haue some priuate conference with the Duke, in fewe wordes deliuered the discourse of all that I before haue recited,
both of his escape from the intended murther of his malicious Uncle, of his carrying him ouer, of his preferment in Court by him, and of the cause of his comming thither in Ambassage: all which recounted truly as it was, with the comming ouer of the Ladie Merilla in the attire of a Prentise, for the loue of his son Fantiro, so pleased the Duke, that he not onelie kindly gaue him thankes, but richly rewarded him for his good newes, and rosal∣tie considered all his honest, and kinde dealing: and presentlie caused his sonne the Ambassadour to be sent for, whom he wel∣comed with such a soie, as such a father might such a son. Who hauing recounted all his fortune, his father the Duke caused his sister the young Princesse to be sent for, to whom he not on∣lie gaue thankes for her carefull, and kinde vsage of the young Princesse Merilla, but charged her vpon his blessing to conti∣nue all kindnesse, that might giue her knowledge of the oifull loue that shee should finde both in himselfe, his Court, and his whole countrey: and that for a fewe daies shee should seeme to conceale it from her, that he knewe of her being in his Court, till he had made preparation euerie waie fit for the entertain∣ment of her presence. And thus will I leaue the Ladies passing their time together in priuate conference of their thiefest com∣fortes, and I will returne to the Duke Feronte nowe hauing gotten his forces togither, marching with his whole Armie to∣wardes the sea, minding to make for Cotasi, where nothing should content him but a conquest. The Duke resolued vpon his determination, either to leaue his bloud, or take his reuenge, dispatching awaie a post with letters to his embassadour for the defiance of his termed ene∣mie the Duke, and proclamation of warre with him and his whole countrey, calling his sonne vnto him, vpon a rocke on the sea side in the middest of his Armie made this speech vnto his people. The long iniurie that I haue borne at the handes of my vnfriendlie neighbour Ordillo, besides the debt that hee oweth me, and neuer intendeth to paie me, togither with my extreme griefe for the losse of my onely daughter, that onelie through a fonde affection carried I know not how; to a stranger I know not whom, coueied away by a banbrout, or decaied merchant,
if I maie better terme him into that vngratious piece of ground where Ordillo hath his gouernment: these I safe with manie other iust causes of discontentment conceiued against y• proude Prince and his stubborne people, haue caused me to put on the resolution either of death or reuenge, which shall no waie ende but in conquest or submission; as manie therefore as ei∣ther regarde our loue, or haue anie hope of our fauour, let them with willing heartes followe the honour of my resolution, pro∣testing that whatsoeuer he bee, that shall in the least shewe of feare turne his backe vnto the enemie, if hee were as déere to me as mine owne sonne, he shall die in the place where I finde him: but hee that shall with the fortune of his forwardnesse, bring me the Duke or his soune either dead or aliue, I will so regard and reward him, that he shall leaue honour to his poste∣ritie: the winde serueth well for our passage, and we shall finde them perhaps vnprouided for our comming, so the easier will be our victorie and the shorter our warres, if not the sharper our fight, the greater will be our honor, and since feare is the badge of villanie, let vs auoide the shame of such condition and as manie as loue either our crowne or countrey, holde vp their handes with me: who then in the whole campe, that had a hand, but he would holde it vp? Well to grow towardes an ende, as the Prince said, so said the people: the Duke set foote aboord, and all the Armie followed him: the winde serued, the sales were hoised, and the anchors weied, and awaie they went where I will leaue them for a while, and returne againe to Or∣dillo the Duke of Cotasi and his sonne, Feronte his embassa∣dour. The post hauing béen with the embassadour as he thought, but now rather an enemie then a friend, if this quarrell should go forwarde, perceiuing the intent of the Duke his late ma∣ster, rather chusing to be an vnkinde seruant, then an vnnatu∣rall sonne, wrote vnto him, that the case was altered, hee had nowe chosen an other master, whose loue hee knewe was such vnto him, that seruing him faithfullie, woulde not vse him vn∣kindlie: his embassage was deliuered, and nowe this must bee his answere, as in kindnesse hee might command much, so by
the contrarie as little; his comming was more expected then feared, and his welcome should be as he deserued: and for him∣selfe, if his fortune were to his hope, he should find a kinder ser∣uant, then he had done a master: with these and such like conclu∣sions, dispatched awaie. The young Prince, presentlie went to his father the Duke Ordillo, with whom and his Counsaile conferring vpon the ser∣uice speedelie to bee had care of, taking order by vertue of his Commission, to leuie a great Armie, as well to encounter the enemie, as in diuerse places of strength to stand for defence, if anie occasion should be offered, being secure for anie feare, or doubt to be ouertaken, hearing by a Pinnis, that being at sea deseried the fléete so farre, as by meanes of crosse windes, and ill weather, they could not in fiue daies come néere the shore of their countrey, after he had a little reposed himselfe, after his trauaile, considering the great discomfort that his mistris the young Princesse might take vpon the rumour of these warres, making all the meanes hee could to haue it kept from her hea∣ring, tooke a conuenient time to go to his sister, with whome his mistris as yet remained. But as such kinde of persons most inquisitiue of newes are not without their intelligencers, so fell it out, that the post was scarce at the Court, but his mes∣sage was knowne to the young Ladies, hose priuate confe∣rence vpon the same, before Fantiroes comming to them, was as followeth. Merilla considering the manie sorrowes that were now like to fall vpon her, the assurance of her fathers displeasure, the doubt of her brothers loue, and the feare of the young Prince her seruantes death in the seruice, was euen so appauled, that (following the humours of women) first to sigh for a little griefe of disobedience in nature, then enfolding her armes, as lamenting the doubted losse of her brothers loue, and last of all, wéeping with feare to loose the comfort of all her worldes hope, in her déere beloued and kinde louing Lorde, in the misfortune of the warres, was by the young Princesse her seruants sister comforted with these wordes. Sister, so will I nowe terme thee, for so doe I holde thee,
and so doe I hope to haue thee, and so will I euer loue shee; take not too much griefe at anything, that either feare or doubt may put into thy head, let this comfort thee, that thou art not alone in thy miserie: if thou hast left a father, thou hast found a friend, and if thou hast lost a brother, thou hast found a sister, choler and melancholie gouernes the spirits of the aged, but kindnesse and mirth should be the humours of our yeares: nature biddes you loue your father, so you maie though you do not liue with him; but loue biddes you liue with your friende, which you can not if you be from him; and let me tell you, that a well as I séem to beare it out, I am stoong at the heart as well as you. I loue your brother as deerely as I can deuise, but for his affection, I had little time to hope of, and too little time to enoie. Nowe my father I loue, as you doe yours, but your brother I cannot loue as you doe mine, for I cannot enioie his presence, as you doe my brothers: you feare the fortune of the warres, and I both fortune and the wars. I would my case were yours or as yours, that fortune would do her worst, so I had but my loue to looke on: be therefore content, put off this mourning, this warre maie bréede a blessed peace, for when the Princes are both in the field, my wits shal faile me, but I wil plot such a piece of seruice, as hath neuer been heard of before, and I beleeue once executed, will not be forgotten in hast. The other young Princesse much comforted to haue such a companion in her crosses, and that the heauens did fauour her affection, or else fortune would not haue bin so kind to her in her aduentures, taking a little hart of grace, loath to die with conceit, wtout greater cause then she yet had, for though her head was much troubled with imaginati∣ons, yet nothing came so néere her heart, but a looke of her loue would put it quite out of place, yet with a little kinde of heau∣nesse made her this answere. Good Madame, if the miseries were far greater that I endure, then I hope they euer will be, yet of such force are the perswasions that you haue vsed vno me, that I should beare them with such patience, that I should forget much of the paine: but yet so manie are the thoughtes of griefe in my head, that but for the comfort of your honourable kindnesse, would doe me but a little good in my heart: I must
confesse loue is the life of the heart, but what is the daie that comes but like lightening? little better then darke night. You cannot mourne so much for the lacke of your hope, as I for the losse of my happinesse; your loue maie bee forcible for the time, but it is not of so long continuance as mine, and for that the eie sees not, the heart grieues not; you feare the fortune of the warres, and I wishe for nothing but peace. But sister, since you will haue it so, and I would it were so, euerie waie that you wishe, till the warres bee determined I can be at no quiet, for if my brother die, you loose your loue, if your brother perish, what ioie haue I in the world? if fortune fauour my fa∣ther, my comfort will be little with my affection, and if your fa∣ther haue the fielde, downe goes the honour of my house: so that I can no waie sée how it can go so well, but wofull will bee the issue of what fortune soeuer befall: but good Madam, if there be anie humour in your heade, that maie giue comfort to my heart, I beséech you acquaint me with some little sparke of your conceit. I will quoth Merilla her sworne sister: and as she was begin∣ning to vtter some part of her minde, her brother Fantiro the young Prince came in, who with a kinde Congee, lacking no Grace to entertaine time with such Gratious creatures, fin∣ding them in alike tunes for their humours, some what too néere maidens melancholie, hoping to remooue it with a Corpus ha∣beas, fell aboord with them in this manner: Ladies all, faire fortunes befall you, what fowle weather doe you dreame of, that makes you droope so in your countenance? I hope sister, you are not affraid of sparrow-blasting, and for my swéete mistris, I would I knew the cause of her discontent, I would soone pro∣cure her comfort. The Ladie with a merrie goe sorrie not yet hauing fullie ac∣quainted him with her loue to Penillo, the Duke Feronte his sonne, nowe comming in Armes against her father, made him this answere: Brother, my sister and I am both sicke of one disease, I would we might both alike haue remedies: but these wicked warres haue put vs both in such a flight, that till they be at a point, we are not like to be at rest: her brother as déere
to me, as she to you, I haue no cause to hope euer to enfoie, so manie are my perswasions thereto, you are not yet possessed though beloued, and maie bee lost though neuer enioied, so our crosse carding gets nothing but sorrowe, our heads are so full of doubts, and our heartes so full of feares, I speake for my si∣ster as my selfe. Well answered Fantiro, for my mistris let her be comforted with this, that my life I mate léese, but shee my loue neuer; and for your feares and doubtes, they are incident to your natures, and therefore you maie the better awaie with them. But déere mistris, quoth he, turning to Merilla, bee not dismaied at anie thing, feare nothing, the praiers of a Uirgine are excéedinglie effectiue, I am perswaded, if anie liue in the fielde, the lot would fall to me and your brother: for our loues and your praiers cannot but prosper togither. And for my loue thus much will I saie to satisfie all conceit of your imaginati∣on, that so honourable is the nature of my affection, and so gra∣tious the honor of your vertue, that I should hate my selfe, if I should offend you; but in doing you seruice, shall bee my resol∣ued happines. Time giues me not leaue to solemnize the rights of our desires, & therefore will I attend the issue of my fortune▪ to performe the care of my duetie, ere with the hasting of my happines, I maie displease the honour of your patience:  meane time, assuring my selfe, that my sister will be to you as a second selfe, I will leaue you to her kinde companie  you maie heare further of my wished comfort. His mistris the young Princesse not a little pleased with this spéech of his. wherein taking her chiefe notes in the assu∣rance of his neuer dying loue, the prosperitie of the Uirgines praiers, & the patience of his affection to attend the issue of his fortune, with a heart as full of greefe, as her eies wéeping  could conceale, made him this short answeare. My deere loue, in the midst of extremities hope is the comfort of the  ▪ and though I see no perswasion of comfort in the issue of these warres; yet will I not despaire of the blessing of a peace▪ let my life march with thy loue, and my praiers with thy acts, and if the fates be not too frowarde, I will hope the best of thy fortune: and for your patience, it is a proofe of your constanci;
and for your care in committing me to your sister, it is the true witnesse of kindnesse in your selfe. What shall I saie? if wee were not women, we shoulde haue hearts like men; but as we are, giue vs leaue to shew our weakenes, till we be comforted with your happines: and for that I know, your carefull experi∣ence is not a little comforte to your father, in this action, I will entreat you if it maie be, not to thinke of me, till I maie come to you, which in the warres is vnfit, and in peace is yet vn∣likely. His Sister withall came in with her fiue pennie-moice in this manner. Brother, though you cannot bee out of loue, yet now you are in hand with other matters, trouble not your selfe with thinking of vs, till neede be: forget not your selfe, and we will not forgette you; followe your businesse, let vs alone with your humoures: the powers of heauens bring all to a good ende. The young Prince with a thankfull Amen to their prayer, tooke his leaue of them both and returned to the Court, where I will leaue him with his father, preparing for his Armie, and the two Ladies in their chamber, parting stakes in conceites, and I will returne to Feronte the Duke of Balino, and his son Penillo, who with a great Armie were in sight of lande, but for some politique occasions to take the benefite of time, did anker all nighte in the Road before the Harbour; at which time the young Prince desious, by some resolute aduenture, to gayne some especiall honour, humbly be sought the Duke his father, that hee would vouchsafe him leaue, to haue the leading of the Uanguarde, the first daie of seruice, and the first night to haue the selting of the watch: both which in regarde, as well of his earnest suit, as for the skill that he sawe in him, and the honour that he had gotten in the Emperours wars against the Turke, was granted him. But after a counsayle helde by the Duke himselfe, his Sonne, and all his honourable followers, for the pitching of his Campe, and determination of his seruice, ta∣king some little repose, till the first breaking of the morning; as soone as they had light to serue their turns for landing, they made all the hast they coulde a shore: where I will leaue them
for a while pitching their Tents, and prouiding for their wars, and I will tell you a worde or two of the two Ladies, that I left in their chamber. Bilanta hauing receaued newes that the enemie▪ was lan∣ded, and that the Dukes both in their Tentes, there was like to be a battell out of hand; began thus to talk to her sister Prin∣cesse. Sister did not I tell thee that I would plaie a mad part▪ wilt thou do as I do? venture our liues for our loues? if we shal be sisters let vs ioine handes, and heartes to take part alike in our fortunes: I will not stirre a foote from thee: what sayest thou? The Ladie amazed at her manner of spéech, and yet know ing the nature of her loue, made her this answeare: Saie and it is done; for I am no more then you will haue mee, if I fayle in my loue, let me fall with my life: I will make no exception knowing the honour of your discretion, but stand vpon this re∣solution, our fastes of one feather, let our loues lie togither▪ what you do I will do, if I die for it I care not. Then quoth Bi∣lanta, ten to one, but Penillo will be the formost man in the fiel, and perhaps to striue for honour, maie step vpon a stone of dan ger, where if his foote slippe; hee maie happen bee taken vp er he rise. My father and my brother are I am sure in their Tent▪ before whom euerie man must come that will seeke preser in this péece of seruice. Now let vs plaie the gallantes  Armour, and furnishe our selues with Armour, sworde, and Pike, and let vs with our burgonettes close couering our fa∣ces, as strangers vnknowne, make suit to the Duke my father and my brother, to haue leaue before the battel, to do some pe of seruice in his honour: and saie that we are young Knightes that will not be knowne till our actions be performed, but that we come from two Ladies (I meane our selues) who were sent by them, with this chaine of Peare to gratifie the Duke, and this Iewell my brother, the better to obtaine leaue for the e∣cution of our attempte. Nowe if we get leaue as I doubt not it maie be, we shall be happier then we looke for. Good sister (quoth Merilla) agreed, I am for you: if I  aduenture the danger of the Seaes, to follow my friend, shall
I feare anie course in the companie of my kinde sister? No, be∣side me life, or death, I will take part with you in your fortune. Then sister (quoth Merilla) wee two will arme our selues like to gallant young souldiers, and being vnknowne when our Uan∣guards are put down, we will go to the Duke my fathers tent, where ten to one, wee shall finde my brother with him, to them will wee present our selues, by a friend that I haue made for the purpose, who shall not anie waie reueale vs, but make re∣port, that wee are two strange knightes, that for our honoures haue auowed to feare no dangers, nor slippe any occasion of aduenture: and hearing of late, of this Larum of the arriuall of the Duke Feronte, and his Armie, will vpon him or some of his chiefe Generals performe some such resolute piece of ser∣uice, as maie well approoue more loue, then we will protest both to his Maiestie and his countrey, which performed, wee will then reueale our selues, our names and conditions, onely we will entreat but this fauour, that we maie alone without fur∣ther companie haue leaue to march this night towardes the e∣nemie, vpon whome we hope to gaine such honour, as maie be to the Dukes content, and the benefite to his whole countrey; and the better to procure this fauour, I will carrie this chaine of pearle, that with a letter to the effect of this suite I will car∣rie, as written from me to my brother, which with this chaine of pearle shall be giuen him as from mee: nowe if we obtaine our suite wee will to the fielde, and through the darke, trie our fortune. It giues me in my mind, the young Prince your bro∣ther will be some what gallant vpon the spleene, and steppe fur∣ther then he is aware of: which if he doe, and we light vpon him, it maie bee it will make a short warre: howsoeuer it bee I am resolued, if we be taken prisoners, wee shall receiue no great hurt, and if we die, our sorrowes are at an ende. The Princesse Merilla smiling at her inuention, and hauing past her promise to followe her in her enterprise, was as good as her worde, went with her into a priuate chamber with her si∣ster Bilanta, where they fell to conferre with a secret friende, for the better effecting of their intent, where I will leaue them like Amazones, fitting their armours, to plaie the pares of madde
people, and I will tell you a word or two of the Duke Ordillo, and his sonne Fantiro. The Duke making preparation for the next daie to answere the enemie both horse and foote, and after good order taken for e∣uerie thing according to his desire, calling his sonne vnto him, with certaine of his Lordes, and principall men of Armes, vsed this roiall speech vnto him: My good friendes and followers, the matter that we haue now in hande, is of no little moment, when the liues of our selues, wiues and children, our libertie, our landes and goods, and our honour, and reputation for euer in this worlde, standeth vpon the issue of one daies seruice, wherein the triumphant shall bee blessed, and the vanquished in a manner vtterlie confounded: our enemie is angrie, and ferce, now it becommeth vs to be patient and valiant: for no∣thing more daunteth furie, then the banishment of feare, which in a fielde is commonlie the cause of the ouerthrow: Rashnes maie be hurtfull, but cowardise is the shame of reason Let vs therefore put on resolution, to be readie vpon the first summon, to answere the enemie: ours is the better quarrell, hee would haue that he hath no néede of, and we cannot spare that he will commande; now our pouertie hath made his pride to swell to such a height, as I hope will come down: for if euerie one be of my minde, he shall haue a sharper breakfast, then he had a sup∣per: which if hee disgest not the better, maie happe sticke in his stomacke till his heart ake: our strengthes are well fortified, but shall we looke on him a farre off? and be afraid to take him by the hand? no, I am olde, and first to thee my sonne I speake, & so to all my friends, I will neuer returne to my Court, with∣out great contentment to my countrey: and he that loueth me or himselfe let him laie downe his life with me in this seruice: I will leade you, follow me that will, and let him die quoth his sonne, that will not: to which praier was such a generall Amen, that with the cheerefulnesse of euerie one, it séemed they rather thought of a banquet then a battaile. But not long they were in this resolute consultation, but the two Ladies, before spoken of nowe armed at all pointes like souldiers, were brought before
the Duke and his sonne, who after the reading of the letter, and deliuerie of the chaine of pearle, with much adoe obtained  t suite, without the companie of anie more then themselues; to trie their fortune in gaining honour vpon the enemie, who lea∣uing the Duke with his sonne in their tentes, in the dim night marched towardes the enemie, and vpon the sodaine fearing to be descried by some soote, ambusaded themselues, in such sort, that they would be sure of their purpose, ere they would put their honours in aduenture, where they had not long rested, till they mette with the happinesse of their whole hope: but I will leaue them there close waiting for their fortune, and tell you a fewe wordes of Penillo the young Prince, sonne to the Duke Feronte. This roiall spirited youth, euer spurring for the best fortune, and hauing that night obtained of the Duke his father, the charge of the watch for that night, and the leading of the van∣guarde the next morning; looking rounde about him, and see∣ing no cause of feare or doubt of enemie, the moone though dim∣lie shining, yet giuing so much light, as might deserie a lesse shadow then a souldiers, with his trunenin his hand, and his rapier at his side, walking as it were carelesse of all fortune, thinking none within the hearing, tell thus to talke to him∣selfe: Oh poore Penillo, the most vnfortunate man liuing, to come with honour from the seruice vpon the Turke, and nowe to make a quarrell, with alas too weake a Christian, what shall I doe? I must followe my father, to fall out with my friende: Ordillo vsed me like himselfe, and shall I be vngratefull, in the greatest vnkindnesse? but Bilanta my loue, what will she thinke of my faith, to she we such fruites of my affection? Oh I am not my selfe, that cannot be hers, and yet in my heart I am hers, howe harde soeuer be my happe: but I must not be vnnaturall, and I would not be vnkinde: what is to be done? Oh heauens doe that which I cannot deuise, loue is diuine, and as the stature is of my affection, so let me prosper in my fortune. Which word was scarcelie out, when the two vnknowne souldiers laied hold of him, and carried him prisoner to the Duke Ordillo: before
whom  they had brought him, the Duke had them for re∣warde of their seruice, aske anie thing whatsoeuer his court or countrey could affoorde them, with protestation vpon the sword of honour, not to denie, nor to delaie them: but before the de∣m of the souldiers for their promised rewarde, passed these fewe words betwixt the two Princes. Fantiro the yoong Prince seeing the sonne of his enimie pri∣soner, the more to abate as he thought, the pride of his spirit, entertained him with this welcome. Your fortune is like your quarrell, no better then I wish, and as it beginneth, so I hope will bee the ende: disgrace at the first, thinke what will bee the last. Well (quoth Penillo) I am nowe not my selfe, had not fortune thus throwne me into thy handes, thou wouldest neuer haue dared to haue vttered one of these wordes; and had I my libertie, I would make thee shake for this presumption. Who, e (quoth the Prince Fantiro?) Thou art deceyued, thou shalt see howe little account I make of thy too great minde, go take thy libertie; see what thy second fortune can do vppon mee. but hadst thou me at this aduantage, what wouldest thou do to me? Use thee (quoth the Prince) nowe prisoner, as thou dost mee, giue thee thy libertie for charitie. At which wordes the young Prince Fantiro smiling at the greatnesse of so roiall a spirite, with better wordes perswaded him to patience. When the two Ladies taking off their Burgonets, descry∣ing themselues to the great admiration of the Duke, the young Prince, and the prisoner, and all the beholders neere them, demaunded their rewardes in this manner. Merilla by her trae through the Seaes▪ losse of her fathers loue, her bro∣ther, friendes, and countrie, desired to haue for her rewarde the young Prince Fantiro, whome the Duke with no little gladnes was content to yee vnto. Bilanta in the aduenture of her life, in y• atchieuing of this honor, pleaded a blessing of the heauens for the enioying of her loue, which was the prisoner. The other young Prince, whoseeing his fortune no worse then to fall in∣to such faire hands, was nothing vnwilling to haue the Dukes worde performed. But I will leaue them awhile determining
of the euent of these fortunes, and I will speake a little of the duke Feronte and his passions. Nowe the morning following the duke expecting his sons comming to his Tent, to take the charge of the vanguarde for that daye in the seruice intended, but neyther seeing, nor hea∣ring of him soo long that he grewe into some feare, least some mishap or other was come vnto him, fell at last into this speech with himself. Oh Feronte, vnder what planet wert thou born? or what offence hast thou committed against the heauens, to haue these heauie fortunes befall thee, in thy aged yéeres, thy onelie daughter as full of vertue, as honour could wish, to bee stolne from thy Court, by a stranger, and perhaps thine enimie: thy sonne more deare to thee then thy selfe, hauing wonne honour in the seruice of the Emperour, to loose it in the gouerment of a meane Prince: naie more dost thou not rather doubt of his deathe, then hope of his life, hauing no notice what maye be∣come of him. Oh too much valour I feare hath made thee too forwarde: Is it possible that thou liuest, if thou hast lighted in∣to the hands of thine enimies? No, thy spirite is so great, that it will not let thée yéelde but to death; and if thou dost liue howe canst thou hope of anie thing, but ▪ knowing the condi∣tion of my comming? Well, all thinges are at the heauens disposing, to whome I will referre the hope of my comfort: I thou liuest Sonne, I will redeeme thée; and if thou diest, I will follow thée. And thus in extreame passion, determyning the aduenture of his owne life, to take reuenge of his sons fortun, vpon the sodaine cane a Herauld of Armes from Ordillo the Duke, with this Ambassage vnto him, that if it woulde please him to remit all iniuries, and to accept the submission of much loue; the intended warre should turne to a continuall peace: he shoulde haue the demande of his desire, and more contentment then he could expect. This message in the midst of his manie griefes, so pacified his wrath, that he ad y• Herauld tell his master, that his words were currant weight with him, and that if he would in person meete him betweene both the campes, he should see what com∣fortable
effect his kindnes had wrought with him: with which wordes, and a bountifull rewarde for his good message, hee re∣turned to the Duke his master, who vpon the receit of the mes∣sage, came presentlie out of his tent, & met with y• Duke Feron∣te, according to appointment, to whome after akind of humble greeting, he recounted all that happened of both their children, and that in regard of the debt that he confessed due vnto him, he would if with his fauour hee might endowe his daughter with his whole Dukedome, which discourse, and profer so pleased his much appawled mind, that causing al the children to be brought togither on either side, in steede of sharpe intended war, made so blessed a peace, that the houses vnited in mariage, liued euer after in much loue, & the souldiers al commanded to laie by their Armes, after much feasting, and manie triumphes returned home with no little ioie. FINIS.
