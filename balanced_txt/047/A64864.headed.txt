The young Horse-man OR, The honest plain-dealing CAVALIER. Wherein is plainly demonstrated, by figures and other∣wise, the Exercise and Discipline of the horse, very usefull for all those that desire the knowledge of warlike Horse-man-ship. By JOHN VERNON. PSAL. 20.7. Some trust in Chariots, and some in Horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. PRO. 21.31. The horse is prepared against the day of battail, but safety is of the Lord.
To the courteous Reader, AND Desirous Practitioner, OF Martiall Discipline. Fellow Souldiers, THe Wars being a matter that concerns a Souldiers life, it behoveth every Souldier to arme himselfe with the best advantage that hee can: You know what IOB saith, skin for skin, and all that a man hath will hee give for his life, and a man in some kinde becomes his own murtherer, if he doth not use the best means hee can to preserve his own life, as well as when hee commits the act of murther on himselfe. I have therefore thought fit (having some small experience of my own) to give thee these few directions both how to Accoutre and how to Annure thy selfe for the meanes of thy safety I have purposely omitted many things I could have inserted, because I would not prove tedious and write a tract
larger then every ordinary Souldier might easily pur∣chase with his money  in his pocket to be his continuall advisor, and prove no hinderance unto him in the expedyating of his service, to this end I have but briefely toucht upon each particular that is materiall, & compared my own experience with the iudgement of those that have lately written of this subiect, and have in some places inserted the breviats of the notes in this tract. My request therefore unto thee is to make a favourable construction of this my endeavour. And I shall continue thine in what I am able, John Vernon.
Now if thou beest a man that doest intend to se forth thy selfe for this good and warrantabl CAUSE, which now invites thee to use th most of thy might, let these briefe rules be thy di∣rection. FIrst make choise of a nimble and able Horse of a convenient Stature, of 15 handfuls high, sac coloured, as black, brown, cheasnut, dun, bay, socet, fox, Iron grey, Roe, and the like, for a white horse is not so necessary for thy use, nor so convenient for thy safety, as when thou shalt bee commanded forth on a party, in a dark night thou wilt the easilier be discerned by the Enemy, so that if they chance to give fire on you, they will have the greater aime at thee, in regard thou wilt be so visible a marke unto them, it is not save for a Sentinell to have a white Horse in a pitcht field, a file lea∣der being mounted on a white Horse is commonly aimed at by the Enemies Gunners or Musktiers, & so sometimes becomes the over∣throw of himself and the rest of the file, some other reasons I could rēder, but I forbear, let not the neck of your spurs be overlōg, if they be they are subject in your close order when you troop on, to atch hold on your next right or left hand mans stirrop, and so by that means be likely to unhorse you, or spraine your leg, let your sword be of a middle length, sharpe pointed and stiffe, for there is no great advantage in the length of swords on horsbacke, and a short sword
a better command then a long, use a flask rather then a horn or cartheages for your charge is quicker provided, and if you proed Cartheages, they are subject with the trotting of your Horse to lose il the powder out of them, a Poll Axe is very nccessarie for a rooper, for if you should chance to encounter a Troop of Cur∣ssiers where your sword can do no good but little execution, your oll axe may be an advantage unto you to offend your enemie, and  by that meanes defend your selves, provide for your Horse an iron or brasse chain for false Reines covered over with leather, for  your other Reins should chance to be cut, those will then stand ou in good stead to gird your Horse withall, be always carefull to eep thy Arms fixt and clean, for by that means thou maist chance o kill thy Enemie; and so preserve thy own life, but if thy arms be ot fixt, and so thou missest firing thine enemie, may chance to kill thee before thou shalt be able to offend him, be always well provi∣ded of powder and shot, that so thou maist alwaies be in a readi∣nesse either to passe upon dutie, or goe upon service, which is the Character of a good Souldier, and this will worke for thy honour and good report, let thy Horse be well kept and well provendred, that so he may be the abler instrumentally in time of danger to pre∣serve thy life when thou art in the midst of thine Enemies skirma∣ging, or if thou shalt be forced to retreat to carrie thee off coura∣giously, when thou encountrest thy Enemie in the field, if thou beest furnished with one Cabine and two Pistols, fire thy Carbine, and one of thy Pistols at thine Enemies, but alwaies reserve one of thy Pistols readie charged, primed, stand and cocked in thy houlster, so that if thou shouldst be foced to retreat, and thine Enemie pursue thee, thou maist be able to reward him with that Messenger in thy Houlster, and so thou maist haply kill him, and by that means save thine own life. Now to show you the ordering and disciplining of a Regiment of Horse, it behoves I should first acquaint you with the Comman∣ders and Officers belonging unto a Regiment of Horse, and these
particular parts properly belonging unto them: & first for the Colo∣nell who is appointed Comander in Chief over his own Regiment, he ought to be a Souldier of extraordinarie experience, & valour, as having the comand of a little army, somtimes singled from the grea∣ter; on him dependeth the good successe of many brave designes & actions, therefore he must be well skilled in inbattailing of the Ca∣valrie for sometimes the good ordering of charging the Enemie, causeth the victorie, and the contrarie sometime causeth the de∣struction of the whole bodie, he must take particular notice of all the Captains under his command, which are most usually five, and a Serjeant Major, hee is likewise to take care that the Troope under his command be well accommodated with good Equipage, as good and serviceable Horse and Armes, and all other necessaries requisite or belonging unto the Cavalrie, hee is not to suffer his Captains to make Officers, nor to absent themselves from their Troops with∣out his leave. In the March his own Troop marches first, and is first quartered, in time of fight his place is in the Battalia, if there be on∣ly his own Regiment, or if he command in Chiefe, that so hee may be able to give order and command upon all occasions, hee should not resolve upon any Enterprize, but first advise with one or more of his faithfullest and most experienced Captains. The second Commander belonging unto a Regiment of Horse is, the Serjeant Major whose Experience and Valour had need be answerable unto his place, which is of great concernment, for hee is most usually a man of the most practice in the Regiment, in marching he ought to be well acquainted with the ways. that so he may with best advantage encounter the Enemy, if it hapneth they met, if the Regiment marches in high ways. In the Enemies Coun∣trie or where the people do most affect their Enemie: it is his dutie in all places or fields convenient, to cause all the Regiment to be drawn up into Battalia, which will both annew the Souldiers to this kinde of Exercise, and cause them to be more Expert and Readie at all times to Encounter these Enemies, at this time, and so at all o∣ther times in their marching, hee should send forth Scouts before
the Bodie of the best and ablest Horse, with an able an expert Offi∣cer to discover, if haply they may, where the Enemie is quartered, how the Countrie stands affected, and if they can to take some of the Enemies Scouts or stragling Souldiers, that so by faire promi∣ses of Reward or threatnings of great punishment you may get out of them, how strong your Enemie is, how well provided of Am∣munition, what Enterprize he intends next, and the like, hee must also if he can with secrecie procure to have Spies, not onely in the Enemies Armie, but also upon their Frontiers, that so you may have continuall notice of the Enemies moving, and which way and of all the Designes in hand, and the like, he is likewise to take care that the Captaines doe not wrong their Souldiers, and that they keepe the Troops in a good state and well armed, and that themselves and their Officers do frequently Exercise and Dis∣cipline their Troops, and cause them to observe good order, it is his dutie likewise when he hath received the Word and Orders how the Guard shall be commanded that night from the Colonell, the Corporals reparing unto him to give out these Orders and Word unto them, and they to acquaint the Pistolers Captaines there∣with. The next Commander in a Regiment of Horse is a Captain, who should be a man of Wsdome and Policy, as being one of the Co∣lonels counsel, and wel exercised in Arms that so he may be the bet∣ter able to Dicipline his own Troop, hee hath need have good Ex∣perience and Valour, in regard that many times it hapneth, that be∣ing at a distance from the grosse body with his troop, he must with∣out order or counsell of others, sometimes when he shall see advan∣tageable occasions, execute service of great consequence▪ e should always in all things shew a good example to his souldiers, he must diligently and punctually observe these orders which shall either be given or sent him from his superiour Officers, and be at the place at the appointed houre with his Troop, others under his command on all occasions, hee must be first on horse back s a good example to his Souldiers, hee must be carefull to keep his owne Troope find
and compleat, he must endevour to know every one of his souldiers by their names, that so he may distinctly name them upon all occa∣sions of employment, hee must never be daunted whatsoever, disadvantage befall him for feare of discouraging his Souldiers, hee must cherish his well deserving Souldiers, and cashiere the contrarie, it must be his care to have one or more of his Souldiers well acquainted with the ways of that Countrie he marches in, to serve him as Guides, to that end he must if he can get one or more of the Country inhabitants to enter themselves as Souldiers under his command. The Lievtenant of a Troop of horse ought to be a man of known experience, nursed and well educated in Cavalrie, it properly be∣longs unto his care and office to exercise and discipline the Troope in the Captains absence, he commands the Troope, his name signi∣fieth so much in the French Lievtenant, that is one which supplieth the place of another upon him, usually all difficulties doe rest, be∣cause oftimes the Troops are given unto young Gentlemen which want experience, he must see that the Souldiers keep their horse and arms well, he always marches in the Reare, causing the Souldiers to follow their Captaine and Colours; in time of fight his place is in the Reare with his sword drawne in his hand, encouraging the Souldiers, and killing any that shall offer to flie from their Colours or disband themselves, but if the Captain be absent, then hee shall take tht Captaines place, appointing another able Officer in the Reare, in the ordinary marching of the Troope, the Lieutenant must not take the Captains place though he be absent, but the Cor∣net must lead the Troop, and the Lievtenant must bring up the Reare, hee must be able to write and read, because hee must keep a List of the Troopers names, and likewise be able himselfe to read those Orders and Letters that shall be sent him from his Superiour Officers, and not communicating it to others, hee must take notice of the sufficiencie of every souldier, and make use of them accord∣ingly, when the Troop goeth to manage any Guard, the Lievte∣nant is to go a little before unto that Lievtenant he is to relieve, and
by him to acquaint himself of the place for the Sentinels for day and night, and must himselfe place the Sentinels when the Troope lodgeth in a Village, he must cause the Billits assigned to be distri∣buted before the Cornets lodging, so that in case of an Alarm, the Souldiers may know where to repaire to their Colours, when the Troop is to march: he must be first on horseback, giving the soul∣diers a good example, he must endeavour to acquaint himself with the ways of the Country, because hee is often sent forth upon ex∣ploits, when the Troop in marching is charged by the Enemy, hee must keep some distance behind, with some of the best mounted Souldiers for a reserve, that so the first having done their dutie, they may second them, giving the other oportunitie to resemble be∣hind them, and time to make ready again. The Cornet must be a man of courage, who in the absence of the Captain and Lievtenant commands the Troope, in the ordinary marching of the Troop, he marches in the first division betweene the first and second squadron, the Colours are then carried by his man. In the first rank of the second squadron next the right hand man, but in fight the Cornet takes the Colours himselfe and mar∣ches in the middle of the Front, when the Lord Generall passes by he is to doe obaience, by inclining the Cornet or Colours towards the ground. The Quartermaster must be a souldier of good experience, as be∣ing many times sent forth upon parties, and sometimes leads on the forlorne hope, he had need bee well acquainted with the wayes, because he alwayes goeth before the Troop to provide quarter for them, he is to take two or more of the nimblest mounted Troopers along with him, and having provided quarter, sends them back to direct the Troop to their quarters, there is likewise much fidelity re∣quired of them that are Quartermasters, by reason that they distri∣bute the word and the billis in the absence of the Cornet and su∣periour Officers; he commands the troop, in the time of the troops ordinary marching, his place is in the second division, between the second and third squadron.
The Corporals which are commonly three belonging unto a Troop of horse are very usefull, it is requisite they should have good experience in the Cavalry, being commonly sent forth with a party of horse to scout, and scoure the high wayes before the body, and to guard some passages of danger, and to assist the Liev∣tenant in placing the Sentinels when the particular squadrons are to perform that service; their places of marching is after this manner, the eldest Corporall marches on the right hand of the Front, the second Corporall marches on the right hand of the se∣cond squadron, the youngest Corporall marches on the right hand of the last squadron. The Trumpeters which are usuall too belonging unto a Troop of horse, ought to be men of a pregnant wit and very industrious, fit to deliver Embassages when they are sent, they are to observe if they can have so much liberty the enemies workes and guards, and what they can further gather or espy in the enemies quarters, and so report it unto his commander in chiefe; he must prescisely at the time appointed him by his superiours, sound the Boutezselle, that is clap on your saddles, the next is the Chevall, that is mount on horseback, the next sound of the Trumpet is the standard, that is repaire to your standard; therefore it is requisite that the Troop be distinctly taught to know the severall sounds of the Trumpet, as when to saddle, when to mount, when to repaire to their stan∣dard; when to troop on, when to give the charge, when to retreat, when to attend the watch, and the like. All which they must punctually obey, as being the loud voice of the Commander, the Trumpeter must alwaies have his Trumpet with him, because it be∣ing the more ready to sound an Alarme when occasion shall require the same. It is requisite for a Trooper to be of a sound and active body, of a fitting age, as from twenty to forty yeares of age, of a resolute spirit, as befitting a horseman, who is to meet the enemy and not to stay his comming, he ought to be of an ingenious mind to learn the perfection of a souldier, to ow obedience to his superi∣our Officers, one that loveth and knoweth what belongeth to a
horse▪ he must be carefull to keep his horse well, & his arms fixt up∣on, which many times dependeth the safety of his life, every horse∣man must weare a skarfe of his Generalls Colours, and not leave it off neither in his quarters nor out of his quarters, it being an orna∣ment unto him: besides it will cause him to forbeare many unfit∣ting actions, as being therby distinguished from the vulgar or com∣mon souldiour, it is likewise a good and visible mark in time of battell to know one another, but above all hee must have the true feare of God before his eyes, which will direct him in all his acti∣ons to imbrace vertue, and abhorre vice. The next thing we are to treat of is, the arming of the Cavalrie which is of two sorts, chiefly defensive, and offensive. The arming of the Currasseer is chiefly defensive, as with a close caske or head-peece, gorget, brest-plate, pistoll proofe, and placket to make it carbine-proofe. Poulderons, and Vambraces, Gantlets, Tassets, Cassets, and Garderans, to arme him fitly downe to the knee be∣fore, and so loe as the calves behind with a Buffe Coate under his arms, a good sword stiffe and sharp pointed, two good fire-locks, Pistols, In housters at his Saddle, with a good Poleaxe, a good strong horse of fifteen handfuls high, his Saddle and Bitt must be strong and usefull, hee must weare a Scarfe on his Headpiece, hee must have false Reines to his bridle made of an Iron or brasse chain, covered over with leather, that if his other Reins should be cut, he may have them to guide his Horse with all as before. The Harquebuses and Carbines arming is chiefly offensive, his defensive Arms, as only an open Caske or Head-peece, a back and brest with buffe coat under his armes; his offensive Ames are a good Harquebus, a Carbine hanging on his right side in a belt by a sweble, a flask and Carthareg case, and spannes, and good fire-lock pistols in houlsters. At his saddle a good stiffe sword sharp pointed, and a good poll-axe in his hand, a good tall horse of fif∣teen handfulls high, strong and nimble, with false raines to your bridle made of an Iron Chain as the former. The Dragoones arm∣ing is only offensive, having a good fire and cock musket somthing,
a wider bore, then ordinary hanging in a belt by a sweble at his side, with a good sword and ordinary horse, it being only to expe∣diate his march, for he must perform his service on foot, the ordi∣nary marching is usually ten a brest, and when they come in ser∣vice, nine of them alight casting the bridle over the next side∣mans horse necke, and for one in ten serves to keepe their horses, the rest performe the service; it is a good and speciall principle, to have our souldiers both horse and foot well chosen, well armed, and well disciplined. The next thing wee have to treat on, is to teach the Cavalrie the use of the horse and armes, concerning your horse, you must be carefull to observe these few following directi∣ons, that is to have him alwayes ready at command, as to pace, trot, gallop, or run in full carreers, also to advance, stop suddenly, re∣tire and turn readily to either hand, to teach him to turne readily, you must use him often to ride the Ring, and the figure eight, first in the greater compasse, and afterwards in a lesser, by degrees: first on his pace, then on his trot, and so to his gallop; and lastly, in full careere, you may teach him this by using him unto your hand, legge, and voice, for the using him unto your hand you must observe not to move your arme at all, but your rist only; this is excellent for facings, as if you would have him turn to the left, a little motion of the left little finger on that raine, and a touch of the left leg not using the spurre doth it, if you would have him face about to the left, you must use the same motion a little har∣der, for the use of the leg if you would have him trot, you must move both your legs a little forward if gallops move them more forward, and if you would have him run in full careere, you must move them most of all forward, and your bodie a little forward with them, it were good after ever motion to keepe him a little while in that motion, as when you bid him stand, to stand a while when you face to either hand to stand in that posture, a while giving him sometimes as a reward when hee hath well done, a piece of bread or the like: for the voice you must use him to these words, as advance, hold, turn, stand, or the like, but it were farre better to use him chiefly to the motions of the hand and legs, because the voice
cannot always be heard as in the time of fight or the like, now to teach him to go side-ways which is very usefull for closing of your Files, you must lay his provender at a distance from him in the Manger, keeping him from turning his head towards it, you must use him to the smell of Gunpowder, a sight of fire and armour, hea∣ring of Drums and Trumpets, and shouting of Guns but by de∣grees, when he is eating of his Oats you may fire a little traine of Gunpowder in the Manger, at a little distance from him, and so neerer by degrees. In like manner you may fire a Pistoll at a little distance from him in the stable, and so neerer by degrees, and so like∣wise a Drum, or Trumpet may be used to him in the stable, the Groom may sometimes dresse him in armour, using him sometimes to eat his Oats on the Drum head, In the fields when you are on his back cause a Musquet and your selfe to fire on each other at a con∣venient distance, thereupon riding up unto him with speed, making a sodain stand, also you may use to ride him up against a compleat armour set on a stack a purpose, that hee may overthrow it, and so trample it under his feet, so that by these meanes, the horse finding that hee receiveth no harme, may become bold to approach any object; you must use him to ride one Mountaines and on even ways, and to be exercised to leap, swim, run, and stop sodainly, and the like. The next thing in order to teach the Cavalier is the use of the Armie, now, for brevity sake I shall purposely omit the postures of the horseman, it being of little use in service, and only acquaint you with those things that are materiall. Now if you use Cartrages, you shall finde in your Crattreg case a turned wooden pin which you must take, having cut lengths of white paper something broader then the pin is in length, and roule the paper on the pin, then twist one end of the paper, and fill it al∣most full of powder, then put the bullet on the top of the powder, twisting that end also, then put it into your Carttreg case, now when you come to lade your Carbine or Pistols with these Cartreges, you must bite off that end of the paper where the powder is, pow∣ring
it into your Carbine or Pistol, then put in that bullet, and some of that paper will serve for a wad after it, and Ram home, but al∣wayes observe that your bullet be not too big, but that it may roule home to the Powder, for if there be any distance between the bullet and the powder, it is likely to breake the barrell of your Car∣bine or Pistoll: But if you use a flaske, which, in my judgement, is far better then Carttreges, because that many times, the trotting of your horse in long march, shaketh out all the powder out of your Carttrages, and thereby causes you to bee unprovided for the so∣dain charge of the enemie, you must gage your flaske, and so lade your Carbine or Pistol with powder and bullet as before, but ne∣ver prime before you have spand, and never span before you have just need, because many times the firelock pistols will nor goe off if they have stood long spand. Now the quantity of powder u∣sually required, for the lading of either Carbine or Pistol is halfe the weight of the bullet, but to avoid the cariage of either Cartrage case or flaske, there is a new invented spanner which contains some sixe charges with priming powder, which is more many times then is used in our skirmiges. The next thing in order is to shew you the exercise of the horse, in their motions, wherein is to be understood the true distance be∣tweene Horse and Horse, which is to be six foot at their open order, and three foot at their close order, the distance being taken from the head and tail of the Horses; in the File and the like distance, in rank now the Motions for the Cavalrie are of foure kinds, as Facings, Doublings, Countermarchings, and Wheelings: the use of Facings is to make the Troop perfect, to be sodainly prepared for a Charge on either Flank or Reare, Doublings of Ranks or by half Files, or by Bringers up, serveth to strengthen the Front, Doubling the Files serveth to strengthen the Flanks, Countermarching serveth to reduce the File-leaders into the place of the Bringers up, that so the best men may be ready to receive the charge of the Enemy in the Reare: the use of Wheelings is to bring the Front which com∣monly consists of best and ablest men to receive the charge of the
Enemy in the Reare, the use of Wheelings is to bring the Front, which commonly consists of best and ablest men to receive the Charge of the Enemy on either Flank or Reare, and also unexpe∣cted to Charge the Enemy on either Flanke or Reare, these motions for the more easier apprehending of them as represented in Figures by a Troop of Horse consisting of 72 Horsmen, the Fileleaders and Bringers up are distinguished by a different Letter, but because it may be profitable unto some, I shall first give you the proper words of Command together that belong unto the Excercising of a Troop of Horse, and afterward insert the Figures with the words of Com∣mand, and the Reasons of a very Motion. First, march into the field foure in Rank when you come into the Field command to double their Ranke, which make eight in Ranke, then command to open to the right and left, as they they march to their open Order of six foot distance, then command to stand and silently hearken unto the word of Command. 1 To the right hand face, To the left hand as you were. 2 To the left hand face, To the right hand as you were. Silence, and even your Ranks. 3 To the right hand about face, To the left hand about as you were. 4 To the left hand about face, To the right hand about as you were. Silence, and straighten your Files. 5 Ranks to the right hand double, Ranks to the left hand as you were. 6 Ranks to the left hand double, Ranks to the right hand as you were. Silence, and even your Ranks.
7 Files to the right hand double, Files to the left hand as you were. 8 Files to the left hand double, Files to the right hand as you were. Silence, and straighten your Files. 9 Files to right and left outward double, Files to right and left as you were. 10 Files to the right and left inward double, Files to the right and left as you were. 11 Halfe Files to the right hand double the Front Halfe Files to the left hand as you were. 12 Halfe Files to the left hand double the Front, Halfe Files to the right hand as you were. Gentlemen take notice of this Rule, Always observe your right hand man, And your leader. 13 Bringers up to the right hand double the Front, Bringers up to the right hand as you were. 14 Bringers up to the left hand double the Front, Bringers up to the right hand as you were. Silence, and even your Ranks. 15 Files to the right hand countermarch, Files to the left hand as you were. 16 Files to the left hand countermarch, Files to the right hand as you were. Silence, and straighten your Files. Gentlemen always in your countermarches observe this rule, to come up to your Leaders ground, before you wheele. Silence, and observe the word of command. 17 Files close to the right and left to your close order. 18 Ranks close forwards to your close order. 19 Half Files to the right and left double the Front by division. Half Files to the right and left as you were.
20 Half Files to the left hand, double the Front entire, Half Files to the right hand as you were. Silence. 21 Close your Files with your right knee fast lockt, Under your right hand mans left hamme. Silence. 22 To the right hand wheele close your Files to the Right hand men move easily, and let Your left hand men come about To the left hand wheele close your Files to the right, 23 Left hand men move easily, and let your Right hand men come about: Troop on and close your Files. 24 Ranks, File, Rank: as you were. March esily, Troop on, Stand. Now when the Troop lieth in Garrison or continueth long in a∣ny Town, it should be their constant course if neither they nor their horses, be overburthened with going forth upon parties to exercise twice a weeke at the least, I shall therefore now according to my promise, give you a plain demonstration by Figures, with the rea∣sons of each motion, of the manner of exercising the Horse, as for the common marching of a Troop through a Town or high way, or straight passage or the like: the first Figure sheweth how, the second Figure sheweth the manner of their marching when they come into an open Field or Common, or the like convenient place, when the Troop is commanded forth to exercise marching into the field af∣ter that manner, as is demonstrated by the two former Figures, when they come into the field, the Officers are to march forth from between the Divisions, then they are to close the Divisions and stand at their open order of six foot distance as is represented by the third Figure. It is proper in all commands to begin with the right first, which is presented by this fourth Figure, the first command in Facings is to the right hand face, which serveth to receive the Charge of the Enemy comming on one the right Flank, the Command to Reduc them is to the left hand as you were▪
Fig. 1. Fig. 2. If any shall seem to remain unsatisfied in the placing of my Officers, as it seemeth some already have, I shall presume to render them these reasons for it, submit∣ting my selfe unto the judgement of the learned. 1 Each Officer in these figures, assumeth no other then their proper places of honour or dignity, peculiar unto each of them. 2 Each Corporall is therefore appointed to march on the right of his perticular Squadron, that they might with the more facility sometimes suffering the Troop to advance, discerne any disorder or disproportion of the troops marching, and thereby the easier cause them to march in good order. 3 It hath been the most ancient and moderne custom of the Netherlands thus to place the Quartermaster as in this figure, during the time of his residing with the Troop, and then in his absence the youngest Corporall assumeth the place as substitute.
Fig 3 Fig 4. Fig. 5. The next command is to the left hand face which is here presented by this fift Figure, and differeth no∣thing from the 4 Figure, but by the hand being usefull, as the former to reduce them, the command is to the right hand as you were.
Fig. 6. Now if the enemie come on the Reere, somthing inclining to the Right, you are to comand to the right hand about face, or if the nemie come on the Reere, something inclini to the left, you are to command to the left  about face, which is both demonstrated by th sixth figure, to reduce them, you are to com∣mand to the right or left as you were. Alway note this, that when they performe any motio to the right, you must reduce them by the lef or to the left, you must reduce them by th right, reducing them alwayes by the contrarie hand they performed that motion by. Fig. 7. Rank to the right hand double to performe this Motion, every
n Rank passeth into the odde upon the right hand of his Leader, he second Rank into the first, and so all the rest successively, as his seventh Figure is plainly demonstrated to reduce them, the per word of Command is Ranks to the left hand as you were,  may be done the best way for the Horse, by causing those  that doubled to stand, and those that stood to advance to the per place and distance: this Motion and likewise all the rest con∣ning doubling of Ranks, doubling by halfe Files, and doubling Bringers up, is usefull for the strengthening of the Front: now cause this Troope consists of 72 Horsmen, which is an equall mber to be divided into three equall Squadrons, of 24 men a , there will remain in all these doublings of Ranks on odde  in the Reere, which always is to stand in their proper places,  this Figure sheweth; you may observe also the places from ich, the way by which those Ranks that double, doe advance by  round oes, and small pricks. g. 8.
This Motion differeth nothing from the former, but by the dobling one the contary hand, being commanded, Ranks to the  hand double, and is usefull as the former, the proper word of co∣mand to reduce them is Ranks to the right hand as you were, th eighth Figure plainly sheweth the manner how to perform it. Fig. 9. Doubling of Files is usefull for the strenthening of the Flanks the first Command by way of Exercise, in doubling of Files  Files to the right hand double, which is plainly demonstrated by this ninth Figure to reduce them: the Command is Files to the lef hand as you were, note this that  man that moves must giv place to him that stands.
ig. 10. This motion differeth nothing from the former, but by the dou∣bling to the contrary hand, it being of the same use as the other, the proper word of Command is Files to the left hand Double: and to Reduce them, the Command is Files to the right hand as you were, and a plain description how to performe this Motion is seene by this tenth Figure, every even number passeth into the odd as the eighth into the seventh, the sixt into the fifth, and so all the rest successively.
Fig. 11. This motion is very usefull for the avoyding of Canon-shot, or sometimes for the suffering of the enemy, when he charges with full career to passe in between, and so hve you the greater advan∣tage of the enemie, it is performed by commanding, files to the right and left outwards double, to reduce them the command is, files to the right and left as you were: The speculation of this 11 figure will shew you the usefulnesse of this motion, and likewise how to performe it.
Fig. 12. This motion is usefull for the drawing of the Troope into a clo∣ser sentor then the former, and is performed by commanding, files to the right and left inwards double; to reduce them, the command is, files to the right and left as you were, let this 12 figure be your guid, for the attaining of the usefulnesse and manner of performing of this motion.
Fig. 13. This motion, as hath been formerly shown, is usefull for th strengthening of the Front, but performed differently from the other, the proper word of command is, halfe files to the rit han double the front, to reduce them, the command is, halfe files to th left hand as you were, The best way to performe it for the hor is, as hath beene formerly shown, to command those halfe fil that stood to advance, and those that advanced to stand, this  teenth figure will shew you how to performe it.
Fig. 14. The difference betwenne this and the former motion is only by advansing on the contrary hand, the command being halfe files to the left hand double the front, it being of the like use as the former: to reduce them, the word is, halfe files to the right hand as you were, all which is plainly shown by this 14 figure.
Fig. 15. This motion is of the same use as the former, but performed dif∣ferently from it, here the bringers up advance into the front, and the next ranke after them, and so all the rest successively as the reere ranke figure one, into the front ranke, figure one, and so likewise all the rest, The command being, bringers up to the right hand dou∣ble the front, reducing them as is formerly shown, this 15 figure plainly demonstrates the manner how to performe it.
Fig. 16. This motion and the former is of one use, all the difference being, the advancing on the contrary hand, being commanded, bringers up to the left hand, double the Front, reduceing them as before, let this 16 figure be your guid,
Fig. 17. The use of countermarching as hath been shown before is,  the sodain reducing of the file-leaders, into the place of the bring∣ers up, so that by that means, the best and ablest men, which ought to be frontiers, may be ready to receive the charge of the enemie in the reere, the proper command being files to the right hand coun∣termarch, as is plainly demonstrated by this 17 figure, to reduce them, the command is, files to the left hand countermarch as you were.
ig. 18. he difference of this motion from the former, as hath beene shown in all, the left hand motions is only changeing of hands, be∣ing of the same use as the former, the manner of performing it is de∣scribed by this 18 figure, the command being files to the left hand countermarch, reducing them by the right, into their proper places as before.
Fig. 19. This motion is usefull for the drawing of the files into their close Order, every mans right knee being close locked under his right-hand-mans left ham, the command is, files to the right and left close inwards to your close Order, you may see the manner of perfor∣ming it by this 19. figure.
Fig. 20 This motion is useful for the drawing up of the Rankes into their close Order, the command being, Rankes close forward to your close Order, as is demonstrated by this 20 figure,
Fig. 21. These two motions differ from any of the former, and is usefull for the drawing up of the Troop into the lesser batalia of 16, for there is the battalia consisting of 24 and three deep, now when it shall fall out that this Troop shall be just in the midst between other two Troops, it may be usefull to draw them up on either flanke, as this 21 figure sheweth; how, the comand being, half files to the right and left, double the front by division, and it may be performed by com∣manding, reare halfe files to the right and left face outward, the command, rear halfe files, march cleere of either flanke, then com∣mand, rear halfe files advance even with the front; to reduce them, command, Rear halfe files, to the right and left as you were.
Fig. 22. This motion differeth from the former, but is of the same use: now if it shall fall out that this Troop shall bee placed on the left wing of the grosse body, or that there be a scarcitie of ground on the right flanke, it will be proper to command halfe files to the left hand double the front intire, the manner of performing it being plainly shown by this 22 figure, and it may be performed after the same manner as the former, you may reduce them the best way by commanding, front halfe files march off, and rear halfe files, fall in∣to your places.
Fig. 23. The use of wheeling, as hath been formerly shown▪ is for the spe∣dy bringing of the front, which should always consist of the ablest souldiers to receive the charge of the enemie on either flanke, or else sodainly to give the charge to the enemie on the Reare, this motion is performed by commanding to the right hand wheele, and close your files to the left, right-hand-men move easily, and let your left-hand-men come about, all which is plainly demonstrated by this 23 figure.
Fig. 24 Now if it shall happen that the enemie shall come on the left, it will be proper to command to the left hand wheele, and close your files to the right, left hand men move easily, and let your right hand men come about, this 24 figure sheweth the manner how to per∣forme it.
The  motion which may ometimes prove very usefull, as the commander shall see fit occasion is to command Ranks, File; which is performed after this manner, when the Troop is wheeling, command to Troop on, then sodainly commad Rankes file, that is▪ the right hand man of the Troope marches off, his next left hand man marches after him, and so all the rest of the Troop successively, the whole Troope making but one entire file, to reduce them com∣mand Rankes as you were. This motion is usefull to fire all at once on a company of foot, but it must be performed with much speed and agility. The last motion is ro draw up into batalia, now it is to be suppo∣sed that the Troop stands in its marching posture, with each Officer in his particular place, as in the first figure, and coming into a con∣venient field or place, you are to command them to double their Rankes, which is answerable to figure 2, then command the second Corporall to advance into the front with the second squadren, which makes 16 in front, then command the youngest Cotporall to advance into the Front with the youngest Squadren, which makes a fair front in Batalia of 24 men and 3 deepe, besides the Cornet and three Corporals, to reduce them the command is, March off eldest Squadren. Every Troop of horse must be furnished with a Captain, a Lievtenant, a Cornet, a Quartermaster, three Corporals, two Trumpeters, a Clarke, a sadler, a Chirurgeon, and a Farriar. The next thing we are to treat of is, the order of a horse Regi∣ments marching; which is after this manner, the Colonels Troop marches first, next them marches the eldest Captains Troop, and so all the rest of the Troops in their degree, the Serjetnt Major with his Troope brings up the Reere, The Harquebuier and Carabiner in their ordinary marching, is to cary their Carabines hanging at their backs, in a belt by their right side, as hath been shown before: but when the Troop marcheth through a Town or City, they must order their Carbines upon their right thigh. In the day marches there ought to be a convenient distance be∣tween Troop and Troop, but in the night, they ought to march
neer together, behaving themselves very silently (In all convenient places as they march) the Serjeant Major ought to cause all the Troops to be drawn up into Battalia, and likewise at the same time, and at other times of there marching to send forth Scouts before the bodie, and those of the nimblest horse to discover if haply they may either the Enemies Quarters, the scituaion of the Countrey and ways whether straight or open passages either over Bridges, or else thorow narrow Lanes, or the like, for the more convenient marching of the Waggons or other baggage, which must be so litle as may conveniently serve turne: the Waggons must not march a∣mongst the Troops, but in a convenient place by themselves, being always guarded with a Squadron of horse (if the Enemie be on your Front, the Waggons must march in the Reere. It is likewise requisite to have good and able Guides that are well acquainted with the Countrie wherein you march, which you may take up of that Country Inhabitants; and if you can entertain them into pay as Souldiers under your command, if not for the better preventing of their running away, which they will oftentimes do, if they may have oportunitie, are to ride between two Troopers of fidelitie and trust, (when the bodie is to march over a Bridge or narrow passage, the first Troop being passed over is to make alto, that is stand, lea∣ving a Souldier on the Bridge or passage, that may give notice to the Commander and Leader in the Front, when the Reere of the whole bodie is passed over. When the bodie is within some four or six miles of the place where they should be quartered that night all the Quartermasters of the Regiment are to march speedily before the bodie to provide Quarter for all there Regiment, each Quarter∣master taking with him three or four of the nimblest horst troopers in his own troop, who are to be sent back again when the Quarters are made, to conduct each troop to its Quarters. The Colonels troop s first to be provided of Quarter, then the Serjeant Major next, and so all the rest of the Troops in their degrees. When the Troops come to the place where they should be quar∣tered, the Quartermasters are to cause each Troope to march alto,
before their particular Cornets lodging, and there to deliver out to each Corporall each Squadrons billets, so that the Troop may the better know if occasion happen of an Alarm, and the like whereto repaired to their Standard or Colours. It is likewise very requisite that the Quarters be very well and sufficiently guarded, and that the Sentinels be placed in the most convenient places or passages, the Officer shall thinke most advantagious for that purpose. Now because it may prove sometimes very advantagious to take some of the Enemies Scouts, or stragling Souldiers for the better gaining Intelligence▪ a cunning stratagem might be very usefull for this purpose, which may be performed after this manner or the like, an Officer of good experience may be sent forth with a pri of some twentie of the best and nimblest mounted Souldiers wih one Trumpetter, who are in the day time to repaire unto some Wood neere the Enemies Quarter, placing some Sentinels on Trees, and endevour to take if haply they can some of the Enemies stragling or disbauded souldiers, & in the night to approch the enemies sentinels surprising one or more of them (now because it may so fall out that after the taking of a Sentinell or the like, the Troope may be char∣ged by the Enemie, the Officer is to leave some four of these twen∣tie with the Trumpetter neer the aforesaid Wood, who are to have the nimblest horses: giving them order, that when they shall, see the other sixteen coming charged by the Enemy, they shew them∣selves to the Enemie, and that the Trumpetter shall then sound: now the Enemy preserving this usually will make a stand for feare of some Ambuscado, which will give the more opportunitie for the sixteen to further their retreat, the other foure with the Trum∣petter may afterwards safely retreat, either severally or together, by reason of the speed of their Horses. A Quartermaster usually performs this service after he hath provided Quarter, having well refreshed both themselves and there hores; that assist him in this stratagem. If the Cavalrie lodgeth or incampeth in the fields, there must be
speciall care taken that it be in a convenient place for water, and under som shelter, (for one cold or rainy night doth more hurt un∣to the horses then any other thing, and now if it so happen, (as it  sometimes) that the Cavalrey come late to their Quarters, so that convent places for the Sentinels cannot bee made choise of some Commanders will cause the Boutezelle to be sounded at mid∣night, an smetimes make false Alarmes, as though the enemie  to keep their Souldiers waking, but the often using of,  diers to this proves verie evill (causing them to be secure an carelesse) it were far better in such a case to cause all the troops after two or three houres refreshment to goe forth into the Cham∣paige, every Trooper taking with him some Oates and other refreshment both for himself and his horse, placing the Corps de Guard where it shall be thought fitting (but if the weather be rainie and tempestuous, which requires the Cavalrie to be under some shelter) every Officer by turns shal visit the houses where the troops are quartered, causing them to saddle their horses, calling and Knocking aloud: and so by that means keeping them waking and in readinesse, if that the Enemy shall chance to give an Alarm. Sentinels are used for no other purpose but to give the rest of the body the more opportunitie to provide themselves, when the ene∣my shall make any approch, and are usually placed two together, the one standing whilst the other goes and acquaints the Corpes de Guard of all the Occurrences that they shall discerne: the Cavalrie never performs this service, but when the whole bodie is in the field, and are for the most part placed at a great distance from the bodie, as the Officer shall think fit neer the meeting of divers high ways, or the like. And in unwalled Towns when there is no In∣fantrie there, but if there be Infantrie there, they are to performe this service. In the day time, they are to be placed on high hils, that are most cō∣venient to descry all the Country round: In the night they are to be placed in the Vallies or lower ground, being convenient for the dis∣cerning
of any approches from the Hils, they are not to stirre from their places where they are set, although invited by any opportuni∣tie of advantage, as they may conjecture, which are sometimes stra∣tagems of the Enemie on purpose to surprize them, till the Officer that placed them come, or cause them to be relieved on paine of death, because that many times the suprizall of the Sentinels proves the defeat of the whole bodie, they are silently but vigilantly to ob∣serve all fires, or the more then ordinary barking of Dogs, or fi∣ring of peeces, or trampling of Horses, or hearing of voices or the like, all which they are to give speedie notice of unto the Com∣mander in Chief, in the Corps de Guard, No Sentinell is to alight off his Horse unlesse it be for naturall necessitie, and then but on at once. The Round ought to be gone foure times in a night, who are to see that the Sentinels be vigilant and watchfull, if the Senti∣nels be placed in the fields or Champagne: foure of the Round ought to be sent twice so far beyond the Sentinels, as the Sentinels are from thee. Corps de Guard for to discry all Occurrences as be∣fore. If the bodie lie incamped or in Garrison, or neere the Enemies Quarters, the placing of Sentinels will not be sufficient, but you must also send forth Scouts to the number of twelve or more, who are all to be very well horsed and commanded by an able Souldier, they are very silently to advance towards the Enemies Quarters, some three or foure houres march by severall high wayes foure or five to a way as occasion shal require, they ought not to alight upon any occasion whatsoever, but to listen if they can heare any noise or rumour, or the trampling of horses, or the like, which if they can descry not being discerned themselves, shall send word scretly by one of the Souldiers to their Quarters of the Enemies approach, afterward sending a second to confirme the messge of the fst, and so by little and little retreating themselves, but if they be discried by the Enemy, and that the Enemy consists of a great bodie: the Officer that commands in chief shall cause some house to be set on
fire neer his Quarters, they of the Quarter knowing before the rea∣son, that it is to give notice of the Enemies neer approach and great number, and comming within hearing of Carbine shot, shall case some three or foure Carbines to be discharged, to gie them in the Quarter, the more opportunity to provide for the Enemy, bt if it fall out that your Scouts or discoveries abroad, or your Sentinels at home be so hard charged by the Enemy, that they have no oppor∣tunity to send word, but that the Enemy will enter the Quarter with them, the said Scouts and Sentinels shall enter the Quarters by unusuall ways, which will give the Enemy occasion of suspence not knowing whether they may be drawne into some unexpected great danger, and by firing of their Carbines with loud cryings out arme, arme, cause the body to be the more active, and speedilie to provide for the chrge of the Enemy. It is the policie of an ene∣my many times to give false alarms for two reasons, first, to weary out your men by continuall night watches: and secondly, to cause your men by continuall false alarms to grow secure and carelesse, that so by that means they may have the greater advantage by com¦ming on them unawares, therefore it should be the wisdome of the Commanders to give the alarm secretly without noise from one to another, that so the Enemy may not boast of his putting you to trou¦ble, but only weary out himself. The fittest place for the Cavalrie to lie in Garrison, is in the Frontier Towns towards the Enemy, that thereby the incursions of the Enemy may be hindred, and your own friend the better secured, besides it gives courage to brave soudiers to be thus quartered, it were very good to appoint them ordinary setled Garrisons, that so they may when occasion shall re∣quire, leave their baggage behind them, and go into the field with lesse incumbrance, and likewise be better acquainted with the Coun¦trey and ways therebouts, at the opening of the gates. Each mor∣ning it were fit that the horsmen should be sent forth to discover round about whether the Enemy hath planted any Embuscadoe neer, and for the better securing of those Scouts that shall be sen forth, some peeces of Ordnance ought always to be kept ready at
the Gates or other places that may command round about. There ought none to be suffered to goe forth of the gates till the Scouts shall returne, sometimes the enemie in policie to invite you forth of your Garrison, having planted severall Embshcadoes, or other the like disadvanageable stratagems, wil send forth a party of horse neere your Quarters to surprise catail or the like, by that means to draw you forth to regain this booy▪ therefore there must be great and ctilus diligence used for this purpose, i your scouts set forth and returned, having not met with any of the countrey people, it is a signe that the enemie hath planted some Embshcadoe not far off; but if the Scouts doe not returne at th usuall time, it is an argument that they are suprised by the enemies ambushcadoe or the like. It is necssary for a politique Commander, for the better atchie∣ving of many worthy designes to accommodate himselfe with severall trusty spies; who faining discontent for want of pay or the like, are to enter themselves in the enemies service of the Cavalerie, who for the most part are best acquainted with the sudain designes of the enemie, and to agree with these spies of the place under what tree or the like; where they may convey their letters of intelligence, giving them order when their advice is of greatest importance to come themselves, these spies ought to bee trusty, witty, and well rewarded, which will cause them to expose themselves unto all ha∣zards and dangers to give intelligence. The next thing considerable is the embatteling of a Regiment of horse, which is to be considered two wayes, that is, first by way of offence to assail a Quarter, or to give the charge in fight: Secondly by way of defence, meeting the enemie in marching or the like or∣dering of the Troops in battalia by single combate, or else united in a grosse body together. The best and most advantageable way for the surprising of a Quarter, is to be secretly and sodainly assailed, which may be performed after this manner, or the like. The Re∣giment of horse consisting for the most part of seven Troops, who are to be divided severally, the first Troop marching secretly with∣out any forerunner, coming neer the enemies Quarters, and percei∣ving
themselves to be discovered by the enemies Sentinels shall sodainly without losing any time charge the Sentinels, and enter the Quarters with them immediately surprising the Corps de gard, the second Troop immediately following, shall possesse themselves of the Alarme place, the third Troop shall strait ways possesse them∣selves of the Market place, the fourth Troop shall with speede run throvgh each street, keeping the souldiers, in and thereby hinder them from mounting on horseback, or uniting of themselves toge∣ther, the fist Troop being entred, and hearing where the greatest noise is, shall immediately repair thither and alight▪ entring the houses, either put to the sword or take prisoners all whom they shall find to be enemies. The rest of the body may place themselvs in the most convenient places on either side of the Town, for the better surprising of those Souldiers that shall indeavour to escape through the gardens or other back waies, by reason of the horses running through the Streets within the Town, hindering them either to mount on horseback, or unite themselves together. Now although your enemie consists of twice so much strength as your selves, which sometimes will cause them to be the more secure and negli∣gent in their watches, yet will they not be able by reason of this se∣cret and sodain surprize to stand against you. The next thing considerable is, to charge the enemie in the field in a united or grosse body, or else by single Troops, In fighting with the enemie in a pitcht field, with all your Forces united into one intire bodie, these things are considerable, as the place, whether it be hilly or levl, as also that there be sufficient rome behind you for a retreating place, so that you be not straitned of ground, which manie times proves a great disadvantage, likewise you must always appoint troops of Reserve, which are not by any means to engage themselves in fight till the first Troops have given the charge, and are reasembled behind them to make readie again for the second charge, your Curriassers if you have any are fit for Troopes of re∣serve which gives a great deal of courage unto the other Cavalrie, this must always be observed either in grosse bodies or in single Troops.
In grosse bodies if you have field room enough, all the Troops are to be drawn up into battalia, each being not above three deepe, likewise each troop must be at least a hundred paces distance behind each other for the better avoiding of disorder, those troops that are to give the first charge being drawn up into battail as before, are to be at their close order, every left hand mans right knee must be close locked under his right hand mans left ha, as hath bin shown before. In this order they are to advance toward the Enemy with an easie pace, firing their Carbines at a convenient distance, always aiming at their Enemies brest or lower, because that pouder is of an elevating nature, then drawing neere the Enemy, they are with their right hands to take forth one of their Pistols out of their houl∣sters, and holding the lock up are most firing as before, always re∣serving on Pistoll ready charged, spann'd and primed in your houl∣sters, in case of a retreat as I have shown before, having thus fired the troops are to charge the Enemy in a full career, but in good or∣der with their swords fastned with a Riband or the like unto their wrists, for feare of losing out of their hand, if they should chance to misse their blow, placing the pomel on their thigh, keeping still in their close order, close locked as before. Each single Troope or partie meeting an equall number of the Enemy, are to use the ame method and order as before, always appointing some of their horse for a partie of Reserve for the use as before, but if the Enemy ex∣ceed in strength, and you also being not farre from your grosse bo∣die, it will e both save and honorable to retreat, but if it be a great distance from your grosse body, you must then resolve to charge the enemy with good courage couragious actions being oftentimes seconded with good successe. If one single Troop met another, your Enemy charging you in full career, you are sodainly to divide your Troop in the middle: on Flank from the other, and so the Enemie being in his full career, must either passe through and effect little, or else stopping sodainly disorder his Troops, and thereby give you a fit occasion to wheel both your Flanks inward, to charge him in the Reer. In full career, and then in all probabilitie, you will utter∣ly
out him. If one singe Troop and the like are to encounter one Company of Foot, the pace of encounter is chiefly to be marked, that is, that it be Champaigne ground, cleere of Trees, Hedges, Ditches or the like, and that there be roome enough for the n∣counter, or else the Cavalrie are by no meanes to encounter the In∣fantrie, now if the foot be drawn up into compleat order, it will be very necessary for the Cavalry to have some pretty strata∣geme, in the charging of the Foote: or else it will be very difficult rouing of the foot, which may be performed after this manner or the like, you are to divide your Troop or partie into three Squadrons, each Squadron having an able souldier to lead them, who are to charge in ful career all at one instant upon the Front Reer and Flank of the Foot. The Officer that leads on the Squadron, that charges the Front; is to charg as the others in ful career, til he comes close unto the Pikes heads, and then sodainly stopping is sodainly to comand with an elevated voice, close your file or the like, which sodain command being loud will sometimes cause those Pikes that stand charged against the other two Squadrons, either in the Flank or Reer, to extend their bodies towards the Front, which will give a fit advantage unto one of the Squadrons to slip in between, and so make way for the other two Squadrons to charge in, and utterly rout the Front, but you must always observe that this stratagem must always be prformed sodainly & altogether as at one intire mo¦tion. Thus having shewn what an ordinarie horsman needs to know, for I will not presume to instruct Commanders, though there be some that make great brags need instructions in martiall Discipline, but I shal forbear to be larger for the Reasons I have alreadie shewn.

An Appendix. COurteous Friend, Whosoever thou art, unto whose view these my unpolisht lines of young Horsmanship shall come, let me beg this favour at thy hand, that thou make the most favourable constru∣struction of those things which thou shalt suppose, although weak∣ly to be erronius in this ensuing Tract, and if there be any that shall prove positive errours, impute it rather to the unskilfulnesse of me the unwor∣thy Authour, then unto the unwillingnesse of him whose onely aime for the publike good hath invited, to set forth this ensuing Discourse of Horsmanship. I am very unwilling to be of the judgment of those men, whose priate positions themselves esteem to be infallible or unerring, but my self, shall rather desire to submit unto the judgment of the judicious, I have for the most part tendred a reason of each particular throughout the whole Tract if then they shall seem emptie and of no value, unto them who have bee more anciently educated or longer inured unto the Discipline of Forreign States then my selfe. I shall presume also to intreat this favour at their hands, that they would in love as aiming at the publike good, subscribe their contradictory Reasons, which if authentick, I shall be willing to ac∣knowledge mine errour, and crave their pardon, if not, let mee friendly prevail withall men, who are inclinable to finde faults, though very un¦willing to amend what is amisse, to suspend their censure of him, who had rather be profitable to the State, then iniurious to any. Thy loving Friend, IOHN VERNON.
THE AUTHORS APOLOGIE. KInde Reader, I am forced to acquaint thee with one thing more, which is, that having passed the copie out of my hand, the Prin∣ter without my privity, caused the impressions of the severall figures inserted, to be cut in wood, my selfe having no knowledge thereof, was thereby disinabled of the giving directions for their better, and more sircumspect cutting. In the curious survey of these figures, thou maist, finde many mistakes, as in the 3, 4, 5, 6. figures, not placed at their open Orders as they should have beene, in the doubling of Rankes by halfe files, or by bringers up, the file leaders and bringers up should have been distinguished, by these two different letters. (h·) or the like, as I have leneally incerted in the copie. In the 14 figure, the omit∣ting of the figures on the right flanke, as in figure the 13, the misplacing of the Rear piece in fig. 18. turning the heads of the ahes the contrary way () and some other mistakes both in the copie and figures, weich I was not able to cor∣rect, by reason that the whole number of shects were printed off before I had a view of them. All which mistakes, both in the copie and figures, I humbly in∣treat thee to correct with thy pen as thou shalt come at them, supplying each de∣fect by thine own industery, and thou shalt always command me, to the utmost of my power, to serve thee in what I am able. Thine, Iohn Vernon.
