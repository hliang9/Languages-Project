Die Martis, 17. Maii. 1642. THe Lords and Commons in Parliament do declare, That it is against the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdome, that any of the Subjects thereof should be commanded by the King, to attend Him at His pleasure, but such as are bound thereto by speciall Service; And that whosoever upon pretence of His Majesties command shall take Arms, and gather to∣gether with others, in a Warlike manner, to the terror of the Kings People, shall be esteemed disturbers of the publike peace, and to do that which may introduce a president of very dangerous conse∣quence for the future, and produce most mischievous effects for the present, Considering the great distempers of the Kingdom, and what pernicious Counsellors, and Incendiaries, are now about the King, and how desperate and ill affected divers persons, attending upon His Majestie, have shewed themselves to the Parliament, and to His other good Subjects, threatning and reproaching them pub∣likely, even in His Majesties presence, and for preventing, and a∣voiding such great mischiefs as may thereupon ensue; It is Ordered and Ordained by both Houses of Parliament, That if the Trained-Bands, or any other His Majesties Subjects, shall up∣on pretence of any such command be drawn together, and put into a posture of War, the Sheriff of that County where there shall be such raising, or drawing together of Armed men; Do forthwith raise the power of the County to suppresse the same, and to keep His Majesties Peace, according to Law. And that the Lord Lieute∣nants, Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of the Peace, and all other His Majesties Subjects, be ayding and assisting to the severall and re∣spective Sheriffs in performance hereof, as they will answer the contrary at their perill.
