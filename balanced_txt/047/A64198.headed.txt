THE Opinion of Witchcraft VINDICATED. SIR, I Received yours, and with it that little treatise of Witchcraft, which you were pleased to send me: which when I had opened, I found the Author in his Preface, laying about him like a Hercules furens, or an Ajax mastigophorus, and charging his oppo∣sers with no less than Paganisme, acknow∣ledging a plurality of Gods, and ascribing
omnipotency to the Devil. This he doubts not but he shall make good with the same ease as he asserts it, and promi∣ses himself and his Reader, to force a surrender at the first assault. But his bat∣teries are not of force enough to effect it, his strongest arguments being little better than an . and his whole Book standing upon no firmer ground than his own Supposals. The vast confidence which he seems to have in the strength of his Arguments, had made me arm my self with a more than ordinary care and circumspection for the sharp encounter I was like to receive from this great Goliah, but I have since found that I may lay aside those heavy Arms, and that a stone and a sling will serve the turn. At the entrance of his Book he layes before you the necessity, in which the Eastern Empire stood, of Juggling tricks and Impostures, to uphold it's greatness; and that the heathen Priests were by con∣tinual practice arrived to that perfection in cheating, that they stood not in need of the Devils assistance: from hence he
would infer that the answers given at O∣racles, were no other than cheats put up∣on the people, and the Priests inventions. But 'tis very improbable that the Devil, who had the liberty of possessing so many Bodies (as we find he had by several un∣deniable instances of the New-Testament) should be debarred that of a wicked Ido∣latrous Priest, or the shrines of the hea∣then Gods, or, that if he had that freedom, he would not make use of it, for the esta∣blishing of his own Kingdom. After this he tells you of the great variety of Impostures used by them, all which he reduces to four heads, viz. Juggling, Inchanting, Conjecturing, and Divining. Of these he gives you definitions, ad ar∣bitrium, and you must take them on his word, as if that were as uncontroulable as the Laws of the Medes and Persians, he sayes that a Familiar was no Devil, but a confederated person, privy to the plot, and assistant to the performance. I do not deny but some cheats of this Na∣ture have been, and yet are in the World, but he that from hence concludes that all
are so, is but a bad Logician. For my part, I cannot be convinc'd by such an Argument, when I find (as I shall en∣deavour to prove) both the testimonies of Scripture and History against it. Nor indeed, is there any probability, that the Heathen Priests could so readily give an∣swers to all questions (put to them or the sudden, and ex improvise) as to keep up the credit of their Oracles to that height they were at for many Ages toge∣ther: neither may we easily suppose that this miraculous Art of cheating could be conveyed from one Priest to another, and not one of so many thousands discover the deceit to the World; and that of so great a number, all should be so ready witted, as to give their answers at a ven∣ture, and yet with so much cunning, as that whatever happen'd, the Oracles should not be taxed with falshood, which I believe our Author, if he were put to it, would find something harder to per∣form than he seems to think it. Yet all this he easily believes they did, and by such tricks magnified their Idols, and
seduced the common people, for which cause they were so great an abomination before God, as that in the Law given by Moses, he so strictly gave in charge to the Israelites, the rooting them out from a∣mong them. To this purpose he quotes the eighteenth Chapter of Deuteronomy, the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth verses. And this he thinks to be as con∣siderable a place as any can be brought from the whole Bible for the proof of Witches. Here therefore he takes occa∣sion to fall foul with our Translatours of the Bible, for that, sayes he, they have falsly Translated the tenth and eleventh verses, making them more significant to that purpose than they are in the Original. Wherefore I think it will not be much a∣miss to compare the Authors Translation of those two Verses and ours with the Hebrew so far as they differ one from the other: ours runs thus. There shall not be found among you any that maketh his Son, or his Daugh∣ter to pass through the fire, or that useth Divinations, or an observer of times,
or an Inchanter, or a Witch. Or a Charmer, or a Consulter with familiar Spirits, or Wizards, or a Ne∣cromancer. Now the main difference (for I pass by those of less concernment) is that instead of a Witch, in the tenth verse this Author has put the word miracle-monger; and for a Consulter with fami∣liar Spirits, a seeker of an Oracle. Now in these places he seems much to blame, for having so peremptorily charg'd the learned Translatours of the Bible with a false interpretation, making himself the only Judge in the sense of the original, and refusing any translation that suites not with his fancy, meerly for that reason. Now the original being rightly conside∣red, we shall find but little difference be∣tween it and our translation, as in that of a Witch, the Hebrew word is , coming from the word , which word, if we may believe the best Hebri∣cians, signifies Witchcraft, or fascinati∣on: for so Buxtorfe, and Xantes Pagni∣nus understand it, expounding it by these
words, fascinum, maleficium, and Prae∣stigium: and so Pagninus in his transla∣tion of the Bible, in which he endea∣vour'd to come as near the sense of the original, as was possible for him, has in this very place expounded the Hebrew , Maleficus, which is the same with our word Witch; Iunius and Tremellius render it, Praestigiator, which has the same signification with the other, though our Author takes it for no more than a meer Juggler, or to use his word, a miracle-monger. But the word has more in it than so, for though it be true, that every Praestigiator is a miracle-mon∣ger, a Juggler, or a Coozner, yet as we find it alwayes used in Authors, it im∣plyes a doing of those deceits by Witch∣craft. As for what he sayes of the word in the Septuagint, that it signi∣fies an Impostor, I cannot at all conceive why he should so positively assert it, or at least why I should believe it, except he could prove from good Authors, that the genuine signification of the word is so; for I do not at all find it any otherwise
than our word Witch has that significati∣on, for it is certain that Witches are the greatest Impostors of the World: and he were extremely irrational, that would believe that the Devil does really those things which many times he seems to do, and that it is in his power to transform the bodies of men and women into those of Dogs, or Cats, or any other Creatures. Yet as we cannot deny but the Devil, having a greater insight into natural Phy∣losophy than ever yet any man has attain'd to, may perform those things by natural means, which will yet be beyond the reach of those who are in the highest rank among us, and have gone farthest in the wayes of nature, so we may easily believe, that he is more cunning in his tricks, whereby he deceives the senses, and that many times he seems to change the out∣ward forms of bodies, when he only de∣ceives the sight by the interposition of co∣lours, and condensation of air, between the eyes of the beholders and the object, or many other wayes which to us are al∣together unknown: But for us to deny
that the Devil can do such things, only because we cannot tell how they are done, or to say that he must be omnipotent, to deceive our weak senses, is so far from a rational argument, that nothing but the want of reason can produce such ridiculous fancies. But to proceed, the Greek word , sayes he, in this place signi∣fies an Impostour, not a poysoner, for it is ridiculous to think that King Manasseth, and Queen Iezabel, exercis'd the Art of poysoning. Now I find it not at all necessary to say that they used the Art of poysoning, though we deny that they were meer Jugglers: yet I see nothing so ridiculous in that assertion as he does; for it may with reason enough be suppo∣sed, that Witches do, by their confede∣rated Devils, infuse poysonous and noxi∣ous humours into those bodies which they desire to hurt: and 'tis likely that Manas∣seth and Iezabel, being practitioners in that Art, were not wanting in any thing that belong'd to their profession. Now where he sayes that these miracle-mon∣gers (as he calls them) were so severely
prohibited in the Law of Moses, be∣cause they acted strange things in the sight of the people, to confirm them in a false Religion, I can easily grant him that this was one cause, but that it was the onely cause I cannot readily believe, since the Art was in it self wicked, and most de∣testable; and by consequence so displea∣sing to God, that he would not suffer it among his people: and besides, I do not think that it was the design of all those that professed this Art, to establish a false Religion, but rather that they did it for gain, by fore-telling things to come, as 'tis likely the Witch of Endor did. As for what he objects of their being coupled together with Sooth-sayers, many times in those places of Scripture, where men∣tion is made of Idolatry, it is not at all strange, for where should we so reasona∣ble expect to find those wicked Artists, as with an Idolatrous and ungodly people. And we may easily think, that the Devil when he finds a people inclin'd to Idolatry will not be wanting to the farther deceiv∣ing of them, so far as his false miracles
and lying wonders can conduce to it: But to conclude from hence, he seems to do, that they were prohibited meerly for upholding it, I see no colour of rea∣son. But here I find my Author endeavour∣ing to perswade the World that Pha∣raoh's Magicians were nothing else but Jugglers, and brought Serpents in their sleeves or pockets to make a fool of Pha∣raoh, by conveying them into the place of their sticks by some slye trick of Legerde∣main. But I find much difficulty in this cheat; for first, I cannot possibly believe, that Moses and Aaron told the Magcians before hand what it was they intended to do, and if not, how it came to pass that they were provided of necessaries for such a cheat; and were so ready at Pharaoh's call, without so much as desiring time to catch the Serpents, and to pull out their stings, for fear of the worst (for other∣wise it had been a kind of jeasting with edged tools.) But to be so quick at it, was I believe an Art beyond the reach of modern Jugglers, But suppose they
were furnished with all things requisite, I cannot see how that could serve their turns, for we read in the Text, they did as Aaron had done, for they cast down every man his Rod, and it became a Ser∣pent; and in the Hebrew it is the same, et projacerunt unusquis∣que, virgam suam, and the Septuagint By these I think it plainly appears that the Magi∣cians cast down Rods, which afterwards became, or at least seemed to be turn'd in∣to Serpents. Now I believe, our Author will have enough to do, to show by what means those miracle-mongers could make their Rods seem to the eyes of Pharaoh, and the other Spectators, after they had thrown them down, to be chang'd into Serpents, and to think that when they had once cast them out of their hands, they could recover them a∣gain, and lay Serpents in their places (except they could have shown Pharaoh and his attendants, some pretty thing up∣on the Wall, to employ their eyes in the mean time) is a whimsey beyond the
reach of imagination. And though we suppose, that Pharaoh and his Nobles were such fools, yet Moses and Aaron were wise men, and one would think, being concerned themselves, might have so carefully observed them as to discover it. But if we could possibly conceive, that notwithstanding all those difficulties, it might be a meer Juggle, the Gordian knot is yet behind, which I will present to our Author to unty (if he can) which is that he would be pleas'd to tell me by what kind of Legerdemain these men could turn the waters of the Rivers into blood, or if by any pretty slight of hand they could make the Frogs come up from the Waters upon the Land of Egypt: and if they could, why they were to seek at the bringing of Lice, for to humane reason this seems as easie as either of the other two. Here methinks I find mine Author at a stand; and because he has not his an∣swer ready, I would advise him in the mean time to say; that certainly that these Magicians dealt with the Devil, by whose assistance they  thus far in opposition
to Moses and Aaron, but that here God (without whose permission the Devil can do nothing) thought good to set his bounds that he might go no farther. And this, 'tis probable, made them say that the finger of God was in it, because they found that power by which they acted, restrain'd by a greater: for if they had done these things by slight of hand, they would only have thought that Moses and Aaron were more cunning Jugglers than themselves, without acknowledging that it was the finger of God that did it. But I find him yet very unwilling to yield, be∣cause, sayes he, whosoever believes that the Devil could turn these staves into Serpents, ascribes to him an omnipotent creating power: But if this be all he sticks at, I shall quickly remove that obstacle, by showing upon how little reason it is founded; for first let him consider the vast difference which is between creating all things of nothing, and changing one thing into another: for by creating we understand the giving of the first being, and making not onely the thing, but the
matter also, of which it is compos'd. Now I see nothing of this ascribed to the Devil by that opinion. Secondly, let him observe that many times such chan∣ges are seen in nature, Serpents being bred of the corruption of other bodies, even of rotten Trees and sticks: and the De∣vil having had time enough to search into the wayes of Nature, might probably follow the same steps which she treads in changes of this kind, though he might go faster, and be sooner at his journeys end: and seeing no man has yet attain'd to that perfection in Natural Philosophy, as to know the thousandth part of what may be done by natural means, it is but vani∣ty in any one to measure the time which is requisite, for such a production being wrought by Supernatural Agents, espe∣cially seeing no man knows the means by which it is done (for would not that man make himself extremely ridiculous, that should with an ignorant confidence affirm that 'tis impossible to take the Co∣py of a Book by any means sooner than by writing, because he never knew the Art
of Printing?) Now if he grants that the seed of a Serpent is in a stick, and that the Devil of this seed may produce a Serpent (as he seems to do) and that sooner than they are form'd by Nature, for he confesses that Devils may strangely promote the generation of several Crea∣tures, if I say this be granted, I may as well say that he can do it in a minute. For if by his great skill he can find out wayes of accelerating generation, why may not he improve those wayes, by the greatness of his skill so far as to do that in an hour, which nature does in a year: for to say, that in regard the Devils do these things by application of matter to matter, they cannot produce a Creature of it's seed without such a space of time as to us seems convenient, is to measure the Devils knowledge by our own, and to fathom the depth of Nature by the short line of our understandings. But I see no necessity of believing that the De∣vil chang'd those Rods into Serpents, neither do I believe it, but rather think that it was a meer illusion and deceit of
the Devils, who might either deceive the lookers on with an appearance of what was not really there, or by placing true Serpents instead of the staves. And now I would not have this Author take me up, and say that if I once recede from the letter of the Text, he may as well say 'tis a Juggle of the Magicians, for I have already said that it is not at all con∣ceivable, that it was possible for the Ma∣gicians to do it by meer humane Art, in regard that when they threw them down, they were yet staves; but though we de∣ny that it could be done by them, we may yet believe that the Devil has both agility, and subtilty enough to effect it. But if he will, after all this, believe that the Magicians might, by slight of hand, conveigh away the staves, and lay Ser∣pents in their places, certainly he cannot think that they turn'd the waters into blood, and brought up Frogs by slight; for I cannot see how they could carry Frogs enough about them to strew the Land with, neither do I believe the Au∣thor himself can guess how it might be
done, because he silently pass'd by this place of Scripture. As for the interpre∣tation which he has given to the Hebrew , by their tricks, (thinking from thence to infer that they were no o∣ther that the tricks of the Magicians, though such an inference is of small force, it properly signifies by their Inchantments; and so Iunius and Tremellius, Arias Montanus, and Pagninus expound it, all three in the same words, Incantationi∣bus suis, and in this his exposition of it he differs from most, if not all Translatours. I am of the same opinion with him where he sayes the Scripture speaks oftentimes according to the deceived apprehensions of men, and I cannot deny but it may be so in this expression of the slaves being turn'd into Serpents; but that it is so, as he affirms, in that of Samuels being raised when Saul came to consult the Witch of Endor, I cannot say, for the Scripture sayes not that the Witch raised Samuel, and that he was sent by God, is not so very improbable as he would make it: for though God to shew his displeasure
against Saul, had refused to answer when he enquired of him, there is no reason from thence to conclude that he did not at this time send Samuel to him, seeing God might do it for many reasons un∣known to us: And 'tis probable that if he had at first answered Saul (though he had received the same answer as he did now from the mouth of Samuel) he had not been stricken with so great a sence of his sin, and of Gods anger against him, as by being first reduced to the extreamity of not knowing what to do, or whither to go for counsel, because God had refu∣sed to answer him. And to say that 'tis unlikely that God would answer him when he sought in a forbidden way, is vain, for we see that he did the same, in sending Elijah to meet the Messengers of Ahaziah, when they were going to en∣quire of Beelzebub, in the first Chapter of the second book of the Kings. But we must not look for a reason of all Gods actions; we find that many times his great wisdom sees good to do those things which to us seem very strange, and
unaccountable. Besides 'tis no small mo∣tive to perswade us that it was Samuel, that the Witch cryed out, as at some un∣expected accident, being, it may be, frigh∣ten'd at the sight of one whom she so little expected: and this, 'tis probable, made her say that she had seen a God coming up from the Earth, meaning a blessed Spirit. As for his Argument drawn from Samuels words, Why hast thou disquieted me? That he was not sent by God, seeing that could have been no trouble to him, it is of no force at all, for those words were spoken to Saul's ca∣pacity, and as being words of course, im∣porting no more than if he had said, why hast thou not suffered my Body to rest? that is, lye still in the grave: and the Hebrew word in this place implyes no more than, why hast thou mov'd me to come up: So this phrase of dead bodies, resting, and being disturbed, is usual with us, though we know that they are not at all sensible of repose, or disquiet. But if it were not Samuel, 'tis very irra∣tional to believe that it was either the
Witch, or any confederated person, for two reasons; first, because it is said in the Scripture, that Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself; for it is not imaginable that any man could so change his face, as that Saul, (who que∣stionless was well enough acquainted with Samuels countenance) could be de∣ceiv'd by it: and to think that Saul saw him not is as ridiculous, for then why did he bow himself? Secondly, because he foretold Saul's Death; for if, as this Author supposes, it had been said by the Woman at a venture, the more cunning way had been to have told him that he should live, for then if he had died, who could have accused her of falshood? If he had liv'd she had told the truth: But to tell him positively that he should dye, and not only himself, but his Sons too, and this with a limitation of time, to morrow, was something too much to be spoken at a venture. The second difference between our Translation and the Authors is, where he puts a seeker of an Oracle, for a Consul∣ter
with familiar Spirits. Here he tells you that the word  is taken in Scrip∣ture sometimes for the gift of Oracling, sometimes for the person that has such a gift: this is as much, and no more, than if he had told you that he is pleas'd to understand it so; I confess as an Oracler may be understood, that is, for one that takes and gives answers from the Devil, , may have that signification; for ob properly signifies a Daemon, or an evil Spirit, and so the best Hebricians expound it: now this being the true sence of the word ob, I see no reason for blaming our Translatours, who have not at all erred from the Original in this place. But he understands an Oracler otherwise, to wit, for one that gave answers at a venture, and only followed the dictates of his own fancy, counterfeiting strange voices, thereby to deceive the people, &c. And so he interprets the Greek  and , but how they came by that signification I cannot tell, for I find it no where but in his Book. And from the Scripture I think the contrary may be
gather'd, viz. That ob and Python, are taken for an evil Spirit that possess'd the person Divining, and not for the person himself; we read in Leviticus, the twen∣tieth Chapter, and the twenty seventh verse, and a Man or a Woman when there is in them a Python; which words [in them] seem to imply something of this Nature, and that the ob was some distinct being from the per∣son in whom it was, for he could not be in himself. And we find in some old Translations, where mention is made of Saul's turning the Witches out of Israel, 'tis said, Et qui Pythones habebant in ven∣tre. But whosoever reads the sixteenth Chapter of the Acts of the Holy Apo∣stles, will be fully confirm'd that this is the meaning of , except he himself be possessed with a spirit of contradiction, for he there shall find that as St. Paul was walking he met a Maid,  having a Spirit of Divination (as our Translation renders it) and in the eighteenth verse, Paul turning himself , he
said to the Spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her, and it came out that same hour. This methinks shews plainly to any body but our Author, that this kind of Divining was done by the help of the Devil. But it may be he will say (for I know no o∣ther way that he can answer it) that she did but deceive the people by counter∣feiting strange voices, and speaking in a bottle, or some such Juggle, and that where St. Paul bid the Spirit come out of her, it is to be understood, that he bid her Juggling tricks come out of her. But to those that rightly consider this place, it will plainly appear that this  was no other than a Devil; and this being true, I see no rea∣son to deny that the Witch of Endor was possessed with the same Spirit; or that the Pythons of Manasses were Familiar Spirits. Thus I have almost done with his first Chapter. But I cannot pass by one argument which he uses, without ta∣king notice of it; for I cannot tell, sayes
he, how Witches come in here, no, not how Devils neither, except you believe that the Devils made answer at Heathen Oracles, which if you do, I must crave leave to dissent: truly no man can deny him this leave, and he may dissent when he pleases, but I do not conceive my self obliged to follow his example; for if they were, as he supposes, onely Jugling tricks of the Priests, I cannot imagine how it came to pass that they ceas'd so suddenly after our Saviours time: begin∣ning sensibly to fall away at the time of his Birth, and since his Death being wholly extinguish'd. For the first, we find some∣thing considerable in Suidas, who writes that Augustus, who liv'd at the time of our Saviours Birth, as he enquired of an Oracle concerning his Successour, had this answer given him.
— . In English —A Boy Of Hebrew race, whom the blest Gods obey, Bids me go hence to Hell without delay, In silence from our Altars go thy way. Hereupon Augustus at his return com∣manded that an Altar should be built in the Capitol, with this inscription. HAEC EST ara primogeniti Dei. Now if this story may be credited, it makes very much for the opinion of the Devils an∣swering at the heathen Oracles, and this answer is not at all like the fancy of a Juggling Priest, it being neither for the Priests Interest, nor the credit of the O∣racle. Thus we see how soon they began to decay upon our Saviours coming: and
we find another story to this purpose, which happen'd at the time of his Cruci∣fixion, in Plutarchs Morals, that part which is intituled , why Oracles are ceased, where he sayes, that a certain company sailing from Greece towards Italy, were sudden∣ly becalmed, and heard a voice calling one Thamus, who was an Egyptian, and at that time in the Ship; but he being called twice gave no answer, but at the third time he said here am I; where∣upon the voice bid him, when he came at the (Shelves in the Ionian Seas which are called) Palodes, to publish that the great God Pan was dead; then the Ship going forward, he did as he was comman∣ded; for coming to the Palodes, he publish'd it from the poop of the Ship; after which immediately followed a great noise of many shreeking and lamenting together. This being told to Tiberius the Emperour, he enquired of the wise men of his Em∣pire, who this great God Pan should be, but they could give him no better answer, than that he was the Son of Mercury and
Penelope. But the circumstances being con∣sidered, it was thought by the wiser sort to be our blessed Saviour, this happening just at that time when he dyed upon the Cross; the Devils making this great la∣mentation, for that they were from that time to quit those Oracles by which they had so long deceiv'd the World. But however it was, we are certain that from that time they began to decay extremely, and in a short time came to nothing; and the famous Oracle of Delphos was silent in Iuvenal's time, as we may see by that expression of his, Delphi Oracula cessant: This their general silence is no small Ar∣gument that there was something more in them than our Author supposes; for if they had been no more than such deceits as he speaks of, I see no reason why they might not have been acted as well since our Saviours time as before, for we do not find that men are debarred the liberty of cheating, or that they are less cunning now than they were then. But it is probable that God would not suffer the Devil to stand in such open opposition to
his Sons Kingdom, and to carry on the interest of the Kingdom of darkness, where the Sun of Righteousness was risen, and the light of the Gospel was made manifest. Now by the Title of his second Chap∣ter he would make you believe that he there proves, that the Opinion of Witch∣es had it's beginning from the Heathen fables, but when you come to the Chap∣ter it self, there is no such thing; indeed he tells you a story of one Lamia, whose Children were killed by Iuno, and that she out of spight used to kill those of other Women, and that from thence Witches (being called Lamiae) had their Original: thus, a man who had never seen a Swan, might dispute against their being, and say that the fancy of Swans had it's first rise from Ovid's Metamorphosis, because he there speaks of one Cyenus, who was chang'd into the first Bird of that name. But the weakness of this Argument is so obvious, that it stands not in need of a confutation: then he tels you how far the folly of men (as he calls it) has procee∣ded in their belief concerning the Actions
of Witches, as if, says he, they could transform Men and Women into Beasts, as if they could destroy the fruits of the Earth, and the fruit of the Womb, &c. I am of opinion that the most rational assertors of Witchcraft are as far from believing that the practisers of it can change the bodies of Men and Women into those of Beasts, as he is, though the common people that search no farther than the outward senses can dis∣cover, may believe it. But I see no rea∣son why we should not allow the Devil a little more cunning than Pharaoh's Ma∣gicians, for he grants that they by meer humane Art could so far deceive the Spectatours, as to make them believe that their Staves were turned into Ser∣pents; and I think the Devil may go far beyond them in the Art of Juggling, as to do the same with the bodies of Men and Women: Besides, the Devil has those advantages which they had not, for being a Spirit, he can take to himself a body of what form he pleases, which he may afterwards transform to any other
shape; so that when we think we see the body of a Witch transformed, it may be only the Vehicle of the Devil in her like∣ness. And that he can destroy the fruits of the Earth, or of the Womb, and en∣able or disenable in matters venerial, seems not at all hard to be believ'd, seeing humane Art can reach so far: as for his raising of Winds and Tempests, we need no other Argument than that exam∣ple we have in the first Chapter of Iob, to convinee us of it: Besides, that he is called in Scripture the Prince of the Air, is something considerable to this purpose; and 'tis probable that he may as easily cause Lightnings and Thunder, as he could bring down fire in such abundance upon Iob's Servants and Cattel, as to consume them: now when we find in Scripture, that Winds and Tempests have been rais'd by him, I think it is a sufficient warrant for us to believe that he can do it. Then he tells you that exam∣ples of this prodigious power are scatter'd up and down the Roman Poets, and quotes you two whole sides out of Ovid,
Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, and Lucan, and alas, all this stir to very little (or to speak more truly, to no) purpose; but onely to shew that these Poets did speak of those things, and that indeed he has very clearly demonstrated: But I will not so much as suppose that he meant from hence to conclude that nothing of this Nature is true, for then I might think that he would say, the World had no beginning, because Ovid writes of it. But sayes he, the ingenious Poets them∣selves, nor the wiser sort of Heathens, did not believe these things; and what then? I hope he will not say that we must believe no more than the wiser sort of Heathens did; for if he does (to use his own words) I must crave leave to dissent. He says he could instance in ma∣ny more of the Ancients (and all, I be∣lieve, to as much purpose as these.) But he will conclude with Nero the Empe∣rour, who having studied the Art of Ma∣gick, did at last despise it as vain, and promising more than it can perform. But what is this to the purpose, for it is no
Argument to say, Nero could not be a Witch, Ergo, there are no Witches; it may be the Devil thought Nero sure e∣nough without a contract, and 'tis likely that he will not engage himself in such bargains when it is no advantage to him. Besides, the Devil will not appear to Atheists, for fear of undeceiving them, and it may be he took this course to con∣firm Nero in the belief that there was nei∣ther God nor Devils; and it may be that if he had made a contract with Nero, he would have required more at his hands than our Witches do, or then he was a∣ble to perform; for his ambitious mind could not have contented it self with such petty practices as theirs are; for he had already wherewithall to satisfie himself in the enjoyment of Worldly pleasures, and he stood not in need of the Devils help or any tricks of Witchcraft to wreak his fury upon those that had offended him: But the Devil usually takes advan∣tage of poor silly wretches, over-ruled by malice and desire of revenge, and wanting means to execute their malicious
designs, whom if he can satisfie in this particular, and in the accomplishing of their inordinate lusts and pleasures, they aim no farther. But I need not insist upon this; it is enough to say, that his not being a Witch, is no Argument a∣gainst the being of Witches in gene∣ral. His third Chapter is nothing but the story of the first setting up of the inquisiti∣on, and of their proceedings; where he tells you what a great number of Witches were then discover'd, and supposes them to have been all innocent, having their confessions extorted from them by extre∣mity of torment: truly I cannot say any thing to the contrary, but weak spirits may by torture be brought to confess any thing; and I verily believe that many in∣nocent persons suffered by this cruel way of proceeding, as well as those which were guilty; but I cannot from thence conclude that none were guilty, either there or any where else, no more than I can say that because many at Amboyna were forced by torture to confess that they
had conspired against the Governour, there are no Traytors in the World; so that I think I may pass by this Chapter, and come to the fourth, which by the Title seems more considerable; for that tells you that there are Arguments to prove that there is no such thing as a Witch in Scripture, as also to prove that there is no such thing as a Witch at all. Now because he has yet said nothing towards it, I suppose he has reserved his greatest strength for this Chapter; so that if I can come off here without harm, I shall think my business done; wherefore it will not be amiss to take these Argu∣ments into consideration. The first, says he, shall be taken from the difference which is between our vul∣garly reputed Witches, and those which our Translatours of the Bible call so; for who be they, but the Kings, Queens, and Princes of this World? Whereas now adayes, they are poor, silly, and contemptible persons. Now let any ra∣tional person judge if there be any force in
this Argument: for supposing this to be true, there will follow nothing from hence to his purpose; for his Argument rightly considered sounds thus, Our Translatours of the Bible call none but Kings, Queens, and Princes, Witches. Our Witches now adayes are poor, contemptible persons. Ergo, there is no such thing as a Witch in Scripture. This is a strange sort of Argument to be brought by a rational man, and stands rather in need of pity than an answer: yet to satisfie him I will say thus much; that he ought to consider that the Scrip∣ture mentions the Witchcrafts of Kings and Queens, as being the more considera∣ble, and such as concern'd all Israel in gene∣ral; and also, that in writing their lives, these practices of theirs could not be omit∣ted: Now it was not at all requisite that the Scripture should speak of every old Wo∣man in Israel, that was a Witch, since it
was nothing pertinent to the story: this I say might serve to answer him, supposing his assertion to be true, that the Scripture makes mention of no other Witches but Kings and Queens; but that is not ap∣parent; for where the story required it, we find that the Scripture does take no∣tice of meaner persons that practised this Art, as in that passage of the Witch of Endor; as also where it is said that Saul turn'd them all out of Israel, for we can∣not suppose that he turn'd out so many Kings and Queens; but we may easily think that many of them were poor con∣temptible persons, as well as some of ours. But seeing there is nothing in this Ar∣gument to stop me, I will pass to the se∣cond, which is drawn from the Sadduces, who denyed Spirits, and the Resurrection of the Dead, yet had the five Books of Moses in great esteem among them; wherefore, sayes he, either they did not understand Hebrew, or the notion of a Witch does not appear in Scripture. This Argument is as weak as the other,
for if he means that there is no mention of Spirits in Scripture, the contrary is easily proved, what ever the Sadduces thought; and it is very manifest from ma∣ny places of Scripture that there were both good and evil Spirits: in the nine∣teenth Chapter of Genesis, and the first verse, it is said that two Angels came to Sodom; so in the thirty second Chapter, and the first verse, Iacob went on his way, and the Angels of God met him; so we read that Iacob, in his dream, saw a Ladder that reacht from Earth to Hea∣ven, and the Angels of God ascending and descending on it: many other places there are where mention is made of the Angels of God: Now in the seventeenth of Leviticus, and the seventh verse, it is said, and they shall no more offer their Sacrifices unto Devils; and in the thirty second of Deuteronomy, and the seven∣teenth, they Sacrificed to Devils, not unto God; and other examples of this kind might be produced; yet by his Ar∣gument nothing of all this should be found in Scripture. Now if he once yields (as
he must do) that the notion of a Devil appears in Scripture, for what end serves his Argument drawn from the Sadduces, but to shew that they were in an errour, and mis-understood the Bible: But I cannot be convinced that the Sadduces de∣nied the being of Spirits in general, though we read that they deny'd the Re∣surrection, or that there was either An∣gel or Spirit, for that has reference only to the Spirits of Dead men; for if they had denied all Spirits and Angels, 'tis not likely that our Saviour would have told them, as he did, that men in the Resur∣rection should be as the Angels of God, for what would such a comparison have signified to those who denied that there were such things as Angels. Now if we believe that they acknowledged any Spi∣rits, whence can we draw an Argument to prove that they denyed the being of Devils. But whatever the opinion of the Sadduces was, we are not to be go∣verned by their Judgment, in deciding whether or no the notion of a Witch ap∣pears in Scripture, but by our own; nei∣ther
have we any great reason to rely up∣on their understanding of the Scriptures, though this Author sayes much for it; seeing our Saviour tells them that they erred, not knowing the Scriptures. Now for his third and last Argument, which is taken from the different practices of those whom our Translatours call Witches, and those which are vulgarly supposed to be so; for sayes he, our modern Witches practise an occult and secret Art, and 'tis great Art to discover them, by several strange signs and horrid tortures; but the others practis'd what they did openly and in the face of the World: I have this to answer, that he is extremely deceiv'd in this point, for that the Witch of Endor practis'd openly, is not to be imagined, seeing she was so cautious when Saul came to her, that she durst not do any thing till he had sworn to her that she should have no harm, but asked him why he laid a snare for her Life. And since the Law was so strict against them, as it is in the twentieth of Leviticus, and the twenty seventh verse, where it is
said, A Man or a Woman that hath a Familiar Spirit thou shalt not suffer to live, but shalt stone him with stones, his blood shall be upon him (I say where such a Law was in force) it is not likely that this Art was practised openly, and in the face of the World, as he sayes, but that they were as private as ours are▪ but, sayes he, if they were so, how impossible was it for Saul to turn them all out of Israel? 'Tis true indeed, it was impossible for him, neither did he, for the Witch of Endor was yet there; and if one remained, there might be as well a hundred, or a thousand, notwithstan∣ding his objection of the first of Samuel, and twenty eighth Chapter, where we read that Saul had put away those that had Familiar Spirits out of the Land, which must of necessity be understood, that he put the Law in Execution against them, putting all those to death which were discovered, so that they durst not practise openly; and so he might well be said to put them out of the Land, though there were hundreds yet remain∣ing,
which practised secretly and by stealth, because he used all possible means for the rooting them out of Israel; nei∣ther can he certainly say that Manasses practised this Art openly, for the Scrip∣ture onely sayes that he used Inchant∣ments, and Divinations, and dealt with Familiar Spirits, which he might do pri∣vately, though he was a King: yet I can easily grant that when both King and peo∣ple were wholly given up to Idolatry, and all other wickedness, any thing might be practised openly; wherefore that hin∣ders not but it might be the same Art which our Witches use now adayes, though practised in a different manner. Thus I have done with his Arguments, by which he endeavoured to prove that there is no such thing as a Witch in Scripture, and am now come to those by which he undertakes to prove that there is no such thing as a Witch at all. To his first I perceive I shall not need to say much, it being onely this; that seeing there is no such thing in Scripture, it follows there is no such thing at all:
therefore I shall onely say, that seeing the force of this Argument depends wholly upon those which went before, they be∣ing already answered, this may keep them company. Now he objects, that the Law of Moses being so strict against be∣stial and incestuous Concubinage, it would seem very strange, the Opinion of Witches being true, that it should not so much as mention Diabolical. To this I answer, that it is not at all strange that it should not mention particularities, when the whole Art is forbidden upon pain of Death; for in that Law [thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live;] this and all other their wicked Actions, were included. So that, whether it was Diabolical Copu∣lation, or killing of Men or Beasts by Witchcrafts, or any other Action of this Nature, all was punish'd when the Witch was ston'd to death. His second Argument is taken from the miserable poverty of our vulgarly reputed Witches; for, sayes he, I am not willing to believe that they have such a power with the De∣vil, as to make him do wonderful things
at their command, when they cannot command him to fetch them money, &c. To this I answer, that certainly the Devil deludes these people with the enjoyment of all sorts of pleasures which they desire, if not in reality, at least in the imagina∣tion, which is all one to them, as if they were real. Now riches not being desi∣rable for themselves alone, but onely as they conduce to a pleasant life, if they can obtain this without them, I see no reason why they should command the Devil to fetch them money: Besides, as they are people of a base and degenerate spirit, having no aim but malice and re∣venge, and the satisfying of their beastly lusts, and coming as near as is possible to the Nature of the Devils themselves, such a sordid way of living may be more suitable to their temper; as also they may out of policy choose such an obscure and contemptible life to avoid suspition, and that they might have the greater freedom to practise their wicked Arts, their Acti∣ons not being so much pryed into, as those of more considerable persons. These
reasons may suffice, though many more might be given for the removing of this objection. In the third place he sayes, that the opinion of Witchcraft is atten∣ded either with irrationality or impiety, for that it is irrational to think that the De∣vil being so full of malice, and breathing nothing but mischief against men, should suffer any man to live, when he can so easily kill us at the command of a Witch: To this I say, that the Devil cannot go be∣yond his Commission, and that it is in Gods power to stop the course of the Devils malice, when, and where he plea∣ses. Besides, 'tis very probable, that the Laws by which the Devils are gover∣ned, do not allow them that freedom; for by that means the interest of the dark Kingdom would not be carried on, seeing it is the ruine of the Souls of men, not the destruction of their Bodies, by which it is established. So that cunning and slye temptations are more advantagious to this end, than open violence; for if the Devil should take this course to wreak his malice upon men, they would be
more sensible of his mischievous practices; and finding themselves too weak to make resistance, it might be a means to draw them from their evil courses, and make them run to God for succour. This I say may be suppos'd, and it is enough to clear this opinion of irrationality, if we can guess at a reason why the Devil would not take this course, though he had his liberty of hurting whom he pleas'd; but it is certain that neither Devils nor Witches can hurt us without Gods per∣mission. But I see no such impiety in saying that God does many times permit such Actions (as the Author seems to think there is,) for then it were as impi∣ous to say that God suffers us to be temp∣ted to sin; yet we are certain that the Devil cannot do it without his permission; as appears by that expression of St. Paul, He will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able, &c. So if we acknowledge that God is omnipotent, we must confess that no wickedness could be done in the World without his permissi∣on, seeing it is in his power to prevent
it; and there is no impiety in affirming that though God of his great mercy may preserve any man from falling into sin, yet he is not bound to do it, neither does he, as we see by daily experience; and if we once grant that he suffers men to sin, where lyes the impiety of saying that he permits Witchcraft? If we do not de∣ny that God suffers one man to murther another, why should we not, without impiety, confess that he suffers Witches to do the same thing? Certainly no rea∣son can be given why it should be more impious to say that he permits one sin, then another; and if not, I see none, why this opinion should be charged with either irrationality or impiety. His last objection is as malicious as it is frivolous; for, sayes he, the opinion of Witchcraft being true, no man can be able by the light of reason to know if Christ were a Witch or no. But if he had conside∣red the difference between the miracles wrought by the Holy Jesus, and the Impo∣stures of Witches; if he had considered the different ends to which they tend, if he had
had any regard to the life and conversati∣on of our Blessed Saviour, and that of an Impostor, the holiness of the one, and the wickedness of the other, if he had weigh'd the words of our Saviour, You shall know the Tree by it's fruit; can one gather Grapes of Thornes, or Figgs of Thistles? he might have spared this Ob∣jection. Who ever believed, of all the rational assertors of VVitchcraft, that an Impo∣stor could infallibly cure all diseases by a word of his mouth, or a touch of his hand? That he could raise the dead to life, after they had been so long buried as to stink in their Graves? That he could feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes; that he could cause the Earth to tremble, and the Sun to be darkened at his death? The graves of dead men to be opened, and their Bodies to arise to accompany him at his Resurrection; final∣ly, that he could raise himself after three dayes burial, and converse for some days with men, and at last gloriously to ascend up to Heaven in the sight of several wit∣nesses.
Methinks the manner of our Saviours Birth is enough to satisfie us in this par∣ticular, that he was born of a Virgin, that a glorious Star appeared over the place of his birth, that a company of Heavenly Angels were sent to proclaim it, as tidings of joy to the whole World; and that the wise men being led by his Star, which they had seen in the East, came so far to worship him, and bring him presents. Much more might be said to shew the great difference between them; but I think it is so visible to those who have read the life of our Saviour in the four Evangelists, that I shall not need to insist upon it; I will onely add, that the sweetness of his disposition, the sincerity of his Doctrine, the holiness of his life and conversation, his transcendent know∣ledge, his zeal for the glory of God, and the Salvation of men, are infallible Testimonies to prove that he was no Im∣poster: So that, if whatever has been by the common people ascribed to Witches, which seems miraculous, were really true, and that they had done
all, or more than has ever been believ'd of them; yet should we have no reason to doubt of our Blessed Saviours Divini∣ty; and his faith that thinks so, is but weakly grounded, and in danger of being shaken by every strange Action, which is beyond the reach of his understanding. Our Saviour himself has told us that false Christs shall come, with signs and won∣ders able to deceive, if it were possible, the very Elect, which is enough to con∣vince us, notwithstanding this Authors objection, that such miraculous Actions may be performed without a Divine com∣mission, as may carry with them a great shew of Divine power; but he is in a deplorable condition that from thence concludes that Christ Jesus might be an Impostor. Thus I have done with his ob∣jections; after which he tells you his opi∣nion of the Nature and power of Devils; I believe, sayes he, that the Devils are aërial Creatures, and though they have more skill, strength, and agility than men, yet they act as men do by applying Natural Agents and Patients, one to the
other, in this sublunary VVorld; but as for the VVorld aetherial, or coelestial, I suppose they have no power there, but consequently that the wind bloweth when and where it listeth; and that the seasons of the year are neither promoted nor hindred by them, or the fruits of the Earth: To this I answer, that I think it is apparent out of the first Chapter of Iob, that the Devil may raise winds and Tem∣pests; but I am of his opinion, that he cannot promote or hinder the seasons of the year, or alter the course of the Stars and Planets; as for the last, touching the fruits of the Earth, he himself has said enough against it, in the eleventh page of his Book, where he sayes that men by their well ordering the seeds of Plants may strangely promote the generation of such Plants, and the ripening of their Fruits; therefore he adds, the Devils be∣ing more skilful than men may strangely promote the generation of several Crea∣tures. Thus having answered himself, he has sav'd me the labour; and I see very little, or no reason that he has, to tax the
affirmers of Witchcraft, with approach∣ing to the opinion of the Persians, of two great principles of good and evil, both Almighty; for by the opinion of Witch∣craft, nothing of omnipotency is ascri∣bed to the Devil, as he supposes; and by this saying, he seems not to under∣stand what is meant by omnipotency; for any one Action, how strange soever it seems to us, cannot be an Argument to prove an omnipotency in the doer; so to say, if the Devil can raise a wind, he must be omnipotent, is ridiculous, as much as if he said, I can blow with a pair of Bel∣lows, Ergo, I am omnipotent; I can do one thing, Ergo, I can do all things: if the Devil raises a wind, he does but Act upon natural Bodies, and by natural means, which requires nothing of omni∣potency. So if he causes Thunders, or Lightnings, or if he changes one Body ito another, he has still matter to work upon, and so long we may suppose any thing to be done without omnipotency, bcause we know not how far the Laws of Nature are intended.
Now for what he quotes out of the Ancyran council, it is not much to be re∣garded, for it seems not to have been in∣tended against the opinion of Witches in general; but to shew the folly of those Witches which believ'd the illusions of the Devil to be realities, and professed that in the night time they conversed with Diana, or some other heathen god, or goddess: for they feared lest by this their folly the common people might be led to the old errour of the heathens, in believing a plurality of gods: this seems very plain from the words of the Council;—Quod quaedam scele∣ratae mulieres retro post sathanam conversae, daemonum illusionibus, & phantasmatibus seductae, se nocturnis horis cum Diana Paga∣norum Dea, &c. super quasdam bestias e∣quitare; and a little after, nam innumera multitudo hac falsa opinione decepta, haec vera esse credit, & credendo, a recta fide de∣viat, & in errorem paganorum devolvitur, cum aliquid numinis, ant divinitatis extra unum Deum arbitratur. Now that Witches are deluded by the
Devil, and made to believe those things which are many times false, is not to be question'd; but it does not follow, be∣cause they are deluded, that they are no Witches; neither can I find oe sentence in all this decree to prove it: 'tis true, they have endeavoured to shew that these nocturnal pleasures and recreations are onely imaginary, and delusions of the Devil, and this seems to be the scope of the whole decree: and the other decree, —Siquis credit quod Diabolus aliquan∣do creaturas in Mundo facerit, et tonitrua, et fulgura, &c. sua authoritate fecerit, sicut dixit Priscillianus, anathema sit; It was made against that errour of Priscilli∣an, that the Devil has a power in the things of this World, equal to that of God, and can do these things at his own will and pleasure; wherefore these words, Sua authoritate, are put in; but it does not at all deny that he can do those things with Gods permission; and if it had, I think the authority is not so great, but that of the Scripture is to be preferred be∣fore it. As for that which he objects
that the Devil did no more in the case of Iob, than Elijah, or any mortal man may do when he receives a commission from God, I think the contrary may be gathered from the Scripture, I mean, that it was wholly Sathans doing, having only obtain'd leave from God, for, God said to him, all that he has is in thy power; and the same expression is again used in the second Chapter, and the sixth verse; Behold, he is in thy pow∣er; by which expressions we may gather, that God left it to him, and acted nothing of it himself; and it immediately follows, Sathan went out from the prsence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boyls from the head to the foot; it is not said, the Lord smote him; now if this last was done by the Devil, why not all the rest? Besides, if God had been the Actor, the limitation, onely upon himself strech not forth thine hand, had been altogether needless. Thus I have done with his fourth Chapter, and am come to his fifth, which he intitles, An answer to their Arguments which endeavour to prove,
that there are Witches, where I find the Arguments which he produces against himself, to be these: first, that Drums and Trumpets have been heard when nei∣ther Drummer nor Trumpeter was near. Secondly, that the persons tormented have fallen into their fits upon the sight of the suspected VVitches. Thirdly, that immediately upon the threatning, or cur∣sing of this or that person, such an acci∣dent has happened to the party threatned or cursed. And lastly, that the VVitch∣es themselves have confessed it. The first he yields to be true, being unwilling (as he sayes) to gainsay the authority of so many in the world, who affirm it to be so, but he denys that from hence the be∣ing of VVitches may be proved: it is easily thought this Author would not raise a Devil which he could not lay again; and that of so many Arguments as may be brought too for the proof of VVitches, he would only make choice of such as he could answer, or at least would so order the matter, as to leave out the most ma∣terial circumstances, thereby to render
the Argument invalid; for it is true (as he sayes) that onely to hear Drums and Trumpets, and to see Chairs and Stools move about a Room, and no body touch∣ing the one or the other, proves no more than the being of Spirits; but (because he seems to allude to that story of Mr. Mompesson's house in Wiltshire) I will thus answer him; that if these things shall happen in a Gentlemans house, which was formerly undisturb'd, meerly upon the taking away of an idle fellows Drum; if the Devil by such and such signs being demanded, shall declare that the Drummer employ'd him; if upon the Drummers being condemned, and sent to the Islands, shall be quiet, and up∣on his return these disturbances shall be renew'd, these circumstances will render the Argument of no small force to prove contracts with the Devil. Now if he has ever heard the true Relation of the foremention'd story, he will find in it all this that I have said. The second Ar∣gument, that upon the sight of the Witch the party has fallen into his fit,
&c. he answers thus: first, he objects that these stories are different from the former, in this, that those are attested by several persons of Credit, and these are grounded onely in the Juggling delu∣sions of Impostors, and the foolish mi∣stakes of the vulgar: to which I answer, that he speaks with too much haste, and considers not that these things have been sworn by innumerable, and many of them persons of credit, before Judges of As∣size, and in the face of the Countrey; and that Judges are not generally so care∣less of what they do, as to take away the lives of so many hundreds, upon no better ground than the foolish mistakes of the Vulgar. Secondly, he sayes, that if he grants these things to be true, he yet sees no reason to grant that there are Witches, but rather to conclude that these Spirits, which are so gamesome, in doing us mis∣chiefs, when they perceive that any are suspected to have set them on work, use these tricks to confirm the suspition, ma∣king it their sport to see poor innocent people hang'd. Here I will make him
the same objection as he made against the being of VVitches, which is, that if the Devil could by such tricks as these so ea∣sily deprive innocent people of their lives, 'tis irrational to think that he would suf∣fer any body to live, considering his great malice; and if he answers, that he cannot do it without Gods permission, I will say, in his own words, that 'tis impious to concern the great God with these designs of the Devil to take away innocent per∣sons lives: thus by denying of VVitch∣craft, he is fallen himself into the same irrationality, or impiety, of which he accused the assertors of it. But if, as he sayes, the Devil should by such tricks en∣deavour the ruine of poor innocent peo∣ple, 'tis not probable, that he could make those persons Actors in their own ruine, so that all their words and actions should contribute to it; as it happens for the most part, for it is seldom known that people are hanged, because others fell in∣to their fits at the sight of them, without any other evidence against them, but some suspitious actions of their own con∣curring.
To the third, which is, that up∣on their threatning or cursing such things have happen'd to the party cursed, he an∣swers, that it is not to be wondred at, if in the VVorld there has often hap∣pened a notable concurrence of Events, &c. this I suppose he said, meerly for want of something else to say; for it is not at all conceivable (though once in a hundred years such a thing may come to pass, as that upon an Old VVomans cur∣sing a man may immediately fall sick, or dye) that it should be so frequently done, and that such events should con∣stantly attend the curses of some particu∣lar persons, more than others. The last Argument is from the confession of the VVitch; and he answers it thus; that the wisest man in the world may by torture be brought to confess any thing, whether it be true or false: this answer seems very weak, when we con∣sider, that this way of forcing confessions by torture is not in use with us, and by consequence, that can be no reason why our Witches should confess themselves
to be so, except it were really true. But that answer not sufficing, he has another, which is, that he believes, that some silly Old Women overgrown with melancho∣ly and dotage, have really believ'd them∣selves to be Witches, and to have done those things which not onely their foolish Neighbours, but worshipful men in the VVorld, have charged them with. But suppose some one, or two, have been so extreamly foolish, as to be perswaded into that belief against their own knowledge, can it be thought that all were so? Or if we could conceive that any persons by be∣ing accus'd could be made to believe that they were VVitches, what is that to those who have freely accus'd themselves with∣out so much as being suspected by others? Or what to those, who after they had past the danger of being perswaded into this folly, and had stood it out to the last with a stiff denyal, notwithstanding the clear evidences brought in, and sworn a∣gainst them, after, I say, that they had past all this, without confession, have after∣wards penitently acknowledged all upon
the Ladder? To such as these his answer reaches not; yet, that many such have been, is evident to any but those who believe no more than they have seen them∣selves. Now, to suppose that an Old Man or VVoman, sunk in melancholy, may be perswaded to think themselves VVitches, is excusable, if that were all; but to believe, that not onely the Old man or woman, but the Judge, the Jury, and the whole Assize, should be thus abus'd, the witnesses forswearing themselves, only to hang poor innocent people that have done them no harm; and that not onely one Judge, one Jury, and one Assize, should be so fool'd, but thousands of each, and all with nothing; and to imagine that whole Countries, nay, all the Christian world, should be so over-spread with folly, as to establish Laws against a sort of people which ne∣ver were in being, is a madness of which whosoever is guilty, wants but one step more to become a Sceptick, and reject the Testimony of his own senses. Thus, Sir, I have answered, I think,
what is most considerable in this Book; I will pass by the sixth Chapter, as having nothing in it which requires an answer, it being little more than what has been said before, and onely to shew his fancy touching the first entrance of this Opini∣on of VVitchcraft into the world; so that the truth of this assertion being once pro∣ved, the ground upon which that Chap∣ter stands is taken away. And now Sir, it is time that I free you from this trouble (if you have had the patience to suffer it thus ar) and that I beg your pardon for those many errours, of which either haste or ignorance have made me guilty; which if you grant me, you will abundantly obliedge, SIR, Your most faithful Servant.
