Charles R. MOst Reverend Father in GOD, We greet you well. Having oftentimes with great grief observed, That many of Our Loyal Subjects, who formerly took up Arms for Us, and Our Royal Father of blessed memory, to resist that Torrent of Rebellion, which at last overturned this Monarchy, and Church, or who after∣ward, when We were driven hence, followed Us into Foreign Countreys, are now by Old Age, and Wounds, or other Accidents befalling them in that Service, and disabling them for all other, reduced to so extream Poverty, that some of them have been forced to beg their bread; And farther, foreseeing, that in Our Guards, and standing Garrisons, and other Our Forces necessary to be kept on Foot for the Safety of Our Royal Person, and Government, there will be many from time to time, who by reason of Age or Sickness, or other disabilities, will become unfit to be continued in Our Service and Pay, and so unavoidably fall under the same miserable circumstances with the former: We therefore out of a tender and deep Compassion of the sad and deplorable Condition of so many Loyal and brave Men, and being desirous (as much as in Us lies) to remove this also, among other discouragements, which else may hinder even Men of Courage, from entring into this kind of Service to the Crown; have after mature Consideration of the best Means and Methods of attaining so good an end, Resolved to Found and Erect at Chelsey (in a Place very proper for such a Design) a Perpetual Hospital, in which more then Four hundred Aged, or otherwise-Disabled Souldiers may at present, (and so successively the like Number for ever) be Lodged and Supplied with the necessary Supports of Life, suitable to their respective Conditions: In the beginning, and carrying on of which so Pious, and Cha∣ritable a Work, We have of Our own Royal Bounty already expended great Sums of Money, as by the Fa∣brick to that purpose in great part Erected appears. But now being sensible, that the compleat Finishing of so Chargeable a Building, and much more the Perpetual Endowment thereof for the constant Maintenance of so many Aged, and Infirm Persons, will require a greater Expence, than Our particular Bounty (as Our Affairs now stand) can well extend to; We have thought fit to call in the Aid, and Assistance, of all Our Charitable and well-disposed Subjects of Estate and Quality, and particularly of those of the Clergy, who are such: And do therefore hereby Will, and Require you, that you forthwith send your Circular Letters, to all the Bishops of your Province, earnestly inciting them both by their own Example (if they be men of plentiful Estates) and (however) by such Arguments of Perswasion, wherewith so great, and so good a Cause will abundantly furnish them; to deal effectually with all Our good Subjects, within their respective Dioceses, who are Masters of considerable Estates, exhorting them to contribute liberally to so good a Design, tending so manifestly to the glory of Almighty God, and the Service of their King and Countrey. And We do hereby assure both you, and them all, that whatsoever hath been, or shall be done, in compliance with this Our Royal Command, and Our so just Expectations, shall be by Us most Graci∣ously accepted, as a particular Evidence of their good affection towards Us, and of their Zeal for Our Ser∣vice. And so We bid you very heartily farewell. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Fourteenth day of November 1684. In the Thirty sixth year of Our Reign.
