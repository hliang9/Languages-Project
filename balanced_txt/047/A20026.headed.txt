In sundry sorts, this Sclaunder great, (Of Coniurer) I haue sore blamde: But wilfull, rash, and spitefull heat, Doth nothing cease, to be enflamde. Your helpe, therefore, by Wisdoms lore, And by your Powre, so great and sure, I humbly craue, that neuer more, This hellish wound, I shall endure. And so yourAn Act geâˆ£nerall against Sclaunder, and a speciall penall Order for Iohn Dee his cas. Act, with Honor great, All Ages will hereafter prayse: And Trueth, that sitts in Heauenly seat, Will, in like case, your Comforts rayse. Most dutifully in all humilitie at your commandement.
