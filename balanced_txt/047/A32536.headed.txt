CR DIEV·ET·MON·DROIT HONI·SOIT·QVI·MAL·Y·PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms By the King. A PROCLAMATION For the calling in all Moneys of Gold and Silver Coyned or Stamped with the Cross and Harp, and the Circumscription, The Commonwealth of ENGLAND; and for making the same to be current onely to the First of December next, and no longer. CHARLES R. WHereas in the time of Our absence from this Our Kingdom of England, several pieces of Gold and Silver were Stampt with new Motto's and Inscriptions, that is to say, One Piece of Gold, supposed to be of the value of Twenty shillings Sterling, to be called the Twenty shillings Piece, Stamped on the one side with a Cross, and a Palm, and Lawrel, with these words, (The Commonwealth of England;) and on the other side with a Cross and Harp, with these words (God with us;) One other Piece of Gold-money of Ten shillings, to be called the Ten shillings Piece; and one other Piece of Gold-money of Five shillings, to be called the Five shillings Piece, with the same Words, Inscriptions, Pictures, and Arms on each side as the former. And for Silver-moneys, Pieces of Five shillings, and Pieces of Two shillings six pence, and Pieces of Twelve pence, and Pieces of Six pence, having the same Words, Inscriptions, Pictures, and Arms on each side as the former; also Pieces of Two pence, and one penny, having the same Pictures and Arms as the former, with∣out any Words or Inscriptions; and the half-penny, having on the one side a Cross, and on the other side a Harpe. Which several Coyns of Gold and Silver were appointed by the late Usurpers, to pass in all Receipts and Pay∣ments, as other lawful and currant Moneys used to do, and haue accordingly beén used in all Commerce and Traf∣fick ever since Our Return: Nevertheless, We cannot but take notice that these Coyns were Stamped, not onely without, but against Our Authority, and were intended by the late Usurpers as a high Contempt of Us, Our
Crown and Dignity. And though We have hitherto forborn to restrain the use of these Moneys, as being unwil∣ling to make too sudden an alteration in the Common Traffick and intercourse betweén Our Subjects; Yet having found by experience, that this Our indulgence hath proved the unhappy occasion of very great mischief to Our People in general, whilst evil-disposed persons have taken a liberty to Counterfeit, Wash, Clip, and File, as many of this Coyn as they thought fit▪ and do still continue such their practises, hoping thereby to escape the penal∣ties of Our Laws until these Moneys shall be made Legal and Currant Money by Our Proclamation. We have therefore thought fit, and do hereby publish and declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That all such Pieces of Gold and Silver as have been Coyned since the year One thousand six hundred forty eight, with the Stamps, Motto's, and Inscriptions aforesaid, and are of the like Standart and Allay with the rest of the Currant Moneys of this Our Realm, shall from henceforth, and until the last day of November now next ensuing, be received and used in all Payments as lawful Money of England, and so are hereby made and declared to be according to their several and respective Rates and Ualues, for which they were Coyned: And that if any person or persons shall hereafter presume to Wash, Clip, File, Counterfeit, or otherwise abuse any Coyns having the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid, That then all and every such offenders shall be proceéded against according to the Laws and Statutes of Our Realm, made against such persons as Counterfeit, Wash, Clip, File, or otherwise abuse the lawful and currant Moneys of Our Realm, and shall suffer pains of death, and incur such other Forfeitures and Penalties as use to be inflicted in like cases. And that Our Subjects may not continue long under the daily hazard of re∣ceiving false and adulterate Moneys, which are more frequently and usually to be found in the Coyns of the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid; We do further publish and declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That from and after the last day of November, now next ensuing, no Moneys whatsoever, either of Gold or Silver, having the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid, shall at any time be received, allowed, or taken as currant Money, nor shall the same be used in any Receipts or Payments whatsoever, but shall from thenceforth cease to be lawful Money of England, to all intents and purposes whatsoever. Nevertheless, that such of Our Subjects in whose hands these Moneys shall be found, after the last day of November next ensuing, may not suffer too great damage or pre∣judice thereby, We are pleased further to declare, That all and every person and persons who shall bring any Gold or Silver Coyn of the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid, into Our Mint in the Tower of London, shall there receive the like quantity of lawful and currant Moneys, weight for weight, allowing onely for the Coynage. Given at Our Court at Whitehal, the Seventh day of September, 1661. in the Thirteenth year of Our Raign. God save the KING.
