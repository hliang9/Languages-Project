Saint PAUL the TENT-MAKER: IN A DISCOURSE SHEWING How RELIGION has in all Ages, been promoted BY THE Industrious Mechanick. LICENS'D, October the 24th. 1689. LONDON, Printed for R. Baldwin, next Door to the Black-Bull in the Old-Bailey. MDCXC.
THE PREFACE TO THE READER. THE various Constructions, which the ensuing Pamphlet will unavoidably meet with in the World, makes it reasonable to prepossess the Reader, with a favourable opinion of its de∣sign, which at first blush seems so like an Enthusiastick Frenzy, or an absurd Paradox, that more than meer Candour is required to think otherwise. This bespeaks the necessity of delineating this short Essay upon Religion and Industry, in its true and proper colours, by shewing that although the former of these, has been signally promo∣ted, and encouraged by the latter; yet not to be understood in that Latitude, as to exclude the Grand Auxiliaries of Learned, and Ingenious Men: For next to our Blessed Saviour, and his Holy Apostles, we principally owe the Propagation, and Ʋniversal Establishment of Christiani∣ty, to the successful endeavours of the Holy Fathers, and Eminent Doctors of the Church. These have been the chief Pillars which sustained the Fabrick of the Gospel in
all Ages: The Grand Luminaries which have enlight∣ened the dark Heathen World with the bright and pene∣trating Rays of the Religion of the Holy Jesus. The burning and shining Lights, which like so many Crystal∣line Lamps appeared the most illustriously, in the midst of divers intricate, and obscure Heresies, unwarrantable Schisms, perverse Heterodoxies, and erroneous Principles. These Learned and Holy Men have planted and watered, cultivated and improved the Christian Religion; to which the co-operating Grace of God has mercifully vouch∣safed so Miraculous an increase, as in some Nations, as well as individual Persons, to bring forth an hundred fold, in some Sixty, and in some Thirty. To these sub∣ordinately to the Gracious Influences of Divine Provi∣dence, we owe the blessed effects of those successful and pe∣culiar Offices of the Priesthood, which by that holy Chan∣nel, or Conveyance, have been derived to us, through the preaching of the Word, administring of the Blessed Sacra∣ments, comforting, and admonishing of the sick, easing and disburthening of troubled Consciences, with other Acts of their Sacred Ministration. And what I have here said of the Divine and Peculiar Excellency of the Ministry in general, I desire may be also so interpreted of the Gover∣nours, and subordinate Spiritual Pastors of our Church in particular, whose admirable Constitution, both in Do∣ctrine and Discipline, is justly to be accounted superiour to any in the whole Christian World. This being premised of the singular and worthily dignify'd State of the Clergy: In the next place, I think fit to add, That though I have represented Industrious and Mechanick Persons as very in∣strumental in the disseminating, and advancement of Re∣ligion; yet would have them understood, but as the Sons of Abinadab, as so many Uzza's, and Ahioe's, sit only
to drive the Cart; but not to touch the Ark on which it stands, and consequently, not to invade any part of the Sacerdotal Function, which would inflict a punishment upon them, as it did upon Uzza, or upon those more noto∣rious Usurpers of the Sacred Ministry, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who for their Rebellion against, or rather intrusion upon the Peculiar Divine Offices of Moses and Aaron, which they would have prostituted to vulgar and common use, were swallowed up of the Earth, their Houses, and all the Men that appertained unto them. But without men of Secular Employments invading the Priesthood, there seems a proper Province for them, wherein to act, whereby they may abundantly promote Christianity, which I have shewn in the following Dis∣course, consisting in Domestick and private Converse and instruction, in which capacity Men of Labour and In∣dustry both have, and may be very useful, by removing Ignorances in, and Prejudices against Religion, and by consequence in mens attaining to some progress in the ex∣cellent Doctrine of Christ, and his most Holy Apostles. And if in any place of the following sheets, I seem to as∣cribe too much to the performances of Mechanick Men in this case, whereby I may be thought to derogate any thing from that Veneration which is justly attributed to those of the Honourable Tribe of Levi: I desire the Reader so to interpret this Discourse, as that in the whole tenour of it is tacitly imply'd a profound acknowledgment of their lau∣dable endeavours, in preference to the other. But this being considered, I could not see how Labour and Industry could be more forcibly recommended in this Lazy and De∣generate Age, than by demonstrating its even natural ten∣dency to the Propagation and Improvement of Religion.
For that having entailed upon it an Eternal good, which all mankind do naturally desire to participate of, and Labour and Industry being shewn to be useful Expedients conducing thereunto, must needs be embraced upon their offering so advantagious a prospect, especially when they not only secure to us a future, but also a present Temporal Interest. That we are visibly declined from that active and laborious frame and disposition, which made us at once, the Envy and Glo∣ry of Europe, into all the effeminate Arts of Ease, Lux∣ury and Sloth, which has sunk us almost to the lowest de∣gree of an Ʋniversal Contempt with other Nations, is a matter of as much truth as lamentation. In a former Dis∣course concerning Mechanick Industry, I proposed some Methods, whereby to revive our declining reputation as to matter of Trade and Laborious Arts, which I evinced to be highly commodious in respect of our Temporal Profit, and the improvement of the Common-wealth. I have now attempted in this small Tract to make out, that the same is also very considerable upon the account of our everlasting and irreversible Estate in the other World, by shewing the mighty power and efficacy of business towards the encourage∣ing, and farthering of Religion. And now I cannot ima∣gine any thing in the World that can more awaken men out of that Lethargick Drowsiness and Sloth, which this Nation seems so deeply involved under, than are one, or both of these Arguments. Such as have a regard to their Secular Advantage, must (if they act consistently with their design) be Laborious and Industrious; and those who would purchase a lasting and perpetual Peace, and immortality of Bliss to their Souls, must diligently pursue their lawful Callings, and respective Employments in this Life. This (I know) will seem mysterious and unaccountable to those, who re∣spect business as the greatest Obstacle to Religion: but I hope, I have shewn the contrary, when 'tis regularly and prudently managed.
And now, if this weak Piece, brought forth in haste, without the Midwifery of Books, or other Learned helps, may conduce any thing to the retrieving of Labour and In∣dustry amongst us, and to the suppressing of Idleness and Sloth, and consequently of those Vices which essentially flow, and are derived from thence; the Author will have reached his primary and utmost intention in it, and has reason to expect, that a Glowing and Conscientious Zeal for the ad∣vancement of Religion, added to his ambitioning the im∣provement of his Native Country, both which he beheld sunk to so low and sordid an Ebb, (the main inducements which prompted him to this undertaking) will with the Can∣did and Judicious Reader meet with so much Charity and good Nature, as to allow a requisite proportion of each to∣wards a supply of its great, and in rigorous Justice, Ʋn∣pardonable Imperfections.
St. PAUL the TENT-MAKER: IN A DISCOURSE, SHEWING How RELIGION has in all Ages, been promoted BY THE Industrious Mechanick. THE Title of this Pamphlet tacitly implores the as∣sistance of that it seems to lessen, and cry down, whereby to explain its meaning: And in regard that the Author professes to bear a vast Venerati∣on for Learned and Ingenious Men, and consequently to be a great Admirer of Humane Literature, and the Sciences; an Invasion upon their just Rights and Prerogatives in this Dis∣course, might justly be interpreted a Felo de se: And there∣fore to take off that imputation, he prays the Reader to un∣derstand his design, in a brief Exposition of it in the follow∣ing words, (viz.) That from the first steps of Christianity to this day, nothing more promoted the true practice of Religion than In∣dustry, and Employments in business of this World.
This at first view of it, looks as an apparent Solecism, or an egregious contradiction to the generally received Doctrine or Opinion of most Men, who explode Men of Business, and Secular Employments, as deeply immersed in, and even eaten up with the Cares, and Riches, and Intanglements of this life. But in the Sequel of this Discourse, I shall endeavour to evince the contrary, by asserting the truth of the proposition alrea∣dy lain down, upon which I will erect some Arguments where∣by to demonstrate the equal necessity of it, as to the enfor∣cing of Employments in Temporal Concerns, as well as to the restraining an immoderate use of them, in relation to our Spi∣ritual, and more sublime condition. In pursuance of which design, I will look back to the first Dawnings of Christianity, or Morning-light of the Gospel, in reference whereunto, not to urge any thing in contradiction to the opinion of our Divines, as not desiring to deviate from a due respect to them, I shall not presume to alledge any thing against those Reasons which they give, why our Blessed Savi∣our made choice of the Family of a Mechanick, when as the Line of David abounded with such variety of Persons of more eminent Quality and Extraction, as well as of Nobler Employ∣ments in the World. The use that I shall only make of that Observation, will be, to deduce the one or both of these In∣ferences from it: That either our Blessed Saviour pitched upon this, whereby to evidence unto the World, the Divine Pleasure of his Heavenly Father, in respecting Men of Labour, in preference to such as devote themselves to their own ease, and live at the cost of other Men, by eating of the fruits of their pains and toil; or else, that the poorer sort of the Tribe and Family of David, were educated to Mechanick Arts. This in the second place. I think it rational to infer from the premised Observation, because the Holy Prophets in the Old Testament, declared it to be the determinate Will of God, and their Predictions concerning the manner of his appearance in this lower World, did all centre and concur in this, that our Saviour should come in the meanest condition, and lowest Estate of Mankind. From whence it follows, that either of these Instances, or both, do vertually imply, or rather formally prove, that Christianity from its original appearance, or ushering into the World, was attended by Mechanicks.
And to demonstrate that both in the order of Nature and Providence, Trade and Business must be antecedent to, and in the true acception of the word, prevent our Spiritual Pro∣gress, and that we must be Labourers in our own Vineyards, before we can be so in that of our Saviour's; 'tis very remark∣able, that we find him a Carpenter before he was a Preacher. For altho' his Divinity like the Beams of the Sun out of a thick Cloud, shone with so strong an influence, as to irradiate and break through his Infant Humanity, when in the Temple he so strongly argued and disputed with the Learned Rabbies and Doctors of the Law; yet afterwards the Scriptures are silent as to an account of him for many Years: In which interval from the Twelfth Year of his Age (for in that Minority, we are assured it was that he puzzled and non-plus'd the most Learned among the Jews) to his Thirtieth, (the time of his Solemn Inauguration into his Priestly Office) many Learned Men suppose him to have applyed himself to the Trade of Joseph, whom the Incredulous and Obstinate Jews, looked up∣on as his Father, and maliciously to lessen the greatness of the Miracles which he wrought, endeavoured what in them lay, (by vile Reflections upon his supposed Birth, Parentage, and Education) to derogate from their true and supernatural worth, and so were wont to reproach him with these Que∣ries, Is not this Joseph's Son? Intimating his supposed origi∣nal: And in another place, Is not this the Carpenter? By way of contempt of his Vulgar Occupation and Employ∣ment. But now that he hath assumed his Sacerdotal Function, let us follow him in the actual discharge of it; in his entrance whereupon, we find that he selected some particular Persons as his Disciples and Followers. Who these were, of what di∣stinct Callings and Vocations, and how employed, cannot be unknown to any who are but in the least conversant in the Di∣vine Oracles of the Gospel. I know it will be here objected, that his choice of such persons that were of ordinary, and Me∣chanick Employments, was on purpose to manifest his Divi∣nity, and to convince both the Jews and Gentiles, that he was the Christ, by capacitating such mean and illiterate Men, to become the Miraculous Instruments of Preaching, and pro∣pagating of his Doctrine, by many Supernatural Signs and
Wonders, and that to all Nations, in their respective Tongues and Languages. To which I Answer, That allowing of all this, which I know to be the received Opinion of Divines, it does not therefore follow, but that our Blessed Saviour might have made his being the true Messiah, still more eminent, and con∣spicious, in calling of a Rank and Order of Men yet inferiour to these, as low and contemptible as they were; and these might have been Beggars who had no Employment: but we find that our Saviour passes by such, and calls Men from their Occupations, which seems to be a plain Argument, That as Labour was an appendant Curse, or Penal Imposition, conse∣quent to the wilful Apostasie of the first Adam; so it was on∣ly Sanctify'd, not removed or taken away by the Second. For that Judgment pronounc'd by God to Adam upon the occasion of his Fall, was to the end of the World irreversible and per∣petual, and consequently a standing Mark and Memorial of his laps'd condition to all successive Generations of Mankind, namely, In the Sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread. Among those numerous, and ridiculous Absurdities, which are but too evident in the Church of Rome, a Monastick, or recluse life of Idlers, seems not the most inconsiderable. And whatever may be said as to the ancient custom of a private recess, or solitary retirement from the World, in order to a more close pursuit of their Devotions and Spiritual Exercises of Religion, which the Cares and Pleasures, the hurry and di∣sturbances of this Life, are but too apt to cross and oppose, though perhaps those who are capable of a regular govern∣ment of their Affections and Passions, so as in due measure and proportion to make the Affairs of this World subordinate to those of Religion, may by their publick Examples of Ver∣tue and Industry, be more instrumental both to the Temporal and Eternal Welfare of a Community of People, than such can be expected to be, who shut themselves up in a Cloyster, though they should live up to the rigour of their order, and its fist Institution. Yet I suppose the case very distant and remote to this, when it relates to those formal and Hypocriti∣cal Zealots of the Romish Church, who though by their seem∣ing Austerities, and outward Mortifications in Religion, they artsly improve the opinion of their blind and superstitious
Votaries, that they are of the first Class in Christianity, yet their apparent indulging of themselves in Idleness and Luxury, in Sensuality and Voluptuousness, and many of them in those no∣torious sins of Drunkenness and Ʋncleanness, though commit∣ted with great Secrecy, to prevent discovery and the eye of the World, are all of them undoubted Characteristicks, not only of their opposing of the Doctrine of our Saviour, but even that of their own Institution, into what corruption soe∣ver 'tis now degenerated. Thus those who aspire to the high∣est Room in Religion, or at least pretend to it, act diametri∣cally contrary to the Blessed and Vertuous Example of that great Lord and Master, whom, they would induce Men to be∣lieve, that they are desirous to follow, but who never insti∣tuted a Society of Gentlemen, or Beggars, to live in Idleness, and in all vitious and unlawful excess. And we never read, that he went about receiving, (as those of Mendicant Orders do) but always doing good. We need therefore no farther as∣surance of the errour and falshood of that Religion, whose Godliness is Gain; from such we ought to withdraw our selves, as not having so learned Christ. And by these Marks and Cha∣racters, we may easily discern it to be that professed in the pre∣sent Church, or rather Court of Rome. But to return to our Saviour's pitching upon Men of a Vul∣gar and Inferiour Rank, and mean Employments in the World, to be his Dsciples and Successors, let us after this choice pur∣sue them in their Practices, and we shall find that this especial Invitation of our Saviour, to the execution of the Sacred Of∣fice of a Disciple, or Follower of the Holy Jesus, did not su∣persede their former Occupations, nor their Heavenly Em∣ployment give a Dispensation to, or take them off from their Temporal. And though it might have been reasonably ima∣gined, that Christs extraordinary Promise to Peter when he was Fishing, That he would make him a Fisher of Men, seemed so ample a Commission for exercising himself altogether in the Divine Offices of Conversion and Salvation of Mankind, as to give a Plenary Discharge from his former mean Employ∣ment, yet by the consequence we may understand, that this was none of our Saviours Intention. For after this, we find St. Peter at his Trade; and 'tis observable, that the first Mi∣racle, or rather (I may say) that which was solely wrought
by Christ after his Resurrection, was giving a Temporal Blessing to their Labour, which seems, to amount almost to a demon∣stration, that of such Industrious Persons were the Kingdom of Heaven. And to me it seems an aggravating Circumstance of that great Curse that attended the fallen Angels, that they were divested of all Business and Employment; they were now no longer in a capacity of praising or magnifying God: And as to obedience to his Commands, they had already shewn an obstinate refusal. From this Infamous original, our Idle Gen∣tlemen, that contemn Employments, may derive the Antiqui∣ty of their Families, and indeed too many of them are the Le∣gitimate Off-spring of that degenerated Stock, who having wound himself into that evil Employment of tempting Eve, has ever since been extream active in doing mischief, whose bad example such persons amongst us as do but too industri∣ously imitate and transcribe, who wholly devote themselves to Pleasure and Licentiousness. For the Principles of Human Nature being capable of, or rather essentially subject to acti∣on, and continual motion, it is therefore impossible for Man to poize himself so equally in the World, as neither to do good nor evil. 'Tis true indeed that the Body may be so con∣fined, or by reason subjected to something of a neutrality in this case, or more properly may be restrain'd within such bounds of moderation, as not to make any great Excursions into an extream, but the thoughts of the heart being of a more subtil and active quality, are not capable of such a limitation, but operating by a certain Independency or Arbitrary Influ∣ence, must either be employed upon good Objects to divert them from bad, or else for want of the former they have a natural recourse and tendency unto the latter, and by this means do oftentimes move their Instrument the Body by such strong impressions, as to encline it to the reducing of them into act; for which reason it is, that we are told, that from the thoughts of the Heart proceed Murthers, Adulte∣ries, &c. Now since 'tis impossible to chain up thoughts, (which are a kind of spiritous extract, or quintessential part of the Soul, proceeding from it like the Beams from the Sun, and acting the Body by a Parallel Influence with the Rays of that grand
Luminary, when it extends them to this lower World) it seems then to be the reason why our Saviour so encouraged Labour and Employments, that by means thereof we may so keep our thoughts in action, as not to suffer them to ramble upon other Objects, than those of our lawful Callings, and so may check the violent intrusion of Vitious thoughts with that of the Father, (viz.) that we are not at leisure. Thoughts are the Instruments of the Soul, and should not be admitted into vulgar heads, no more than a Knife into the Hand of a Child; and since there is no way to limit or con∣fine them in themselves, the best expedient is to give them a powerful diversion, by meeting and entertaining them with such Objects as are conducible thereunto, which to proportion agreeably to the different sorts and capacities of Men in the World, would be to employ the Populace with Mechanick Labour, and the finer and more Speculative Heads, with Arts and Sciences, that so there might be no Sett of Men, as now there is, governed by the unruly Dictates of evil Thoughts. By a serious reflection upon this first Paragraph, it is obvi∣ous to every Man, that the choice and practice of our Savi∣our in the introduction of Christianity, was directed to the encouragement of Labour and Industry, and that the Grace of God was given to such Servants as employed their Temporal Talent. Let us now in the next place enquire into the Behaviour and Practice of the Apostles after our Blessed Lord's Ascension. And if any may expect or challenge an Immunity from Labour of the hands, we may suppose it to be these Men who were peculiarly commissioned, and so miraculously endowed with such power, and so great a proportion of the Divine Spirit for the promulgation of the Gospel, as seemed to make that of their Ministry the only Province wherein they were to act. Add to this, that they were commanded to Preach the Gospel to all Nations, and that continually in their Travels these Holy Men wrought Miracles, Cured Diseases, and Converted three thousand at a Sermon, where it is reasonable enough to believe, that there were not a few, both able and willing e∣nough, to relieve the famous Instruments of their Salvation; yet for all this, we find that they wrought with their own
hands; and notwithstanding that many of the Saints sold what they had, and laid it at the Apostles feet: yet did they not Convert it to their own use, but dispersed it among the poor Brethren, not to maintain them in Idleness and Sloth, but to put them into a capacity of obtaining their own Li∣ving: and this Charity was not dispensed by the usual Method of this Age, by a Penny at the Door, to preserve Vermin in the Street; for such are the Common Vagrant Beggars, that both the Law of God, and that of the Land, not only forbid our relieving, but enjoyn Punishment too; yet such is the preva∣lency of Custom with some, and of Vain Glory and Ostentation in others, as induce too many to violate both. But to return to the Apostles working with their own hands, I do not hence infer, that there was any necessity for them so to do: or St. Paul has told us, That if they sowed Spiritual things, they might well reap Carnal things, and that the Oxe is not to be muzled that treadeth out the Corn; with variety of other places to this purpose, which enforce a Due to the Apo∣stles, and to others that succeed them in their Ministry; and consequently that our present Clergy have a Right of receiv∣ing Tythes, neither are under any obligation of Working with their Hands; as I have shewn that the Apostles were not. For St. Paul (notwithstanding that he did so) told the Thes∣salonians, That he might have lived on his Ministry; yet he and the other Apostles chose rather to work with their own hands night and day; and he gives this reason for it (which is what I would infer from, and principally aim at in this Discourse) that he might be an example to them of, and there∣by promote Labour and Industry. He tells them therefore by way of repetition, what his Doctrine was when among them, that they should work with their own hands, and study to be quiet; as if Idleness tended to create Discords and Animosities among them, fomented by such as had nothing else to do, and whose Sloth had so impaired their Fortunes, as seemed to put them upon a necessity of retrieving themselves, by raising Di∣sturbances and Confusions in the Countrey: and that on the contray, a diligent pursuit of their respective Vocations and Callings, the best means of begetting Peace and Unanimity with one another. And farther, enjoyns a punishment to such as did not Labour, by ordaining that they should not eat; which
not eating seems (with submission to better Judgments) to mean a prohibition from the Lord's Table, which looks like the true, though contrary to the vulgar, Acception: And my reason for this Opinion is, First, That it seems not practicable that the Church in the days of the Apostles, who had no Temporal Authority, could take away the Means of Mens Temporal Support; nor do we ever read, that any Christian Church (but that of Rome) im∣posed Pecuniary Punishments for sins. Another reason is deduced from the following Verses of the Chapter, where the Apostle seems to explain himself; For (saith he) I hear there are some among you that work not at all: Now such (saith he) let them work, and eat their own Bread. The former it seems were not quite idle, but only faulty in part, and therefore were to be restrained, whilst they conti∣nued so, from the Lord's Table: but the latter were totally guilty, and must first he reformed by eating of their own Bread; that is, by the purchace of their Labour, before they could be admitted into the Communion of the Church. From what we have already premised, both as to the Do∣ctrine, Exemplary Practice, and strict Injunctions of the Apo∣stles, it appears sufficiently plain, That each of these respe∣ctively, as well as all of them, did jointly tend to a redu∣cing of Men from Idleness, as being looked upon by them as the first introductory step of their Conversion to the Christian Religion. The Door is shut, and no entrance is admitted to the evil Spirit, where Men are busied in just and lawful Em∣ployments: whereas indeed idleness is the source and inlet to all manner of Vice, and the Devil will certainly be most active when he finds Men at leisure to receive his impressions. He will then shoot his poisonous Arrows, when the Mark stands so fair, and Men for want of business seem prepared for his wicked Influences and Suggestions. Experience has fully in∣structed him how to improve all opportunities, and it would reflect upon his Art and Policy, not to make an attack when the Garrison is in such a Lethargy that it cannot be rous'd up to any vigorous opposition. Besides, we must consider that Idleness does not only leave room for the Temptations of the common Enemy of Mankind, to operate successfully upon us, but it also raises a Storm within our own Breasts, by naturally
encreasing unlawful Lusts, and vile Concupiscences, which like combustible matter meeting with the fuel of outward al∣lurements, which Satan skilfully accommodates to the evil Genius of our vitious and depraved Affections, must needs resolve into a Flame. Whereas Labour and Industry do not only put a stop to Temptations, by not affording leisure to our thoughts to dwell and ruminate upon them; but also are a good expedient to keep the Body in a due subjection to an even and regular decorum, and consequently to the subduing of extravagant and sinful desires. Therefore Men that are busily employed upon their lawful occasions, are like Conju∣rers secure within their Circle, both from the Snares and Insi∣nuations of the Tempter, as well as from those of their own Lusts: both which an Idle Person is constantly exposed to. It is very remarkable, that we do not in all the Scriptures read of any possessed with Devils, that were Men of Em∣ployment. The Gadarenes were an Industrious People, perhaps had there been many Idlers, the Legion had not crowded into one Man; and when our Saviour turned them out, they made it not their request to enter into the Herds-man that kept the Swine, though as near to them as the Herd: For that poor Wretch was upon his lawful Employment, which was an An∣tidote and counter-charm against the entrance of these Evil Spirits into him. 'Tis matter of Lamentation to consider, that in an Age wherein the Sins of Sodom abound with so great predominan∣cy, there should be so few Lots to Preach against that remark∣able one of idleness. Some will be apt to draw this inference from that omission, that many of our Divines say with Lot concerning Zoar, Is it not a little one? A Gentleman's Privi∣ledge, and so not to be invaded? A Birth-right indeed to the Posterity of Esau, who we find had that quality inherent to a Gentleman in the present Age, which still to continue the Pa∣rallel, was in use, a good Hunter: but we find that the Sons of Jacob were better employed in imitation of the Patri∣arch their Father, who was a plain Man, but a good Shep∣herd.
Indeed it seems very unaccountable, that some Pulpits are full of Reproofs against the Off-spring, and yet silent as to the Parent of all Sin, which is idleness. Whereas, if what the Logicians affirm be true, That Sublatâ causâ, tollitur effectus: It seems the best method to pull down vice, by beginning at the root of it, which being destroyed, no more nourishment can be imparted to the Branches. Now 'tis plain, that Idle∣ness is the Foundation, and that other sins which naturally arise from it, are but the Superstructures of Impiety. 'Tis that which is the Origine and Fountain of all manner of wickedness, and other sins are but the Streams which flow from it: and if we would stop or divert the Current, we must apply our selves to Labour and Industry, which however great Men seem to claim a certain Dispensation or Immunity from, and think themselves free and at loose for their Pleasures; yet we meet with no such exemption for them, either in Sacred, or Mo∣dern Authors, but contrary to that, such have been always stigmatized with the Ignominious Characters of Effeminacy and Luxury, who addicted themselves to Sloth and Voluptu∣ousness: And others dignify'd with the highest Panegyricks, and utmost efforts of Human Praises, who were painful and Industrious. As for example, what a Reflection was it upon the Greatness and Wisdom of Solomon, to give himself such a licentious freedom in all those Lusts and Pleasures which he af∣terwards pronounced to be Vanity of Vanities, and Vexation of Spirit? And after making an experiment of their insuffici∣ency, recommends the study of Vertue and Industry, as the only true Wisdom. On the contrary, How much did it redound to the infinite Commendation of St. Paul, so eminent an Apostle and so Learned a Doctor, bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, and Commissioned to Preach the Gospel to the remotest, and ut∣most parts of the Universe, to work with his own hands, when there was neither any obligation nor necessity for him so to do? What Honourable Titles are given to great Perso∣nages, Alexander, Caesar, and Hannibal, Scipio and Epaminon∣das, and several other Grecian and Roman Worthies who were famed for their great and Industrious Atchievements? On the other hand, With what Infamy and Contempt do Men mention the Names of Vitellius and Heliogabalus, with abun∣dance more of those Bestial Monsters, who sat at the Helm of
the Roman Monarchy? What a different Character do the Hi∣storians give us of Pompey and Lucullus, of Augustus Caesar, and Mark Anthony? And how far do we find these to have out∣stript the other in all their Actions, improving their high Fame by Assiduity and Labour, and the others every day more and more eclipsing the Beauty of that reputation which they had got in the World, by a servile Degeneracy into Effemi∣nacy and Luxury. It were highly to be wished that our Gal∣lants of the Age, would from these and the like Precedents con∣sider, that the way to Immortalize their Names to Posterity, and to render them serviceable in the State or Common-wealth wherein they live, is by applying themselves to such Arts and Exercises of Industry, as may be suitable to their respective Educations and Capacities, and not to think themselves disen∣gaged from all business, because their Birth or Parts seat them above the Rank and Order of mean Employments: For all-wise Providence has composed all things in this World by so exact an harmony, as to make every part of it capable of discharg∣ing its incumbent Office, by a due and regular proportion; so that as in the Microcosm, or little World of Man, every di∣stinct Member is intitled to its proper Function, which it is obliged to perform, though some more honourably than o∣thers; so in a Body Politick every individual person stands bound to acquit himself of that Employment in the State, which God and Nature, his own Education, and the Appoint∣ment of his Superiors has rendered him capable of; other∣wise, if none were obliged to business, but such whose Neces∣sities, and Vulgar Extraction enforced to it, whereby to obtain a Livelihood, the whole burthen of the Common-wealth must lie upon the Shoulders of the Populace, and then a wise Govern∣ment might well be expected, when Employments of the highest dignity and moment, were committed to the manage∣ment of such Plebeian Heads, whose Illiterate Breeding would make them wholly unapt for such undertakings: and yet this consequence must needs be entailed upon that erroneous Opi∣nion which too many Gentlemen by their present Practices seem to maintain: Namely, that a Competent Estate disobli∣ges them from business, and by consequence, gives them an unlimited freedom of pursuing their Pleasures at random; notwithstanding that we find that both now and in former
Ages (as has been hinted already) that Men of action were those who entituled themselves to any credit or reputation in the World: And although such as indeavour to do so now, proceed by Slaughters, and enslaving Kingdoms; yet when the World was less vitious, and Men of more sedate and less turbu∣lent Dispositions, the greatest Heroes wore the Laurels of Arts and Industry; and Nations not only gave up themselves, but even their Names to be honoured with that of their In∣structors, as the Oenofrians of Italus to be called Italians, after that he had taught them the Art of Husbandry. Nay, their great veneration and esteem which they had for such, abound∣ed to that excess, till at last they adored them as Gods, that put them upon Arts and Labour. But I must beg pardon for this Digression from my first design of proving, That Arts and Labour reformed these Heathens to Christianity, as Labour did first from Bestiality to Humanity. In the prosecution of this Discourse, we have already pas∣sed through the Lives of our Blessed Saviour, and of his Holy Apostles, in the course whereof we find the agreeableness of their own practice, with that of their Doctrine, working with their own hands, as already mentioned, and so far from recei∣ving any thing of their Converts, though they told them that they might lawfully have done it, that even we find St. Paul discharging a Debt of a Convert due from him to his Master, that was also one of the same Apostles Followers, likewise pro∣mising that the Servant should for the future be more profita∣ble. And in this place we may fitly observe the great Cau∣tion used by the Apostle, not to interfere Religion with Secu∣lar business, but (as it were) made the better, the greater give place to the lesser; that so no Man should pretend an occa∣sion of lessening his Labour and Industry upon the account of Religion. To illustrate this to you, we must believe, that this Onesimus was a Mechanick, and upon that account profi∣table to his Master. The Apostle we find wanted a Servant, being (as he soon after calls himself) Paul the Aged; and may reasonably be thought would not have been denied him, if desired; but 'tis plain, that he would give no such example of Mens deserting their Temporal to espouse the Spiritual Calling, they were by the God they Worshipped joyned toge∣ther, and therefore no Man was to put them asunder.
But now that we have taken this prospect of what both the Apostles Preaching and Practice was in this case, let us in the next place see, what Approbation and Encomiums were gi∣ven to such as pursued both their Doctrine and Example in this particular, and with it, enquire what other Qualities and Endowments are commended in Holy Writ. And in order to this, I think it not amiss to observe, that in all the Apostles Writings, a greater Character is not given to any of their Converts, than to the Industry of a Woman, of which to shew God's great acceptance and encouragement, a Miracle was wrought to bring her back, that so she might excite others to that Labour, of which she was in her own person so exemplary and remarkable an Instance. That she was a Woman of great Piety, is beyond all doubt, and had she been so in these days, her best Friends would have thought it her highest Encomium, to have enumerated her Hours, and Days of Devotion, and to have left out her Works of La∣bour and Worldly Employment: but we see that the Holy Spirit thought fit to do otherwise, by being silent as to the former, but giving us an ample account of the latter, which tacitly interprets unto us, That Religion affords no Sanctuary, or is any shelter for Idleness and Sloth to repair to: But on the contrary, is the greatest Tye and Obligation to business that can be imposed upon Humane Nature. This may look like a Paradox to some, who measure the Duty of a Christian by the frequency of acts of Devotion either publickly in the Church, or privately in the Closet; that considering both the Doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles to be chiefly levelled at the advancement of Religion, and the debasing of our Se∣cular Interests, thence infer, That they can never too zealously adhere to the former, or too much relinquish and abandon the latter. But it is to be considered, that our Saviour and his Apostles well understood the remisness, or rather averseness of our Na∣tures to acts of Divine Worship, and therefore accounted it more necessary to press their due observance, than that of our Temporal advantage, to which our depraved Dispositi∣ons did but too violently hurry and transport us; otherwise, unless we will own that they contradict themselves (a Suppo∣sition as irrational as 'tis odious to a Christian) we cannot but
acknowledge, that Christianity carries no inconsistence with the pursuit of our Lawful Callings: That Religion and busi∣ness are not incompatible, but that as we are obliged to serve God in our Devotions, so to provide for our selves and Fa∣milies in our Worldly Transactions. An Omission whereof is by the Apostle accounted, not an advancing but a degra∣ding of Christianity below that of absolute Gentilism. And the Apostles reasoning in this case, is both plain and excel∣lent, if we consider, that not only the Law of Nature in its first Institution, did unalterably bind all Mankind to such acts of Industry, as might tend to a preservation of themselves, their Families and Posterities; but even the corrupt Principles of it, in the Degenerate Heathens, wrought with so strong an Influ∣ence, as to conclude themselves bound to Labour upon the same account. Now if our Saviour's coming into the World was not to destroy, but to correct the Errors and Corruptions crept into that Law by the depraved Lusts and Interests of Men, which had strangely byassed and perverted its Original rectitude and design; and not only to reduce it to its former straitness, but to improve every part and principle of it to an higher per∣fection than it was capable of before, it must needs follow, That by so much we are the more obliged to Industry by the Law of Christ, by how much its enforcement thereunto, exceeds that of Nature. Again, Christianity has adopted those things, which Men for∣merly stiled acts of Nature and Morality, into the number of such as are Religious: by which it comes to pass, that Men as really serve God in their Callings, as in their constant and im∣mediate attendance upon Divine Worship. He that has com∣manded us to Pray, to hear the Word, to receive the Blessed Sacrament, and to perform other Offices of Devotion, has also bid us to work with our hands, to be Industrious in our several Stations, to follow the business of our Callings, and the like, and in obedience to the latter of these Precepts, we Worship and Adore the Divine Majesty, as really as in the former: Nay, without these, the other are of small use or advantage unto us, are not very (if at all) acceptable to the Throne of Grace, nor derive to us any considerable Blessings from thence. On the contrary, this pulling down with one hand what we set up
by another, this extremity in Religion to the neglect of our proper and lawful business, obstructs the Divine Favours, and will make all our toil in Religion turn to no good account: And the reason is, because we endeavour to storm Heaven, in a way contrary to the revealed Will of God: Strive to be Religious, by committing of a Crime, and in truth do evil, that good may come of it. I speak not this to discourage Men from making all that proficiency in Religion, which they can possibly attain to provided that they pursue those Mea∣sures which are conducible to that end. I think it impossible for Men to fast and prey, and to repair to their publick and private Devotions too frequently, if these Duties be so pro∣portioned as not to hinder those others which they owe to themselves and Families, which both God and Nature require from them. Neither would I, by any means, have Mens avarice to slacken and interrupt their zeal, upon a pretence of making a necessary provision for their subsistence in this World. This, I'm sensible, is a thing, which is, and may be improved to very ill Consequences. Men are apt to make a sinister use of that liberty which God has given them of following their lawful Callings, by pursuing them to that height, as to neglect their Duties in Religion: And more there are that run to this, than to the other extream, and require the application of se∣vere Causticks to remove their Disease, must be sharply repre∣hended for so foul an errour. But the other being reckoned one of the right hand, deserve a mild and gentle usage, and must be managed by Lenitives, and meek Arts of Perswasion. To such, as it is necessary to give all due encouragement to a re∣gular Progress in Religion, and to animate them to a constant perseverance in the ways of Piety, so mildly to insinuate that 'tis not a moderate, but an inordinate pursuit of worldly business, which interferes with, or carrys any opposition to the Go∣spel. Otherwise, that 'tis so far from being a sin, that 'tis an indispensable duty, in some indeed, to an higher degree than others, suitably to their respective Circumstances or Educati∣on in the World. And this is a truth which we cannot but be the more unquestionably convinced of, if we consider how great a part of that duty which we owe to God, and by Christ and his Holy Apostles devolved upon our Neighbour, as the grand Mark and Characteristick of our unfeigned Love to him∣self.
Now 'tis plain, that the more diligently we pursue our several Callings, the more we are capacitated, not only to provide a competent subsistence for our selves, friends, and Relations, which Nature more immediately binds us to relieve, but also to extend our Charity to such as are in Poverty and Distress; a Sacrifice most acceptable unto God, and which he is better pleased with, than the bare Obedience of the Calves of our Lips. And to me it seems no Contemptible Argument, that Religion is highly promoted by Industry (the Subject of this Discourse) seeing that nothing so enables a Man to be chari∣table as that; and none are ignorant that Charity is a most Christian and Divine Grace, and in the whole (of which that of Alms-giving is a part) preferable to all others in the Gospel. But not to insist longer upon this point, nor to enumerate more Instances out of Holy Scripture of such who are famed by the Infallible Pen-man for their great Labour and Industry, I will in the next place descend to the practice of the Primitive Christians in this case: And if I should wade into Antiquity, and undertake to ransack the account given us of those early times of the Gospel, I might present the Reader with such an inexhaustible treasure of Examples of this kind, as would fill a Volume, and consequently be very disproportionable to the brevity designed in this Discourse. I shall therefore men∣tion one for all, which is that of the Abassine Churches, first Converted to Christianity by the Eunuch, Baptized by Philip, but improved by the Preaching of St. Matthew. The Priests of those Churches get their Livings by Labour, and to oblige them to be the more industrious in it, they are not permitted to receive or beg any thing of the People; and however they seem to have lost much of, and to have sensibly degenerated from the purity of that Doctrine which was delivered by their first Teachers and Instructors; yet that part of it which the Apostles recommended as a standing rule to be taught, and inculcated to the People, is to this day inviolably ob∣served by the Priest, for an Example to his Congrega∣tion.
But to descend to later Ages of the World, we shall find, that in all, or whatever parts of it that Christianity flou∣risheth, there the People are remarkable for their Labour and Industry: But in making so large an Hypothesis, I must crave leave to limit my Assertion to the Reformed Churches, as they are distinguished from that of Rome, whose degeneracy into Heathenish Idolatry, and into diverse, if not all of the lewd, and vitious Courses of the Gentiles, has consequently revived that idleness and Luxury which was predominant amongst them, which as Christianity in its first Establishment, did in a great measure eradicate and supplant; so the same Weeds and Tares growing up again by the Errours and Corruptions of that Church, are now choaked and suppressed in those places where Religion is divested of that grievous Yoke of Romish Su∣perstition, and reduced nearer to that original purity, in which it was first delivered unto the Saints. A Demonstration whereof, are those parts of Germany where Luther began the Reformation, wherein Trades, Arts, and Sciences flourish most; the Hans-Towns being distin∣guished by their multitude of Labourers, as well as Regular Life. From thence let us Travel to France, and there see how Calvin's Reformation is attended with the Industrious part of that Kingdom. This might be proved, at large from the visi∣ble decay of Trade, since the Persecution of the Protestants there, whose Churches were attended with Lay-Elders, as well as adorned with Learned Divines; and in something pa∣rallel to this are our Church-wardens here, whose Duty and Charge is to present such persons whose Vices are the Conco∣mitants, or rather Natural Consequents of Idleness and Lux∣ury. I could easily enlarge the Resemblance betwixt these in many Cases (chiefly in suppressing Sloth and Idleness) but the Office of a Church-warden being so universally understood in every Parish, I shall not trouble the Reader with that which he is supposed to be acquainted with before. To return therefore to the Reformed Churches abroad, you shall find the greatest part of Discipline to pass through the hands of the Laity, the Doctrinal part, and the Administration of the Blessed Sacraments thought the work of the Clergy.
Now see what a mighty Progress has this method of Govern∣ment met with, and how wonderfully it has succeeded, a∣midst their most Inveterate Enemies the Church of Rome. In Germany it spread with so great an extent, that the Ro∣mish Party were afraid, that though it took not up the greatest part of the Countrey, yet that it would of their Arts and La∣bour, and leave them none but the unprofitable Rubbish of the Empire, and that stirred up the Empire to consider ways how to stifle and suppress them, which by no Contrivances they were able to effect. God, who works not now by Miracles, uses means and instruments suitable to our Understandings, and agreeable to our lawful interest and improvement in the World; and in proportion to this, the Reformed Churches laid their Methods, instructing their followers in the first Ru∣diments or introductory parts of Christianity, Catechising, and preparing their Children and Servants by such of the gra∣vest and best approved Lay-Elders among them, that were most capable of informing their Clergy of their proficiency and growth in Religion, who were then brought to their Di∣vines and examined, and after being approved by them, were admitted to a participation of the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Not unlike to this, is the Order of Confir∣mation performed by Bishops in our Church. This course of the Reformed Churches prevailed with great advantage over the Papists: For their way of gaining Converts was by drawing Men and Women to Idleness and Poverty; vehemently urging the Doctrine of Self-denial, but with no other intent, than to enrich their Church by empoverishing of their blind and ignorant Votaries. This Doctrine, as it was justly odious in its egregious misapplication, by converting what they thus rack'd from their People to sinister uses, in maintaining a numerous breed of Lewd and Idle Men, who lived in all manner of Ease, Luxury, and unlawful Excess; so was it grievous, and uneasie to those who parted with the ne∣cessary support of themselves and Families, to purchace the Prayers and Benediction of the Church. The Protestants proceeded in a way diametrically opposite to this, and instructed their Converts as well in the Methods of an Industrious course of Life, as in the Principles of Religion
and Vertue: And at the same time that they educated them in the Service of God, and taught them how, and in what man∣ner to perform the Offices of Divine Worship; they likewise proved, that one part of their Duty consisted in making a necessary provision for their Families; and that in all the Scrip∣tures there is not a blacker mark of Infamy placed upon any that violate the Divine Laws, than such as are guilty of that gross omission: And it is remarkable, that in those great Tracts of ground, where Multitudes of Beggers swarm, there is not one of the Reformed Religion among them; which seems to be a signal Blessing in a plain verification of that of the Royal Psalmist, That he never saw the Righteous forsaken, nor his Seed begging their Bread. I might enumerate an abundant variety of Instances to prove, how Temporal Blessings attend Industry among Heathens, and how that just and gracious Providence (who rewards every one according to their Doings) has showered down upon the Gentile World many Secular Felicities and Enjoyments upon that account; but I must remember to keep within my Sphere, which I have limited to Christianity, and more especially to that part of it, which by that inexpressible happiness of the Reformation, is more properly and truly such; in pursuit of which design, as I have named Germany and France in general, so if we take a Prospect of that little State of Geneva, which like a Gem in a Garment, shines in the midst of its Neigh∣bours; the City is as one hand in Labour and Arts: Not a Person to he seen without Employment, and few, or none ig∣norant and unconcerned in his Religion, but both making a joint, and (as it were) mutual progress; and indeed, accord∣ing to the present State and Condition of that place, there seems to be such a necessity for their dependence one upon another, as that it cannot be supposed, that either could be supported without its Concomitant; and both of them thrive to a miraculous augmentation and improvement; notwith∣standing that they are enclosed and fenced about by Enemies to both: Besides, that it is a City situate within the Land, and has not so large a Territory belonging to it, as appertains to some of our Nobility in their Demeans, yet bears the Characters of a Common-wealth, and if considered in all its
Circumstances, in respect of its Circuit, People, &c. may he thought the most formidable place, of so small a Tract of Ground, and so little a number of Men, that is in the Uni∣verse. The prodigious growth and improvement of the Ʋnited Provinces, since the establishing of the Doctrine of the Refor∣mation among them, is so obvious to every Vulgar eye, and so universally known, as needs not to be mentioned in this Dis∣course, only that which respects the case in hand, ought not in reason to be omitted; namely, how considerable a share and interest the Laity are entitled to, in the propagation of the Gospel, and encouragement of Religion, arising from their private Instructions, as well as publick example of a Pious and Laborious Life. Their Clergy chiefly respecting it as their pro∣per Province to be conversant in the publick Exercises of the Ministry, committing the management of Domestick and private Instruction to the Laity, it being a received opinion amongst them, as 'tis with most of the Reformed Churches, that the Commonalty are best wrought upon, and prevailed with, by the Arguments, Examples, and Converse of their Equals and Companions, and such as are of their own size as to their Fortunes and Station in the World, though not as to their knowledge and experience in Matters of Religion. We will now come to our own Countrey, and Plantations, and take a view of that Progress which Religion has attained to, among our selves, and consider by what hands, and in what method most propagated: 'Tis an expression as common as 'tis true, That the Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church, and of all those who gallantly deposited their Lives for the interest of Christ, and his Holy Religion, how many were of the Laity? You will not find one in ten of higher Chara∣cters: and of those Invincible Champions for the Church, and the Reformation, the generality were Trades-men and Wo∣men, such as laboured with their hands for the support of a Life, which they were ready with such great Courage and A∣lacrity to lay down, and as an heroick Testimony of their Christian Magnanimity, sealed their Religion with their Blood: None will be so unkind to the blessed Memories of these poor People, but Glorious Martyrs, as to affirm, that
they were not good Instructors in Religion, seeing that 'tis a Maxim acknowledged by all, That Example is more prevalent than Precept. But in thus giving a just Character of the worthy carriage of the generally Mechanick Laity, I would not be understood to derogate any thing from that veneration which all of us just∣ly owe to the Martyrdoms of those Famous Worthies of the Church of those times, and blessed Instruments of the Reforma∣tion, Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, &c. These were Heavenly Lamps, who both by their Doctrine and Example have forci∣bly recommended the embracement of the true Reformed Re∣ligion to all Posterity, and by dissipating the Clouds and Mists of Romish Idolatry and Superstition, have so cleared up, and en∣lightened Christianity with its ancient brightness, that our Ingratitude would be as unpardonable as miraculous, if we should be wanting in any of those publick Testimonies of a profound respect, which their Heroick and Exemplary Suffer∣ings, as well as Christian and wise Conduct in the whole pro∣gress of the Reformation, may justly require from us. But all this being allowed, as in reason it ought to be, I see not any cause why the Sufferings of the ordinary Laity, may not claim a due place in our pious remembrance and esteem of them, nor that we should not account them to have been greatly in∣strumental in promoting and corroborating of the Reformed Re∣ligion in their Station and Circumstances, as their Martyrdoms and constant perseverance do amply evince. From our Native Countrey we will pass into Foreign Planta∣tions, and of those speak something, especially of New-Eng∣land; and because I would not be thought a friend to Separation from the Church, as is by Law Established, I desire therefore to be understood so, as not to represent them a Precedent, but an Instance only of a wonderful growth in that Wilderness by their Industry and publick encouragement in Religion. These People in the space of twenty years became the greatest Plan∣tation that any Age ever produced, and the visible means was the great industry of the People: Not a Man but was em∣ployed in Labour or Arts, their Children kept at School, and such, whose Quality seated them above mean Employments, were put to the Ʋniversity, which they expressed a great Care
and Sollicitude at their first Planting to erect. Now to bring this Relation to my purpose, to prove that Artizens, Men of Labour and Employments, have been great instruments in promoting, and advancing the Christian Religion, I will shew how they have prevailed in the Conversion of divers of those Heathens they lived among; and for the better understanding the difficulty that attended the dissuading those Poor Wret∣ches from their ancient Gentilism, I shall shew their manner of Living and Worship when the English came among them. Idolaters they cannot properly be called, because they neither Worshipped the Sun, nor Host of Heaven; nor indeed had they any Idols among them: their Worship (if any such they had) exceeding even that of Idolatry it self, and consisting in supplicating the Devil, and that only upon extremity of sick∣ness, which was done by their Witches, Priests, or Powon, as they call them, who upon extraordinary occasions raises the evil Spirit in the shape of a Dog, or any Creature among them. These People then having no publick Rites or Ceremonies of Worship, no Sacrifices, or burthensom Devotion, as other Servile Wretches to that Evil Spirit are miserably intangled in, made it a matter of far greater difficulty to bring them off a Life of Liberty, than it can rationally be supposed to be, where Men are loaded with the most extream Rigours, and Su∣perstitions, Austerities, Macerating and Cruciating their Bo∣dies like the Dervises among the Turks, and several other delu∣ded Zealots, both among the Mahometans, and Heathens, or such as Sacrificed their Children to appease (as they vainly imagined) their angry Deities. To have prevailed with these to relinquish their Follies, which were so ungrateful to Flesh and Blood, so harsh and awkard to their Natural Inclinations, which exposed them to such mighty hardships, and made their Lives a continued Series of the greatest misery and sorrow that could be inflicted upon Mankind; and in lieu thereof to have embraced the pleasing, and light Yoke of Christianity, would have been a Deliverance from Exquisite Tortures, to Ease and Liberty; but the Case was otherwise with these Indians who were not under any such Severities, and therefore not exposed to such Mortifying Circumstances.
Another Obstruction was, That these Indians, (the Men e∣specially) lived as well without Labour for their Bodies, as Divine Worship for their Souls, and would not be induced to any thing of Labour, lest they should thereby be obliged to Religion. Now let us see how many were brought in to be true Converts, and not such as the Spaniards made in the West Indies. 'Twas found a difficult undertaking to bring them to Church, and Publick Instruction, but first discoursing with the poorer English, and being tod by them, that their God commanded them to work with their hands, as well as pray with their lips, and that if they did both, they should go to a place of everla∣sting Joys, where they should have no Labour; this brought them to their Churches, and so (by the Blessing and Goodness of God) to their Conversion; which is now arrived to that height, that they are come to numbers of Converts, have the Holy Bible Translated into their own Language, and Ministers to officiate amongst them, which are of the Natives of the Countrey, but carefully Educated at the English Ʋniversity; and whereas before their Conversion, the Indian Men did no man∣ner of work, no not so much as Planting their Indian Corn, or gathering it in, but all was done by their Women; yet since they became Christians, they are good Artizens and Labourers. This (I presume) will be granted a sufficient Demonstration, That Labour, and Mechanical Men are very active, and success∣ful in the propagation of the Gospel: And as a Publick Blessing upon their great Industry, this Country, like those I have be∣fore-mentioned, has no such thing as a Begger among them. Now, as hence we may observe the Blessing that attends In∣dustry in the Conversion of Heathens, to the Excellent Doctrine of Christianity, as has been instanced in this Foreign Plantation; so on the contrary, we may see how the Natives that live in other Plantation, continue in their miserable Gentilism; the Reason that may be assigned for it, is, That there our English do more indulge themselves in idleness and luxury, and depend upon the labour of Slaves, and Malefactors that are sent thi∣ther for their Crimes, which makes the Indians infer this Con∣clusion from it, That work and labour is no Duty, but a Punishment.
Thus I have given a succinct view of several Ages and Pe∣riods of Christianity, since our Blessed Saviour, and have n∣deavoured to shew, that whereever the Religion of the Holy Jesus has been introduced, Artizs, and Men of Labour wre highly instrumental in the acquisition of, if not led the Va in that Spiritual Conquest. Our Saviour made choice of such, his Holy Apostles and Successors inculcated this Doctrine by their Precepts, as well as inforced a Vigorous Executio of it, by their Examples. Their Converts, and the Primi∣tive Christians pursued the same steps, as well in their Lives as Instructions to others; and after a general Defection by the Errors and Innovations of the Church of Rome (which reduced Matters to a Primitive State of Heathenism, and consequently degenerated into Idleness and Luxury.) Our Reformation sprang up among the same People of Industry and Labour, who retrieving Christianity from the Gross Corruptions of the Romanists, reduced it to its first and Ancient Purity, and so encouraged that diligence in Se∣cular Employments, which the first Preachers imprinted in their Gentile Converts; and such as became Proselytes to that most Excellent Doctrine of the Gospel. And as this course was pursued by our selves at home, so has it been carefully attended to by our Countrey-men in our Foreign Plantations of New-England, where we have observed, that what Proficiency many of the poor Indians have attained to in Christianity, is owing to the instruction, and familiar con∣verse of the ordinary Mechanick English, at whose perswasion they were prevailed upon to make an industrious enquiry in∣to the Nature and Principles of the Reformed Religion, and consequently to espouse and embrace it. And in our daily view and prospect of the best Governed and Religious Sons of our own Church, we may observe them to be such as al∣low not themselvs in Idleness and Luxury, but strictly apply their endeavours, as well to a Laborious as a Religious Course of Life: And as we find some Mens worldly business so regularly, and prudently managed, as not to obstruct; but on the contrary, to promote and improve Religion, by affording them the greater opportunities of extending their Charity to Distressed Objects, and the like: so are there others,
who being either wholly, or in a greater measure exempt from Temporal Employments, are less regardful of, and not so painful and sollicitous in securing to themselves an Immortal Divine State in the other World. The Parable of the Un∣profitable Servant being applicable unto them in a two-fold Construction, in a visible Neglect, or at least Non-improvement both of their Secular and Spiritual Inte∣rests.
