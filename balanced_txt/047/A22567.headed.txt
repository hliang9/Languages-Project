CR DIEV ET MON DROIT. HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms ❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation for preuenting of the abuses growing by the vnordered Retailing of Tobacco. WHereas the Plant or Drugge called Tobacco scarce knowne to this Nation in former times, was in this Age first vsually brought into this Realme in small quantity, as Medicine, and so vsed, and by diuers taken as Medicine, but in processe of time, to satisfie the inordinate appetite of a great number of men and women it hath been brought in in great quantity, and taken for wantonnesse and excesse, prouoking them to drinking and other inconueniences, to the great impairing of their healths, and deprauing of their manners, so that the care which His Maiesty hath of his people hath enforced Him to thinke of some meanes for the preuenting of the euill consequence of this immoderate vse thereof. And albeit His Maiesties dearest father of blessed memorie had giuen directions therein, as well by Proclamation as otherwise, yet those waies tooke not so good effect as was desired, for that therein was no restraint of the num∣ber of those that should sell Tobacco by retaile, nor care taken of the quality of those that should make such sale, but Uictuallers, Tauerners, Alehousekeepers, Tapsters, Chamberlaines, Hostlers and others, of the meanest condition haue promiscuously vsed to regrate the same as allurements to other naughtinesse, keeping therein no Assize, to the preiudice of the rest of His Maiesties louing Subiects. For repressing therefore of all such excesses and for preuenting of fu∣ture inconuenience, Our Soueraigne Lord the King, by the aduice of the Lords and others of His Priuie Councell hath resolued to reduce the venting, selling and vttering of Tobacco into some good order, and that none but men of sufficiency, and such as shall bring certificate of their meetnesse, shall hereafter sell or vtter any Tobacco by retaile. And to that purpose His Maiestie hath lately caused Letters from His Lords, and others of His Priuie Councell to bee directed vnto the Iustices of Peace of the seuerall Counties of this Kingdome, and Dominion of Wales, and also vnto the Maiors, Bailiffes and other chiefe Officers of diuers Cities and Townes Cor∣porate; Commanding them to certifie in what Townes and places it may bee fit to suffer selling and retailing of Tobacco, and how many in each place were fit to bee licensed to vse that Trade. In answere of which Letters, Certificates haue beene made from diuers of the Iustices of Peace, and from the Maiors, Bailiffes, and other Magistrates of diuers Cities and Townes Corporate, who therein haue acknowledged the abuses that daily arise by the vngouerned selling and retailing of Tobacco, expressing their desire of reformation. Wherupon His Maiestie by like aduice of his Counsell hath caused other Letters to be directed to the Iustices and Conseruators of the Peace in seuerall Counties; thereby declaring in what Townes and places Tobacco shall be permitted to be sold or vttered by Retayle, and hath Com∣manded the said Iustices and Conseruators of the Peace, to cause the names of those Townes and places specified in those Letters, to be written and affixed in publique places where the Assises and Sessions of the peace shall be kept, in those Counties, to the end that all His people may take notice that other places are not admitted or allowed for selling or vttering of Tobacco by Retaile. And by Letters directed to the said Maiors, Bayliffes, and other head Officers of Cities and Townes, His Maiestie hath giuen notice vnto them of the names of those that are permitted there to sell or deliuer Tobacco in that manner, and hath Commanded them to giue publique notice in the said Cities and Townes, of the names of those persons that are so admit∣ted to sell or deliuer it. Now our said Souereigne Lord the King doth straightly prohibite all His people, that after the feast of Candlemas next comming after the date of these presents, none of them out of the said Cities or Townes so appointed as aforesaid, or within the said Cities, or Townes, no others but those named as aforesaid, and such as from time to time shall bee permitted in like manner, doe sell or deliuer any Tobacco by Retayle, and that none of them that are permitted or allow∣ed in this behalfe, keepe any Tauerne, Alehouse, or Uictualling, or otherwise sell any distilled or hot Waters, Wine, Ale, Beere, or Cyder in their houses, so long as they shall bee permitted to sell Tobacco by Retayle: And for that the necessities of these times require it, His Maiestie doth charge and command all His Subiects to obey these His Ordinances, vnder the paines to bee inflicted vpon contemners of the same, and of His Royall will and pleasure, being for the good of His people: All which His pleasure is shall bee obserued vntill Hee shall by His Procla∣mation, or Letters of His Priuie Counsell make other publique signification of His pleasure herein. And Hee doth charge and command all Iustices of Peace, and all Maiors, Bayliffes, and head Officers of all His Cities and Townes within His said Kingdome of England, and Do∣minion of Wales, and all those who are permitted to sell Tobacco by Retaile, that they make di∣ligent enquirie of all those that shall presume to doe against this Command, and from time to time to make certificate of their names, and places of their residence, with the particular of their contempts, to the Lords of His Maiesties Priuie Councell. Giuen at the Court at Whitehall the thirteenth day of October, in the ninth yeere of the Reigne of our Souereigne Lord CHARLES by the grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE: and by the Assignes of Iohn Bill. M.DC.XXXIII.
