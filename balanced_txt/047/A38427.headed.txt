ENGLANDS REMEMBRANCES. AMONGST some sayings of a Wise Man, one of his best was, that the Life of a Life was a good Conscience: This may be good Counsel to our fellow subjects of England, at this time, in this Apostate Age, whereas nothing, but a present Fi∣nition is acceptable, upon no certainty; but great uncertainties, both of death, sudden changes, and alterations. This address, and faithfull advice, is out of af∣fection, and zeal, for the honour and hap∣piness of the English Nation, which is as near and dear to a true wel-wisher to his Country, as his nearest relations; all sufferings to a clear English heart in redemption of it, would be like a fair hot sun shining day, in the end of Harvest: For only excremental creatures, proceed, and dissolve in the like nature: But man that is chiefly born to serve God, his King, and Country (upon the principles of Vertue, Justice, and true Religion, according to revealed knowledge) hath a duty of injunction laid upon him. The blot upon our Nation, must needs trouble all English hearts: The deception under the Mask of Reli∣ligion, which is now thoroughly unmasked, ought, and must com∣mand much Repentance: The Design of some of our Northern neighbours (with the conspiracy of some of our Country men) to pull down, one Ecclesiastical Government (for their own interest) before another was put into a method, for the settlement of Church Govern∣ment, hath justly brought this confusion upon themselves in Scotland, and on us in England; and do not we see, how God hath worn our in their own actions, and blasted many of the Plotters of our alterations in England; although in Justice from Heaven we must look, upon our sins, the Nations sins, and the three Kingdoms sins, to be the moving
cause from God, so to punish us: For is there any evil in the City, and God hath not done it, Amos the 3. chap. and 6. ve. that is the evil of punishment which we all justly deserve: Hath not God pu∣nished the Irish nation, now almost extirpated for that horrid Massa∣cre, Murther and Rebellion, in that Kingdom of Ireland, palliating their wickedness under a counterfeit Commission and connivance from the last King, whose innocence was most traiterously abused in it, as was confessed, by Sir Philemon Oneal, before his execution, in presence of divers worthy and noble persons now living, who can te∣stifie it upon their voluntary or required Oaths: The Kings Broad Seal being taken off from a Letters Patents for a grant of lands, and put to a forged and counterfeit Commission: And concerning those papers taken out of Mr. Secretary Windebants study, and put by the Parliaments order into the custody of one Mr. Willingham, a Citizen of London, some years since dead, a noble Lord, and a Citizen of London, sent his Majesty word, that if any of those papers, concer∣ning Ireland, or any other of them, might do his Majesty prejudice, (some persons of the Parliament intending to lay a charge against his Majesty about them) such a course was, and should be taken for their conveyance away (if his Majesty would have it) that they should never see light more: But the King sent that noble Lord word, and that Citizen (who acted the business with Mr, Willingham) that he thanked them for their love and care of him; but for any knowledge that he had, or had given order in, or for that business or massacre of Ireland, he defied the Divel and all his Imps, or any body else about it, but if any of his servants had done amiss, they must answer for their own faults, and this will be testified upon Oath before God and Man. And to confirm his Majesties clearness in that business of Ireland, you see his enemies could not lay the least imputation a∣gainst his Majesty in it, although they wanted neither Will nor Ma∣lice. For Scotland, how hath God punished that Nation, for the in∣nocent blood and cruelties they have acted amongst themselves, for their perjury and falseness, for the breach of their publick and na∣tional Faith, and agreement with the King, made solemnly in the Parliament of Scotland 1641. after full satisfaction given by the King in that Parliament, for that Church and kingdom, and by invading England again with an Army, contrary to their former Faith and
Agreement, upon the surruptions making, wresting, and breaking their solemn League ad Covenant, construing part of it to serve their own sence and ends, and not taking the whole scope, sence, and Ar∣ticles of it together, (in which Covenant the English Independents out-witted them) they supposing upon the interest of that Cove∣nant to have overswayed the Parliament, made London their own in affection and interest, and so to have obtained the power of all Eng∣land, but with what success hath God yet blessed that Covenant, be∣ing illegally entred into, at the first, although much, and not all, the contents thereof is good: The Covenant Makers, being the Cove∣nant Breakers, who declared a publick promise to have the Kings approbation and confirmation of it, which was deferred, until they had a Sword to inforce and compel it, not a Christian like way to settle Religion, which otherwise should be by a Synod of Refor∣med Divines, legally called: And for delivering their King to the English Independents, when the Plot was visibly seen, for the de∣struction of King and Parliament, upon the Compact and Agree∣ment for receiving 200000 pounds sterling, for their Army, when the King came to their Army, then at Newark for a Sanctuary (a Blot in Marble) whereas if they had kept the King, and not deli∣vered him untill they had treated with the King and Parliament of England, and London, so much longed for, and desired, the King, Parliament, and kingdomes had been settled upon the Bases of Justice, Truth and Righteousnes, with a firm and lasting Peace, and a Religious and Civill Reformation, of all former errors, and although they had the publick faith of the Parliament of England, for a Treaty with his Majesty, and both Kingdomes upon their de∣livering the King, yet they could not but wel understand, by their Commissioners, who had lived long in England, at the cost and charge of England, that the Independent Faction, grew so strong in the English Parliament, and Army, which were no friends, to the King, that it could not be safe, for his Majesty, to be in that custody at Holmby, which was rather in the power of the Army than Par∣liament (as it proved too sadly afterwards) the Army being molded, contrary to the first Iudgment of Parliament; where as if the King had beene delivered, unto the protection of his subjects in London,
there was then a visible power, and foundation, to guard his Ma∣jesty, from the designe of Oliver Cromwell, whose design was well perceived by many at that time. And when the Scots had divested themselves of the King, by delivering his Majestey over: and Oliver Cromwell was acting that unparralleld death, which could not but be wel known, (to the grand Committee of Parliament, sitting then in Scotland) by the advice of their Commissioners, being then in Westminster, who lukewarmly declared against that horrid act: and so did the Committee of Parliament in Scotland as Lukewarmly act, at that time in Scoland, the Kings best friends there, being excluded from sitting; but it is well knowne, what passed betweene Argile and Cromwell, at my Lady Humes house in Edenburgh, concerning the Kings death. And after the Kings horrid death, for breaking their Treaty made at Breda (fully consented unto by this present King) before they would suffer his Majesty, to land in Scotland, hee then lying upon their Coast, in great perill and danger of the Englsh Parliament ships, (then near his Majesty) whose deliverance, God prevented at Sea upon the coast, by a great mist: and for Inforcing a Declaration, upon the now innocent King after his landing, by the power of Argile, and the Church, to take the Guilt of that kingdome upon his innocent selfe, and afterwards, by jubjugating his Maje∣sty, under the pretended power of Church Government, and Crom∣wels Creatures: For delivering up their Army, at Dunbar, (so much purged by the Church) by the Treachery, and Correspondence of some few persons, when Cromwel could not have stayed 6. Dayes longer in the country, and offered Scotland satisfaction, for the da∣mage, he hed done to that kingdome, and would have left it, and returned into England, with 3. or 4. Troops of horse: for delivering up there Forts, and Castles upon Treachery, and for mony. As Edenburgh castle, by Dundas old Leisleyes Son in Law, and Sterling Castle upon conditions, to save their owne particular Goods, for delivering the Records of the kingdom: for their design at the com∣ming in of Duke Hamiltons Army in Anno 1648. not for a clear in∣tent to relieve England, and themselves from the present treason and slavery then hathing by some compact persons of England and Scot∣land, but intending to have the whole power, and domination of the
whole English nation to themselves, as it hath been clearely seene since, and confessed by themselves, and God prospered it accord∣ingly: and in the Worcester businesse, noe English power, nor Army must be raised, but under Commission, and power of the Scots, and hath not God, for their sinnes, and their only Acting the Scotch in∣terest, inslaved them wholly to the English, and made ther Kingdome a Mercinary Province, or Commonwealth, in subjection unto Eng∣land, betrayed, and voluntarily submitted unto, by Argile, and some of their country men, lately sitting, in the late howse of Commons in England, onely for mony, profit and their particular advantage, Scotland is never to be trusted, for the interest of England, unlesse the Exchequer of Edenburgh, were greater then the Exchequer of Westmin∣ster; and yt Scotland were England, and England, Scotland, and is not this a greater judgment from heaven, upon Scotland, but blame not the whole nation, for many of their rulers have caused them to err, although the Commons, at this time (who have beene formerly, to much in∣slaved by their Lords, and Landlords) are to much addicted to their lucre, and profit, wherein the English have indulged them, with long Leases, and by laying the Chief Burdens upon their Landlords, for the more quiet of that kingdome, but let Duke William Hamiltons ingenious confession a little before his death, and his affection to the King, then also expressed at Worcester to a noble English Lord, now living, and the Marquesse of Moniros, his and the Lord Nappiers Loyalty, and some other Lords in custody in England, and others in Scotland upon their Parrol, have that everlasting memory, which their blood and honors have purchased. And England which is now, prevalent in power, but odious, by its Governours, both at home and abroad, unless to such, who are involved in guilt, and profit with them. If England repent not of its perjury, oppression, and injustice, to its country men, bretheren, and of all the innocent blood, it hath spilt in England: for its breach of faith, solemnly ingaged, in and out of Parliament before God, Men, and Angels, to the whole world (witnes their declarations) and for suffering a compact number of conspirators, cunningly to deceive the people under pretence of Re∣formation in Religion, and the kingdomes abuses, who have brought in, a far greater destruction of Religion, then before, and over∣thrown
all the liberties of the subject, inslaving them to an absolute illegal, and arbitrary power, and to the bloody lust, and wils, of any persons whatsoever, that may, or can hereafter, get, or obtayne, any unlawful power, or Government whatsoever: who have destroy∣ed the ancient, safe, healthful, and fundamentall constitution of Eng∣land by King, and Parliament, ad introduced varieties of mock Parliaments, to color there wickednes, and to make monstrons Courts and constitutions, only to serve their own lust, ambition, and Ava∣rice, and for the enslaving, and murthering of their fellow subjects, who with their Cap. General Oliver Cromwel, the grand Protectorian brooke of the personal Treaty, in the Isle of Wight, with the last King, when his Majestey, had fully consented, unto the parliaments propositions, and given ful satisfaction for a firm, and lasting peace in his three Kingdomes, and was to come to Westminster by agree∣ment, to confirm them in ful Parliament. The Parliament having voted the Kings concessions satisfactory, wherin his Majesty, had given the subjects, more liberties, and freedomes in that treaty, and Con∣sent, then al the Kings since William the first, and afterwards the said Cromwel with these Conspirators, did expel most of the mem∣bers, of the howse of Commons, and imprisoned, them in Hel, and two common Inns, in the strand, only leaving, such other mem∣bers, in the howse as were his Conspirators and pentioners who sold, their owne Consciences, and the blood, lives, and liberties of the subject, by setting up a slaughter howse (their high court of justice, a meer extrajudicial thing in law) on purpose to blood, and terrifie the people, and to ingross, the power, and wealth of the Kingdome to themselves, and the Committee men: what wast sums of mony and plate, they have given to themselves, it is partly in print, but far more concealed: and can ye expect justice from them who make themselves judge and party, whose iron hands, you have sufficiently felt: and afterwards openly committed that horrid, and Barbarous Act, a thing never parralleld in the world, many or most of them, now convened, in this Fleeting wood Parliament, being those monsters, with there journy man Lentall the old Speaker (who corresponded, with the last King for his peace and assurance) that have brought al these miseries upon the nation, and do now follow the same dictates
of blood, and innovations: and if ye suffer them to fit, you must expect, nothing but blood, ruine of your estates, and destruction of the kingdom, by all illegal, and arbitrary waies whatsoever, and to sel your remaining monuments of the kingdome, churches, and noble houses, and put the money in what Purses they please, and weaken the king∣dom for a prey to a forraign Nation: These will be like the 30. Ty∣rants of Athens, the Decemviri in Rome, you have felt their hands enough already, and will feel them again, more to purpose, if you let them sit, who will call for any mans life and estate at their plea∣sures or displeasures, whose Pride and power is to treasure up un∣righteous Mammon against the Day of Wrath: Their right to sit is nothing but force and violence (a Monster in nature) and a compa∣ny of Theeves on the High way, calling a Councel in a Wood, and inlarging their unjust power by a Confederacy, have as much right to sit in Councel, as these unsatiable Usurpers, and may give them∣selves the name of Parliament as well as these: but all pious and truly affected to their country, hope these will prove a Fleeting Parliament as Fleetwoods Mock Parliament: The pact persons of the Councel of War, with the old conspiring Members of the kingdoms miseries, be∣ing all Conspiratots in this misery for the nation, against Truth and Justice. That Parliament of which these were unruly and excremen∣tal Members, was absolutely dissolved by three waies: the force and violence upon the House of Commons, by expelling and imprisoning their Members, and then the utter expulsion and extirpation of the rest by Cromwel and his Conspirators (many now sitting, being part of them) which made that house sine Die; and then the force and vio∣lence upon the House of Lords, after adjournment to a Day, the mee∣ting of the Lords and their Speaker being prevented by the Souldi∣ers guarding the House (who writ upon it, This House is to be Let) made it also sine Die, a natural dissolution: But the chief and main reason was the Kings death, a most absolute dissolution, who called them by his Writ to consult with him, and where his Soul now is, it is feared many of them wil never come without great & unfeigned Re∣pentance. A Parliament is the great and free Councel of the king∣dom, not called as this Juncto is, by the Speakers or other persons, giving notice to one another for their meeting: but lawfully and
freely called and chosen, for the making and mending of Laws, for the subjects good, whereby they may have protection and security, consisting of King, Lords and Commons, whereunto the subject may have address for his Grievances and redress of the same, fully con∣firmed by Act of Parliament, of King Lords and Commons, the great security of the kingdom: And if the Judges and Ministers of the Laws do not their Duties, they are loyable to legal judgements and sentences, according to the dismerrit of their offences. And Eng∣land will never be happy without these Parliaments in Freedome, but otherwise most miserable, as at this time you feel by experience. And while that long Parliament called by the King in Anno 1648. kept its integrety and sincerity, God blessed it, but when it was cruel to its fellow Members, and unjustly intruded upon the King and kingdoms Rights, after full satisfaction given by his Majesty, as the Bill passed for taking away the Star Chamber Court, and other offensive Courts in the kingdom, Bishops out of the Lords House, and after that pas∣sed a Bill for a Triannual Parliament, and whatsoever else was for the kingdoms good, and offered the Parliament after wards only to treat with the Synod of Divines himself, or else for his Majesty to chuse 20 Divines to sit amongst them, for the settlement of the Discipline of the Church, as by his message of the 20. of May, which 20. per∣sons could not overvote 120. or more: But by the Guilt and Ambi∣tion of some of the Parliament Members, when that Parliament made it self a Court to tyrannize over its fellow subjects, their lives, liberties, and estates, and accumulate the wealth and treasure of the kingdom to its self,nd Pentioners to vel and their ittee-men: God t low and con∣ble in the eyes of ple and at last, wn Members, and its mercinary Members, to turn one another out of the House; and will ye serve the scum and offile of that Parliament, that create themselves a name and power without Law, Right, and Ju∣stice, whereby to murther your persons, consume your estates, and give you nothing but changes and uncertainties for security and set∣tlement. O England, England, repent, repent of all thy Perjury and breach of Faith with God and Man, of the breach of thy Allegiance thou hast sworn to thy lawfull King, and his Heyors after him sworn unto, and declared to the whole World, by the Members of that Par∣liament, and by these now sitting at Westminster, and all the other se∣veral Oaths, Vows, Covenants, Protestations and Declarations, in or∣der
thereunto for the honour and happiness of the King and king∣dom, That you will with your Estates and Lives, mutually preserve the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the kingdom, and Preserve and Defend his Majesties Person and Authority, that the World may bear witness with your Consciences of your Loyalty, that you had no thoughts nor intentions, to diminish his Majesties just Power and Greatness. O England, England, Repent, Repent of all the multiplication of Illegal Oaths and Engagements thou hast taken, and never take any Illegal Oath more, although it seem never so religious; but such as are confirmed by King and Parliament, the wholesom and only lawfull constitution of the kingdom: you feel the event of illegal oaths well enough. And London the great Metropolis of the kingdom, sell not your estates, li∣berties, lives and consciences, as you do your wares and goods: you have done too much already, and make not your selves abominable to all succeeding generations: you could fight well enough to bring your selves into slavery, but not to free your selves out of it the time was when you had the prize in your hand and may yet, if ye will put on wisedom and courage to redeem your honors, and your selves from slavery, and preserve the rights and priviledges of Parliaments, and restore the King upon the principles of honor and justice, and for your own, and the kingdomes liberties and security: you had those which stood in the gap for you, who thirsted to have hazarded their lives for your redemption, and their King and Country: But you suf∣fered your selves to be cheated and betrayed into a Treaty, by two or three of your Aldermen, and some others, Citizens and Ministers, who were Cromwels Factors, and betraied you, (as Iudas did Christ, or like Synon who brought in the Grecian horse into Troy) when the power of the whole Army was not one quarter equivolent, to the power and strength of the City; whereas if you would have defended your own and the Parliaments liberties, and maintained your Declarations (which you so unworthily recalled, as the Parliament also did theirs) most of the Army had come off to you, and this you were told by some of your very faithfull and good friends, and was there any appearance of blood, If you had not accepted the mes∣sage for acceptance of the treaty, by 6. of the Clock at night one day when the Army was at Turnam Green, and by Brainford, into which you were scarced by the long winded speech of Cromwels messenger; the said messenger telling the Common Councel, that if by 6, of the
Clock that night, Cromwel and his Officers of the Army, had not notice of your acceptanee of the Treaty, the Army would be inga∣ged in blood, with the City forces at the Forts, and it was 9. or 10. of the clock at night, before the message was sent from London, and the same long winded messenger returning again the next morning, to the Common Councel in London, from Cromwel, and his Complices who were then at Syon house, tould the Common Councel, that the night before, as he went to Syon house, that there was about half a troop of horse, in an Inn in Knightbridge, and one Centinel in the street, and at Turnam Creen about one Regiment and half of Horse, the Troopers all lying a sleep, and their horses feeding, tyed to the Troo∣pers legs, unless a Centinel or two in the high way, and that was about 10. or 11. of the clock at night, and what faith was to be given to that messenger, who ye knew, was the Cabals Creature of Cromwels and my Lord Says: If ye had sent Cromwel word, that if he shot his Guns against the City you would Ring your Bels, as the Duke of Florence told Charles the 8. of France when his Army was before Florence, and then the Kings Army durst not meddle with the City by which courage and Resolution, the Duke preserved the City and its liberties & so might ye have preserved London. Repent London, and Redeem the innocent blood that hath been spilt by your means, I say you could fight wel enough to inslave your selves, but not to Redeem your lost honor, which formerly you have long enjoyed: And until England return to its Loyalty, and its Iust Principles, for King and Parliament, it wil be like a man in a feaver, removing from one bed or Pallet to another, but never be at ease, or rest, until the feaver hath left him. Why should these new Fleeting wood Governors (so much hated) think to keep their intended Government, built upon the Principles of Injustice, Avarice, and Ambition, expect more se∣curity, then the former Protectorians, or other changes of Govern∣ment have had, hath not God overthrown the former pretended Re∣formers, who sought their own Ambition, and power, under pre∣tence of the kingdomes Good, how many Changes and alterations have ye had since the last Kings death: and can England without Re∣pentance, promise its self more security then former Empires, and other Kingdomes have done, hath it not been conquered by Ro∣mans, Saxons, Danes, and Normans, and are not Englands sins as great now, nay greater then formerly: Is there not a Generall Apo∣stacy
of Magistrates, ministers, and people do not almost all serve for lucre and Gain, and dawb with untempered morter, and mini∣sters who would be accompted pious and Religious, Intitle God to their Dawbing sins, against knowledge, only for wordly profit, and Pedantick honor: and may not England without Repentance, suck the dregs of Gods wrath, and make England in Conclusion, the most miserable of the 3. nations: let then that stand, take heed least they fall: it is a kingdom, more envied then affected, unless for its bene∣fit; and if the pride, malice, fury and revenge, of Scotch, Irish, and Forrainers, fall on it, (from which God keep it) it may be harraced, with iron hands, and hearts, and your Children, friends, Neighbors and Country men, sold into forraign plantations, and slavery with as little, or less mercy, or pitty, then ye have sent and sold your Neighbours, Countrey men, and brethren: Do not ye see in these alterations, how God doth visit the sins of the Parents upon their Children. Therefore as a good Physitian, and Chyrurgian, must know the disease and wound, before he can cure it, so Pardon the zeal of this pen, not intentionally to Corrode, but Heal, for without sence of sin, there can be no true repentance: but let not us say like Caine, and Iudas, our sins are greater then God can forgive, for if we Repent, God will forgive, and if England return to its loyaltie, Iust Government, or lawfull obedience, it will be heartily forgiven, and then, it will be firmely setled, upon a sure foundation, in its just liberties that King and people, may enjoy both their Rights, and a full oblivion of all that is past, firmely confirmed by the King in a free Parliament, the great scrity of the kingdom all these late ways, being absolutely Mutenous and Tumultuous: and are a very few persons considerable to the good and happiness of a Nation (who seduce the Souldiers, and others that would be good Subjects) who if they please, may secure and save themselves, most of the Grand Ac∣tors of that horrid death, and murther, God having Reserved their Iudgments to himself: do not you now plainly preceive, that Crom∣wells murthering the last King, and his fair and Religious pretences, for the Kingdomes Good, were only steps to get the Crown himself, and not finding in his life time all things concurring for his atcheive∣ment thereof: yet after his death would have his Effigies, adorned with Trophies of the Regalia, the Crown, Globe, and Scepter: and these few persons now, that contrive this new Government are
only to make themselves, Voces Plebi & Magistri Plebi, making the Councell of State, to bring forth their Monster: Their mock Parlia∣ment the God fathers, the Army their actors: and the people their porters and spectators, to receive the Blessing (from them) of Issa∣char, and themselves enjoy the free Common wealth, of wealth, Am∣bition, luxury, power, and Revenge, against whom they please: Do not ye see they begin, with Lentall their Speaker, to make him as absolute Lord Chancellor, as ever any was before, and themselves will follow in other places, being the Giving Parliament, one to ano∣ther. And wheras in Monarchy you have one head, to resort unto for Iustice, and if his ministers fail they are Punishable by law, and Parliament; but where you have many to Resort unto, it will be like the old saying of the Deans and Chapters come to them apart, they are all honest, but together they are very knaves, and so will these be. Have ye got any thing by your often Changes, but losse of your Blood and estates. O that England would vindicate its self from those blots and just aspertions now upon it for its own honour, and happi∣nes, and terror of its no friends abroad, that it may have a firm and lasting peace within its self, which it can never have, without its lawfull King. Never was England more happy in a King, then it will be in this Kings Restoration, whose nature cannot be a Tyrant, who thirsteth, to receive his subjects, into his Gracious Favour, and har∣tily wisheth the Good, and Prosperity of England in generall, and its Metropolis London, which now serveth its Chargeable Task-ma∣sters for the Avarice and Ambition of a very few persons: your law∣full King is an Englishman born, and in heart and Affection the same (although loving, and just to all his subjects) of whose Gracious dis∣position and Princely parts, his Enemies must, and do Confesse, and for his mercy, let him Confess it, that the King pardoned in Scotland, who was sent out of England, to murther his Majesty, as he volun∣tarily Confessed himself, after his apprehension: and for his care of his Subjects, let his peaceable, and unhurtfull march to Worcester with his Army, (by his Majesties especial Command) testifie, wherein the kingdome, received not the least damage by it. The kingdomes Terms, may be honorable, gracious, and secure, with the King, who thirsteth to come unto the Crown, by the interest, and love of his own people. His Majesty also hath two Royall Brothers to Confirm his subjects security: The world cannot equalize such three Princes
whose fame soundeth loud abroad, and do not think, but God which so miraculously preserved his Majesty in going to Scotland, and after∣wards in Scotland, in so many dangers and Casualties, and also when two were sent thither to murther him: and after the Defeat at Wor∣cester, God so miraculously delivered him, and sent his Majesty safe into France, in which escape he shewed more then Kingly Courage and Resolution, and God which hath delivered the Duke of York in so many hazards, and desperate Charges, and Dangers, in the field, wherin his Highness, hath performed to Admiration, and the Duke of Glocester who by especial providence of God was sent out of Eng∣land, young (not out of Cromwels affection to his Highness, but fea∣ring his Title to the Crown, and the peoples affection to the Royall Family) who in the last assault before Dunkirck fought like a Prince, and never left his Royal brother the Duke of York a swords length, and how they charged, again and again, & what service they did there is well known, for ther Everlasting honors: and do not believe but that Almighty God, had reserved these three great Princes, for some great work: they are bone of your bone, and Flesh of your Flesh: and if England, will not be just to its self, in doing justice where God requi∣reth it God may be Graciusly just, to their Lawfull King, who never offended England (but desireth its good heartily and loveth it) and restore his Majesty upon the injustice of a perjured nation: doubt not but in a general peace, there will be a consideration for him by o∣ther Princes (who may be served, as he now is, by their own subjects) whose Justice and right it is to be your K. have a care of the old Motto, se sapit ingratus. Therefore England make it thy work alone, and have the honour and happiness of it thy self without thy neighbours: The King is your father, your country is your mother, and until father and mother be united, the family must be divided: And as he is your na∣tural and only lawfull King, so no King under Heaven hath a clearer Title (most Kings not so clear) the Saxon, Norman, English, and Scotch Race, solely and wholly centring in his Maj. And if the armies by sea and land are sensible of their own honors, profit, and advantage and security, and the kingdoms happinesse, they will rather serve the King and kingdom then these Fleeting masters, every day changing upon uncertainties, and upon this just settlement of King and people: Their Arrears will be payed and satisfied, and the Commanders and Souldiers imployed for the honor and advantage of the nation. And
is it not more noble and beneficial for ye to be in a continual and ho∣norable imploiment, with the love of the kingdom, then upon these uncertainties ye now are in, with the kingdoms curse: upon this just settlement of King and people, the discipline of our religion will be setled the nearest way agreeable to divine Scripture truth, withall re∣spect to tender consciences: your King, and his two royal brothers, are reformed Protestants (in which reformed religion, with Gods grace, they refolve to live and die) for which Rome is not their great friend: And upon this just settlement, oblivion of all errors will bee passed in free Parl, with full indempnity, the exceptions included with your own judgments, Estates comprimized and secured by Parl, his Maj. Court regulated, the Law rectified, the kingdoms abuses re∣formed, Trade restored and enlarged, manufactures increased, Land improved, and a great part of the kingdoms charge taken off, mens minds setled in peace and quietness, and the people governed by law and love, penalties confirmed by Parliam, against distinction of nick names, whereby the nation may be brought into an amiable posture and condition: and a full and perfect Act of amnesty and oblivion passed and confirmed by King and Parl. with invocation unto Hea∣ven for its observance; and noble Acts advanced, for just and honour∣able ends, for the honor and advantage of the nation: Experience having improved your King, and our English nation, by awaking them out of the drowsiness of a slothfull and luxurious Peace. This Comenting at home of King and people, will prevent all forraign de∣signs, and make us formidable and terrible abroad, and on the contra∣ry, by our divisions indanger us, for a prey to other nations: There∣fore (again) England, have the honor of it thy self without the help of thy neighbors, who brought thee into confusion: And all ye loyal subjects of England, and excluded Members of the long Parl. by Crom∣wel, that were for the personal Treaty in the Isle of Wight, and all ye Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty, Justices of Peace, Sheriffs of the se∣veral counties and shires, and all cities, and towns corporate, all Ma∣gistrates and Members of the kingdom whatsoever, who have all your rights from the Crown, your lawfull King and his Heyors, and that do enjoy your laws, liberties, francheses and freedoms, from the concessi∣ons of King and free Parl, Rise up, as Thrasibulus did against the 30. Tyrants of Athens, and as one man put your selves into a posture of de∣fence, against any power whatsoever that shall invade your Rights
and Liberties and debar ye of free Parl, which are your birth-rights and inheritance, and then treat with your King, from whom you may have honorable and safe conditions for the honor, happiness, and safe∣ty of the nation, the children not bearing the sins of their Parents, as in the Prophet Ezekel—and make your selves famous over all the world, to all posterity: And unto the opposers of this happiness and settlement, throw into their hearts and faces with invocation up to Heaven, the breach of all their Oaths, Vows, Covenants, Protestations and Declarations, for the honor and happinesse of the King, for the freedom and Priviledges of Parliament, and for the good and liberty of the subject (as A∣mutath the great Turk, did against Ʋladislaus King of Hungary: The Time, and Covenant Breaker when his Army was almost lost before his Invocation unto Heaven, and then gave him a wonderfull victo∣ry, over the Hungarians) that ye may be hereafter governed by law and not by the lust of men, and be confident, God will bless ye in it and wil strike such a daunt, and terror into your Enemies hearts, that oppose your just and righteous Cause, that 10. of ye, shal chase an hundreth, and 100. of ye put 1000. to flight, but you must do it, with zeal, and dexterity, for all the Kingdome, to Rise, as one Man, on one Day, and God bless ye in it. Ye have men enough to head ye: The protection and enjoyment, of your lawes, lives, liber∣ties and Estates, being all taken from ye. Therefore ye must protect your selfes, as ye are bound, by the law of nature, that afterwards ye may have a free Parliament called, to settle, and confirm your laws, liberties and Estates: and in your rising; use the people as Bre∣thren, and country men, not cruelly but kindly, and be sure, ye are not created by independent treaties, nor long winded speeches, let them seem never so religious (you have experience enough of that) untill you have a free Parliament chosen, not only to confirm your old Magna Carta, but to make a new Maxima Carta, Truth doth rest, and is quiet, when its just ends are granted, but falshood never: where is now Quintus Curtius, that stopt the Gulf of Rome, and Scevola that lost his hand to save the city: remember Sisia the noble Bohemian that defended Prage against the whole Imperial Army take but courage you have 9. parts of 10 of the Kingdome for ye: therefore O English Blood, and hearts, redeem your Liberties, and declare only for a free Parliament for the settlement of your laws, li∣berties, and Estates, (a most just cause and most safely may be Ac∣ted,
with a good conscience) and God bless and prosper ye in it, that his infinite Majesty may have the honor and glory and the whole na∣tion, and your posterity after ye, may have the benefit, and your selves of this age be engraven in everlasting monuments, for the re∣storers, of your Kings and countries liberties, upon the Principles of Truth justice, mercy and amnesty; for so prayeth every true hearted English man. Printed at London the 12. of Iune 1659.
