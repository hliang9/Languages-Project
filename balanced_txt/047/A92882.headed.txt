Sad and Lamentable NEWES From several parts of ENGLAND. BEING A true Relation of the great Losses sustained by those strange Windes, and impetuous Tempests, on Tuesday the 18th of February, both by Sea and Land. The number killed and wounded in the City of London, and other places, by the blowing down of Chimneys, and the tops of stately Houses; the violent Storm ef Rain, mixt with Lightning at Hereford, Worcester, Norwitch, and other famous Cities, the like not known in many Ages. The renting and tearing of many gallant Churches and stately Fabricks; so that there was scarce any safety for Man, Woman, or Child, either within or without Doors: The blowing down of many dwelling Houses in several parts, as also great Barns, Stables, and Cow-houses, where many Cattle were killed and destroyed. The tearing up of great Trees by the Roots, and the filling of High-wayes so exceeding full, that Carriers and Travellers can hardly pass. LONDON, Printed for Charles Tay, 1662.
Sad and Lamentable NEWES From the North, East, and Western parts OF England. THe great and violent storms that lately happened in the City of London and other parts adjacent, are as strange to elate as they were then dreadful to behold; the like having not bin in may Ages, both for the continuance and impetuousness thereof; and to begin with what befel in this Southern Climate, the City of London had its share; for in Covent Garden,
near the Fleece Tavern, a Lady received her last breath being killed by the roof of the house falling into her Chamber, and two little Children were miraculously preserved in the same house▪ being immediately before that terrible blow hapned carried down stairs. Another person of qualiy had her Brins beat out by the fall of a Chimney, and many were lamentably hurt and bru∣sed in several places, to the number of 17. amongst whom a poor Porter in Fleetstreet, felt the bitter pain of that sad Tempest, having his right Arm shivered almost to pieces, by the vehement fall of divers Bricks and iles from off a house near the Pageant, the top of the said Pageant being soon after likwise blown down, the fall thereof being so great, that it beat down the sides of many houses, doing great harm to the inhabi∣tants; the other likewise in Leaden Hall street was ex∣ceedingly rent and torn, and the Temple in Cheapside somewhat defaced about the top, but blessed be God no great harm done to the people. This great Tempest continued for many hours, do∣ing much harm to many stately houses, which by the fall of Chimneys and flying about both of Bricks and Tiles, some Horses were killed in the open streets, be∣sides one Coach horse standing in the Coach, near Grays Inn had his Brains beat out by the Bricks that descended from the houses. But that which is most sad and grievous is, the great ruines that befel the Country people in several places, where 'tis said above 2. were killed and hurt; for sad were the objects all along the Road from Cambridge to London, the Barns and Out houses being in many places levelled to the
ground, and many Cattle overwhelmed and smother∣ed with the Timber, Thtch and Rubbish; their dwel∣ling houses were also pitiously rent and torn and little safety in many of their habitations. The Wind-Mils al∣so in many places were laid flat to the earth, and the May-Poles also about Tottenham High Cross, Waltham, Hosdon, and other places, became no longer standing Triumphs. Great were the cries of the people in many Towns, to see such a devastation of their Corn and oods; nay, the fields, Woods, and Groves, seemed to mourn for the loss of their stately Cedars, there being in many places great Trees torn up by force and violence of the Wind by the roots: And this extended many miles, even to the North East, and VVestern parts: for not onely at Lin in Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Hartford, Buokingham, Northampton, & in Leicestershire, but also as far as Hereford in the VVest of England, the storm was exceeding great, and very consi∣derable the losses, sustained by those great & strange winds: for on Tuesday morning the 1th of February about two of the clock began a most violent storm of Rain mixt with Lightning, which coninued about two hours: after which followed such an impetuous Tempest of wind that never was the like known in those part, continuing till almost noon ve∣ry strong and high, being scarce any safety within Doors or without▪ and not a Church nor House in the City, but hath re∣ceived loss. The poor Country people resort thither daily, complaining of their great sufferings by this violent storm, some having their awelling houses blown down, some their Barns▪ some their Stables, Beasts, and Cow-houses, their Hor∣ses and Cattle being destroyed and killed in them.
The like hapned at VVorcster, Glocester, Tenisbury and other Towns and Vilges in those parts; and the High wayes are so full of fal Trees, tha Carriers▪ Wggo∣ners, and other Travellers can hardly pass; and it is to be feared that many have suffered great shipwrack at Sea, many Fishermen being likewise reported to be cast away at the mouth of the River of Thames. We also hear, that the same day there was very great and violent storms in Yorkshire Lincolnshire, and those parts, and that there is very much harm done by these strange Windes, and that many Cattle have been kil'd by the fall of Houses Such stomes have not been known those many years, and indeed scarce heard of since the year 1625. at which tim blessed be God, Providence was pleased to divert it from ning to these Kingdomes, for the Eastern Countries underwent the terror thereof, espe∣cially at Constantinople, where on Munday the 29th, of June there began a mst terrible Tempest; with so vio∣lent and cntiu Thunder and Lightning, that all the City shewed as if it had been on fire: At the end whereof fell a storm of Hil, whose force brake both Tiles and Glasss, so tha stnes were taken up of an hundred and ity Drams and the next morning some of hem being weighed they were of about seven or eight Ounces a piece, where ih my were sore wounded: And the third of July after, there fell out another Tempest of Thunder and Lightning, which burned some and slew many Cattle in the Field. Sundry such examples we may read of in History, but those which seemed most terrible, are such menti∣oned
in the Reign of Tarquin, in whose dayes fell out one of the most terriblest Earthquakes that ever was: First, there arose furious and vioent Windes, which tare up Trees by the Roots, made Birds fall to the Earth, uncovered houses▪ and overthrew many; then followed Thunder are Lightning, which made the night like noon day; then fearfull Thunder Bolts, which brake down stately Buildings▪ and slew many men; the Sea was wonderfully troubled, after which came such a violent heat, that men were not able to endure it but were forced to cast off their cloaths and hide themselves under ground; the Sky was so dark and dust so great, that one could not see another, so that flocking together, many fell down dead. Many Cities were ruinated, much people perished, many moun∣tains and Hills fell and became plains, many Rivers were dried up, Fountains and Springs brake up where never was any before, and almost all the houses in An∣tioch were demolished. Thus did the Lord pour down heavy Judgements upon a wicked and sinful people; for many are the Plagues which God sends sometimes upon a people to make them see their iniquities; and sometimes they are great and of long continuance, to stir up and induce a sinful people to observe the works of the Lord, and fear his Glorious Name: O that the inhabitants of this Island would take up a lamentation for the sins of England, crying to the Lord night and day, renting their hearts, and not their garments that his Divine Majesty would be pleased to divert those judgements threatned to this sinful Land, and to preserve us from violent
Storms, Famines Plagues, and Sicknesses; for by tur∣ning to the Lord, is the only way to remove his judge∣ments; and if we seek the face of the Lord, and turn to him, and call upon his Name, and forsake our evil wayes, then will the Lord hear from Heaven, pardon our Sins and heal our Land. The loss sustained by these great and violent VVindes, is said to amount to above one Million of Money; besides the loss of many ships 7 being reported to be sunk, coming for London laden with Suffolk Cheee, and other necessary pro∣visions: may Boats were also cast away▪ and great detri∣ment an dmage done by fire the same day, which hapned on Tuesday the 18th of this instant February.
