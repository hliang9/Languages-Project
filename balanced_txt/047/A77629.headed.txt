Advertisement to Booksellers. WHereas The Four Oxford Cullies, having run Themselves and Por∣ter out of breath, and finding that their ill∣shap'd Testaments, &c. will not answer their expectation, they have lately among other things Pirated a certain Book called Elegantiae Poeticae, and offer'd it to Sale for 1 s. 4 d. in Quires: THis is to give notice, That of the true Proprietors of the Copy, the said Book may be had at 12 d. a single Book in Quires, of a more perfect Edi∣tion, having three Sheets more of Matter than the Oxford Print. Brought downe to Oxford by a London bookseller, & dis{per}sed there in Station{er}s shops about 10. March 1679/80.
