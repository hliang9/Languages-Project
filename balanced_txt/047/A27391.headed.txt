A True and Impartial ACCOUNT OF The most Remarkable Passages in IRELAND, &c. IN December last, the Protestants of Ireland had very great expectation of an Army suddenly to be sent over into that Kingdom for their Relief, and were privately arming them∣selves, and securing what Ammunition they could to pre∣pare to join with the English Forces, assoon as they should land; and to make the People more earnest to put themselves in a posture of defence, in case the Earl of Tyrconnel, the then Lord De∣puty, should offer any violence to them, there was by way of Letter a Relation given from some Persons of Note in the North to two or three Lords in Dublin, and to several Persons of Quality throughout the Kingdom, that the Irish were generally to rise on the 9th of December, with intent to massacre and totally destory the whole Body of English, and all of the Protestant Religion in that Kingdom. These Letters did so run about the Nation, that in few days all the Protestants were upon their defence, and every private man making his House a Garrison, by keeping great and strong Guards in the Night-time, insomuch that if their nearest Relations had come to visit after night, they were answered out of Casements, Spike-holes, or Windows, with Blunder busses on Guns at their breasts, to know their business: And particularly on the 9th of December (as is mention'd before) it was credibly reported, that there was not a Protestant in the whole Kingdom, but was
on his Guard that whole Night in his own respective Dwelling, or joined with some Neighbours in some sort of strength. The Earl Tyrconnel finding the whole Kingdom in this great Consternation, sent to some of the Gentlemen in Dublin, who had received this Advice, and assured them with Oaths and Execrations, That there was no such thing intended against the Protestants; but being doubtful that the English of that Nation had but very small regard to his Oaths, did call a grand Council, in order to propose some way to appease the people: The result of which was, That a Pro∣clamation should be immediately issued out, commanding all peo∣ple to repair to their respective Dwellings, assuring them that no injury was intended against them, making it penal for any man afterward to desert his own House, or associate himself with any riotous people in any Garrison-Town or strong Houses. But not∣withstanding all these fair Promises and Threats, the people were so universally alarmed by these Circular Letters (whether true or false) that they daily joined themselves in greater Numbers, and many of them went into England, Scotland, and the Isle of Man for safety, carrying with them what they conveniently could. The Earl of Tyrconnel observing the humour of the people, and how apprehensive they were of the Irish Cruelty, and likewise being informed of the vast number of people daily leaving Dublin, and many considerable Merchants and House-keepers lying at Rings-End for a Wind to carry them off, sent the Earl of Roscommon and the Lord Mountjoy to Rings-End to discourse to the people, and endeavour to prevail with them to return to their own Dwellings, and follow their Employments; but what they said either at Rings-End, or elsewhere, made no greater impression on the minds of the people than the former Proclamations he had issued out, which occa∣sioned his Excellency to redouble his Oaths, and burn some Hats and Wigs, that being his accustomed way of appeasing his rage and passion: during all this time, the people having advice of the great Success of his present Majesty against the late King James's Forces, were encouraged to appear more bare-fac'd; and they ap∣peared in greater Bodies than formerly in Munster, Connaght, and Ʋlster, and the Protestants of Leinster daily made their Escapes into the North, leaving all their Substance to the disposal of the insatiable ravenous Irish, who would impudently in the day-time
drive Horses and Cows, with thousands of Sheep, from the Owners thereof before their faces, who dared not to ask them what they did; and the Protestants of the Counties of Dublin, East-Meath, West-Meath, Longford, Lowth, and the upper part of the County of Cavan, being the greatest Sufferers, repaired with this great loss quietly to the North, esteeming it the Mercy of God that they escaped with their lives. The very great Success of his present Majesty, and the Late King's abdicating his Kingdom, so much encouraged the Protestants, that then they began to appear in great Bodies of Horse and Foot, and take possession of Towns and Forts, and declare their design. And now being Londonderry and Inis∣killing were the first that shut their Gates against the Irish, it's ne∣cessary that I give an account of them, before I proceed to speak of other places of the same Country. The News of his present Majesty's design in landing an Army in England, did so alarm the Earl of Tyrconnel, that he very speedily put what Forces was then in Arms, into such Garrisons as he thought fit; but it seems, upon some Orders from the Late King James, two Regiments of Foot, and one of Dragoons, were to be forthwith sent into England; whereupon his Excellency gave Dire∣ctions for the Regiment of Foot, quartered in Londonderry, belong∣ing to the Lord Mountjoy, to march up to Dublin, in order for their embarquing for England, which was accordingly marcht to Dublin, and a new Regiment belonging to the Earl of Antrim, newly raised, was ordered to march into Londonderry, to secure that Garrison (the same being left to the Government of the Townsmen and Inhabitants of that place) but whether it was, that these new Le∣vies looked so dreadfully starved, or the Townsmen had an incli∣nation to keep Popery out, they shut the Gates of the Town on the appearance of this new Regiment, and utterly denied them entrance; but some of the Officers being desirous to go into the Town, the Inhabitants allowed them that priviledge, and upon some debate the Inhabitants declared, they would secure the Garrison for the King and their own Preservation, and sent the Gentlemen out with this Answer to the Earl of Antrim. This coming by an Express to his Excellency, and considering how indiscreetly he had command∣ed the whole Regiment to march out of the Garrison before others were ordered to possess that place, he burned another Wigg, and then
thought to retake that strong Hold with about 6 Companies of the Lord Mountjoy's Regiment with Pike and Musket, who were with∣in three days after their arrival at Dublin, and after a long March of 110 miles, being the depth of Winter, ordered to march back again; but indeed it was altogether needless, until the Lord Mountjoy came in Person, and proposed to the Inhabitants. That if they would admit of any of the Army to quarter in that Town, he would disband all the Papists in those six Companies, and put Protestants in their places, and that Colonel Robert Lundy should be their Governour; to which the whole Town agreed, and after that time there were six Companies of Protestants belong∣ing to the Lord Mountjoy, who are now it that place, and Colonel Lundy continued Governour until of late. The little Town of Iniskilling being situated in an Island in a great Lake, so that there was no access but by water, the Inhabi∣tants thereof did no less gallantly secure that place, opposing two Foot-Companies which were sent by the Earl of Tyrconnel to secure that Garrison, looking on it as a most advantageous place bordering on Connaght; but not timing his Intrigue well, the Inhabitants of Iniskilling never suffered these two Companies to come nearer than two miles of the Town, and so sent them back again with as much shame as the Earl of Antrim's Regiment left Londonderry, and very soon after the said Town of Iniskilling declared for the Prince of Orange (the now King) and the Protestant Religion, and have very gallantly ever since defended that place with great Courage and Zeal, altho' they were like to have been surprised by some of the disaffected Gentlemen in that Country several times. Since which time this Town has not been idle; for after the Army had marched against the Counties of Downe, Antrim, &c. under the Command of Lieutenant General Hamilton and Colonel Sheldon, the Lord Galmoy with about 2000 Horse and Foot, was ordered to march against this place, and the Country thereabouts being boggy, and very bad way to bring great Guns against the place, there was a contrivance of a Tin Gun covered with Leather, and this was drawn by eight Horses to the Top of a Hill near the Town: After this great Bugbear (for so it might be term'd) was fairly planted against the Town, the Lord Galmoy sends a Trum∣pet with a Summons for surrendring the Garrison, offering large
Conditions, but the Town refused him Entrance, and set his Lordship and his great Gun at defiance (not knowing but the same was real) and sallied out in the Night, killed about thirty six, took some Prisoners, and this extream weighty Gun, which one man triumphantly brought into Town on his shoulder, that was drawn by eight Horses the day before. This Defeat so much shamed the Lord and his Party, that they drew off, and never troubled the place more, nor dare they ever since come near the Town, but permit the Souldiers of it to ride thirty or forty miles in the best planted Countries, driving before them such Cattle, and bringing such Provisions as they think most convenient for the use of the Garrison, without the least obstruction. When the Lord Galmoy was on his March towards Iniskilling with his Tin Gun, he happened to take one Wolston Dixie, eldest Son to the Dean of Kilmore, and one Edward Charleton, as they were carrying off some Concerns of the Dean's; and this young Gentleman coming but newly from the Colledge, and being with a Party of Horse, the Lord Galmoy said he was a Captain, and instrumental in making so much trouble in the North; the Gen∣tleman disowned it, and said he only was securing his Father's Goods; but in short, he and Mr. Charleton were hanged at Beltur∣bet; and there being an accident, either by the breaking of the Rope, or the Gate whereon they were hanged, this young Gentle∣man fell down alive, and then the Question was put, Whether he would turn Roman Catholick, and pray for King James? He said he would not alter his Opinion, but would pray for the King: Whereupon Command was given to hang him up again, and be∣ing half dead, was cut down, his Head and Mr. Charleton's being kicked about the streets, and afterwards fixed on the Market-house. This piece of Cruelty was done by that Bloody Villain the Lord Galmoy at Belturbet in the County of Cavan. After the Towns of Londonderry and Iniskilling had thus oppo∣sed the Earl of Tyrconnel and his Proclamations, the County of Cavan being the neighbouring County, began to appear very briskly; for on the 8th of January there being a Quarter-Sessions to be held at the Town of Cavan, and there also being many Irish Justices of the Peace on the Bench, one Captain Robert Sander∣son, of Castle Sanderson, came with about eighty Horse into that
Town. After the Country had met, this Gentleman demanded of the Irish Justices to shew by what Commission they sat there? They replied, It was by King James his Commission; whereupon Captain Sanderson told them, That was no good Authority at that time of day, and ordered the Country to return to their own Dwellings; some of the Reilys, being Great men of that Country, and Justices of the Peace, began to thwart him, which Contro∣versie had been ended by the Captain's Cane, if the Justice had not fled off the Bench, and escaped his Fury; this so alarmed the whole Court and Town, that the Quarter-Sessions were broke up, and none kept there ever since. This News went very soon to the Earl of Tyrconnel's Ears, who threatned to send some Troops of Horse into that Rebellious Country (as 'twas then termed) which so much terrified the people, that almost every man was in Arms. The Irish then began even to break and plunder Houses in Cor∣poration-Towns, and take away the Protestants Goods at plea∣sure. Not long after this, one Sir Gerrard Irwin having gone to Dublin, was made Lieutenant Colonel to the Earl of Granard's Regiment of Horse to be then raised, and in order to the better raising of the same in the County of Fermanagh, the said Sir Ger∣rard brought with him several Cases of Pistols, Holsters, and other Furniture, with Carbines, Swords, &c. from Dublin, with Powder and Ball, which did so much terrifie the hearts of the English there∣abouts, that they resolved to seize both the Knight and his Arms, &c. which was accordingly done by one Mr. Dan. French and Mr. Hen. Gwillyms, who came from Belturbet to the Town of Cavan with about sixty Horse, and there seized on the Arms, and took Sir Gerrard Prisoner to Belturbet, who was delivered to the Lord Blany's disposal, being there at that time, upon his viewing the Forces of that Country, who sent Sir Gerrard Prisoner to Iniskil∣ling, the Country wherein he purposed to raise his Men, to be se∣cured by them. This was not long from the Earl of Tyrconnel's Ears (viz. that the Protestants had broke the County-Goal at Cavan, and dis∣charged the Protestant Prisoners, who were hourly threatned to have their Throats cut by the Papists in the said Goal) who was exceedingly troubled at it, but dared not to send any Forces into
that Countrey, lest they would be served with the same sauce, as Sir Gerrard Irwin was: So that he did only send some Troops of Horse and Dragoons to Navan and Kells, in order to prevent Captain Sanderson's Motion to Dublin with his Horse, being by this time alarm'd on the other side of his Head by the Lord Mount Alexander, my Lord Blany, Sir Arthur Rawdon, and several other Persons of Quality, being all up in Arms in the Counties of Downe, Antrim, &c. and having the Stand∣ing Army but in a very bad Condition at that time (the best whereof being sent for England on the Prince's Landing) and few or no New Men raised, seemed to be so apprehensive of the Scotch Army marching to Dublin, that he had Scouts for Fif∣ty or Threescore Miles together, to observe the Motion of the Rebels in the North (as he termed them), And it is most certain, that if some Troops had marcht up towards Dublin, the Earl of Tyrconnel would certainly either have fled, or surrendred the Castle, not having above Ten Companies of Foot, and some few Horse in Dublin, and these being all new rais'd raw Men. But the Gentlemen of the North, al∣though they were in an indifferent Condition, and had a great Desire to effect this, yet were unwilling to appear any otherwise than in their own Defence, until Commissions should come out of England. The Earl of Tyrconnel considering how numerous the Scotch in the North were, and how weak and insignificant the Stand∣ing Army was, and how useless the Rabble of the Irish would be to him, very cunningly engag'd the Lord Mount∣joy to send Letters to his Friends in the North, to be very careful of Affairs; assuring them, that no Forces should be sent into the North, or any New Levies made, or Soldiers quartered upon private Houses; and that all things would be very well, to their own satisfaction; for, that he was going into France, to receive Orders from King James, to make Tyrcon∣nel lay down the Sword. This so much pleased the Peo∣ple, that all things began to grow pretty still and quiet a∣gain; in which time the Earl of Tyrconnel was raising Men, and sending Arms, privately into the Countrey, to such as he
had given Commission; and in a very short time, notwith∣standing his Promises to the Lord Mountjoy, had Raised and Armed several Regiments of Dragoons, and Foot, and secured the Town of Newry, being a great Pass, and very disadvantageous to the Protestants in the Norths. The Irish having secured this Pass of Newry, the Earl of Tyrconnel thought himself very safe, and then daily sent down Arms to all that Countrey, and secured the Towns of Drogheda and Dun∣dalke, by leaving great Parties both of Horse and Foot in them. So that the Protestants had no manner of Correspon∣dence that way; and likewise had taken care, that all other By-Passes cunningly should be secured; which was the only mischief the Protestants met with; for by this means the Earl of Tyrconnel could march down his Army against them when he pleased, and at his own leisure, and they never have the least Account of their Motion, which has proved too true, as you shall hear hereafter. The Irish having got this Considerable Strength (as I have mentioned before), then it was their Business, and indeed the positive Commands from the Respective Parish-Priests, and under the Danger of a Curse too, That they should endeavour to secure and seize all strong Castles, or Gentlemens Houses of any Strength, as soon as possible they could, which indeed they effected with much Integrity, ei∣ther by cunningly stealing into them by Nights, or setting Fire to their Gates. While the Earl of Tyrconnel was fortifying the Newry, and re-enforcing several other Garrisons, there were several Odd Companies of Foot, and Troops of Dragoons quarter∣ed about the Countrey, who indeed were willing to be gone from amongst the Scotch Army; and amongst the rest, (I cannot pass by giving you an Account of the Troop of Dragoons quartered in Armagh) it seems Lieutenant Aspoll, commanding in Chief in that Town, perceiving how vast∣ly numerous the Protestants were in that Countrey, and how vigorously they armed themselves, was apprehensive of
some Danger; therefore gave private Orders to all the Men to be ready against a certain Hour, and march out of the Garrison with all the Privacy imaginable. But this was not so secretly managed, but it took Wind in the Town, and the very morning the Dragoons were to march away, the Townsmen surprized the Officers in their Chambers, and se∣cured all the Horses and Arms they could find; and there being about Ten of the Dragoons on the Guard that Night, posted themselves in the Session-House, and endeavoured to secure that Place; but the Townsmen were so forward and resolute, that they came up to the Doors of the House, fire∣ing on both sides very smartly: But at last the Dragoons surrendered, after a Serjeant was shot in the Arm, and they with the rest of the Troop, all sent Prisoners to the Church, after having lost both Horse and Arms, which were distribu∣ted amongst the Men who performed this Service; and the Dragoons after some Days Confinement, Discharg'd, who upon their March in the County of Lowth, got near the va∣lue of all their Horse and Arms at Captain Blany's House, ha∣ving taken all his best Horses and Houshold-Goods, to a very considerable Value. This late Action at Armagh much stir'd up his Excellen∣cy's Passion; insomuch, that he swore, he would send down a very powerful Army against the North; but being awed by a considerable Force under the Lord Inchiqueen, in Munster, and by another under the Lord Kingston in Connaught, durst not send so great an Army as he would; and therefore for some time rested quiet. The Northern Gentlemen understanding, that the Earl of Tyrconnel did not intend an Army to divert them, so soon as expected, were willing to give themselves some Recreation; and the taking of Carrickfergus (where the Earl of Antrim was Governour, and Mark Talbot, Natural Son to the Earl of Tyrconnel, Commander of the Forces there) was the Sub∣ject; and it was reported on all hands, That if there had not been a Mis-management in the Matter, the Design had taken Effect; but since it did not, I shall not trouble the Reader with
a Relation of the manner of besieging that Town, or how they left it. After the Forces were drawn back which went against the Town of Carrickfergus, the Council at Hilburragh thought convenient to send some Forces to secure the Pass at Logh∣bricklan, and other places thereabouts, lying within some few Miles of Newry, where the Irish had made a considerable Strength, both by manning the Bridge, and intrenching the Town; and at Armagh the Lord Blany, with about a Re∣giment of Horse, and a Regiment of Foot, secured that Pass, in case the Enemy should move that way. Things being ordered in this manner, there happened several Skirmishes both between the Enemy at Newry, and that part of the Prote∣stant Army at Loghbricklan, in some part of which a ve∣ry worthy Gentleman, one Captain Poe, was slain, with about Nine more, as they went a Forraging, by an Ambus∣cade; as also several Skirmishes between the Lord Blany's Par∣ty, and the Enemy at Charlimount, and other flying Parties who were Pillaging the Countrey: So that scarcely a Day passed without killing and taking some. This being about the beginning of March, things arrived to a very great pitch, and the Irish grew more insolent than formerly: Inso∣much that many People fled from their Concerns, leaving all, or most of their Substance behind, to the disposal of the Enemy, and grew almost impatient for Relief out of Eng∣land, expecting every fair Wind would bring over an Army, which would settle that Kingdom: And indeed a very small Number of Men, with Arms and Ammunition, might have effected it, when the Prince of Orange (the now King) his Proclamation came over, requiring the Irish to surrender them∣selves and their Arms by the 10th of April: Which Procla∣mation was sent by the Lord Blany to the Garrison of Charli∣mount: And the said Lord Blany had his Majesty Proclaimed at Armagh, with all the Solemnity imaginable, which was likewise done at Hillsburrough, and several other Places in the North. When the Earl of Tyrconnel had advice, That our Present King William was proclaimed in Armagh, and several other
places, he by this time had put his Army into some better Condition than before, and ordered some Horse and Dra∣goons, commanded by Collonel Dominick Sheldon, with a con∣siderable Body of Foot, commanded by Collonel Richard Ha∣milton (who was sent out of England, with Conditions for the Irish) to march towards the North: And having stopt all Correspondence from the Protestants, from Newry downwards, that Army marched within some few Miles of Loghbricklan, before any particular Account came to the Lord Mount Alex∣ander, or the Council at Hillsburrough: Whereupon it was thought fit to withdraw what Forces were quartered at Logh∣bricklan, and thereabouts, nearer Drumore and Hillsburrough, and to burn and destroy all the Countrey they marched through, to make the same uneasie for the Earl of Tyrcon∣nel's Horse, in regard there was not much Forrage in that Countrey. However, Collonel Hamilton and Sheldon finding the Garrison of Loghbricklan deserted, immediately moved forward; and having some Troops in the Forlorn, marched within some few Miles of Drumore: Sir Arthur Rawdon then commanding at Drumore, sent out some Scouts, to observe the Motion of the Enemy, and to discover their Number: The Scouts informed him, that there could not be above Three or Four Troops of Horse, and that they approached near the Town: Whereupon Sir Arthur Rawdon drew out about Five Hundred Men, or thereabouts, to prevent the Enemies coming farther into that Countrey) and upon View of the Body of Horse (the rest of the Army lying obscurely under a great Hill), resolved to Charge them; but before there was any Close Engagement, the great Army which lay secure behind the Hill, moved forward, and were much too strong for Sir Arthur's Party: Whereupon the Protestants fled, and made their way through Hillsburrough, the Enemy killing several, ha∣ving the pursuit of them for about Five or Six Miles, and getting great Plunder of Rich Portmantions, and other things left on the way; but finding themselves near Hillsburrough, and not knowing but the Body of the Protestant Army were in a Reserve thereabouts, thought it convenient to make a Halt until they had brought up the rest of the Army. But to
give Sir Arthur Rawdon his due, he behaved himself with as much Courage as any Man could do in this Engagement; and had there been but reasonable Odds, he and Major Ba∣ker, now one of the Governours of Londonderry, had defeat∣ed the Enemy; But the loss of the Protestants was not much (considering the advantage of the pursuit the Enemy might have made) losing about 100. Upon the News of this, most of the People about Hillsbur∣rough fled; but some kept the Castle, being a place of a rea∣sonable good Strength, and having about a Thousand Pound in Money, and an incredible Store of Oatmeal, and other Provision, were resolved to defend the Place; but in a very little time surrendred it, and all the Money, &c. to the Enemy, Col. Hamilton and Sheldon giving Protections to all People who desired them, on his March, which was their Policy; for there∣upon many remained in their own Houses. After the Break of Drumore, Sir Arthur Rawdon brought what Horse and Foot he could with him to Colerain; and there∣upon what Forces were in Lisnegarvy, Belfast, Antrim, and o∣ther places thereabouts, made their way to that Garrison, think∣ing to secure that Pass, and prevent the Enemy going over the Ban Water, having cut down the Bridge at Porteglanone, a∣bout Ten Miles from Colerain, and ordered all the Boats on Lough Neagh, and the River to be burnt, which was esteemed the only way to retard the Enemies March into the County of Londonderry and Donegall (having no way to pass but by a tedious march by Charlimount): But the great oversight of not sinking or burning these Boats, proved very fatal, as you shall hear hereafter. The Garrison at Hillburrough being surrendred, and all the Prote∣stant Forces making their way to Colerain, there was nothing left to oppose the Irish Army in all that Country, where they got very great Plunder, especially in Lisnegarvy, Belfast and Antrim, besides to the value of 3 or 4000 l. belonging to the Lord Massereen in Money and Plate, hid about his House, and discovered by his own Servant, for a Reward of 10 Guinies; and besides this, they got all the Furniture of his House, as it stood, to a very great value: And in this plentiful Country the Enemy thought fit for some time to refresh themselves, which indeed they did.
Now I must return to Armagh, Monaghar and Glasslogh, to give account of the Forces there, under the Command of the Lord Bla∣ny, and the other Forces of the Counties of Cavan and Fermanaugh, commanded by Capt. Francis Hamilton, now Sir Francis Hamilton, who for the good of his Country and Religion, deserted the late King James's Army, and brought off about 16 or 20 of the best Men in his Troop, and forced his way, escaping several imminent dangers. The Irish of the North-West having advice, that the Army had conquered all before them in the North-East Country, very vio∣lently prest the taking in of strong Houses and Castles: wherefore the Protestants thought good to make a fair Escape to Iniskilling, where many of them now are, to the number of about 10000 of good Men, under the command of Gustavus Hamilton, some time Cornet to the Lord Galmoy; and many of the Protestants got into the Castle of Monaghan; but the Irish were so numerous about that place, and so very earnest in getting it, that the Protestants were forced to desert it, and make to Glasslogh; But this was no resting place for them long; for one John Macanna came against it with a∣bout 600 Men, and intended to have seized the Lady Blany, and some other Persons of Quality in the Castle, if Matthew Auctle, Esq; a person of undaunted courage, had not drawn out what Forces were in that small Village, consisting not of above Two Troops of Horse, and Three Companies of Foot, to fight the Enemy, who advantageously lined a large Fort on the Top of a Hill, and gauled the Protestants as they advanced; but this Gentleman, Mr. Auctle, very bravely forced his way into the Fort, notwithstanding their Fire, and put them to the rout, where there was about 89 kill'd, be∣sides Macanna himself, his Son, and another Son taken Prisoner; and immediately after this passage a Rogue lay behind a Bush; and shot Mr. Auctle dead, being the only person lost in this Skirmish. But the Enemy being thus routed, the Lady Blany, and the other persons in the Castle, with the Two Troops and Three Foot Companies, had afair opportunity of making their Escape, and quitting that place, made their way to Londonderry. Then what Forces were left in this Country, were at Armagh with the Lord Blany, to secure that Frontier Garrison; but Coll. Lundy not sending any Men to re-enforce the place, as was expect∣ed, and the Enemy in a manner surrounding the Town, before the
Lord Blany would stir, or quit it, was at length forced to make his way to Colerain, with about 7 Troops of Horse, and 8 Companies of Foot, with which his Lordship did narrowly escape; for the Gar∣risons of Charlimount and Mountjoy, having notice of his March, or∣dered about 1200 Men, on the 16th of March, to get the Pass at Ardea-Bridge; and if that was done, 500 more were to fall on in the Rear, and so destroy the whole Party; but my Lord marching his Men in good order, and with all the speed he could, by good For∣tune got the Bridge, not a quarter of an hour before the Enemy ap∣peared, and fired in the Rear: Whereupon the Horse and Foot were drawn up, and about Two Companies sent out for the Forlorn, to the Bridge, to make a handsome Engagement of it; but the Enemy at the very first Fire ran. Upon which the Horse fell on, and killed about 155, as was then found on the spot, besides several that were drowned: And in this Exploit there was not a man killed or wound∣ed of the Lord Blany's Party, nor any harm done, save Two Horses lost; so that Party marched forward to Colerain. There was Seven Companies of Foot more which belonged to the Lord Blany; but they thinking to make a nearer way to Colerain, were all disarmed near Antrim, and no other harm done them, as I gave you an ac∣count before. About this time 8000 Arms, and 500 Barrels of Pow∣der, with 550 l. for Coll. Lundy's good Service, arrived at Derry, which came most seasonably for the use of the Protestants. During this Encounter, Hamilton and Sheldon were refreshing their Men in that plentiful Country; for it pleased them so well, that they did not very eagerly press forward towards Colerain, until that Garri∣son was made very strong by great Bodies of Horse and Foot of the Protestants, coming daily to them: And the first thing the Enemy did, was to secure all the Boats which were drawn up (as I formerly told you), and then about Two Troops of Horse came to view the place, and went so near, that their Leader was shot by one from the Garrison, which caused the rest to retreat, after they had taken a good view of the Situation of the Town, and the Fortification of it, being a Mud Wall of a considerable height, and a deep wet Ditch round Three Parts of the Town, and the Ban Water, with a Draw-Bridge on it, fortifying the other 4th part. The Chief Commander of the Place was Major Gastavus Hamilton, who did not spare any charge or labour to make the Place tenable.
The Enemy having thus received the Garrison, sent word, that they would give them a Visit the next day about Ten a Clock; and indeed they were as good as their promise; for about the same hour they marched up with five Pieces of Cannon, three whereof they planted against the Gate near the River, attended with a Body of Dragoons, and the other two Guns were planted against King's-Gate, attended by a Body of Horse, and their Foot drawn up in the Cen∣tre: They began to play very warmly at the Town, and the Town as hotly at them; but there being many Hedges and Gardens near the Works, the Enemies Foot got into them; which much preserv'd them from the Shot of the Town; as also did a Water-Mill very near the Town, where about thirty or forty of the Granadeers got, near night, and when they found there was no good to be done with the Town, marched off their Foot in a shower of Snow, so that the Town could not observe their motion; when the Foot were clearly drawn off, the Dragoons followed, and then the Horse marched; but in such confusion and disorder they were, that had the Town sallied out with some Troops of House, and a brisk Party of Foot, they certainly had ruined the Enemy, who were so terrify'd at a great Body of Horse, being the Lord Blany's Regiment, and some Foot drawn out on a Hill beyond the Town, that they dropt two of their Cannon on the Road, with much of their Baggage and Lug∣gage, and the next Morning came and brought them away, having lost about sixty Men the day before, and several wounded; amongst whom, Sir Gregory Birne was shot in the Head, but recovered of the Wound. The Enemy meeting with this Repulse, contrary to expectation, (for they really thought to get the Town on their first appearance) marched back to Balymony, Balymenagh, Antrim, and other Towns thereabouts: And now, since they could not pass the Ban-water at Colrain, and the Bridge at Portglanone being cut down, (as I men∣tioned before,) they make use of the Boats which should have been burned, and attempted in a few days to get over their Forces; but there being some Troops of Horse and Dragoons, and about two Re∣giments of Foot attending their motion, along the River-side, could not easily make their way, Sir Arthur Rawdon taking such great care to prevent them: However, this matter was not long in dispute;
for Col. Nugent (Son to the Earl of West-meath) with about sixty Granadeers, on the 10th of April, before day, came over a little above the Bridge of Portglanone in a Boat, and marched his men so close, and firing in such good order, that he soon gained the Trench, where about forty of the Protestants were, who deserted the same for want of Ammunition (as it was reported,) and then the rest of the Foot fled; Arthur Rawdon, Capt. James Magill, Capt. Dunbar, and Capt. Henly stood, and charged Nugent and his sixty men, (although their men left them;) and disputed the matter for a short time, where Capt. Magill was slain, and Capt. Henly desperately wounded; and then Sir Arthur, after a close engagement with Nugent, the Bul∣lets flying thick about him, was forced to retreat as gallantly as Col. Nugent's Attempt was great. The Business being over, on viewing the Body of Capt. Henly, being strangely mangled, Col. Nugent ob∣served him to move; and asking whether he was not dead, Capt. Henly said, he was not; and therefore desired honourable Quarters, which was given; and he sent to the Hospital near Colrain, and well recovered of his Wounds, by the particular Directions of Col. Nu∣gent; and the Lord of Duntreath, either out of fear or vexation, that the Army was broken, died at Kilmore. This News of the Enemies passing the River, coming to Col. Lun∣dy, the Governor of London-Derry, he forthwith ordered all the Forces at and about Colrain, to march into the Laggan, and to quit the Gar∣rison of Colrain, although it might have been kept for a considera∣ble time; but his Orders were observed, and all the Forces march∣ed to London-Derry (burning and destroying all the Country be∣tween Colrain and Derry, before them; where Col. Lundy assured the Army that they should fight the Enemy very soon; and to that end a Proclamation was set forth, which very much encouraged both Of∣ficers and Soldiers. Within some few days the Enemy began to appear on the other side of the River of Derry, which was not much regarded, or taken notice of; but within two days the whole Army was observed to march towards Strabawne, of which Col. Lundy had a full account, and was advised, that the Enemy could not stay in that Country, which was ruined before by the Protestant Army, and therefore must of necessity press and force their way into the Laggan, being a plenti∣ful Countrey; wherefore Col. Lundy was desired to march even with
the Enemy on the one side of the River, that they may be at the Passes as soon or sooner than the Enemy; and if Lifford, Claydy and Fin-Waters were secured, there was no danger of the Enemy get∣ting into that good Country, where the whole Army may be main∣tain'd till Relief came out of England; but these Reasons made no sound in his ears, or at least seemed little to regard them, and suffered the Enemy to have a days March before him; so that when he had ordered some few Regiments of Foot to secure these Passes, the Ene∣mies whole Body were drawn up near these Places, and broke in at Claydy-Ford, (whether upon a Sign from Col. Lundy or not, I can∣not positively say,) and then Col. Lundy fled, crying out, You are all cut off, shift for your selves; suffering about two hundred of the Protestants to be cut off, he making his way to London-Derry, and indeed the whole Regiment posted at Lifford, had certainly been lost, had not some Gentlemen of greater Courage or more honesty, made a a halt with the Horse, and brought up the Foot, after the loss of 100 of them; and then according to Col. Lundy's Directi∣ons, all the Army marched with what haste they could to Derry; but when they came there, the Gates were shut, and about 8000 kept out of the Walls, and dispersed about the Country; so that if the Enemy had pursued, all these poor Souls might have been lost; but as it was, many of them were lost, for they made down to E∣vishein, where several of them were killed, as well by the Rabble of the Country, as the Army, besides getting a great many good Arms. When the Enemies Horse and Foot, that were drawn up at Claydy, observed the Protestants to run, the Horse eagerly pressed over, by swimming the River, dragging the Foot by Tail and Mane after them, very few being lost, save only Major Robert Nangle, and two Troopers drowned. The next day (and as all looked upon as a great Providence) Col. Cunningham and Col. Richards appeared in Loghfoyle, about four miles from the Town, with nine Sail and a Man of War, which brought over two Regiments for the Relief of Derry: This indeed com∣forted the People; but alas! it was to little purpose; for as soon as Col. Cunningham and Richards came up to the Town, Col. Lundy assured them there was not ten days Provision in the Garrison; and thereupon a Council of War was called, and 'twas concluded, that the Town was not tenable, for want of Provisions: Upon which,
Cunningham and Richards immediately returned to their Men on board, and waited two days to bring off Col. Lundy, leaving the Town to make Conditions for themselves, having before brought off most of the considerable men of the Army, who, neither through fear, or dis∣affection to the Cause they had espoused, left the Place, but meerly cheated and deluded by this blind Council of War. This sudden Resolution of the Relief going back, amazed the Town, and especially those who knew nothing of the Design, and the Town being in a good condition, both as to Provision and a considerable Ar∣my both of Horse and Foot in it, sent three several Messengers to Col. Cunningham and Richards, That if they would accept of the Gar∣rison, and secure it for Their present Majesties, what Horse and Foot were in Town, would take the Field, and leave the Town to them∣selves, (for in that time they were in a condition to do it, but they returned no Answer, nor did the Messengers return ever since, While Col. Cunningham and Richards were in the Logh, the late King James marched all his Forces within a small way of London-Derry, and thought to get the Garrison without the least opposition; but upon his approach, the Townsmen gave him a warm Salute with their great Guns, and kill'd Three of his Horse with a Cannon-Ball; which put a stop to his Career. Col. Lundy observing how violent the men were, sent Col. Thomas Whitney round the Walls, to command the men not to fire any more; which Orders the said Whitney de∣livered; but had he not made soon off, he had certainly been thrown over the Walls: Col Lundy finding how resolute the men were, re∣solved to let them take their own Measures; and within some few hours after, the Earl of Abbercorne was sent with a Parly from the late King, for to surrender, permitting them their Lives, Estates, Re∣ligion, and a free Pardon for all Offences past; but all this would not work with the People, who utterly denied to surrender on any Con∣ditions. Col. Lundy, seeing this way would not do what he designed (as the Town had strong Presumptions to believe,) it seems the Key of the Ferry-Gate was lost, and the Gun before the Gate uncharged, and the Gunner not to be found; this being discovered, the whole Town was allarm'd, and every man repair'd to the Wall, and Col Murray appointed Governor that night, upon which, Col. Lundy secur'd himself in his House under a Guard of his own Red-coats, fearing the Soldiers of the Town would use violence against him.
The next day, it appearing that Col. Lundy had absconded, the Town unanimously chose Mr. George Walker Clerk, and Lieut. Hen. Baker, their Governors, and Col. Murray the General in the Field upon all Sallies. This Election mightily pleas'd the People, and were, notwithstanding Col. Cunningham and Richards had left them, resol∣ved to defend the Place. Now there was a hot Discourse in the Garrison, that King James was in person before the Town, and that if they would not believe it, two Gent. who knew him, might go out and see: Whereupon, Mr. Arch-deacon Hamilton, and Capt. Nevil were appointed; who returned not again to the Garrison. Then another Paper came, under the Hand and Seal of the late King, to desire the Garrison to send out any number under Twenty, to see him; but Answer was return'd, That whether he was there or not, the Town should not be surren∣dred. When the late King found himself thus slighted by the Town, he did then tamper with Capt. Robert Galbreath, Capt. William and Ben∣jamin Adaire, for the Surrender of the Fort of Kilmore, which indeed took effect; but before this, Col. Lundy, one Giluer Brasier, and Lieut. Wildman, made their Escapes in Disguise, and went down to Kilmore, with Benjamin Adaire, who came for Powder to the Town, and so got off to Scotland. This News of the Surrender of Kilmore, was a second Surprize to the Town; but all this would not perswade them to surrender, and by this time most of the Horse in the Town were forced to be turned out for want of Forage, and only one hundred kept, being two Troops, Col. Murray Capt. of the one, and Nathanael Bull Capt. of the other: And now the Town being surrounded, they came to ex∣amine their Provision and Number of fighting Men, and upon search, it plainly appear'd there was Provision for 12000 men for ten or twelve weeks: Whereupon the men were Regimented, and brought to an Allowance, and have ever since most gallantly defended the Place, their Sallies being frequent and brave. I will only say, That by the prudent Government of these two Gentlement, being en∣couraged by many in the Garrison, the Town has been preserved. In Munster the Lord Inchequin commanded the Protestants; but being surprized by Major General Macarty, were all disarmed, and no farther harm done them.
Before I proceed any farther to give an Account of the Town of London-Derry, and the Situation of the Place, I must give a Relation how that Honourable Person, the Lord Kingston, with about 1000 Horse and Foot, were decoyed out of the two strong Forts at Sligoe, which might very well have held out as long as Derry, and been a great Relief to many of the Protestants in Connaught. Col. Lundy, Governor of London-Derry, writes to this Honoura∣ble Person, to march his men to joyn the Protestants in the Laggan; Upon this Letter, the Lord Kingston accordingly marched his men as far as Ballyshannan and Donegall; but when his Lordship had come that length, he had Advice, that there was no room for his men, or Forage for his Horse in London-Derry, and therefore desired him to shift for himself, and that his men might take the late King James's Protection. Upon which, the Lord Kingston made for England, for∣cing a French Vessel that lay near Castledoe, and brought some of his men with him, and the rest got into Iniskilling: This carries the Face of contrivance, in regard his Lordship was not able to make his way to London-Derry, nor to return to Sligoe, the Enemy pos∣sessing themselves of those Forts so soon as they were deserted. And now I must return to London-Derry: As I have informed you how the late King James used all means to get that Town, so there was one Expedient more found out, (which was thus;) A Sham-Letter was sent into the Garrison, That the Lord Kingston's Party had en∣gaged some of the Enemy at Fin-water, and routed them, and there∣fore earnestly pressed the Governor to send 500 Foot, with twenty Barrels of Powder to meet him about Raphoe, and that his Lordship doubted not to repel the Enemy; but the Governors very discreetly considering the unreasonableness of that Letter, inasmuch as the greatest part of the Irish Army lay between the Town and Raphoe, looked upon it as a Trick to get the Powder and Arms; the truth of which was afterwards made very plain, in regard the Lord Kingston had not writ any such Letter, nor was he near that place, or ever engaged any part of the Irish Army. The Town, by this time, was very well allarm'd by the approach of the Enemy, and having an Account of a considerable quantity of Salmon, about sixty Tun, belonging to the Lord Massereen, in a Ware∣house near the Town, made a shift to get it all, excepting forty Barrels, which afterwards came to the hands of the Enemy, and a
great Stack of Hay, which stood within a quarter of a Mile of the Town, which might easily have been brought in, but was not. The Enemy having now got the Fort of Kilmore by Surrender, (which lies on the Mouth of the River) wherein was 300 Foot, belon∣gnig to the Town, and some Powder and Salmon, the Soldiers made Conditions to carry out their Swords and Baggage, (leaving their Fire-Arms behind;) but these Conditions were not performed, for most of them had their Swords, Hats, &c. taken from them in the Garri∣sons of Colrain, Balymenagh and Antrim, for want of Guards to con∣duct them from Garrison to Garrison, as agreed upon; upon which Complaint being made to General Hamilton, all the Satisfaction he gave, was, That if the Persons wronged could discover who plunde∣red them, they should be punished (if Soldiers,) but was not able to prevent the Barbarous Actions of the Rabble. After the Fort of Kilmore was surrendred, the Irish Army were Quartered from St. John∣stons along the Country, about eight miles in length, and Brook-Hall was ordered for the Duke of Berwick, Mr. Fitz-James, and General Hamilton's Quarters. They also placed about 100 men in the Fort of Kilmore, and about two Batallions of Foot at Pennyburne-Mill, lying a mile from the Tomn; so that most of their Foot were near that Place, and the greatest Body of their Horse, consisting of two Re∣giments, belonging to the Lord Gallmoy and Sir Maurice Eustace of Castlemartin, and a Regiment of Dragoons, belonging to the Lord Duleeke, were quartered about St. Johnstons and the Carrigans; all which did not amount to more than 7000 on Derry side, and about 3000 attending a Battery raised near Strongs-Mill, in view of the whole Town, on the other side of the Water; in which Battery were seven Cannon, which play'd very warmly against the Town, and especially against the Walls, but did no great prejudice; the Go∣vernors ordering Blinds to be built on the Walls, to prevent the Ene∣my's Shot against the Men who were posted on the Works: The Harm they did against the Town, was very small, and only brake some Slates and Tiles on the tops of Houses. The Governors being apprehensive of some Bombs to be thrown into the Town, ordered a great part of the Pavements to be pulled up, lest the fall of a Bomb might do some injury by breaking of the Streets, and casting the Stones about; and this was done by the Advice of an experienced old Soldier, and all the Timber which was saved out of Houses pull'd
down without the Gates, laid round on the Walls to be flung over in case of a Storm: Besides this, there is a Wind-Mill within a small space of that Garrison, in which was posted about 60 Fire-locks, which in∣deed kept the Enemy at some distance, and was of good use to the Besieged. The Enemy having thus encamped themselves, (if I may call it so,) the besieged began to make some Sallies; but little Execution was done, (for want of Horse,) having turned their whole Body of Horse, save 100, out of the Gates, for want of Forage, until the 20th of April; at which time our new General Murray, had a very great desire to take a Breathing to blood his Soldiers; the manner of it was pretty inge∣nious, (if so designed,) and therefore will ask leave to give some ac∣count of it, and of his Behaviour in the Enterprize. As I said on the 20th of April he ordered 500 Fire-locks to march out by small Numbers, as secretly as they could, and lodge themselves in the Ditches between the Town and Pennyburn-Mill; this being done with great Secrecy, he, and one Captain Nathaniel Bull, marched out with two Troops, and moved towards this Mill, where two Batal∣lions of the Enemies Foot lay, who immediately received the Allarm, and ordered a Body of Horse to advance and charge General Murray; but he finding them too many for him, made a halt, and ordered 500 Fire-locks more to march out, who were drawn upon the top of the Hill, in view of the Enemy; upon which the Foot at Pennyburn-Mill, drew out in two Bodies, and the Besiegers Horse advanced on the Strand to charge Colonel Murray, but received some prejudice by the Men lodged in the Ditches, who flanked their Horse; and altho' se∣veral of them dropp'd, yet the rest made good the charge against the Towns-men, who at the first Fire ran in the Rere, leaving the Gene∣ral, with Captain Bull, and some others, engaged; but whether Colo∣nel Murray, and these with him, knew that the Party retreated, I can∣not justly say, however he charged through the Enemies Horse, and forced his way back, without receiving any prejudice, only his Horse shot in the Counter; and to give the Party who engaged them their due, about 15 pursued, pistolling and slashing the Protestant Horse, within Carbine-shot of the Gates; but some of them never returned to brag of their Valour, being all slain but two by the Men who had lined the Ditches near the Strand; in this Skirmish Monsieur Mamoe, the French General of Horse, was killed; Major Toafe, Brother to the Earl of
Carlingford, Captain Fitzger Captain Bourke, and 9 Officers more, with 60 private Men; and now the 500 Fire-locks, posted on the top of the Hill with the Foot which lined the Ditches, made their Retreat towards the Town, (having an account of the Lord Gallmoy, and Sir Maurice Eustace's 2 Regiments of Horse, marching with all speed to get between them and home,) and narrowly escaped, with the loss of 7 Men, and a Lieutenant; and then the Guns from the Town forced the Enemies Horse to retreat. Within three or four days after, there was another Sally, wherein the Duke of Berwick received a slight Wound on his Back, Monsieur Puscinian, and the French General of Foot killed, and Monsieur Pon∣tee, the chief Ingeneer, wounded in the Head, the Earl of Abbercorn's Horse killed under him, and he very narrowly escaping, leaving his Scarlet Cloak, Saddle, &c. for a Prey to the besieged; some others were killed and wounded, but their Names I cannot particularly men∣tion; but such was the Execution done by the Protestants, that by some few Sallies many of the Besieged were richly clothed in the late King Jame's Livery, which afforded great diversion to the Governors to see their Soldiers strut in Scarlet laced with Silver and Gold, and o∣thers in Buff, whose Fortune afforded them no better. These Sallies proving so successful, and the Men seeing some Action, occasioned the whole Town to be greatly satisfied with their new Go∣vernors, and General Murray; in so much that they often importuned their Officers to go out; and the great freedom and familiarity of the Governors and Officers, had so prevailing a Power over the Sol∣diers, that nothing was dearer than their Commanders, and the de∣fence of the Town; whereupon a firm Resolution was set up to defend the Place to the utmost extremity; and therefore certain Rules were agreed upon, (by a general Council of War,) to be observed in the Ga∣rison, of which I must beg leave to give the Reader some short Account. There being 12000 Men in Arms in the Town, it was ordered, that two entire Regiments should be on the Guard each Night. That each Regiment had a Post assigned on the Walls, where they were to repair on all Allarms without farther Order, and there remain till drawn off. That every Regiment should have their Quarters assigned them to be together; and all the Drums of that Regiment to be quartered in one house in case of Allarms.
That the Adjutants of the whole Grrison should be quartered to∣gether, that they may be found on all occasions; and that the Ad∣jutant of each Regiment should remain on the Main Guard till the Regiment would be relieved from Duty to which he belonged. That no Tipling or Drinking should be after Eight of the Clock at night, or Candles lighted, which might direct the Enemy to fire their Cannon against the Town in the night-time. That each private Soldier should have a Salmon and a half, two pounds of Salt Beef, and four Quarts of Oatmeal in the Week, and the Inn-keepers not to take more than a Peny a Quart for Beer, in re∣gard the Soldiers receiv'd no Pay. That the Ammunition should be removed out of the grand Store, and lodged in four several Places, in case of accidental Fire, or Trea∣chery; so that all might not be lost at one time. That the Keys of the Gates should be lodged on the Main-Guard, and the same to be delivered to no Person under the degree of a Cap∣tain, there being two to attend at each Gate every night. That all Merchants Goods belonging to the Merchants who went away, should be brought into common Stores, and Inventories ta∣ken of them, to prevent Soldiers from breaking Shops and Cellars. That no Soldier should fire a Shot in the Garrison needlesly, to waste Powder and Ball, until there should be occasion. All which Orders and Rules were duly observed by the Soldiers, as well for their own Safety, as by the Command of the Governors. After the Garrison was brought to this good Order, and the Hearts of the People a little at rest, (after some suspected had left the Town,) they now unanimously resolve to stand to their Work, and consider, That if they had surrendred, and taken Protections to go to their own Dwellings, all was gone from thence before they came, and then they would be exposed to the Mercy of the Rabble, who would not only plunder them of what they had, but might barbarously murther them; and if they escaped murthering, must of necessity pe∣rish for Want; and therefore of the two chose rather to die on the Walls, than run those Hazards; so that now all thoughts of surren∣dring was quite removed from them, and a Siege began to grow something familiar. The Governors finding the humor of the People, and that Lon∣don-Derry was likely to be some time besieged before Relief was sent
from England, considered what Places about the Town could annoy them most, and from what part of the Town the Guns could most conveniently prejudice the Besiegers. The first thing they went up∣on, was the burning of all the Houses clear round the Town with∣out the Walls, and levelling their Rubbish and Ditches, so that the Enemy might not sculk in them, and gall the men on the Walls; and also considering that the great Quick-set Hedge round Alderman Tompkins's Orchard, and the Orchard it self, might be prejudicial likewise to the Walls, ordered the same to be razed. These things were no sooner thought of, and Orders given, but the Soldiers as readily and chearfully put them in execution, and in a very small time perfected this Work to admiration. And as the wise Governors and Officers considered what might be disadvantageous to themselves, resolve upon something to be equally prejudicial to the Enemy, and knowing there were some Guns to spare, which were brought up from the Fort of Kilmore, ordered two of them to be mounted on the top of the Steeple of the Church, be∣ing a great heighth, commanding all Places about the Town within Cannon-shot: This Work was no sooner ordered, but in a manner finished, and indeed to the satisfaction of the whole Garrison; for those Guns exceedingly gall'd the Enemy in the Battery on the other side of the Water, insomuch that their Battery was several times broken, and at length, when they discovered a Gun to be fired from the Steeple, the Soldiers would either run out of the Works in great disorder, or fall flat on their Bellies to avoid the Shot. Now the Town being a very strong Place by its natural Situation, built on the extream North-point of a long Tract of Ground envi∣roned on the East-side with the River about 300 yards broad, on the West with a Bogg or Marsh Ground, and on the South is the Way leading to it, which is but very narrow, and a sort of a Fort cast up at the Wind-mill, to secure that entrance: Besides this, the Town is oval in its Form, and a regular Fortification being built by the Lon∣doners in the time of Queen Elizabeth, or the beginning of the Reign of King James the First, the outward Wall being about 21 or 22 Foot high, and of a great thickness, and the inward Wall rising as high or near the heighth of a Man of the outward Wall, and be∣tween these two, Earth filled up in the middle, whereon eight or ten men may walk in Breast, so that no Gun can batter it to make a
Breach to storm: There are four Gates belonging to this Town, viz. Bishopsgate, Ferry-Key-Gate, Ship-Key-Gate, and Butchers-Gate; they stand directly opposite to each other, there being a Square in the Centre of the Town, in which Square the Market-House stands, and a large Street answering every Gate from this Square; at every Gate there is a Gun planted within twenty yards of the Gate, and four Guns planted at the Market-House, one directly against each Gate, to clear the Streets: There are nine Bastions about the Town, and about three or four Guns on each Bastion; besides this, there is a dry Ditch round the Town, over which there are two Draw-bridges, one at Bishopsgate, and the other at Ferry-Key-Gate; but in some places this Ditch is filled up, not being kept clean for a long time: But to satisfie the Reader's Curiosity of the Place, I have here given a Draught or Map of the Town. But to return to my former Discourse, I must again proceed to give some Account of the Trouble the Governors and the Officers were under, fearing His present Majesty would not send Relief to them in the time they were really able to maintain that Garrison; for it was but reasonable to think His Majesty would imagine the Place was either lost, or not able to hold out long, in regard Col. Cunningham and Richards had returned with the Relief they brought thither: And now the Fort of Kilmore being surrendred, which com∣manded the River, and the Irish Army lying round the Town on both sides of the River, a Council of War was called, and a Propo∣sal made by the Governors, That it was absolutely necessary to give the King an Account of the State and Condition of that Garrison; but there being no manner of way to effect this, but by sending some person who durst adventure to make his Way through the Irish Camp, and take shipping at the next Port he could compass; which Service was undertaken by one then present, and by a contrivance in making some of the Townsmen, posted at the Windmill, fire some loose Shot after him in view of the Enemies Scouts, was received by them as a Deserter, who afterwards, (as I have been informed,) made his way into Scotland, and so to England, escaping several imminent Dan∣gers; and after his departure from London-Derry, the ensuing Ac∣tion happened in the County of Downe. The Irish Army having run through all the North, and many of the Protestants having taken Protections from Lieut. Gen. Hamilton,
all the Ards-Isle of Kele, and the lower part of the County of Downe were forced to give a certain quantity of Oatmeal, and other Grain out of every Parish, to be delivered at the Garrisons of Charlimont, or Carrickfergus, before they could get Protections, and upon delive∣ring such Meal, &c. they were not to be disturbed in their Dwel∣lings, and that those who did molest them, should be deem'd as com∣mon Robbers. The poor Protestants being filled with great hopes of Peace, im∣mediately sent in their Composition-Meal, &c. and indeed before the time limited, (although some of them wanted to support their Families,) thinking to get the greater favour: But this Agreement was not unlike the Articles with the Protestants at Kilmore, (which were broke as soon as the Castle was surrendred;) for the Lord E∣vagh's Regiment of Mountaniers, newly rais'd in the upper Part of the County of Downe, (of meer wild Irish,) came down and plun∣dered all the Ards and Isle of Kele, notwithstanding the Conditions which were exactly performed by the Protestants. At this time one Hen. Hunter, one of the seven Captains disarm'd near Antrim, (as I mention'd before,) being in the County of Downe, when those Outrages were committed by the Lord Evagh's ragged Regiment, informed the People, That it was lawful to kill any Per∣son who should rob or plunder them after their Conditions were ful∣filled; and having some acquaintance in that Country, and troubled for being disarmed, prevailed upon the people to stand on their own Defence against these common Plunderers: This Advice soon fast∣ned upon the poor oppressed Protestants, insomuch that in some few days Capt. Hunter got near 3000 Horse and Foot in a Body, with what Arms they had, and were fully resolved to defend that Coun∣try until an Army landed out of England; and Sir Robert Maxwel's House at Killeleagh, was the chief Garrison, where Capt. Hunter brought an old Iron Gun which lay some years at Downe-patrick, and mounted it there. The News of this soon was with the late King James at Dublin, and and thereupon the whole Royal Regiment, then before London-Derry, part of the Lord Gallmoy's Regiment of Horse, Sir Maurice Eustace's Regiment of Horse, and the Lord Duleeke's Regiment of Dragoons, were ordered to march immediately from the Camp against this Hunter, and to joyn some Foot quartered at Antrim, Carikfergus,
Belfast and Lislegarvey, under the Command of Major General Bou∣char, and Lieut. Col. Mark Talbot; this was so suddenly done, and all correspondence being stopt with Col. Hunter, about the 28th of April, the Enemy surprized Capt. Hunter, falling in between his Horse and Foot, near Comlir, putting them to the Rout, killing a∣bout 300, besides several wounded, and taken Prisoners; Captain Hunter himself making his escape in a small Boat into the Isle of Man. In this Business some of the Enemy were slain, and especially Cor∣net Lock, who it's thought was killed by some of his own Party, who had a Design on his Place, he being a Protestant; for he was shot in the Back with a brace of Bullets, which could not be done by the Protestant Party, in regard the Cornet was in the Centre, and the Ranks never broke; which fully demonstrates the good Will of Papists to Protestants, although they fight under the same General, and the same Cause. This Rebellion of the Protestants in the Ards, (as it was called) gave a fair opportunity for the Lord Evagh's Regiment, which in∣deed did not let it pass them; for in a very short time most of the Protestants thereabouts were plundered, and turned out of their own Houses, and afterwards chased by the Lord Duleeke's Dragoons to Donaghadee, driving them into the Sea; but one Agnew riding at Anchor, and having four small Guns on Board, and observing how barbarously the Irish were forcing the poor Wretches into the Sea, fired two Guns at the Enemy; upon which they halted; so that Capt. Agnew brought 68 on Board, and Landed them in Scotland, without taking one penny Fraight. The Enemy having met with these Repulses against the Town and finding the Place impregnable by Storm, and believing the Garrison wanted both Commanders, Provisions, and were scarce of fresh Wa∣ter, now resolved to block it up, and stop all manner of Correspon∣dence between the Besiegers and England, by which means they hoped they would surrender, and the rather that they were discou∣raged by Col. Cunningham and Richards going away, and afterwards by the Loss of Kilmore; and therefore from the 25th of April, till the 11th or 12th of May, there was little or no Action, except the Townsmen now and then killing some of the Enemy, who too ea∣gerly came into Alderman Tompkins's Orchard, and the Meadows and Parks about the Town, to take away the Horses before they had
eaten the Grass thereabouts: About this time the Besieged made a Sal∣ly, and defeated a small Party of Foot, and then forced into the Town, and upon their Retreat, they were protected by the Guns of the Town-Walls; in this Sally some small Booty was had, but not so much as generally reported. Some few days before this, the Enemy had a warm Salute by a de∣tached Party out of the Garrison, who beat off Col. Ramsey and his Party, coming to secure the small Rivulet near the Town, thinking the Besieged had their fresh Water there; in which Sally some Offi∣cers and Soldiers fell of the Enemies Party. This, with the several other Defeats, disheartned the Irish Army very much, who were in∣deed weary of that long Fatigue of a Siege, generally drinking Wa∣ter, and but very indifferent Meat: Whereupon it was resolved, That they should draw off some small distance from the Town, (and level all the Ditches wherein the Besiegers frequently gall'd them,) until a Supply of Provisions came from Dublin to the Camp. About this time the Men of Iniskilling, having Advice of some Provisions going towards London-Derry with a Convoy, under the Command of Col. Sarsfield, intercepted them, took all the Provisi∣ons, and kill'd some of the Convoy, the rest escaping narrowly. The Town of London-Derry being thus successful in all their En∣terprizes, now daily expect Relief from England, and at length Major General Kirk, with about three Regiments, appeared in Logh∣foile, with three and twenty Sail, and three Frigats; some few days after Capt. Richards the Engineer, had got off with his Vessel, which ran on the Sands for want of a skilful Pilot; he lost some Men, and came for England, but Major General Kirk still remains in the Logh, about a Mile from Kilmore, and four Miles off the Town, in view of the Besiegers, to their great Satisfaction, although he cannot get into the Town, the River being Boomb'd between the Castle of Kil∣more and the Garrison, and durst not Land his Men, they not being able to fight their way through the Enemies Camp, and therefore expect farther Relief to be able to take the Field.
