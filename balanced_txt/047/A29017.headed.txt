Novemb. 2. 1665. Imprimatur ROBERTƲS SAY, VICECANCELLARIUS OXON.
The Publisher to the Ingenious Reader. IN this curious and inquisitive Age, when men, altogether dissatisfied and wearied out with the wranglings and idle speculations of the Schools, are with equal zeal and industry so ear∣nest in their quest and pursuit of a more solid, rational, and useful Philosophy, it may prove a work very obliging and meritorious to help and guide them in their studies and researches, and to hang out a Light to them, (as the Aegyptians used to do from their highly celebrated Pharos, for direction to the Mariners, that sailed in those dangerous Seas ner Alexandria▪) where∣by they may, with better success, steer their course through the vast Ocean of Learning, and make more full and perfect Discoveries of hitherto un∣known Philosophical verities: which has been the chief Design of this Gentleman of Honour, the most excellent and Incomparable Author in this Treatise now presented to your view, wherein Principles are not (as was the mode and guize of former times) obtruded on the World upon the account of a Great Name, or involved in cloudy and mystical Notions, which put the Ʋnderstanding upon the Wrack, and yet when
with all this labour and toile of the Brain they are at last known, prove impertinent and use∣lesse to the making out with satisfaction, or so much as tolerably, the ordinary Phaenomena, which Nature every day presents the world with, but such as are built upon the firme and immoveable foundation of Reason, Sense, and Experience, plain and obvious as well to the Eye as the Ʋnderstanding, and no less accurate and certain in their Application. And though the most noble Author hath herein, for the main, espoused the Atomical Philosophy (corrected and purged from the wild fancies and extrava∣gancies of the first Inventours of it, as to the O∣rigine of the Universe, and still mbraced with so much kindness and tenderness by some Preten∣ders, against which He hath so Learnedly dis∣puted in his first part Of the Usefulness of Ex∣perimental Philosophy, p. 74. &c.) in expli∣cating the Appearances; yet considering the se∣veral Alterations and Additions (the happy pro∣duct of his penetrating judgment) made therein, I may not scruple to call it a New Hypothesis, peculiar to the Author, made out by daily Ob∣servations, familiar Proofs and Experiments, and by exact and easily practicable Chymical processes, whereby one of the most abstruse parts of Natural Philosophy, the Origine of
Forms and Qualities, which so much vexed and puzzled the Antients, and which, I would spak with the leave of the Cartesians, their Ingenious Master durst scarce venture upon, or at least was unwilling to handle at large, is now fully cleared, and become manifest: so that from this very Essay we may well take hope, and joy∣fully expect to see the noble Project of the fa∣mous ERULAM (hitherto reckond among the Desiderata) receive its full and perfect Accom∣plishment, I mean, a real, useful, and experi∣mental Physiology established and bottomed up∣on easie, true, and generally received Principles. But I shall not forestall thy judgment either a∣bout the Excell nay of the Author, or his Sub∣ject, who hath so freely communicated to the World those treasures of Learning, wherewith his Mind is enriched, but shall soon refer you to the Work it self, after I have given you these few Advertisements. The following Discourse (as is easily perceiva∣ble by divers Passages thereof) being written, se∣veral years since, whole and entire, as now it is, I know not whether it will be worth while to in∣timate, that the Author, casually turning over of late a very recent Chymical Writer, found in one of his Treatises (divers of which he never to this day read over) a part of the Fifth Expe∣riment
of the second Section; but, as He professes, (and sure is like to be believed, she did not dream that That Chymist, or any other Author what∣soever had lighted on that part of the Experi∣ment till a good while after he had made and examined That, among many others, concerning Salts, as may be easily guess'd by the peculiar uses and applications He made of it. And though He had met with so unlikely an Experi∣ment in a Writer, who, whether he deserve it or no, has the ill fortune to be much accus'd of In∣sincerity, and some of whose more easie processes our Author (who yet is willing to spare his Name, and seems to think his works not useless) could not find to succeed, He should not have ta∣ken it upon his Authority, no more then he is wont to take other Processes, divers of which He yet in the general supposes may be true upon the relation of other Chymists; who by blemish∣ing their Books by things untrue and justly sus∣picious, are not to be relyed on, nor much thanked by wary men. But twill probably appear lesse pertinent to adde any thing further on this sub∣ject, then to take notice, that when the Author had once consented to the Publication of the fol∣lowing Papers, He several times wishd for an Opportunity to make the Experiments and Ob∣servations, He now presents to the Publick,
more full and compleat, then they were when ad∣dress'd to a private Friend. But the Contagi∣on, that drove him from the Places, where his Accommodations for repeating Experiments were, oblig'd Him to apply Himself to other Stu∣dies and Employments. And upon the same account, though he after∣wards found many of his Notes upon other parts of the Essay of Salt-petre, and have lying by him divers Papers concerning Sensible Qualities, and Sensation in general, and the Production of Second Qualities, together with a collection of Notes about Occult Qualities, and some o∣ther Subjects of kin to those of this Book; yet having, upon the freshly intimated Occasion, di∣verted his Thoughts to other Subjects, He will not engage himself to put together and commu∣nicate his Collections on these Subjects by any Publick promise. Onely thus much perchance I may undertake for, if a fair Opportunity offer it self, that the Author may be induc'd to adde ere long, for the comple∣tion of this present Work, a Discourse of Sub∣ordinate orms, wherein He, not finding that they have been by any one attempted to be expli∣cated by the Corpuscularian Hypothesis, hath proposed an Account of them agreeable thereunto. Furthermore, as the Author has in the follow∣ing
Disquisitions aim'd not at the raising or a∣betting a Faction in Philosophy, but at the Dis∣covery of the Truth; so he is not so sollicitous what every sort of Readr will think of his At∣tempts, (which tis easie to foresee are not like to be overwelcome to the Votaries of the School Philosophy) as to refuse a Compliance with the desires of his Friends, who have been long since very earnest with him not to spend that time in Replies to particular Persons, which might be more usefully imploy'd in pursuing further Dis∣coveries of Nature by Experiments. If he meet with any cogent and material Objections against any of his chief Opinions, He is enough a Lover of Truth, to be dispos'd to think himself oblig'd by those that shall shew him his Mistakes, and to take occasion to reforme them. But if nothing new or weighty be urg d, He considers, that he lives in an Age, wherein he has observ'd (even in his Own case) that Truths, if recommended by real Experiments, will in time make their own way, and wherein livestore of Ingenious Men, who, for the main, approve the Opinions, and probably will not dislike the Arguments he has propos'd, and who being more at leisure then He to write Polemical Books, will not silently suffer what they judge Truth, to be triumph'd over, or oppressd by those, who, imploying usually but
Scholastical Arguments, may be confuted by Answers of the like nature. And threfore He doubts not, but that sme Learned Favourers of the Corpuscularian Philosophy (of which he hath endeavour'd to make out those parts, wherein they almost all agree will be both able and willing to defend those Discoveries by ra∣tional Diputations, that thy have not Oppor∣tunity to increase by New Experiments. In the mean while I have no Temptation to doubt in the last, but that this curious and excellent Piece will be entertained and received by all that have any regard to the great concerns of Learning with that gust, delight, respect, and aestimation which it so highly mrits. The following Treatise being printed in the absence of the Honourable Author, thre has hapned (through the misplacing of the several Bundles wt apart fairly for the Press)  Dislocation at the 107. page, (as is there also in∣timated) where the first Section of the Historical part is placed, which should not have come in till p. 269. after the discourse of FORMS.
The Praeface. THe Origine (Pyrophilus) and Nature of the Qualities of Bo∣dies, is a Subject, that I have long lookt upon, as one of the most Im∣portant and Usefull that the Naturalist can pitch upon for his Contemplation. For the Knowledge we have of the Bodies without Us, being for the Most part fetched from the In∣formations the Mind receives by the Senses, we scarce know any thing else in Bodies, upon whose account they can worke upon our Senses save their Qualities: For as to the Substantial Formes, which some Imagine to be in all Na∣turall Bodies, it is not halfe so Evident, that there are such, as it is, that the wisest of those that do admit them, Confesse, that they do not well Know them.Nego tibi ullam esse formam robis notam pleè & planè: nostrámque scientiam esse umbram in sole. Scalger: (f whose confession to the same purpose, more are cited hereafter.) And as tis by their Qua∣lities, that Bodies act Immediately upon our
Senses, so 'tis by vertue of those Attributes likewise, that they act upon Other bodies, & by that action produce in Them, & oftentimes in Themselves those Changes, that sometimes we call Alterations, and sometimes Genera∣tion, or Corruption. And 'tis chiefly by the Knowledge, such as it is, that Experience, (not Art) hath taught Us, of these differing Qua∣lities of Bodies, that we are enabled, by a due application of Agents to Patients, to exer∣cise the little Empire, that we have either Ac∣quir'd or Regain'd over the Creatures. But I think not the contemplation of Qualities more Noble & Useful, then I find it Difficult; For what is wont to be taught us of Qualities in the Schools, is so Slight and ill grounded, that it may be doubted, whether they have not rather Obscured, then Illustrated the things they should have explain'd. And I was quickly discouraged from expecting to learne much from them, of the Nature  divers Particular Qualities, when I found that except some few, which they tell You i
General may be deduced, (by wayes they leave those to guesse at that can,) from those foure Qualities, they are pleas'd to call the First; they confesse, that the rest spring from those Forms of Bodies, whose particular Natures, the judiciousest of them acknowledge, they cannot comprehend. And Aristotle him∣self not only doth (as we shall see anon) give us of Qualitie in Generall, (which yet seems far more easily defineable, then many a Particular Quality,) no other then such a definition, as is as Obscure, as the thing to be declared by it; but I Observe not without some wonder, that in his eight Books of Physicks, where he professedly treats of the Generall Affections of Naturall things, he leaves out the Doctrine of Qualities; as after him Magirus, and divers other Wri∣ters of the Peripatetick Physiologie have done: which (by the way) I cannot but look upon as an Omission, since Qualities doe as well seem to belong to Naturall Bodies Generally consider'd, as Place, Time, Moti∣on, and those other things, which upon that
account are wont to be Treated of in the Generall part of Natural Philosophy. The most Ingenious Des Cartes has something concerning some Qualities; but though for Reasons elsewhere expressd, I have pur∣posely Forborn to peruse his Systeme of Philo∣sophy; yet I find by Turning over the Leaves that he has Left most of the other Qualities Ʋntreated of, & of Those, that are more pro∣perly call'd Sensible, he Speaks but very Briefly & Generally; rather considering what they do upon the Organs of Sense, then what Changes happen in the Objects themselves, to make them Cause in us a Perception sometimes of one Quality, and sometimes of Another. Besides, that his Explications, do many of them so depend upon His pecu∣liar Notions, (of a Materia Subtilis, Glo∣buli Secundi Elementi, and the like) and These as it became so Great a Person, he has so Interwoven with the rest of his Hypothe∣sis, that They can seldome be made Ʋse of without Adopting his whole Philosophy Epicurus indeed, and his Scholiast Lucre∣tius,
have Given some good Hints concer∣ning the Nature of some few Qualities. But beside, that even these Explications are divers of them either Doubtfull or Im∣perfect, or both, there are many other Qua∣lities, which are left for Others to Treat of. And this is the Second and Maine Difficul∣ty, which I find in investigating the Na∣ture of Qualities, Namely, that Whatever be to be thought of the Generall Theoryes of Aristotle, or other Philosophers, concer∣ning Qualities; we evidently Want That, upon which a Theory, to be Solid and Ʋsefull, must be Built; I mean an Experimentall History of them. And this we so Want, that except perhaps what Mathematicians have done concerning Sounds, and the Observations (rather then Experiments) that our Illustrious Verulam hath (in some few Pages) say'd of Heat, in his short Essay, De Formâ Calidi; I know not Any one Quality, of which any Author has yet Given us an any thing competent History. These things I mention to You, Pyrophilus, not
at all to derogate from those Great Men; whose design seems rather to have been to deliver Principles and Summaries of Phi∣losophy, then to insist upon Particulars; but for this purpose, that since the Nature of Qualities is so beneficiall a speculation, my labours may not be look'd upon as wholly Uselesse, though I can contribute but a little to the clearing of it: and that since 'tis so abstruse a subject, I may be pardon'd, if I sometimes misse the marke, and leave diverse things uncompleated; That being but what such great Philosophers have done be∣fore mee. But, Pyrophylus, before I proceed to give You my Notes upon this part of our Author's Essay, that you may rightly understand my Intention in them, it will be requisite to give you three or foure Advertisements. And first, when ever I shall speake in∣definitely of Substantiall forms, I would al∣wayes be understood to except the Reasonable Soule, that is said to inform the humane Bo∣dy; which Declaration I here desire may be
taken notice of, once for all. Secondly, Nor am I willing to treat of the Origine of Qualities in beasts; partly be∣cause I would not be engaged to examine, of what Nature their Soules are, and partly be∣cause it is difficult in most cases, (at least for one, that is compassionate enough,) either to make experiments upon Living a∣nimals, or to judg what influence their Life may have, upon the change of Qualities, pro∣duc'd by such Experiments. Thirdly, The occasion of the following Reflections, being onely this; that our Author in that part of his Essay concerning Salt∣peter, whereto these Notes referre, does briefly Intimate some Notions about the Nature and Origine of Qualities; You must not exspect, that I, whose Method leads me but to Write some Notes upon this, and some other parts of this Essay, should make Solemne or Elaborate discour∣ses concerning the Nature of particular Qualities, and that I should fully deliver my own apprehensions concerning those
Subjects. For as I elsewhere sufficiently Intimate, that in these first Notes I Write as a Corpuscularian, & set down those Things onely, that seem to have a tendency to Illu∣strate or Countenance the Notions or Fan∣cies imply'd in our Author's Essay: So I must here Tell you, that I neither have now the Leasure, nor Pretend to the Skill, to deli∣ver Fully the History or to Explicate Parti∣cularly the Nature of Each several Quality. Fourthly, But I consider, that the Schools have of late much Amus'd the World, with a way they have got, of Referring all Natu∣rall Effects to certain Entities, that they call Reall Qualities, and accordingly Attri∣bute to them a Nature distinct from the Mo∣dification of the Matter they belong to, & in some cases Separable from all Matter what∣soever, by which Meanes they have, as farre forth as their Doctrine is Acquiesc'd in, made it thought Needlesse or Hopeless for men to Employ their Industry, in searching into the Nature of Particular Qualities, & their Effects. As if, (for Instance) it be De∣manded,
how Snow comes to dazle the Eyes, they will answer, that 'tis by a Quality of Whiteness that is in It; which makes all very white Bodies produce the same Effect; And if You, ask what this Whiteness is, They will tell you no more in substance, then that tis a reall Entity, which denominates the Parcel of Matter, to which it is Joyn'd, White; & if You further Enquire, what this real Entity, which They call a Quality, is, You will find, as Wee shall see anon, that They either Speak of it much after the same rate, that They do of their Substantiall Forms; (as indeed some of the Modern'st teach, That a Quality af∣fects the Matter it belongs to, per modum formae secundariae, as they speak) or at least they will not Explicate it more Intelligibly. And accordingly if you further Ask them, how white Bodies in Generall do rather Produce this effect of dazling the Eyes, then Green or Blew ones, instead of being told, that the former sort of Bodies reflect Outwards, and so to the Eye farre more of the Incident Light, then the Latter; You shall perchance
be told, that 'tis their respective Natures so to act, by which way of dispatching difficulties, they make it very easy to solve All the Phoenomena of Nature in Generall, but make men think it impossible to ex∣plicate almost Any of them in Particular. And though the Unsatisfactorisness and Barrennesse of the School. Philosophy have perswaded a great many Learned Men, especially Physicians, to substitute the Chy∣mists Three principles, instead of those of the Schools; and though I have a very good opinion of Chymistry it self, as 'tis a Practical Art; yet as 'tis by Chymists pretended to containe a Systeme of Theori∣call Principles of Philosophy, I fear it will afford but very little satisfaction to a se∣vere enquirer, into the Nature of Quali∣ties. For besides that, as we shall more par∣ticularly see anon, there are Many Quali∣ties, which cannot with any probability be deduc'd from Any of the three Princi∣ples; those that are ascrib'd to One, or other of them, cannot Intelligibly be explica∣ted,
without recourse to the more Compre∣hensive Principles of the Corpuscularian Philosophy. To tell us, for instance, that all Solidity proceeds from Salt, onely in∣forming us, (where it can plausibly be pre∣tended) in what materiall principle or ingredient that Quality resides, not how it is produced; for this doth not teach us, (for example) how Water even in exact∣ly clos'd vessels comes to be frozen into Ice; that is, turn'd from a fluid to a Solid Body, without the accession of a saline ingredi∣ent (which I have not yet found pretended, especially Glasse being held Impervious to Salts.) Wherefore, Pyrophilus, I thought it might much conduce to the understan∣ding the Nature of Qualities, To shew how they are Generated; and by the same way, I hop'd it might remove in some measure the obstacle, that these Dark and Narrow Theo∣ries of the Peripateticks and Chymists may prove to the Advancement of solid and use∣full Philosophy. That then, which I chie∣fly aime at, is to make it Probable to you by
Experiments, (which I Think hath not yet beene done:) That allmost all sorts of Qualities, most of which have been by the Schooles either left Unexplicated, or Ge∣nerally referr'd, to I know not what In∣comprehensible Substantiall Formes; may be produced Mechanically, I mean by such Corporeall Agents, as do not appear, either to Work otherwise, then by vertue of the Motion, Size, Figure, and Contrivance of their own Parts, (which Attributes I call the Mechanicall Affections of Mat∣ter, because to Them men willingly Referre the various Operations of Mechanical En∣gines:) or to Produce the new Qualities exhibited by those Bodies their Action changes, by any other way, then by chan∣ging the Texture, or Motion, or some other Mechanical Affection of the Body wrought upon. And this if I can in any Passable mea∣sure do, though but in a generall way, in some or other of each of these Three Sorts, into which the Peripateticks are wont to Divide the Qualities of Bodies, I hope I shall have
done no uselesse Piece of Service to Natural Philosophy, Partly by exciting You, and Your Learned Friends, to Enquire after more Intelligible and Satisfactory wayes of explicating Qualities, and Partly by Be∣ginning such a Collection of Materials to∣wards the History of those Qualities, that I shall the most largely Insist on, as Heat, Co∣lours, Fluidity and Firmnesse, as may invite You, and other Ingenious en, to contribute also their Experiments, and Observations to so Usefull a VVork, and thereby lay a foun∣dation, whereon You, and perhaps I, may su∣perstruct a more Distinct and Explicite Theory of Qualities, then I shall at present adventure at. And though I Know, that some of the things my Experiments tend to Manifest, may likewise be Confirm'd by the more obvious Phaenomena of Nature, yet I Praesume You will not dislike my Cho∣sing to entertaine You with the Former, (though without at all Despising, or so much as strictly forbearing to Employ the Latter,) because the Changes of Qualities made by
Our Experiments will for the most part be more Quick & Conspicuous, and the agents made use of to produce them, being of our own Applying, and oftentimes of our own Praeparation, we may be thereby assisted the better to judge of what they Are, and to make an aestimate of what 'tis they Do.
CONSIDERATIONS, AND EXPERIMENTS touching the Origine of Qualities, and Forms. The Theoricall Part. THat before I descend to Particulars, I may (Pyro∣philus) furnish you with some General Apprehen∣sion of the Doctrine (or rather the Hypothesis,) which is to be Collated with, and to be either Con∣firmed, or Disproved by, the Histori∣call Truths, that will be deliver'd con∣cerning Particular Qualities, (& Forms;) I will assume the person of a Corpuscula∣rian,
and here, at the Entrance, give you (in a general way) a brief Account of the Hypothesis it selfe, as it concernes the Origine of Qualities (and Forms:) and for Distinctions sake, I shall comprize it in the Eight following Particulars, which, that the whole Scheme may be the better Comprehended, and as it were Survey'd under one Prospect, I shall do little more then Barely propose Them, that either seem evident enough by their owne Light, or may without Praejudice have diverse of their Proofes reserv'd for proper places in the following part of this Treatise: and though there be some Other Particulars, to which the Importance of the Subjects, and the Greatnesse of the (almost Universall) Prejudices, that lye against them, vvill oblige mee Immediately to annexe (for the seasonable Clearing, and Justifying of them) some Annotations: yet that they may, as Little as I can, Obscure the Cohaerence of the vvhole Discourse, as
much of them as conveniently may be, shall be included in [ ] Paratheses. I. I agree with the generality of Phi∣losophers so far, as to allow, that there is one Catholick or Universal Matter common to all Bodies, by which I mean a Substance extended, divisible and impenetrable. II. But because this Matter being in its own Nature but one, the diversity we see in Bodies must necessarily arise from somewhat else, then the Matter they consist of. And since we see not, how there could be any change in Mat∣ter, if all its (actual or designable) parts were perpetually at rest among them∣selves, it will follow, that to discrimi∣nate the Catholick Matter into variety of Natural Bodies, it must have Moti∣on in some or all its designable Parts: and that Motion must have various tendencies, that which is in this part of the Matter tending one way, and that which is in that part tending another;
as we plainly see in the Universe or ge∣neral Mass of Matter there is really a great quantity of Motion, and that va∣riously determin'd, and that yet diverse portions of Matter are at rest. That there is Local Motion in many parts of Matter is manifest to sense, but how Matter came by this Motion was of Old, and is still hotly disputed of: for the antient Corpuscularian Philosophers, (whose doctrine in most other points, though not in all, we are the most incli∣nable to,) not acknowledging an Author of the Universe, were thereby reduc'd to make Motion congenite to Matter, and consequently coëval with it; but since Local Motion, or an Endeavour at it, is not included in the nature of Mat∣ter, which is as much Matter, when it rests, as when it moves; and since we see, that the same portion of Matter may from Motion be reduc'd to Rest, and after it hath continu'd at Rest, as long as other Bodies doe not put it out
of that state, may by external Agents be set a moving again; I, who am not wont to think a man the worse Natura∣list for not being an Atheist, shall not scruple to say with an Eminent Philoso∣pher of Old, whom I find to have pro∣pos'd among the Greeks that Opinion (for the main) that the Excellent Des Cartes hath revived amongst Us, That the Origine of Motion in Matter is from God; and not onely so, but that think∣ing it very unfit to be believ'd, that Matter barely put into Motion, and then left to it self, should Casually con∣stitute this beautiful and orderly World: I think also further, that the wise Author of Things did by establish∣ing the laws of Motion among Bodies, and by guiding the first Motions of the small parts of Matter, bring them to convene after the manner requisite to compose the World, and especially did contrive those curious and elaborate Engines, the bodies of living Crea∣tures,
endowing most of them with a power of propagating their Species. But though these things are my Perswa∣sions, yet because they are not necessa∣ry to be suppos'd here, where I doe not pretend to deliver any compleat Dis∣course of the Principles of Natural Phi∣lophy, but onely to touch upon such Notions, as are requisite to explicate the Origine of Qualities and Forms, I shall pass on to what remains, as soon as I have taken notice, that Local Mo∣tion seems to be indeed the Principl a∣mongst Second Causes, and the Grand A∣gent of all that happens in Nature: For though Bulk, Figure, Rest, Situation, and Texture do concurre to the Phaeno∣mena of Nature, yet in comparison of Motion they seem to be in many Cases, Effects, and in many others, little bet∣ter then Conditions, or Requisites, or Causes sine quibus non, which modifie the operation, that one part of Matter by vertue of its Motion hath upon a∣nother:
as in a Watch, the number, the figure, and coaptation of the Wheels and other parts is requisite to the shew∣ing the hour, and doing the other things that may be perform'd by the Watch; but till these parts be actually put into Motion, all their other affections re∣maine inefficacious: and so in a Key, though if it were too big, or too little, or if its Shape were incongruous to that of the cavity of the Lock, it would be un∣fit to be us'd as a Key, though it were put into Motion; yet let its bigness and figure be never so fit, unless actual Mo∣tion intervene, it will never lock or un∣lock any thing, as without the like a∣ctual Motion, neither a Knife nor Rasor will actually cut, how much soever their shape & other Qualities may it them to do so. And so Brimstone, what disposi∣tion of Parts soever it have to be turn'd into Flame, would never be kindled, unless some actual fire, or other parcel of vehemently and variously agitated
Matter should put the Sulphureous Corpuscles into a very brisk motion. III. These two grand and most Ca∣tholick Principles of Bodies, Matter, and Motion, being thus establish'd, it will follow both, that Matter must be actually divided into Parts, that being the genuine Effect of variously deter∣min'd Motion, and that each of the pri∣mitive Fragments, or other distinct and entire Masses of Matter must have two Attributes, its own Magnitude, or ra∣ther Size, and its own Figure or Shape. And since Experience shews us (espe∣cially that which is afforded us by Chy∣mical Operations, in many of which Matter is divided into Parts, too small to be singly sensible,) that this divi∣sion of Matter is frequently made into insensible Corpuscles or Particles, we may conclude, that the minutest frag∣ments, as well as the biggest Masses of the Universal Matter are likewise en∣dowed each with its peculiar Bulk and
Shape. For being a finite Body, its Dimensions must be terminated and measurable: and though it may change its Figure, yet for the same reason it must necessarily have some Figure or other. So that now we have found out, and must admit three Essential Proper∣ties of each entire or undivided, though insensible part of Matter, namely, Mag∣nitude, (by which I mean not quantity in general, but a determin'd quantity, which we in English oftentimes call the Size of a bodie,) Shape, and either Mo∣tion or Rest, (for betwixt them two there is no mean:) the two first of which may be called inseparable Acci∣dents of each distinct part of Matter: in∣separable, because being extended, and yet finite, it is Physically impossible, that it should be devoid of some Bulk or other, and som determinate Shape or other; and yet Accidents, because that whether or no the Shape can by Physi∣cal Agents be alter'd or the Body subdi∣vided,
yet mentally both the one and the other may be done, the whole essence of Matter remaining undestroy'd. Whether these Accidents may not conveniently enough be call'd the Moods or primary affections of Bodies, to distinguish them from those lesse simple Qualities, (as Colours, Tastes, and Odours,) that belong to Bodies u∣pon their account, or whether with the Epicureans they may not be called the Conjuncts of the smallest parts of Mat∣ter, I shall not now stay to consider, but one thing the Modern Schools are wont to teach concerning Accidents, which is too repugnant to our present Doctrine, to be in this place quite omit∣ted, namely that there are in Natural Bodies store of real Qualities, and o∣ther real Accidents, which not onely are no Moods of Matter, but are real Entities distinct from it, and according to the doctrine of many modern Schoolmen may exist separate from all
Matter whatsoever. To clear this point a little, we must take notice, that Accident is among Logicians and Phi∣losophers us'd in two several senses, for sometimes it is oppos'd to the 4th Prae∣dicable, (Property,) and is then defin'd, "that which may be present or absent, without the destruction of the subject; as a Man may be sick or well, and a Wall white or not white, and yet the one be still a Man, the other a Wall; and this is call'd in the Schools Accidens praedicabile, to distinguish it from what they call Accidens praedicamentale, which is oppos'd to Substance: for when things are divided by Logicians into 10 Praedicaments, or highest genuses of things, Substance making one of them, all the nine other are of Accidents. And as Substance is commonly defin'd to be a thing that subsists of it self, and is the subject of Accidents, (or more plainly, a real Entity or thing, that needs not any (created) Being, that it may exist:)
so an Accident is said commonly to be id cujus esse est inesse, and therefore A∣ristotle, who usually calls Substances simply , Entities, most commonly calls Accidents , Entities of Entities. These needing the existence of some substance or other, in which they may be, as in their subject of Inhae∣sion. And because Logicians make it the discriminating note of Substance, and Accident, that the former is a thing that cannot be in another, as in its sub∣ject of Inhaesion, tis requisite to know, that according to them, That is said to Be in a Subject, which hath these three conditions, That however it (1) be in another thing, (2) is not in it as a part, and (3) cannot exist separately from the thing or subject, wherein it is: as a white Wall is the subject of Inhaesion of the Whiteness we see in it, which self-same whiteness though it be not in the wall as a part of it, yet cannot the self-same whiteness according to our Logi∣cians
exist any where out of the wall, though many other Bodies may have the like degree of whiteness. This pre∣mis'd, twill not be hard to discover the falsity of the lately mentioned Schola∣stick opinion touching real Qualities and Accidents, their doctrine about which does, I confess, appear to me to be either unintelligible, or manifestly contradictious: for speaking in a Physi∣cal sense, if they will not allow these Accidents to be Modes of Matter, but Entities really distinct from it, and in some cases separable from all Matter, they make them indeed Accidents in name, but represent them under such a notion as belongs onely to Substances; the nature of a Substance consisting in this, That it can subsist of it selfe, with∣out being in any thing else, as in a sub∣ject of Inhaesion: so that to tell us, that a Quality, or other Accident may sub∣sist without a subject, is indeed, whate∣ver they please to call it, to allow it the
true Nature of Substance, nor will their Groundlesse Distinctions do any more then keep them from seeming to con∣tradict themselves in words, whilst Un∣prepossess'd persons see that they do it in effect. Nor could I ever find it in∣telligibly made out, what these real Qualities may be, that they deny to be either Matter or modes of Matter, or immaterial Substances. When a Bowl runs along or lies still, that Motion or Rest, or Globous figure of the Bowl, is not Nothing, and yet it is not any part of the Bowl; whose whole Substance would remain, though it wanted which you please of these Accidents: and to make them real and physical Entities, (for we have not here to do either with Logical or Metaphysical ones) is, as if, because we may consider the same Man sitting, standing, running, thirsty, hun∣grie, wearie, &c. we should make each of these a distinct Entitie, as we do give some of them (as hunger, weariness, &c.)
distinct names. Whereas the subject of all these Qualities is but the same Man as he is considered with Circum∣stances, that make him appear different in one case from what he appears in a∣nother: And it may be very useful to our present Scope to observe, that not onely diversity of Names, but even di∣versity of Definitions, doth not alwaies infer a diversity of Physical Entities in the Subject, whereunto they are attri∣buted. For it happens in many of the Physical Attributes of a Body, as in those Other cases, wherein a Man that is a Father, a Husband, a Master, a Prince, &c. may have a Peculiar Defi∣nition (such as the Nature of the thing will bear) belong unto him in each of these Capacities, and yet the Man in himself considered is but the same Man, who in respect of differing Capacities or Relations to other things is call'd by differing Names, and describ'd by vari∣ous Definitions, which yet (as I was
saying) conclude not so many real and distinct Entities in the person so vari∣ously denominated. An EXCƲRSION about the Relative Nature of Phy∣sical Qualities. BUt because I take this Notion to be of no Small Importance towards the Avoiding of the Grand Mistake, that hath hitherto obtain'd about the Nature of Qualities, it will be worth while to Illustrate it a little farther. We may consider then, that when Tubal-Cain, or whoever else were the Smith, that Invented Locks and Keyes, had made his first Lock, (for we may Reasonably suppose him to have made that before the Key, though the Com∣parison
may be made use of without that Supposition,) That was onely a Piece of Iron, contriv'd into such a Shape; and when afterwards he made a Key to that Lock, That also in it self Consider'd, was nothing but a Piece of Iron of such a Determinate Figure: but in Regard that these two Pieces of Iron might now be Applied to one another after a Certain manner, and that there was a Congruitie betwixt the Wards of the Lock and those of the Key, the Lock and the Key did each of them now Obtain a new Capacity and it be∣came a Main part of the Notion and Description of a Lock, that it was ca∣pable of being made to Lock or Un∣lock by that other Piece of Iron we call a Key, and it was Lookd upon as a Pe∣culiar Faculty and Power in the Key, that it was Fitted to Open and Shut the Lock, and yet by these new Attributes there was not added any Real or Physi∣cal Entity, either to the Lock, or to the
Key, each of them remaining indeed nothing, but the same Piece of Iron, just so Shap'd as it was before. And when our Smith made other Keyes of differing Bignesses, or with Differing Wards, though the first Lock was not to be open'd by any of those Keyes, yet that Indisposition, however it might be Consider'd as a peculiar Power of Resi∣sisting this or that Key, and might serve to Discriminate it sufficiently from the Locks those Keyes belong'd to, was nothing new in the Lock, or distinct from the Figure it had before those Keyes were made. To carrie this Com∣parison a little Further, let me adde, that though one that would have De∣fin'd the First Lock, and the First Key, would have Given them distinct Defi∣nitions with Reference to each other; and yet (as I was saying) these Defini∣tions being given but upon the Score o Certain Respects, which the Defin'd Bodies had One to Another, would no
infer, that these two Iron Instruments did Physically differ otherwise then in the Figure, Size, or Contrivement of the Iron, whereof each of them consi∣sted. And proportionably hereunto I do not see, why we may not conceive, That as to those Qualities (for Instan∣ce) which we call Sensible, though by virtue of a certain Congruity or Incon∣gruity in point of Figure or Texture, (or other Mechanical Attributes,) to our Sensories, the Portions of Matter they Modifie are enabled to produce various Effects, upon whose account we make Bodies to be Endow'd with Qua∣lities; yet They are not in the Bodies that are Endow'd with them any Real or Distinct Entities, or differing from the Matter its self, furnish'd with such a Determinate Bigness, Shape, or o∣ther Mechanical Modifications. Thus though the modern Gold-Smiths and Refiners reckon amongst the most di∣stinguishing Qualities of Gold, by which
men may be certain of its being True and not Sophisticated, that is easily dis∣soluble in Aqua Regis, and that Aqua Fortis will not work upon it; yet these Attributes are not in the Gold any thing distinct from its peculiar Texture, not is the Gold we have now of any other Nature, then it was in Pliny's time, when Aqua Fortis and Aqua Regis had not been Found out, (at least in these parts of the World,) and were utterly unknown to the Roman Gold-Smiths And this Example I have the rather pitch'd upon, because it affords me an Opportunity to represent, that, unless we admit the Doctrine I have been Pro∣posing, we must Admit, that a Body may have an almost Infinite Number o New Real Entities accruing to it, with∣out the Intervention of any Physic Change in the Body its self. As for Example, Gold was the same Natur Body immediately before Aqua Regi and Aqua Fortis were first made, as it
was immediately after, and yet now 'tis reckon'd amongst its Principal Proper∣ties, that it is dissoluble by the Former of those two Menstruums, and that it is not like other Mettals Dissoluble or Corrodible by the Latter. And if one should Invent another Menstruum, (as possibly I may Think my self Master of such a one) that will but in part dissolve pure Gold, and change some part of it into another Metalline Body, there will then arise another new Property; where∣by to distinguish That from other Met∣tals; and yet the Nature of Gold is not a whit other now, then it was before this last Menstruum was first made. There are some Bodies not Cathartick, nor Sudorifick, with some of which Gold being joyn'd acquires a Purgative Vertue, and with others a power to pro∣cure Sweat; and in a word, Nature her self doth, sometimes otherwise, and sometimes by Chance, produce so many things, that have new Relations unto o∣thers:
And Art, especially assisted by Chymistry, may, by variously dissipa∣ting Natural Bodies, or Compound∣ing either them, or their Constituent Parts with one another, make such an Innumerable Company of new Produ∣ctions, that will each of Them have new operations, either immediately upon our Sensories, or upon other Bodies, whose Changes we are able to perceive, that no man can know, but that the most Familiar Bodies may have Multitudes of Qualities, that he dreams not of, and a Considering man will hardly imagine, that so numerous a Croud of real Phy∣sical Entities can accrue to a Body, whilst in the Judgment of all our Sen∣ses it remains Unchang'd, and the Same that 'twas before. To clear this a little farther, we may adde, that beaten Glass is commonly reckon'd among Poisons; and (to skip what is mention'd out of Sanctorius, of the Dysentery procur'd by the Frag∣ments
of it) I remember Cardan: Contradict. 9. lib. 2. Tract. 5. a pud Schenckium.Cardan hath a story, That in a Cloister, where he had a Patient then like to die of tor∣ments in the Stomach, two other Nuns had been already kill'd by a distracted Woman, that having Casually got Free, had mixt beaten Glass with Pease, that were eaten by these three, and diverse others of the Sisters (who yet escap'd unharm'd.) Now though the powers of Poisons be not onely look'd upon as real Qualities, but are reckoned among the Abstrusest ones: yet this Deleterious Faculty, which is suppos'd to be a Pe∣culiar and Superadded Entitie in the beaten Glasse, is really nothing distinct from the Glass its self, (which though a Concrete made up of those Innocent Ingredients, Salt and Ashes, is yet a hard and stiffe Body,) as it is furnish'd with that determinate Bigness, and Fi∣gure of Parts, which have been acquir'd
by Comminution. For these Glassy Fragments being many, and Rigid, and somewhat Small, (without yet being so small as Dust,) and endow'd with sharp Points and cutting Edges, are ena∣bled by these Mechanical Affections to Pierce or Wound the tender Mem∣branes of the Stomach and Guts, and cut the slender Vessels that they meet with there, whereby naturally ensue great Gripings and Contorsions of the injur'd Parts, and oftentimes Bloudy Fluxes occasion'd by the perforation of the Capillary Arteries, and the great irritation of the Expulsive Faculty, and sometimes also not onely horrid Con∣vulsions by Consent of the Brain and Cerebellum, with some of the Nervous or Membranous parts that happen to be hurt, but also Dropsies occasioned by the great loss of Bloud we were just now speaking of. And it agrees very well with this Conjecture, that beaten Glass hath diverse times been observ'd
to have done no Mischief to Animals that have swallowed it: For there is no Reason it should, in case the Corpuscles of the Powder either chance to be so small, as not to be fit to wound the Guts, which are usually lin'd with a sli∣my substance, wherein very minute Powders may be as it vvere sheath'd, and by that means hinder'd from hurt∣ing the Guts, (insomuch that a frag∣ment of Glass vvith three very sharp corners, hath been observ'd to have for above eighteen Months lain This memorable Accident happen'd to a Senator of Brne, who was cur'd by the Experienc'd Fabricius Hildanus, that gives a long Account of it to the Lear∣ned Horstius, among whose Observatons tis extant; (Lib. 2. observ. 35.) who ascribes the Indolence of the Part, whilst uncompress'd, to some slimy Juice, (fami∣liar enough to those Tendinous parts,) wherein the Glassy fragment was as it were Bedded. inoffen∣sive even in a nervous and very sensible part of the body,) out of vvhich they may with the grosser Excrements of the Lower Belly be harmelesly Excluded,
especially in some Individuals, whose Guts and Stomach too may be of a much stronger Texture, and better Lin'd or Stuff'd with Gross and Slimy Matter, then those of others. And ac∣cordingly we see, that the Fragments of Saphires, Christals, and ev'n Rubies, which are much harder then Glass, are innocently, though perhaps not very effectually us'd by Physicians, (and I have several times taken That without Inconvenience) in Cordial Compositi∣ons, because of their being by Grinding reduc'd to a Powder too Subtle to Ex∣coriate, or Grate upon the Stomach, or Guts; and probably 'twas upon some such Account, that That happen'd which is related by Cardan in the same place, namely, That though the three Nuns we have been speaking of were Poison'd by the Glass, yet many others who eat of the other Portions of the same mingled Pease, receiv'd no mis∣chief thereby. (But of this subject
more In those Notes about Occult Qualitles, where the Deleterious Faculty attributed to Diamonds is conside∣red. elsewhere.) And this puts me in mind to adde, That the Multiplicity of Qualities, that are sometimes to be met with in the same Natural Bodies, needs not make men reject the Opinion we have been proposing, by perswading them, that so many Differing Attributes, as may be sometimes found in one and the same Natural Body, cannot proceed from the bare Texture, and other Mechani∣cal Affections of its Matter. For we must consider each Body, not barely as it is in it self an entire and distinct porti∣on of Matter, but as it is a Part of the Universe, and consequently plac'd a∣mong a great Number and Variety of other Bodies, upon which it may Act, and by which it may be acted on, in ma∣ny waies, (or upon many Accounts,) each of which Men are wont to Fancy,
as a distinct Power or Quality in the Body, by which those Actions, or in which those Passions are produc'd. For if we thus consider Things, we shall not much wonder, that a Portion of Matter, that is indeed endow'd but with a very few Mechanical Affections, as such a determinate Texture and Motion, but is plac'd among a multitude of other Bodies, that differ in those Attributes from it, and one another, should be ca∣pable of having a great Number and Variety of Relations to those other Bo∣dies, and consequently should be thought to have many Distinct In∣haerent Qualities, by such as look upon those several Relations or Respects it may have to Bodies without it, as Real and Distinct Entities implanted in the Body it self. When a Curious Watch is going, though the Spring be that which puts all the Parts into Motion, yet we do not Fancie (as an Indian o Chinois would perchance do) in this
Spring one Faculty to move the Index uniformely round the Dial-plate, ano∣ther to strike the Hour, and perhaps a Third to give an Alarme, or shew the Age of the Moon, or the Tides; all the action of the Spring, (which is but a fle∣xible piece of Steel, forcibly coil'd to∣gether,) being but an Endeavour to di∣late or unbind its self, and the rest be∣ing perform'd by the various Respects it hath to the several Bodies (that com∣pose the Watch) among which it is plac'd, and which they have One to a∣nother. We all know, that the Sun hath a power to Harden Clay, and Sof∣ten Wax, and Melt Butter, and Thaw Ice, and turn Water into Vapours, and make Air expand it self in Weather-Glasses, and contribute to Blanch Lin∣nen, and make the White skin of the Face Swarthy, and Mowed Grass Yel∣low, and ripen Fruit, hatch the Eggs of Silk-worms, Caterpillars, and the like Insects, and perform I know not how
many other things, divers of which seen contrary Effects, and yet these are not distinct Powers or Faculties in the Sun but onely the Productions of its Heat▪ (which it self is but the brisk, and con∣fus'd Local Motion of the Minute parts of a Body,) diversify'd by the differing Textures of the Body that it chances to work upon, and the Condition of the o∣ther Bodies that are concern'd in the Operation. And therefore whether the Sun in some cases have any Influ∣ence at all distinct from its Light and Heat, we see, that all those Phaenomen we have thought fit to name are produ∣cible by the heat of the common Culi∣nary Fire duly apply'd and regulated. And so, to give an Instance of another Kind, when some years since, to Try some Experiments about the Propaga∣tion of Motion, with Bodies less capa∣ble of being batter'd by one another, then those that have been formerly im∣ploy'd; I caus'd some solid Bals of Iron
skilfully harden'd, and exquisitely shap'd and glaz'd, to be purposely made; each of these polished Balls was a Sphaerical Looking-Glass, which plac'd in the mid'st of a Room, would exhibit the Images of the Objects round about it, in a very regular and pleasing Per∣spective. It would Contract the Image, and Reflect the Beams of the Sun, after a manner differing from Flat and from Convex Looking Glasses. It would in a neat Perspective lessen the Image of him that look'd upon it; and bend it, and it would shew that Image, as if it were behind the Surface, and within the solid substance of the Sphaere, and in some it had all those Distinct, and some of them wonderful Properties, which either Antient or Modern Writers of Catoptricks have demonstrated to be∣long to Sphaerical Specula, as such: and yet the Globe furnish'd with all these Properties and Affections, was but the Iron it self reduc'd by the Artificer to
a Sphaerical Figure, (for the Glass, that made it Specular, was not distinct from the Superficial parts of the Iron, re∣duc'd all of them to a Physically equal distance from the Center.) And of Specula, Sphaerical enough as to sense, you may make store in a trice, by break∣ing a large Drop of Quick-silver into several little ones, each of which will serve for Objects plac'd pretty near it, and the smaller of which (being the least depress'd in the middle by the own weight, and consequently more perfectly Globous,) may with a goo Microscope plac'd in a Window affor you no unpleasant prospect of the neigh¦bouring Objects, and yet to reduce parcel of Stagnant Quicksilver, which will much aemulate a Flat Looking Glass, into many of these little Sphaeri¦cal Specula, whose Properties are so dif¦fering from those of Plain ones, the intervenes nothing but a sleight Loc Motion, which in the twinckling of
Eye changeth the Figure of the self same Matter. I have said thus much (Pyrophilus) to remove the Mistake, That every thing men are wont to call a Quality, must needs be a Real and Physical Entity, because of the Importance of the Sub∣ject; and yet I have omitted some things that might have been pertinently added, partly because I may hereafter have Opportunity to take them in, and part∣ly because I would not any farther lengthen this Excursion, which yet I must not Conclude, till I have added this short Advertisement. That I have chosen to Declare what I mean by Qualities, rather by Exam∣ples, then Definitions, partly because being immediately or reductively the Objects of sense, Men generally under∣stand pretty well what one another mean, when they are spoken of: (As to say, that the Tast of such a thing is Sa∣line or Sowr, or that such a Sound is
Melodious, Shrill, or Jarring, (especially if when we speak of Sensible Qualities, we adde some Enumeration of particu∣lar Subjects, wherein they do the most Eminently reside,) will make a Man as soon understood, as if he should go a∣bout to give Logical Definitions of those Qualities:) and partly because the Notions of things are not yet so well stated, and agreed on, but that it is ma∣ny times difficult to Assign their true Genus's: and Aristotle himself doth not onely define Accidents without setting down their Genus, but when he comes to define Qualities, he tels us, that Qua∣lity is that by which a thing is said to be Qualis, where I would have you take notice both, that in his Definition he o∣mits the Genus, and that 'tis no such ea¦sy Thing to give a very good Definiti¦on of Qualities, since he that is repute the great Master of Logick, where he pretends to give us one, doth but upo the matter define the thing by the same
thing; for 'tis suppos'd to be as little known what Qualis is, as what Qualitas is, and me thinks he does just as if I should define Whiteness to be that, for which a thing is called White, or Ver∣tue, that for which a Man is said to be Vertuous Since the writing of this, the Author found, that some of the Eminentest of the modern Schoolmen themselves, have been, as well as he, unsatisfied with the Aristotelian Definition of Quality: concerning which (not to mention Revius, a Learned Protestant. Anno∣tato upon Suaez.) Ariaga sayes (disp. 5. sect. 2. subs. 1.) Per haec nhil explicatur; nam de hoc quaerimus, quid sit esse qual, dices habere qualitatem; bonus Circulus: qua∣litas est id quo quis sit qualis, & esse qualem est habere Qualitatem. And even the famous Jesuit Suarez, though he endeavours to excuse it, yet confesseth, that it leaves the proper Notion of Quality as obscure to us as before: (Quae dfinitio, saith he, licèt a ration essen∣talis videatur, quod detur per habitudinem ad effectum formalem, quem omnis Foma esstialiter respicit, tamen quod ad nos spectat, aquè obscura nobis manet propria ra∣tio Qualitatis.) Suarez Disputat. Metaphysic. 42. But Hurtadus (n his Metaphysical Disputations) speaks moe boldly, telling us roundly, that it is Non tam Definitio, quàm inanis quaedam Nugatio, which makes me the moe wonder, that a famous Cartesian (whom I forbear to name) should content himself to give us such an Insig∣nificant, or t least Superficial Definition of Quality.. Besides that, I much
doubt, whether his Definition be not Untrue as well as Obscure, for to the Question, Qualis res est? Answer may be return'd out of some, if not all of the other Praedicaments of Accidents: which some of the Modern Logicians being aware of, they have endeavoured to salve the matter with certain Cautions and Limitations, which however they may argue the Devisors to be ingeni∣ous, do, for ought I can discern, leave us still to seek for a right and intelligi∣ble Definition of Quality in general, though to give such a one be probably a much easier Task, then to define ma∣ny Qualities, that may be nam'd in par∣ticular, as Saltness, Sowrness, Green, Blew, and many others, which when we hear nam'd, every man knows what is meant by them, though no man (th I know of) hath been able to give ac∣curate Definitions of them. IV. And if we should conceive, th
all the rest of the Universe were annihi∣lated, except any of these entire and undivided Corpuscles, (treated of in the 3d Particular foregoing,) it is hard to say what could be attributed to it, be∣sides Matter, Motion (or Rest,) Bulk, and Shape, (whence by the way you may take notice, that Bulk, though u∣sually taken in a Comparative sense, is in our sense an absolute Thing, since a Body would have it, though there were no other in the World.) But now there being actually in the Universe great Multitudes of Corpuscles ming∣led among themselves, there arise in any distinct portion of Matter, which a number of them make up, two new Accidents or Events: the one doth more relate to each particular Corpus∣cle in reference to the (really or suppo∣sedly) stable Bodies about it, namely its Posture; (whether Erected, Inclin'd, or Horizontal:) And, when two or more of such Bodies are plac'd one by
anorher, the manner of their being so plac'd, as one besides another, or one behind another, may be call'd their Order; as I remember, Aristotle in his Metaphysicks, lib. 1. cap. 4. recites this Example out of the antient Corpuscu∣larians, That A and N differ in Figure, and A N and N A in Order, Z and N in Scituation: and indeed Posture and Order seem both of them reducible to Scituation. And when many Corpus∣cles do so convene together as to com∣pose any distinct Body, as a Stone, or a Mettal, then from their other Accidents (or Modes,) and from these two last mention'd, there doth emerge a certain Disposition or Contrivance of Parts in the whole, which we may call the Tex∣ture of it. V. And if we should conceive all the rest of the Universe to be annihila∣ted, save one such Body, suppose a Met∣tal or a Stone, it were hard to shew, tha there is Physically any thing more in it
then Matter, and the Accidents we have already named. But now we are to consider, that there are de facto in the world certain sensible and rational Be∣ings, that we call Men, and the body of Man having several of its external parts, as the Eye, the Ear, &c. each of a di∣stinct and peculiar Texture, whereby it is capable to receive Impressions from the Bodies about it, and upon that ac∣count it is call'd an Organ of Sense, we must consider, I say, that these Senso∣ries may be wrought upon by the Fi∣gure, Shape, Motion, and Texture of Bodies without them, after several waies, some of those External Bodies being fitted to affect the Eye, others the Ear, others the Nostrils, &c. And to these Operations of the Objects on the Sensories, the Mind of Man, which up∣on the account of its Union with the Body perceives them, giveth distinct Names, calling the one Light or Co∣lour, the other Sound, the other Odour,
&c. And because also each Organ of Sense, as the Eye, or the Palat, may be it self differingly affected by Exter∣nal Objects, the Mind likewise gives the Objects of the same Sense distinct Appellations, calling one colour Green, the other Blew, and one tast Sweet, and another Bitter, &c. Whence Men have been induc'd to frame a long Catalogue of such Things as, for their relating to our Senses, we call Sensible Qualities; and because we have been conversant with them, before we had the use of Reason, and the Mind of Man is prone to conceive almost every Thing (nay even Privations, as Blindness, Death, &c.) under the notion of a true Entitie or Substance as it self is, we have been from our Infancy apt to imagine, that these Sensible Qualities are Real Be∣ings, in the Objects they denominate, and have the faculty or power to work such and such things; as Gravity hath a power to stop the motion of a Bullet
shot upwards, and carry that solid Globe of Matter toward the Center of the Earth, whereas indeed (according to what we have largely shewn above) there is in the Body, to which these Sensible Qualities are attributed, no∣thing of Real and Physical, but the Size, Shape, and Motion, or Rest of its com∣ponent Particles, together with that Texture of the whole, which results from their being so contriv'd as they are; nor is it necessary they should have in them any thing more, like to the Ideas they occasion in us, those Ideas being either the Effects of our Praeju∣dices, or Inconsiderateness, or else to be fetcht from the Relation, that happens to be betwixt those Primary Accidents of the Sensible Object, and the peculiar Texture of the Organ it affects; as when a Pin, being run into my Finger, causeth pain, there is no distinct Quality in the Pin answerable to what I am apt to fan∣cie Pain to be, but the Pin in it self is
onely slender, stiff, and sharp, and by those qualities happens to make a So∣lution of Continuity in my Organ of Touching, upon which, by reason of the Fabrick of the Body, and the inti∣mate Union of the Soul with it, there a∣riseth that troublesome kind of Percep∣tion which we call Pain, and I shall anon more particularly shew, how much that depends upon the peculiar fabrick of the Body. VI. But here I foresee a Difficulty, which being perhaps the chiefest, that we shall meet with against the Corpus∣cular Hypothesis, it will deserve to be, before we proceed any farther, taken notice of. And it is this, that, whereas we explicate Colours, Odours, and the like sensible Qualities by a relation to our Senses, it seems evident, that they have an absolute Being irrelative to Us; for, Snow (for instance) would be white, and a glowing Coal would be hot, though there were no Man or any other
Animal in the World: and 'tis plain, that Bodies do not onely by their Qua∣lities work upon Our senses, but upon other, and those, Inanimate Bodies; as the Coal will not onely heat or burn a Man's hand if he touch it, but would likewise heat Wax, (even so much as to melt it, and make it slow,) and thaw Ice into Water, though all the Men, and sensitive Beings in the World were an∣nihilated. To clear this Difficulty, I have several things to represent, and, 1. I say not, that there are no other Accidents in Bodies then Colours, O∣dours, and the like; for I have already taught, that there are simpler and more Primitive Affections of Matter, from which these Secondary Qualities, if I may so call them, do depend: and that the Operations of Bodies upon one ano∣ther spring from the same, we shall see by and by. 2. Nor do I say, that all Qualities of Bodies are directly Sensible; but I ob∣serve,
that when one Body works upon another, the knowledg we have of their Operation, proceeds, either from some sensible Quality, or some more Catho∣lick affection of Matter, as Motion, Rest, or Texture, generated or destroy'd in one of them; for else it is hard to con∣ceive, how we should come to discover what passes betwixt them. 3. We must not look upon every di∣stinct Body, that works upon our Sen∣ses, as a bare lump of Matter of that bigness and outward shape, that it ap∣pears of; many of them having their parts curiously contriv'd, and most of them perhaps in motion too. No must we look upon the Universe that surrounds us, as upon a moveless and un∣distinguish'd Heap of Matter, but as upon a great Engine, which, having either no Vacuity, or none that is consi∣derable, betwixt its parts (known to us,) the actions of particular Bodies up∣on one another must not be barely aesti∣mated,
as if two Portions of Matter of their Bulk and Figure were plac'd in some imaginary Space beyond the World, but as being scituated in the World, constituted as it now is, and consequently as having their action up∣on each other liable to be promoted, or hindred, or modify'd by the Acti∣ons of other Bodies besides them: as in a Clock, a small force apply'd to move the Index to the Figure of 12, will make the Haromer strike often and forcibly a∣gainst the Bell, and will make a far grea∣ter Commotion among the Wheels and Weights, then a far greater force would do, if the Texture and Contri∣vance of the Clock did not abundantly contribute to the Production of so great an Effect. And in agitating Water in∣to Froth, the Whiteness would never be produc'd by that Motion, were it not that the Sun, or other Lucid Body, shi∣ning upon that Aggregate of small Bubbles, enables them to reflect confu∣sedly
great store of little, and as it were contiguous lucid images to the Eye. And so the giving to a large Metalline Speculum a Concave figure, would ne∣ver enable it to set Wood on fire, and even to melt down Mettals readily, if the Sun beams, that in Cloudless dayes do, as to sense, fill the Air, were not by the help of that Concavity, thrown toge∣ther to a Point. And to shew You by an eminent Instance, how various and how differing Effects the Same action of a Natural Agent may produce, according to the several Dispositions of the Bo∣dies it works upon, do but consider, that in two Eggs, the one Prolifick, the othe Barren, the sense can perhaps distinguish before Incubation no difference at all▪ and yet these Bodies, outwardly so like, do so differ in the internal disposition of their parts, that if they be both ex∣pos'd to the same degree of Heat, (whe∣ther of a Hen, or an Artificial Oven,) that Heat will change the one into a pu∣trid
and stinking Substance, and the o∣ther into a Chick, furnish'd with great variety of Organical parts of very diffe∣ring consistences, and curious as well as differing Textures. 4. I do not deny, but that Bodies may be said, in a very favourable sense, to have those Qualities we call Sensible, though there were no Animals in the World: for a Body in that case may dif∣fer from those Bodies, which now are quite devoid of Quality, in its having such a disposition of its Constituent Corpuscles, that in case it were duely apply'd to the Sensory of an Animal, it would produce such a sensible Quali∣ty, which a Body of another Texture would not; as though if there were no Animals, there would be no such thing as Pain, yet a Pin may upon the account of its Figure be fitted to cause pain, in case it were mov'd against a Man's fin∣ger; whereas a Bullet, or other blunt Body mov'd against it with no greater
force, will not cause any such percepti∣on of pain. And thus Snow, though if there were no Lucid Body nor Organ of Sight in the World, it would exhibit no Colour at all, (for I could not find it had any in places exactly darkned,) yet it hath a greater disposition then a Coal or Soot to reflect store of Light outwards, when the Sun shines upon them all three. And so we say, that a Lute is in tune, whether it be actually plaid upon or no, if the Strings be all so duly stretcht, as that it would appear to be in Tune, if it were play'd upon. But as if You should thrust a Pin into a man's Finger, both a while before and after his Death, though the Pin be as sharp at one time as at another, and ma∣keth in both cases alike a Solution of Continuity; yet in the former case, the Action of the Pin will produce Pain, and not in the latter, because in this the prick'd Body wants the Soule, and con∣sequently the Perceptive Faculty: so
if there were no Sensitive Beings, those Bodies that are now the Objects of our Senses, would be but dispositively, if I may so speak, endow'd with Colours, Tasts, and the like; and actually but onely with those more Catholick Affe∣ctions of Bodies, Figure, Motion, Tex∣ture, &c. To illustrate this yet a little farther, suppose a Man should beat a Drum at some distance from the mouth of a Cave, conveniently scituated to return the Noise he makes; although Men will presently conclude, that That Cave hath an Echo, and will be apt to fancy upon that account some Real Property in the place, to which the Echo is said to be∣long, and although indeed the same Noise made in many other of the neigh∣bouring places, would not be reflected to the Eare, and consequently would manifest those places to have no Echos; yet to speak Physically of things, this Peculiar Quality or Pro∣perty
we fancy in the Cave, is in It no∣thing else but the Hollowness of its Fi∣gure, whereby 'tis so dispos'd, as when the Air beats against it, to reflect the Motion towards the place whence that Motion began; and that which passeth on this occasion is indeed but this, That the Drum stick falling upon the Drum, makes a Percussion of the Air, and puts that Fluid Body into an Undulating Motion, and the Aery Waves thrust∣ing on one another, 'till they arrive at the hollow Superficies of the Cave, have by reason of its resistance and fi∣gure, their Motion determin'd the con∣trary way, namely backwards towards that part where the Drum was, vvhen it vvas struck; so that in That, vvhich here happens, there intervenes nothing but the Figure of one Body, and the Motion of another, though if a Man's Ear chance to be in the way of these Motions of the Air forwards and back∣vvards, it gives him a Perception of
them, which he calls Sounds; and be∣cause these Perceptions, which are sup∣pos'd to proceed from the same percus∣sion of the Drum, and thereby of the Air, are made at distinct times one after another, That hollow Body, from whence the Last Sound is conceiv'd to come to the Air, is imagin'd to have a peculiar Faculty, upon whose account Men are wont to say, that such a place hath an Echo. 5. And whereas one Body doth often seem to produce in another divers such Qualities, as we call Sensible, which Qualities therefore seem not to need any reference to our Senses, I consider, that when one Inanimate Body works upon another, there is nothing really produc'd by the Agent in the Patient, save some Local Motion of its Parts, or some Change of Texture consequent upon that Motion; and so, if the Pati∣ent come to have any sensible Quality, that it had not before, it acquires it up∣on
the same account, upon which other Bodies have it, and it is but a consequent to this Mechanical Change of Texture, that by means of its Effects upon our Organs of Sense, we are induc'd to attri∣bute this or that sensible Quality to it. As in case a Pin should chance by some inanimate Body to be driven against a Man's Finger, that which the Agent doth, is but to put a sharp and slende Body into such a kind of Motion, an that which the Pin doth, is to pierce in∣to a Body that it meets with, not ha enough to resist its Motion, and so tha upon this there should ensue such a thing as Pain, is but a Consequent, tha superadds nothing of Real to the P that occasions that Pain. So if a piece of Transparent Ice be, by the falling o some heavy and hard Body upon it, bro¦ken into a Gross Powder that look Whitish, the falling Body doth nothing to the Ice but break it into very sma Fragments, lying confusedly upon on
another; though by reason of the Fa∣brick of the World, and of our Eyes, there doth in the day time upon this Comminution, ensue such a kind of copious Reflection of the incident Light to our Eyes, as we call Whitenesse: and when the Sun, by thawing this broken Ice, destroyes the Whiteness of that portion of Matter, and makes it become Diaphanous, which it was not before, it doth no more then alter the Texture of the Component parts, by putting them into Motion, and thereby into a new Order; in which, by reason of the disposition of the Pores intercepted be∣twixt them, they reflect but few of the incident beams of Light, and transmit most of them. Thus when with a Bur∣nisher You polish a rough piece of Sil∣ver, that which is really done, is but the Depression of the little Protuberant parts into one Level with the rest of the Superficies; though upon this Me∣chanical change of the Texture of the
Superficial parts, we Men say, that it hath lost the Quality of Roughness, and acquir'd that of Smoothness, be∣cause that whereas before, the little Ex∣stancies by their Figure resisted a little the Motion of our Finger, and grated upon them a little, our Fingers now meet with no such offensive Resistance. 'Tis true that the Fire doth thaw Ice, and also both make Wax slow, and ena∣ble it to burn a Man's hand, and yet this doth not necessarily argue in it any Inhaerent Quality of Heat, distinct from the Power it hath of putting the smal parts of the Wax into such a Motion as that their Agitation surmounts their Cohaesion; which Motion, together with their Gravity, is enough to make them pro tempore constitute a Fluid Bo∣dy: and Aqua Fortis, without any (sen∣sible) Heat, will make Camphire, cas on it, assume the form of a Liquor di∣stinct from it; as I have try'd, that  strong Fire will also make Camphi
fluid: not to adde, that I know a Liquor, into which certain Bodies being put, when both it Self, (as well as They,) is actually cold, (and consequently when You would not suspect it of an Actual Inhaerent Heat) will not onely speedi∣ly dissipate many of their parts into Smoak, but leave the rest Black, and burnt almost like a Coal. So that though we suppose the Fire to do no more then variously and briskly to agitate the In∣sensible parts of the Wax, That may suffice to make us think the Wax en∣dow'd with a Quality of Heat: because if such an Agitation be greater then that of the Spirit, and other parts of our Or∣gans of Touching, That is enough to produce in us that Sensation we call Heat; which is so much a Relative to the Sensory which apprehends it, that vve see, that the same Lukevvarm Wa∣ter, that is, vvhose Corpuscles are mo∣derately agitated by the Fire, will appear hot to one of a Man's hands, if That be
very cold; and cold to the other, in case it be very hot, though both of them be the same Man's hands. To be short, if we fancy any two of the Bodies about us, as a Stone, a Mettal, &c. to have nothing at all to do with any other Body in the Universe, 'tis not easy to conceive, either how one can act upon the other, but by Local Motion (of the whole Body, or its Corporeal Effluvia;) or how by Motion it can do any more, then put the Parts of the other Body into Motion too, and thereby produce in them a Change of Scituation and Texture, or of some other of its Me∣chanical Affections: though this (Pas∣sive) Body being plac'd among other Bodies in a World constituted as ours now is, and being brought to act upon the most curiously contriv'd Sensories of Animals, may upon both these ac∣counts exhibit many differing sensible Phaenomena; which however we look upon them as distinct Qualities, are con∣sequently
but the Effects of the often mention'd Catholick affections of Mat∣ter, and deducible from the Size, Shape, Motion (or Rest,) Posture, Order, and the resulting Texture of the Insensible parts of Bodies. And therefore though, for shortness of speech, I shall not scru∣ple to make use of the word Qualities, since it is already so generally receiv'd, yet I would be understood to mean them in a sense suitable to the Doctrine above deliver'd. As if I should say, that Roughnesse is apt to grate and offend the Skin, I should mean, that a File or other Body, by having upon its Surface a multitude of little hard and exstant Parts, and of an Angular or sharp Fi∣gure, is qualify'd to work the mention'd Effect: and so if I should say, that Heat melts Mettals, I should mean, that this Fusion is effected by Fire, or some other Body, which by the various and vehe∣ment Motion of its insensible parts, does to us appear Hot. And hence,
(by the way,) I presume You will easi∣ly guess at what I think of the Contro∣versy so hotly disputed of late betwixt two parties of Learned Men, whereof the One would have all Accidents to worke onely in virtue of the Matter they reside in, and the Other would have the Matter to act onely in virtue of its Accidents: for considering, that on the one side, the Qualities, we here speak of, do so depend upon Matter, that they cannot so much as have a Be∣ing but in, and by it; and on the other side, if all Matter were but quite devoid of Motion, (to name now no other Ac∣cidents,) I do not readily conceive, how it could operate at all, I think it is safest to conclude, That neither Matter, nor Qualities apart, but both or them con∣jointly do perform, what we see done by Bodies to one another, according to the Doctrine of Qualities just now de∣liver'd.
(Of the Nature of a Forme.) VII. WE may now advance some∣what farther, and consi∣der, that Men having taken notice, that certain conspicuous Accidents were to be found associated in some Bodies, and other Conventions of Accidents in o∣ther Bodies, they did for conveniency, and for the more expeditious Expressi∣on of their Conceptions agree to distin∣guish them into several Sorts, which they call Genders or Species, according as they referr'd them either upwards to a more Comprehensive sort of Bodies, or downward to a narrower Species, or to Individuals: As, observing many Bo∣dies to agree in being Fusible, Mallea∣ble, Heavy, and the like, they gave to that sort of Body the name of Mettal, which is a Genus in reference to Gold, Silver, Lead, and but a Species in refe∣rence to that sort of mixt Bodies they
call Fossilia. This superior Genus com∣prehending both Mettals, Stones, and diverse other Concretions, though it self be but a Species in respect of Mixt Bodies. Now when any Body is referr'd to any particular Species, (as of a Met∣tal, a Stone, or the like,) because Men have for their Convenience agreed to signifie all the Essentials requisite to constitute such a Body by one Name, most of the Writers of Physicks have been apt to think, that besides the com∣mon Matter of all Bodies, there is but One thing that discriminates it from o∣ther Kinds, and makes it what it is, and this for brevities sake they call a Forme; which, because all the Qualities and o∣ther Accidents of the Body must de∣pend on it, they also imagine to be a ve∣ry Substance, and indeed a kind of Soule, which united to the gross Mat∣ter composes with it a Natural Body, and acts in it by the several Qualities to be found therein, which Men are wont
to ascribe to the Creature so compos'd. But as to this affair, I observe, that if (for Instance) You ask a Man, what Gold is, if he cannot shew you a piece of Gold, and tell You, This is Gold, he will describe it to You as a Body, that is extremely Ponderous, very Mal∣leable and Ductile, Fusible and yet Fixt in the Fire, and of a Yellowish colour: and if You offer to put off to him a piece of Brass for a piece of Gold, he will presently refuse it, and (if he under∣stand Mettals) tell You, that though Your Brass be coloured like it, 'tis not so heavy, nor so malleable, neither will it like Gold resist the utmost brunt of the Fire, or resist Aqua Fortis: and if You ask Men what they mean by a Ruby, or Niter, or a Pearl, they will still make You such Answers, that You may clearly perceive, that whatever Men talk in Theory of Substantial Forms, yet That, upon whose account they really distinguish any one Body
from others, and refer it to this or th Species of Bodies, is nothing but a Aggregate or Convention of such Ac∣cidents, as most men do by a kind of A∣greement (for the Thing is more A∣bitrary then we are aware of) think ne∣cessary or sufficient to make a Portio of the Universal Matter belong to th or that Determinate Genus or Specie of Natural Bodies. And therefore no onely the Generality of Chymists, be diverse Philosophers, and, what is more some Schoolmen themselves, maintai it to be possible to Transmute the ign∣bler Mettals into Gold; which argues that if a Man could bring any Parcel o Matter to be Yellow, and Malleable and Ponderous, and Fixt in the Fire, an upon the Test, and Indissoluble in Aqu Fortis, and in some to have a concur∣rence of all those Accidents, by which Men try True Gold from False, the would take it for True Gold without scruple. And in this case the general∣ty
of Mankind would leave the School-Doctors to dispute, whether being a Factitious Body, (as made by the Chy∣mists art,) it have the Substantial Form of Gold, and would upon the account of the Convention of the freshly menti∣on'd Accidents let it pass Current a∣mongst them, notwithstanding most Mens greater care, not to be deceived in a matter of this nature then in any other. And indeed, since to every Determinate Species of Bodies, there doth belong more then One Quality, and for the most part a concurrence of Many is so Essen∣tial to That sort of Bodies, that the want of any of them is sufficient to ex∣clude it from belonging to that Species: there needs no more to discriminate sufficiently any One kind of Bodies from all the Bodies in the World, that are not of that kind; as the Chymists Luna ixa, which they tell us wants not the Weight, the Malleablenesse, nor the Fixtness, nor any other property of
Gold, except the Yellownesse, (which makes them call it White Gold,) would by reason of that want of Colour be ea∣sily known from true Gold. And you will not wonder at this, if you consider, that those Sphaeres and Parallelopipe∣dons differ but in Shape, yet this diffe∣rence alone is the ground of so many others, that Euclid and other Geome∣tricians have demonstrated, I know not how many Properties of the one, which do no way belong to the other, andAnst. Metaph. lib. 7. cap. 8. A∣ristotle himself somewhere tels us, That a Sphaere is compos'd of Brass and Roundness. And I suppose it would be thought a Man's own fault, if he could not distinguish a Needle from a File, or a Key from a pair of Scissors, though these being all made of Iron, and differing but in Bignesse and Shape, are less remarkably diverse then Natu∣ral Bodies, the most part of which differ from each other in far more Accidents
then Two. Nor need we think that Qualities being but Accidents, they cannot be essential to a Natural Body; for Accident, as I formerly noted, is sometimes oppos'd to Substance, and sometimes to Essence: and though an Accident can be but accidental to Mat∣ter, as it is a Substantial thing, yet it may be essential to this or that particu∣lar Body; as in Aristotle's newly menti∣on'd Example, though Roundness is but Accidental to Brass, yet 'tis Essen∣tial to a Brasen Sphaere; because, though the Brasse were devoid of Roundnesse, (as if it were Cubical, or of any other figure,) it would still be a Corporeal Substance, yet without that Roundness it could not be a Sphaere: wherefore since an Aggregate or Convention of Qualities is enough to make the porti∣on of Matter 'tis found in, what it is, and denominate it of this or that Determi∣nate sort of Bodies; and since those Qualities, as we have seen already, do
themselves proceed from those more Primary and Catholick affections of Matter, Bulk, Shape, Motion or Rest, and the Texture thence resulting, why may we not say, that the Form of a Bo∣dy being made up of those Qualities u∣nited in one Subject, doth likewise con∣sist in such a Convention of those new∣ly nam'd Mechanical Affections of Matter, as is necessary to constitute a Body of that Determinate kind. And so, though I shall for brevities sake retain the word Forme, yet I would be under∣stood to mean by it, not a Real Sub∣stance distinct from Matter, but onely the Matter it self of a Natural Body, consider'd with its peculiar manner of Existence, which I think may not in∣conveniently be call'd either its Specifi∣cal or its Denominating State, or its Es∣sential Modification, or, if you would have me express it in one word, its Stamp: for such a Convention of Acci∣dents is sufficient to perform the Offi∣ces
that are necessarily requir'd in what Men call a Forme, since it makes the Body such as it is, making it appertain to this or that Determinate Species of Bodies, and discriminating it from all other Species of Bodies whatsoever: as for Instance, Ponderousness, Ductility, Fixtnesse, Yellowness, and some other Qualities, concurring in a portion of Matter, do with it constitute Gold, and making it belong to that Species we call Mettals, and to that sort of Mettals we call Gold, do both denominate and discriminate it from Stones, Salts, Mar∣chasites, and all other sorts of Bodies that are not Mettals, and from Silver, Brass, Copper, and all Mettals except Gold. And whereas 'tis said by some, that the Forme also of a Body ought to be the Principle of its Operations, we shall hereafter consider in what sense That is to be admitted or rejected, in the mean time it may suffice us, that even in the Vulgar Philosophy 'tis acknow∣ledg'd,
that Natural Things for the most part operate by their Qualities, as Snow dazles the Eyes by its Whiteness, and Water scatter'd into drops of Rain falls from the Clouds upon the account of its Gravity. To which I shall adde, that how great the power may be, which a Body may exercise by virtue of a single Quality, may appear by the Various and oftentimes Prodigious Effects, which Fire produces by its Heat, when there∣by it melts Mettals, calcines Stones, destroyes whole Woods and Cities &c. And if several Active Qualities conven in one Body, (as that which in our Hy∣pothesis is meant by Forme, usually comprises several of them,) what great things may be thereby perform'd, may be somewhat guess'd at by the strange things we see done by some Engines which, being, as Engins, undoubtedly de∣void of Substantial Forms, must d those strange things they are admir'd for, by virtue of those Accidents, the
Shape, Size, Motion, and Contrivance, of their parts. Not to mention, that in our Hypothesis, besides those Operati∣ons that proceed from the Essential Modification of the Matter, as the Bo∣dy (compos'd of Matter and necessary Accidents) is consider'd per modum uni∣us, as one Entire Corporeal Agent, it may in diverse cases have other O∣perations, upon the account of those particular Corpuscles, which though they concurre to compose it, and are in reference to the whole consider'd but as its parts, may yet retain their own par∣ticular Nature, and diverse of the pecu∣liar Qualities: as in a Watch, besides those things which the Watch performs as such, the several parts whereof it consists, as the Spring, the Wheels, the String, the Pins, &c. may have each of them its peculiar Bulk, Shape, and other Attributes, upon the account of one or more of which, the Wheel or Spring &c. may do other things then
what it doth, as meerly a Constituent part of the Watch. And so in the Milk of a Nurse, that hath some hours before taken a Potion, though the Cor∣puscles of the purging Medicine appear not to sense distinct from the other parts of the Milk, which in far greater num∣bers concurre with them, to constitute that white Liquor, yet these Purgative Particles, that seem but to be part of the Matter whereof the Milk consists, do yet so retain their own Nature and Qua∣lities, that being suck'd in with the rest by the Infant, they quickly discriminate and discover themselves by purging him. But of this Subject more hereaf∣ter. (Of Generation, Corruption, and Alteration.) VIII. IT now remains that we declare, what, according to the Tenour of our Hypothesis, is to be meant by Generation, Corruption, and Alteration;
(Three Names, that have very much puzled and divided Philosophers.) In order hereunto we may consider, 1. That there are in the World great store of Particles of Matter, each of which is too small to be, whilst single, Sensible; and being Entire, or Undivi∣ded, must needs both have its Deter∣minate Shape, and be very Solid. Inso∣much, that though it be mentally, and by Divine Omnipotence divisible, yet by reason of its Smalness and Solidity, Na∣ture doth scarce ever actually divide it; and these may in this sense be call'd Mi∣nima or Prima Naturalia. 2. That there are also Multitudes of Corpuscles, which are made up of the Coalition of several of the former Mi∣nima Naturalia; and whose Bulk is so small, and their Adhaesion so close and strict, that each of these little Primitive Concretions or Clusters (if I may so call them) of Particles is singly below the discernment of Sense, and though not
absolutely indivisible by Nature into the Prima Naturalia that compos'd it, or perhaps into other little Fragments, yet, for the reasons freshly intimated, they very rarely happen to be actually dissolv'd or broken, but remain entire in great variety of sensible Bodies, and under various forms or disguises. As, not to repeat, what we lately mention'd of the undestroy'd purging Corpuscles of Milk; we see, that even Grosser and more compounded Corpuscles may have such a permanent Texture: For Quicksilver, for instance, may be turn'd into a red Powder for a Fusible and Malleable Body, or a Fugitive Smoak, and disguis'd I know not how many o∣ther wayes, and yet remain true and re∣coverable Mercury. And these are as it were the Seeds, or immediate Princi∣ples of many sorts of Natural Bodies, as Earth, Water, Salt, &c. and those singly insensible, become capable, when united, to affect the Sense: as I have
try'd, that if good Camphire be kept a while in pure Spirit of Wine, it will thereby be reduc'd into such Little parts, as totally to disappear in the Li∣quor, without making it look less clear then fair Water, and yet, if into this Mixture you pour a competent quanti∣ty of Water, in a moment the scatter'd Corpuscles of the Camphire will, by re∣uniting themselves, become White, and consequently Visible, as before their Dispersion. 3. That as well each of the Minima Naturalia, as each of the Primary Clu∣sters above mention'd, having its own Determinate Bulk & Shape, when these come to adhere to one another, it must alwaies happen, that the Size, and often, that the Figure of the Corpuscle com∣pos'd by their Juxta-position and Co∣haesion, will be chang'd: and not seldome too, the Motion either of the one, or the other, or both, will receive a new Ten∣dency, or be alter'd as to its Velocity,
or otherwise. And the like will hap∣pen, when the Corpuscles, that compose a Cluster of Particles, are disjoyn'd, or any thing of the little Mass is broken off. And whether any thing of Matter be added to a Corpuscle, or taken from it in either case, (as we just now intima∣ted,) the Size of it must necessarily be alter'd, and for the most part the Figure will be so too, whereby it will both ac∣quire a Congruity to the Pores of some Bodies, (and perhaps some of our Sen∣sories,) and become Incongruous to those of others, and consequently be qualify'd, as I shall more fully shew you hereafter, to operate on diverse occasi∣ons, much otherwise then it was fitted to do before. 4. That when many of these insen∣sible Corpuscles come to be associated into one visible Body, if many or most of them be put into Motion, from what cause soever the Motion proceeds, That it self may produce great Changes, and
new Qualities in the Body they com∣pose; for not onely Motion may perform much, even when it makes not any visible Alteration in it, as Air put into swift Motion, (as when it is blown out of Bellows) acquires a new Name, and is call'd Wind, and to the Touch appears far colder then the same Air not so form'd into a Stream; and Iron, by being briskly rubb'd against Wood or other Iron, hath its small parts so agitated, as to appear hot to our Sense: but this Motion oftentimes makes visible Alte∣rations in the Texture of the Body into which it is receiv'd, for alwaies the Moved parts strive to communicate their Motion, or somewhat of the de∣gree of it, to some parts that were be∣fore either at Rest, or otherwise mov'd, and oftentimes the same Mov'd parts do thereby either disjoyn, or break some of the Corpuscles they hit against, and thereby change their Bulk, or Shape, or both, and either drive some
of them quite out of the Body, and per∣haps lodge themselves in their places, or else associate them anew with others. Whence it usually follows, that the Texture, is for a while at least, and, un∣lesse it be very stable and permanent, for good and all, very much alter'd, and especially, in that the Pores or little In∣tervals intercepted betwixt the com∣ponent Particles, will be chang'd as to Bigness, or Figure, or both, and so will cease to be commensurate to the Cor∣puscles that were fit for them before, and become commensurate to such Cor∣puscles of other Sizes and Shapes, as till then were incongruous to them Thus we see that Water, by loosing the wonted agitation of its parts, may acquire the Firmnesse and Brittlenesse we find in Ice, and loose much of the Transparency it had whilst it was a Li∣quor. Thus also by very hard rubbing two pieces of Resinous Wood against one another, we may make them throw
out diverse of their looser parts into Steams and visible Smoak, and may, if the Attrition be duely continued, make that commotion of the parts so change the Texture of the whole, as afterwards to turn the superficial parts into a kind of Coal. And thus Milk, especially in hot weather, will by the intestine, though languid, Motions of its parts, be in a short time turn'd into a thinner sort of liquor then Milk, and into Cream, and this (last nam'd) will by being barely agitated in a Churn, be turn'd in a shor∣ter time into that Unctuous and consi∣stent Body we call Butter, and into thin, fluid, and sower Butter-milk. And thus (to dispatch) by the bruising of Fruit, the Texture is commonly so chang'd, that as we see particularly in Apples, that the Bruis'd part soon comes to be of another nature then the Sound part, the one differing from the other both in Colour, Tast, Smell, and Consistence. So that (as we have already inculcated)
Local Motion hath, of all other affecti∣ons of Matter, the greatest Interest i the Altering and Modifying of it, since it is not onely the Grand Agent or Effi∣cient among Second Causes, but is also oftentimes one of the principal things that constitutes the Forme of Bodies: as when two Sticks are set on fire by long and vehement Attrition, Local Motion is not onely that which kindles the Wood, and so as an Efficient produces the Fire, but is That which principally concurrs to give the produced Stream of shining Matter, the name and nature of Flame: and so it concurrs also to con∣stitute all Fluid Bodies. 5. And that since we have formerly seen, that 'tis from the Size, Shape, and Motion of the small parts of Matter, and the Texture that results from the manner of their being dispos'd in any one Body, that the Colour, Odour, Tast, and other qualities of that Body are to be deriv'd, it will be easie for us
to recollect, That such Changes cannot happen in a portion of Matter, without so much varying the Nature of it, that we need not deride the antient Ato∣mists, for attempting to deduce the Ge∣neration and Corruption of Bodies from the fam'd , the Conven∣tion and Dissolution, and the Alterations of them, from the transposition of their (suppos'd) Atoms: For though indeed Nature is wont in the Changes she makes among things Corporeal, to im∣ploy all the three wayes, as well in Alte∣rations, as Generations and Corruptions; yet if they onely meant, as probably e∣nough they did, That of the three waies propos'd, the First was wont to be the Principal in the Generation of Bodies, the second in the Corruption, & the third in their Alterations, I shall not much oppose this Doctrine: though I take the Local Motion or Transposition of Parts, in the same portion of Matter, to bear a great stroak as well in reference
to Generation and Corruption, as to Al∣teration: as we see when Milk, or Flesh or Fruit, without any remarkable addi∣tion or loss of parts turns into Mag∣gots, or other Insects; and as we may more conspicuously observe in the Prae∣cipitation of Mercury without addition, in the Vitrification of Mettals, and o∣ther Chymical Experiments to be here∣after mention'd. These things premis'd, it will not now be difficult to comprise in few words such a Doctrine, touching the Ge∣neration, Corruption, and Alteration of Bodies, as is suitable to our Hypothesis, and the former Discourse. For if in a parcel of Matter there happen to be produc'd (it imports not much how) a Concurrence of all those Accidents, (whether those onely, or more) that Men by tacite agreement have thought necessary and sufficient to constitute any one Determinate Species of things cor∣poreal, then we say, That a Body be∣longing
to that Species, as suppose a Stone, or a Mettal, is Generated, or pro∣duc'd de novo. Not that there is really any thing of Substantial produc'd, but that those parts of Matter, that did in∣deed before praeexist, but were either scatter'd and shar'd among other Bodies, or at least otherwise dispos'd of, are now brought together, and dispos'd of after the manner requisite, to entitle the Body that results from them to a new Denomination, and make it apper∣tain to such a Determinate Species of Natural Bodies, so that no new Sub∣stance is in Generation produc'd, but onely That, which was praeexistent, ob∣teins a new Modification, or manner of Existence. Thus when the Spring, and Wheels, and String, and Balance, and Index &c. necessary to a Watch, which lay before scatter'd, some in one part, some in another of the Artificer's Shop, are first set together in the Order requisite to make such an Engine, to
shew how the time passes, a watch is said to be made: not that any of the mention'd Material parts is produc'd de novo, but that till then the divided Mat∣ter was not so contriv'd and put toge∣ther, as was requisite to constitute such a thing, as we call a Watch. And so when Sand and Ashes are well melted together, and suffer'd to cool, there is Generated by the Colliquation that sort of Concretion we call Glass, though it be evident, that its Ingredients were both praeexistent, and do but by their Association obtain a New manner of ex∣isting together. And so when by the Churning of Creame, Butter and But∣ter-milk are generated, we find not any thing Substantial Produc'd de novo in either of them, but onely that the Se∣rum, and the fat Corpuscles, being put into Local Motion, do by their frequent Occursions extricate themselves from each other, and associate themselves in the new manner, requisite to constitute
the Bodies, whose names are given them. And as a Body is said to be generated, when it first appears clothed with all those Qualities, upon whose Account Men have been pleas'd to call some Bo∣dies Stones; others, Mettals; others, Salts, &c. so when a Body comes to loose all or any of those Accidents that are Essential, and necessary to the consti∣tuting of such a Body, it is then said to be corrupted or destroy'd, and is no more a Body of that Kind, but looses its Title to its former Denomination. Not that any thing Corporeal or Sub∣stantial perishes in this Change, but one∣ly that the Essential Modification of the Matter is destroy'd: and though the Bo∣dy be still a Body, (no Natural Agent being able to annihilate Matter,) yet 'tis no longer such a Body, as 'twas be∣fore, but perisheth in the capacity of a Body of that Kind. Thus if a Stone, falling upon a Watch, break it to pieces;
as, when the Watch was made there was no new Substance produc'd, all the Material parts (as the Steel, Brass, String, &c.) being praeexistent some where or other, (as in Iron, and Copper Mines, in the Bellies of those Animals of whose Guts Men use to make Strings;) so not the least part of the Substance of the Watch is lost, be onely displac'd and scatter'd; and yea that Portion of Matter ceases to be a VVatch as it was before. And so ( resume our late Example) when Cream is by Churning turn'd into Buter, and a Serous Liquor, the parts of the Mil remain associated into those two Bodies but the White Liquor perisheth in the capacity of Milk. And so when Ice comes to be thaw'd in exactly close Vessels, though the Corruption be pro¦duc'd onely (for ought appears) by in∣troducing a new Motion and Dispositi∣on into the parts of the Frozen Water yet it thereupon ceases to be Ice, howe¦ver
it be as much VVater, and conse∣quently as much a Body, as before it was frozen or thaw'd. These and the like Examples may teach us rightly to un∣derstand that common Axiom of Na∣turalists, Corruptio unius est generatio alterius; & è contrà: for since it is ac∣knowledged on all hands, that Matter cannot be annihilated, and since it ap∣pears by what we have said above, that there are some Properties, namely Size, Shape, Motion, (or in its absence, Rest,) that are inseparable from the actual parts of Matter; and since also the Coalition of any competent number of these parts is sufficient to constitute a Natural Bo∣dy, endow'd with diverse sensible Qua∣lities; it can scarce be otherwise, but that the same Agents, that shatter the Frame, or destroy the Texture of one Body, will by shuffling them together, and disposing them after a New manner, bring them to constitute some new sort of Bodies: As the same thing, that by
burning destroyes Wood, turns it into Flame, Soot, and Ashes. Onely I doubt whether the Axiome do generally hol true, if it be meant, That every Corrup¦tion must end in the Generation of a Body belonging to some particular Species  things, unlesse we take Powders an fluid Bodies indefinitely for Species  Natural Bodies; since it is plain, the are multitudes of Vegetables, and other Concretions, which, when they rot, d not, as some others do, turn in Worms, but either into some slimy o watery Substance, or else (which is th most usuall) they crumble into a kin of Dust or Powder, which, thoug look'd upon as being the Earth, in which rotten Bodies are at length re¦solv'd, is very far from being of an Ele¦mentary nature, but as yet a Compoun∣ded Body, retaining some, if not many Qualities, which often makes the D of one sort of Plant or Animal diff much from that of another. And Th
will supply me with this Argument Ad hominem, viz. That since in those vio∣lent Corruptions of Bodies, that are made by Outward Agents, shattering them into pieces, if the Axiome hold true, the New Bodies emergent upon the Dissolution of the Former, must be really Natural Bodies, as (indeed divers of the Moderns hold them to be,) and Generated according to the course of Nature; as when Wood is destroy'd by Fire, and turn'd partly into Flame, part∣ly into Soot, partly into Coals, and partly into Ashes; I hope we may be allow'd to conclude, That those Chymi∣cal Productions, which so many would have to be but Factitious Bodies, are Natural ones, and regularly Generated. For it being the same Agent, the Fire, that operates upon Bodies, whether they be expos'd to it in close Glasses, or in Chimnies, I see no sufficient rea∣son, why the Chymical Oyls, and Vo∣latile Salts, and other things which
Spagirites obtain from mixt Bodies, should not be accounted Natural Bo∣dies, as well as the Soot, and Ashes, an Charcoal, that by the same fire are ob∣tain'd from Kindled Wood. But before we passe away from the mention of the Corruption of Bodies, must take some notice of what is call'd their Putrefaction. This is but a Pecu∣liar kind of Corruption, wrought slow∣ly (whereby it may be distinguish'd from Destruction by Fire, and othe nimble Agents) in Bodies: it happens to them for the most part by means o the Air, or some other Ambient Fluid, which by penetrating into the Pores o the Body, and by its agitation in them, doth usually call out some of the more Agile and lesse entangled parts of the Body, and doth almost ever loosen and dislocate the parts in general, and there∣by so change the Texture, and perhaps too the Figure, of the Corpuscles, that compose it, that the Body, thus chang'd,
acquires Qualities unsuitable to its For∣mer Nature, and for the most part of∣fensive to Our Senses, especially of Smelling and Tasting: which last clause I therefore adde, not onely because the Vulgar look not upon the Change of an Egge into a Chick as a Corruption, but as a Perfection of the Egge; but be∣cause also I think it not improbable, that if by such slow Changes of Bodies, as make them loose their former Na∣ture, and might otherwise passe for Pu∣trefaction, many Bodies should acquire better Sents or Tasts then before; or if Nature, Custom, or any other cause should much alter the Texture of our Organs of Tasting and Smelling, it would not perhaps be so well agreed on what should be call'd Putrefaction, as that imports an impairing Alteration, but Men would find some favourabler Notion for such Changes. For I ob∣serve, that Medlars, though they acquire in length of time such a Colour and
Softness as rotten Apples, and other pu∣trify'd Fruits do, yet, because their Tast is not then harsh as before, we call that Ripeness in them, which otherwise we should call Rottenness. And though up∣on the Death of a fourfooted Beast, we generally call that Change, which hap∣pens to the Flesh or Bloud, Putrefacti∣on, yet we passe a more favourable judg∣ment upon That, which happens to the Flesh and other softer parts of that A∣nimal, (whether it be a kind of large Rabbets, or very small and hornlesse Deer,) of which in China, and in the Levant they make Musk; because by the Change, that ensues the Animals death, the Flesh acquires not an odious, but a grateful Smell. And we see, that some Men, whose Appetites are grati∣fied by Rotten Cheese, think it Then not to have degenerated, but to have at∣tain'd its best State, when having lost its former Colour, Smell, and Tast, and, which is more, being in great part
turn'd into those Insects call'd Mites, 'tis both in a Philosophical sense cor∣rupted, and in the aestimate of the ge∣nerality of Men grown Putrid. But because it very seldom happens, that a Body by Generation acquires no other Qualities, then just those that are abso∣lutely necessary, to make it belong to the Species that Denominates it; there∣fore in most Bodies there are diverse o∣ther Qualities that may be there, or may be missing, without Essentially chang∣ing the Subject: as Water may be clear or muddy, odorous or stinking, and still remain Water; and Butter may be white or yellow, sweet or rancid, consi∣stent or melted, and still be call'd But∣ter. Now therefore whensoever a Par∣cl of Matter does acquire or loose a Quality, that is not Essential to it, That Acquisition or Losse is distinctly call'd Alteration, (or by some, Mutation:) the Acquist onely of the Qualities that are absolutely necessary to constitute its Es∣sential
and Specifical difference, or the Loss of any of those Qualities, being such a Change as must not be call'd meer Alteration, but have the particu∣lar name of Generation or Corruption; both which according to this Doctrine appear to be but several Kinds of Alte∣ration, taken in a large sense, though they are distinguish'd from it in a more strict and Limited acception of that Terme. And here we have a fair Occasion to take notice of the Fruitfulnesse and Ex∣tent of our Mechanical Hypothesis: For since according to our Doctrine, the World we live in is not a Movelesse or Indigested Mass of Matter, but an , or Self moving Engine, where∣in the greatest part of the common Mat∣ter of all Bodies is alwaies (though not still the same parts of it) in Motion; & wherein Bodies are so close set by one another, that (unlesse in some very few and extraordinary, and as it were Prae∣ternatural
cases) they have either no Vacuities betwixt them, or onely here and there interpos'd, and very small ones. And since, according to us, the various manner of the Coalition of seve∣ral Corpuscles into one visible Body is e∣nough to give them a peculiar Texture, and thereby fitt them to exhibit divers sensible Qualities, and to become a Bo∣dy, sometimes of one Denomination, and sometimes of another; it will very naturally follow, that from the various Occursions of those innumerable swarms of little Bodies, that are mov'd to and fro in the World, there will be many fitted to stick to one another, and so compose Concretions; and many (though not in the self same place) dis∣joyn'd from one another, and agitated apart; and multitudes also that will be driven to associate themselves, now with one Body, and presently with another. And if we also consider on the one side, that the Sizes of the small Particles of
Matter may be very various, their Fi∣gures almost innumerable, and that if a parcel of Matter do but happen to stick to one Body, it may chance to give it a new Quality, and if it adhere to another, or hit against some of its Parts, it may constitute a Body of another Kind; or if a parcel of Matter be knockt off from another, it may barely by That, leave It, and become it self of another Nature then before. If, I say, we consider these things on the one side; and on the other side, that (to use Lucretius his Comparison) all that innumerable mul∣titude of Words, that are contain'd in all the Languages of the World, are made of the various Combinations of some of the 24 Letters of the Alpha∣bet; 'twill not be hard to conceive, that there may be an incomprehensible va∣riety of Associations and Textures of the Minute parts of Bodies, and conse∣quently a vast Multitude of Portions of Matter endow'd with store enough of
differing Qualities, to deserve distinct Appellations; though for want of heed∣fulnesse and fit Words, Men have not yet taken so much notice of their lesse obvious Varieties, as to sort them as they deserve, and give them distinct and proper Names. So that though I would not say, that Any thing can im∣mediately be made of Every thing, as a Gold Ring of a VVedge of Gold, or Oyl, or Fire of Water; yet since Bodies, having but one common Matter, can be differenc'd but by Accidents, which seem all of them to be the Effects and Consequents of Local Motion, I see not, why it should be absurd to think, that (at least among Inanimate Bodies) by the Intervention of some very small Addition or Substraction of Matter, (which yet in most cases will scarce be needed,) and of an orderly Series of Al∣terations, disposing by degrees the Mat∣ter to be transmuted, almost of any thing, may at length be made Any
thing: as, though out of a wedge of Gold one cannot immediately make a Ring, yet by either Wyre-drawing that Wedge by degrees, or by melting it, and casting a little of it into a Mould, That thing may easily be effected. And so though Water cannot immediately be transmuted into Oyl, and much less into Fire, yet if you nourish certain Plants with Water alone, (as I have done,) 'till they have assimilated a great quantity of Water into their own Na∣ture, You may, by committing this Transmuted Water (which you may distinguish and separate from that part of the Vegetable you first put in) to Distillation in convenient Glasses, ob∣tain, besides other things, a true Oyl▪ and a black combustible Coal, (and con∣sequently Fire,) both of which may be so copious, as to leave no just cause to suspect, that they could be any thing neer afforded by any little Spirituous parts, which may be praesum'd to have
been communicated by that part of the Vegetable, that is first put into the wa∣ter, to that far greater part of it, which was committed to Distillation. But, Pyrophilus, I perceive the Diffi∣culty and Fruitfulnesse of my Subject, have made me so much more prolix then I intended, that it will not now be amiss to Contract the Summary of our Hypothesis, and give you the Main Points of it with little or no Illustrati∣on, and without particular Proofs in a few words. We teach then (but with∣out peremptorily asserting it,) First, That the Matter of all Natural Bodies is the Same, namely a Substance extended and impenetrable. 2. That all Bodies thus agreeing in the same common Matter, their Distin∣ction is to be taken from those Acci∣dents that do diversity it. 3. That Motion, not belonging to the Essence of Matter, (which retains its whole Nature, when 'tis at Rest,) and
not being Originally producible by o∣ther Accidents, as They are from It, may be look'd upon as the First and chief Mood or Affection of Matter. 4. That Motion, variously deter∣min'd, doth naturally divide the Matter it belongs to, into actual Fragments or Parts; and this Division obvious Ex∣perience, (and more eminently, Chy∣mical Operations) manifest to have been made into parts exceedingly minute, and very often, too minute to be singly perceiveable by our Senses. 5. Whence it must necessarily fol∣low, that each of these Minute Parts, or minima Naturalia (as well as every particular Body, made up by the Coali∣tion of any number of them,) must have its Determinate Bignesse or Size, and its own Shape. And these three, namely Bulk, Figure, and either Motion or Rest, (there being no Mean between these two) are the three Primary and most Catholick Moods or Affections of
the insensible parts of Matter, consider'd each of them apart. 6. That when diverse of them are consider'd together, there will necessa∣rily follow here Below both a certain Position or Posture in reference to the Horizon (as Erected, Inclining, or Le∣vel) of each of them, and a certain Or∣der, or placing before, or behind, or be∣sides one another; (as when in a com∣pany of Souldiers, one stands upright, the other stoops, the other lyes along up∣on the Ground, they have various Po∣stures; and their being plac'd besides one another in Ranks, and behind one ano∣ther in Files, are Varieties of their Or∣der:) and when many of these small parts are brought to Convene into one Body from their primary Affections, and their Disposition, or Contrivance as to Po∣sture and Order, there results That, which by one Comprehensive Name we call the Texture of that Body. And indeed these several Kinds of Location,
to borrow a Scholastical Terme,) attri∣buted (in this 6th number) to the Mi∣nute Particles of Bodies, are so neer of Kinne, that they seem all of them refer∣rable to (that One Event of their Con∣vening,) Scituation, or Position. And these are the Affections that belong to a Body, as it is consider'd in it self, with∣out relation to sensitive Beings, or to other Natural Bodies. 7. That yet, there being Men in the World, whose Organs of Sense are contriv'd in such differing wayes, that one Sensory is fitted to receive Impres∣sions from some, and another from o∣ther sorts of External Objects, or Bo∣dies without them, (whether these act as Entire Bodies, or by Emission of their Corpuscles, or by propagating some Motion to the Sensory,) the Percepti∣ons of these Impressions are by me call'd by several Names, as Heat, Colour, Sound, Odour; and are commonly ima∣gin'd to proceed from certain distinct
and peculiar Qualities in the External Object, which have some resemblance to the Ideas, their action upon the Sen∣ses excites in the Mind; though indeed all these Sensible Qualities, and the rest that are to be met with in the Bodies without us, are but the Effects or Con∣sequents of the above mentioned pri∣mary Affections of Matter, whose Ope∣rations are diversify'd according to the nature of the Sensories, or other Bodies they work upon. 8. That when a Portion of Matter, either by the accession or Recesse of Cor∣puscles, or by the transposition of those it consisted of before, or by any two or all of these waies, happens to obtain a concurrence of all those Qualities, which Men commonly agree to be necessary and sufficient to Denominate the Body, which hath them, either a Mettal, or a Stone, or the like, and to rank it in any peculiar and determinate Species of Bo∣dies, Then a Body of that Denomina∣tion
is said to be Generated. 9. This Convention of Essential Ac∣cidents being taken (not any of the Apart, but all) together for the Specif∣cal Difference that constitutes the Body and discriminates it from all other sort of Bodies, is by one Name, because conside'd as one collective Thing call'd its Forme, (as Beauty, which i made up both of Symmetry of Parts and Agreeablenesse of Colours,) whic is consequently but a certain Character▪ (as I sometimes call it,) or a peculi state of Matter, or, if I may so name it an Essential Modification: a Modificati∣on, because 'tis indeed but a Determi∣nate manner of Existence of the Matter and yet an Essential Modification, be∣cause that though the concurrent Qua∣lities be but Accidental to Matter (which with others in stead of Them would be Matter still,) yet they are es∣sentially necessary to the Particular Body which without those Accidents woul
not be a Body of that Denomination, as a Mettal or a Stone, but of some o∣ther. 10. Now a Body being capable of many other Qualities, besides those, whose Convention is necessary to make up its Form; the acquisition or lesse of any such Quality is, by Naturalists in the more strict sense of that Terme, nam'd Alteration: as when Oyl comes to be frozen, or to change colour, or to grow rancid; but if all, or any of the Qualities, that are reputed essential to such a Body, come to be lost or de∣stroy'd, that notable Change is call'd Corruption; as when Oyl being boyl'd takes fire, the Oyl is not said to be al∣ter'd in the former sense, but corrupted or destroy'd, and the emergent Fire ge∣nerated; and when it so happens, that the Body is slowly corrupted, and there∣by also acquires Qualities offensive to our Senses, especially of Smell and Tast, (as when Flesh▪ or Fruit grows rotten,)
that kind of Corruption is by a more par∣ticular Name call'd Putrefaction. But neither in this, nor in any other kind of Corruption is there any thing substan∣tial destroy'd, (no such thing having been produc'd in Generation, and Mat∣ter it self being on all hands acknow∣ledged incorruptible,) but onely that special connexion of the Parts, or man∣ner of their Coexistence, upon whose account the Matter, whilst it was in its former state, was, and was call'd a Stone, or a Mettal, or did belong to any other Determinate Species of Bodies.
CONSIDERATIONS and EXPERIMENTS, Touching the Origine of QUALITIES and FORMS. THE HISTORICAL PART. The I. SECTION.
The I. SECTION, Containing the Observations. IN the foregoing Notes I have endea∣voured with as much Clearness, as the Difficulty of the Subject, and the Brevity I was confined to, permitted to give a Scheme or Summary of the Prin∣ciples of the Corpuscularian Philoso∣phy, as I apprehended them, by way of a short Introduction to it, at least as far as I judged necessary for the better un∣derstanding of what is contain'd in our Notes and Experiments concerning the Productions and Changes of particular Qualities. But though, I hope, I have not so affected Brevity, as to fall into Obscurity; yet since these Principles are built upon the Phaenomena of Na∣ture, and devis'd in order to the Expli∣cation
of them, I know not what I can do more proper to recommend them, then to subjoyn some such Natural Phaenomena, as either induce me to take up such Notions, or which I was dire∣cted to find out by the Notions I had imbrac'd. And since I appeale to the Testimony of Nature to verifie the Doctrine I have been proposing, about the Origine and Production of Quali∣ties, (for that of Formes will require a distinct Discourse,) I think it very pro∣per to set down some Observations of what Nature does, without being over∣rul'd by the Power and Skill of Man, as well as some Experiments wherein Nature is guided, and as it were Ma∣ster'd by Art, that so she may be made to attest the Truth of our Doctrine, as well, when she discloses her Self freely, and, if I may so speak, of her Own ac∣cord, as when she is as it were Cited to make her Depositions by the Industry of Man. The Observations will be but
the more suitable to our Design for be∣ing Common and Familiar, as to the Phaenomena, though perhaps New e∣nough as to the Application to our Purpose. And as for the Experi∣ments, because those that belong more immediately to this or that particular Quality, may be met with in the Notes that treat of It, I thought it not amisse that the Experiments should be both Few in number, and yet so Pregnant, that every one of them should afford such differing Phaenomena, as may make it applicable to more then One Quality. I. The Observation I will begin with shall be fetch'd from what happens in the Hatching of an Egge. For as fa∣miliar and obvious a thing as it is, (es∣pecially after what the Learned Fabri∣cius ab Aqua pendente, and a recenter A∣natomist have delivered about them,) that there is a great Change made in
the substance of the Egge, when 'tis by Incubation turn'd into a Chick: yet, as far as I know, this Change hath not been taken notice of, for the same pur∣pose, to which I am about to apply it. I consider then, that in a Prolifick Egge, (for Instance that of a Hen,) as well the Liquor of the Yolk, as that of the White, is a Substance, as to sense, Similar. For upon the same account that Anatomists and Physicians call se∣veral parts of the humane Body, as Bones, Membranes, &c. Similar, that is, such, as that every Sensible part of it hath the same Nature or Denominati∣on with the whole, as every Splinter of Bone is Bone, as every Shred of Skin is Skin. And though I find by distilling the Yolks and Whites, they seem to be Dissimilar Bodies, in regard that the White of an Egge (for Example) will afford Substances of a very differing Nature, as Flegme, Salt, Oyl, and Earth,
yet (not now to examine whether, or how far these may be esteem'd Produ∣ctions of the Fire, that are rather ob∣tain'd from the White of the Egge, then were praeexistent in it; not to men∣tion this I say,) it doth not appear by Distillation, that the White of an Egg, is other then a Similar Body in the sense above deliver'd. For it would be hard to prove, that one part of the White of an Egg will not be made to yield the same differing Substances by Distillati∣on, that any other part does; and Bones themselves, and other hard parts of a humane Body, that are confessedly Si∣milar, may by Distillation be made to afford Salt, and Phlegme, and Spirit, and Oyl, and Earth, as well as the White of an Egg. This being thus setled in the First place, we may in the Next consider, that by beating the White of an Egge well with a Whisk, you may reduce it from a somewhat Tenacious into a Fluid
Body, though this Production of a Li∣quor be, as we elsewhere noted, effected by a Divulsion, Agitation &c. of the parts, that is in a word, by a Mechanical change of the Texture of the Body. In the Third place I consider, that according to the exactest Observations of Modern Anatomists, which our own Observations do not contradict, the Rudiments of the Chick, lodg'd in the Cicatricula, or white Speck upon the Coat of the Yolk, is nourish'd, 'till it have obtain'd to be a great Chick, one∣ly by the White of the Egg; the Yolk being by the Providence of Nature re∣serv'd as a more strong and solid Ali∣ment, till the Chick have absum'd the White, and be thereby grown great and strong enough to digest the Yolk; and in effect you may see the Chick fur∣nish'd not onely with all the necessary, but divers other parts, as Head, Wings, Legs, and Beak, and Claws, whilst the Yolk seems yet as it were untouch'd.
But whether this Observation about the Entireness of the Yolk be precisely true, is not much material to our pre∣sent purpose, nor would I be thought to build much upon it; since the Yolk it self, especially at that time, is wont to be fluid enough, and to be a Liquor per∣haps no less so then the White was, and That is enough for my present purpose. For in the Last place I consider, that the Nutritive Liquor of an Egg, which is in it self a Body so very soft, that by a little Agitation it may be made Fluid, and is readily enough dissolvable in common cold water, this very Sub∣stance, I say, being brooded on by the Hen, will within two or three weeks be transmuted into a Chick, furnish'd with Organical parts, as Eyes, Ears, Wings, Legs, &c. of a very differing Fabrick, and with a good number of Similar ones, as Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Tendons, Membranes, &c. which dif∣fer very much in Texture from one a∣nother;
besides the Liquors, as Blood, Chyle, Gall, &c. contain'd in the solid parts: So that here we have out of the White of an Egg, which is a Substance Similar, Insipid, Soft, (not to call it Fluid,) Diaphanous, Colourlesse, and readily dissoluble in cold water, out of this Substance I say, we have by the new and various Contrivement of the small parts it consisted of, an Animal, some of whose parts are not Transpa∣rent but Opacous; some of them Red, as the Bloud; some Yellow or Gree∣nish, as the Gall; some White, as the Brain; some Fluid, as the Bloud, and o∣ther Juices; some Consistent, as the Bones, Flesh, and other stable parts of the Body; some Solid and Frangible, as the Bones, others Tough and Flexible, as the Ligaments, others Soft and loos∣ly Cohaerent, as the Marrow; some without Springs, as many of the parts▪ some with Springs, as the Feathers, some apt to mingle readily with cold
water, as the Bloud, the Gall; some not to be so dissolv'd in it, as the Bones, the Claws, and the Feathers; some well ta∣sted, as the Flesh and Bloud; some very ill tasted, as the Gall, (for That I have purposely and particularly observ'd.) In a word, we have here produc'd out of such an uniforme Matter as the White of an Egg, First, new kind of Qualities, as (be∣sides Opacity) Colours, (whereof a single Feather will sometimes afford us Variety,) Odours, Tasts, and Heat in the Heart and Bloud of the Chick; Hardness, Smoothness, Roughness, &c. Secondly, diverse other Qualities, that are wont to be distinguish'd from Sensi∣ble ones, as Fluidity (in the Bloud and aqueous humor of the Eye,) Consisten∣cy in the Grisles, Flesh, &c. Hardnesse, Flexibility, Springynesse, Toughness, unfitnesse to be dissolv'd in cold water, and several others. To which may pro∣bably be added
Thirdly, some Occult Properties as Physicians observe, that some Birds, as young Swallows, young Magpies af∣ford Specifick, or at least Noble Me∣dicines, in the Falling sickness, Hysteri∣cal Fits, and divers other Distempers. Fourthly, I very well foresee it may be objected, that the Chick with all its parts is not a Mechanically contriv'd Engine, but fashion'd out of Matter by the Soul of the Bird, lodg'd chiefly in the Cicatricula, which by its Plastick power fashions the obsequious Matter, and becomes the Architect of its own Mansion. But not here to examine, whether any Animal, except Man, be o∣ther then a Curious Engine, I answer, that this Objection invalidates not what I intend to prove from the alledg'd Ex∣ample. For let the Plastick Principle be what it will, yet still, being a Physi∣cal Agent, it must act after a Physical manner, and having no other Matter to work upon but the White of the Egg,
it can work upon that Matter but as Physical Agents, and consequently can but divide the Matter into minute parts of several Sizes and Shapes, and by Local Motion variously context them, according to the Exigency of the Ani∣mal to be produc'd, though from so ma∣ny various Textures of the produc'd parts there must naturally emerge such differences of Colours, Tasts, and Con∣sistencies, and other Qualities as we have been taking notice of. That which we are here to consider, is not what is the Agent or Efficient in these Produ∣ctions, but what is done to the Matter to effect them. And though some Birds by an inbred Skill do very Artificially build their Curious Nests, yet cannot Nature▪ that teaches them, enable them to do ny more then select the Materi∣als of teir Nests, and by Local Moti∣on divde, transport, and connect them after Certain manner. And when Man himself, who is undoubtedly an Intel∣ligent
Agent, is to frame a Building o an Engine, he may indeed by the help of Reason and Art, contrive his Mate∣rials curiously and skilfully, but still  he can do, is but to move, divide, tran∣pose, and context the several parts, in which he is able to reduce the Matte assign'd him. Nor need we imagine, that the So of that Hen, which having first produc'd the Egg, does after a while sit on it hath any peculiar Efficiency in hatching of a Chick: for the Egg will be we hatch'd by another Hen, though Th which laid it be dead; and, which is more, we are assur'd by the Testimony of very good Authors, as well as of re∣cent Travellers, that in some places especially in Aegypt, there needs  Bird at all to the Production of a Chick out of an Egg, since they hatch multi∣tudes of Eggs by the regulated heat o Ovens, or Dunghils. And indeed, that there is a Motion or Agitation of the
parts of the Egg by the external heat, whereby it is hatch'd, is evident of its self, and not (as far as I know) deny'd by any, and that also the white Sub∣stance is absumed and contexted, or con∣triv'd into the Body of the Chick, and its several parts, is manifest to sense; es∣pecially if one hath the Curiosity to observe the progress of the Chicks Formation and Increment. But as 'tis evident, that as these two things, the Substance of the White, and the Local Motion, wherein the External Heat necessary to Incubation puts its parts, do eminently concurr to the Producti∣on of the Chick; so that the Formative Power (whatever that be) doth any more then guide these Motions, and thereby associate the itted Particles of Matter after the manner requisite to constitute a Chick, is that which I think will not easily be evinc'd. And I might to what I said of the Egg, adde several things touching the Generation of Vi∣viparous
Animals, which the Learned Fabricius ab Aqua pendente, as well as some of the Antient Philosophers would have to be generated from a Imperfect kind of Eggs: but I take the Eggs of Birds to be much fitter to in∣stance in, because they are things tha we have more at command, and where with we can conveniently make mo Trials and Observations; and especiall because in perfect Eggs the Matter t be transmuted is more closely lock'd up, and being kept from any visibe supply of Matter, confin'd to be wrought upon by the External Heat and by its own Vital Principle within. II. Water being generally esteem'd  Elementary Body, and being at leas far more Homogeneous then Both here below are wont to be; it may mk very much for our present purpose  shew, that Water it self, that is Flu,
Tastless, Inodorous, Diaphanous, Colourless, Volatile, &c. may, by a dif∣fering Texture of its Parts, be brought to constitute Bodies of Attributes very distant from these. This I thought might be done, by nourishing Vegeta∣bles with simple water. For in case I could do so, all, or the greatest part of that which would accrue to the Vege∣table thus nourish'd, would appear to have been materially but Water, with what Exotick Quality soever it may af∣terwards, when transmuted, be endow'd. The Ingenious Helmont indeed men∣tions an Experiment somewhat of this nature, though not to the same purpose, which he made by planting a Branch of Willow into a Pot full of Earth, and observing the increase of Weight he obtain'd after divers years, though he fed the Plant but with Rain water. And some Learned Modern Naturalists have conjectur'd at the easy Transmutable∣nesse of Water, by what happens in
Gardens and Orchards, where the same Showers or Rain after a long Drought makes a great number of differing Plants to flourish. But though these things be worthy of their Authors, yet I thought they would not be so fit for my purpose, because it may be speci∣ously enough objected, That the Rain water does not make these Plants thrive and flourish, by immediately affording them the Aliments they assimilate into their own Substance, but by proving a Vehicle, that dissolves the Saline, and o∣ther Alimental Substances of the Earth, and dilutes both them and the nutri∣tive Juice, which, in a part of the Plant its self, it may find too much thickned by the Drought or Heat of the ambient Air, and by this means it contributes to the nourishment of the Plant, though it self be insensibly afterwards exhal'd into vapours. And indeed Experience shews us, that several Plants, that thrive not well without Rain water, are not
yet nourish'd by it alone, since when Corn in the Field, and Fruit-trees in Orchards have consum'd the Saline and Sulphureous Juices of the Earth, they will not prosper there, how much Rain soever falls upon the Land, till the Ground by Dung or otherwise be sup∣ply'd again with such assimilable Juices. Wherefore I rather chose to attempt the making of Plants grow in Viols fill'd with Water, not onely to prevent the forementioned Objection, and also to make the Experiment lesse tedious, but that I might have the pleasure of seeing the progress of Nature in the Transmutation of Water; and my Ob∣servations of this kind as Novelties, un∣mention'd by any other Writer, I shew'd divers Ingenious Freinds, who having better Opportunities then I of staying in one place, have attempted the like, and made succesful Trials, which, I sup∣pose, will not be conceal'd from the publick. Of my Observations about
things of this kind, I can at present find but few among my Adversaria; but in Them I find enough for my present turn. For They and my Memory in∣form me, that Vinca per Vinca, Rapha∣nus Aquaticus, Spearemint, and even Ra∣nunculus it self, did grow and prosper very well in Viols filld with fair water, by whose Necks the Leaves were sup∣ported, and the Plant kept from sink∣ing: some of these were onely Cuttings without Roots, divers of them were left in the water all the Autumn, and great part of the Winter, and at the lat∣ter end of January were taken out ver∣dant, and with fair Roots, which they had shot in the water. And besides I find, that particularly a Branch or Sprig of Raphanus Aquaticus was kept full nine Months, and during that time wither'd not the whole Winter, and was taken out of the water with many fi∣brous Roots, and some green Buds, and an increase of Weight, and that a Stump
of Ranunculus did so prosper in the wa∣ter, that in a Months time it had attain'd to a pretty deale more then double the weight it had, when it was put in. And the next Note, which I find concerning these Plants, informes me, that the a∣bove mention'd Crowsfoot being ta∣ken out agen at six Months after it was put in, weigh'd a Drachm and a half wanting a Grain and a half, that is, some∣what above Thrice as much as it did at first. This last Circumstance (of the increase of Weight) I therefore thought fit particularly to make Trial of, and set down upon this account among o∣thers, That having doubted the Roots and Leaves, that seem'd produc'd out of the Water, might really be so, by an Oblongation and an Expansion of the Plants, (as I have purposely try'd, that an Onion weigh'd and laid up in the Spring, though after some weeks keep∣ing in the Air it shot Blades, whereof one was five Inches long, in stead of
incorporating the Air or terrestrial Ef∣fluviums with it self, and consequently thereby growing heavier, had lost nine Grains of its former weight,) it might by this Circumstance appear, that there may be a real Assimilation and Trans∣mutation of Water into the Substance of the Vegetable, as I elsewhere also shew by other proofs. For this being made out, from thence I infer, That the same Corpuscles, which, convening to∣gether after one manner, compose that fluid, Inodorous, colourless, and insipid Body of Water being contexted after other manners, may constitute differing Concretes, which may have Firmeness, Opacity, Odours, Smels, Tasts, Co∣lours, and several other manifest Quali∣ties, and that too very different from one another. And besides all this, these distinct Portions of Transmuted Wa∣ter may have many other Qualities, without excepting those that are wont to be call'd Specifick, or Occult, wit∣ness
the several Medicinal Virtues attri∣buted by Authors to Spearmint, and to Periwinckle, to Majorane, and to Ra∣phanus Aquaticus. And as for Ranun∣culus, that Plant being reckoned among Poisonous ones, and among those that raise Blisters, 'twill be easily granted, that it hath, as other Poisons, an Occult Deleterial faculty; and indeed it some∣what deserves our wonder, that so in∣sipid and innocent a thing as fair Water, should be capable to be turn'd into a Substance of such a piercing and caustick Nature, as by Contact to raise Blisters on an humane Body. And yet perhaps that is no lesse strange, which we else∣where relate, That a Plant, consisting chiefly of Transmuted Water, did by Distillation afford us a true Oyl, that would not mingle with Water, and con∣sequently was easily convertible into Fire. But whether or no this Experi∣ment, or any such like, prove, that al∣most All things may be made of All
things, not immediately, but by inter∣vention of successive Changes and Dis∣positions, is a Question to which we elsewhere say something, but are not willing in this place to say any thing. And if it be here objected, That the so∣lid Substance, that accrues to a Plant rooted in Water, procceds not at all from the water it self, but from the Ni∣trous, fat, and earthy Substances, that may be presum'd to abound even in common Water, not here to repeat what I elsewhere say about this Obje∣ction, I shall at present reply, That though as to divers Plants, that flourish after Raine, I am apt to think, as I inti∣mated above, that they may in part be nourish'd as well by the Saline and Ear∣thy Substances, to which the Rain usu∣ally prooves a Vehicle, as by the Rain it self; yet as to what the Objection holds forth about the Plants, that grow not in the Ground, but in Glasses fill'd with Water, it should not be barely said but
prov'd, which he will not perhaps think easie to be done, that considers how vast a quantity of fair Water is requi∣site to be exhal'd away, to obtain as much as one Ounce of dry Residents, whether Saline or Earthy. III. That a Plant, growing in the Earth, doth by the faculties of its Vegetative Soul attract the Juices of the Earth, that are within its reach, and selecting those parts that are congruous to its Nature, refuse the rest, is the general Opinion of Philosophers, and Physicians: and there∣fore many Naturalists are not wont much to marvail, when they see a Tree bear a Fruit that is sowr or bitter, be∣cause they presume, that Nature hath in the Root of the Tree cull'd out such parts of the Alimental Juice of the Earth, as being made to convene into one Fruit, are fit to make it of such a Quality. But 'tis worth observing for
our present purpose what happens both in ordinary Graftings, and especially in that kind of Insition (taking the word in a large sense) which is commonly call'd Inoculation. For though we may presume, that the Root of a white Thorne (for Instance) may electively attract its Aliment from the Earth, and choose that which is fittest to produce the Ignoble fruit, that is proper for that Plant: yet we cannot reasonably sup∣pose, that it should in its attraction of Aliment have any Designe of providing an Appropriate Nutriment for a Pore, and yet the known Experience of Gar∣diners, and our own Observations mani∣fest, that the Cyons of a Pear tree will take very well upon a White thorn∣stock, and bring forth a well tasted fruit, very differing in many qualities from that of the White thorn. I have also learn'd from those that are expert, That though Apples and Pears, being but Vulgar Fruit, are seldome propagated
but by Grafting; yet they may be pro∣pagated likewise by Inoculation, (which seems to be but a kind of Grafting with a Bud.) Now in the Inoculations, that are made upon Fruit trees, tis very ob∣servable, and may much countenance what we are endeavouring to prove, that a little Vegetable Bud, (that is no Seed, properly so call'd,) not so big often∣times as a Pea, should be able so to transmute all the Sap that arrives at it, that though this Sap be already in the Root, and in its passage upwards deter∣min'd by Natures Intention, as Men are wont to speak, to the production of the Fruit that is natural to the Stock; yet this Sap should by so small a Vegetable Substance as a Bud, (whether by the help of some peculiar kind of Strainer, or by the Operation of some powerful Ferment lodged in it, or by both these, or some other cause,) be so far chang'd and overrul'd, as to constitute a Fruit quite otherwise qualify'd, then that
which is the Genuine production of the Tree, and which is actually produc'd by those other portions of the like Sap, which happen'd to nourish the prolific'd Buds that are the Genuine Of-spring of the Stock; so that the same Sap, that in one part of a Branch constitutes (for in∣stance) a Cluster of Haws, in another part of the same Branch may constitute a Pear. And that which is further re∣markable to our present purpose, is, That not onely the Fruites made of the same Sap do often differ from one ano∣ther in Shape, Bigness, Colour, Odour, Tast, and other obvious Qualities, as well as Occult ones: but that though the Sap it self be (oftentimes) a Wate∣rish and almost Insipid Liquor, that ap∣pears to sense Homogeneous enough, and even by Distillation affords very little besides Flegme; yet this Sap is not onely convertible by Buds of several Natures into differing Fruits, but in one and the same Fruit the transmuted Sap
shall by differing Textures be made to exhibit very differing, and sometimes contrary Qualities. As when (for in∣stance) a Peach bud does not onely change the Sap that comes to it into a Fruit, very differing from that which the Stock naturally produceth, but in the Skin of the Peach it must be red, in the Kernel white, and in other parts of other Colours; the Flesh of it must be fragrant, the Stone inodorous, the Flesh soft and yielding, the Stone very hard and brittle, the Meat pleasantly tasted, the Kernel bitter; not to mention, that Peach Blossoms, though produc'd also by the Bud, are of a Colour and Tex∣ture very differing from that of the Fruit, and are enobled with an Occult Quality, which the Fruit hath not, I mean a Purgative Virtue: So that from Inoculations we may learn, That a steg∣matick Liquor, that seems Homogene∣ous enough, & but very slenderly provi∣ded with other manifest Qualities then
common water, may, by being various∣ly contexted by the Buds of Trees, be transmuted into Bodies endow'd with new, and various, and considerable Sents, Colours, Tasts, Solidity, Medi∣cinal vertues, and divers other Qualities manifest, and occult. If it be here said, that these Qualities are the productions of the Plastick Power residing in prolifick Buds, which indeed (to me) seem to be but very mi∣nute Boughs; I shall return the same Answer that I did to the like Objecti∣on, when 'twas propos'd in the First Observation. Hitherto I have onely argued from vulgar Inoculations, but there may be others, as well more considerable, as lesse ordinary; and I remember I have seen a Tree, whereof, though the Stock was of one sort of good Fruit, there were three more and differing kinds of Stone-fruit, that had been made to take by Inoculation; and two of those inocu∣lated
Boughs had actually Fruit on them, and the third, though it had as yet no Fruit, because the Season for that sort of Plants to bear it was not yet come, yet the Shoot was so flourishing, that we concluded, that the Blossoms would in due time be succeeded by fruit. And since I have been speaking of the differing Qualities of the parts of the same Fruit, I am content to adde two things: the one that Garcias ab Horto, a Classick Author, (and Physician to the Indian Viceroy) affirmes Aromat. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 29. de Cassia solutiva. with some solemnity, (as wondering that a Lear∣ned man should write otherwise,) that though the fruit we call Cassia fistula be very commonly us'd, both here and in the Indies as a Purging Medicine, yet the Seeds of this Solutive Cassia are Astringent. The other: That of late years there have been often brought into England from the Carybbe Islands, certain Kernels of a fruit, which those
that have seen it grow, liken to a white Pear-plumme; these are so strongly Purgative, and also Emetick, that the Ingenious Mr. Lygon Ligon's History of Barbados. pag. 67.68. tells us, th five of them wrought with him a Do∣zen times upwards, and above Twenty downwards, and yet the same Author assures us, (which is likewise here a re∣ceiv'd Tradition among them that are curious of this fruit,) That in the Ker∣nel, in the parting of it into halfes, ( when our Hazle Nuts in England p in the middle longwise) you shall find thin Filme, which looks of a faint Ca¦nation, (which colour is easily enoug discerned, the rest of the Kernel being perfectly white,) and that taking o the Filme you may eat the Nut safely without feeling any Operation at all and 'tis as sweet as a Jordan Almon [A Learned Man, that practis'd Physick in America, being inquir'd of by m concerning the Truth of this Relation
answer'd, That though he had divers times given those Nuts as Cathartick Remedies, yet he had not that Curio∣sity to take out the Filmes, finding it the Universal belief, that the Purgative faculty consisted therein.] And I re∣member, that the famous See Nicholaus Monardes, under the Title, Fabae Purgatrices. Monardes doth somewhat countenance this Tradi∣tion, where speaking of another Purg∣ing fruit, that also comes from America, (from Cartagena, and Nombre de Dios,) he takes notice, that these purging Beans (which are like ours, but smaller) have a thin Skin, that divides them through the middle, which must (toge∣ther with the external Rind) be cast a∣way, else they will work so violently both upwards and downwards, as to bring the Taker into hazard of his Life: whereas he commends these Beans rightly prepar'd, not onely as a pleasant Medicine, that doth without trouble
purge both Choler, Flegme, and gross Humors, for which it is celebrated a∣mong the Indians. To these stories of our Countrymen, and Monardes, I shall subjoin another, which I find related by that great Ram∣bler about the World, Vincent le Blanck, who giving us an Account of a publick Garden, which he visited in A∣frica, in the Territories of the Lord of Casima, not far from the Borders of Nubia, which he represents as the curio∣sest Garden he saw in all the East, he mentions this among other Rarities, "There were (sayes he) other sorts of Fruit, which I never saw but there, and one among the rest leav'd like a Syca∣more, with fruit like the Golden Ap∣ple, but no Gall more bitter, and with∣in five Kernels, as big as Almonds, the Juice whereof is sweet as Sugar, betwixt the Shell and the Nut there grows a thick Skin of a Carnation colour, which Vincent le Blanck's Survey of the World: Part. 2. p. 260.
taken before they be throughly ripe, they preserve with Date Vinegar, and make an excellent Sweetmeat, which they present to the King as a great Cu∣riosity. IV. The Fourth and last Observation I shall at present mention, is afforded me by the consideration of Rotten Cheese. For if we take notice of the difference betwixt two parts of the same Cheese, whereof the one continues sound by preserving its Texture, and the other hath suffer'd that Impairing Alteration of Texture we call Rottenness, we may often see a manifest and notable Change in the several portions of a Body, that was before Similar. For the Rotten part will differ from the Sound in its Colour, which will be sometimes Livid, but most commonly betwixt Green and Blew; and its Odour, which will be both strong and offensive; and its Tast, which will be very Picquant, and to some men
much more pleasant then before, but to most men odious; and in divers other Qualities, as particularly its Consistence, it will be much lesse Solid and more Friable then before; and if with a good Microscope we look upon the moulded parts of many Cheeses, we shall quick∣ly discover therein some Swarms of little Animals, (the Mites,) furnish'd with variety of Parts of differing Sizes, Shapes, Textures, &c. and discry a yet greater diversity, both as to manifest Qualities (nor probably is it inferior as to Occult ones) betwixt the Mouldy part of the Cheese and the Untainted, then the unassisted Eye could otherwise have discovered. The following Discourse (Of the Origine of Form) ought to have been placed before this foregoing Sectio the Historical Part.
OF THE ORIGINE OF FORMS.
THe Origine of Forms, Pyrophilus, as it is thought the Noblest, so, if I mistake not, it hath been found one of the most perplex'd Enquiries, that be∣long to Natural Philosophy: and, I con∣fesse, it is one of the things that has in∣vited me to look about for some more satisfactory Account, then the Schools usually give of this matter, that I have observ'd, that the wisest that have bu∣sied themselves in explicating Forms according to the Peripatetick Notions of them, have either knowingly Con∣fess'd themselves unable to explain them, or unwittingly Prov'd themselves Formarum cognitio est rudis, conusa, nec nisi per ; neque verum est, formae substantialis speciem recipi in intellectum, non enim in sensu usquam fuit. J.C. Scalig. Formae substantiales sunt incognitae nobis, quia insensiles: ideo per qualitates, quae sunt principia immediatae Trans∣mutationis, exprimuntur. Aquinas ad 1. de generat. & corrupt. In hac humanae mentis caligine aequè forma Ignis ac Mag∣netis nobis ignoa est. Sennertus.
to be so, by giving but unsatisfactory Explications of them. It will not (I presume) be expected, that I, who now write but Notes, should enumerate, much lesse examine all the various Opinions touching the Origine and Nature of Forms; it being enough for our purpose, if, having already inti∣mated in our Hypothesis, what, accor∣ding to that, may be thought of this Subject; we now briefly consider the general Opinion of our Modern Aristo∣telians and the Schools concerning it. I say, the Modern Aristotelians, because diverse of the Antient, especially Greek Commentators of Aristotle, seem to have understood their Masters Doctrine of Forms much otherwise, and lesse in∣congruously, then his Latin followers, the Schoolmen and others, have since done. Nor do I expresly mention Ari∣stotle himself among the Champions of substantial Forms, because though he seem in a place or two expresly enough
to reckon Formes among Substances, yet elsewhere the Examples he imploies to set forth the Forms of Natural things by, being taken from the Figures of ar∣tificial things, (as of a Statue, &c.) which are confessedly but Accidents, and making very little use, if any, of Substan∣tial Forms to explain the Phaenomena of Nature, He seems to me upon the whole matter, either to have been irre∣solv'd, whether there were any such Substances, or no, or to speak ambigu∣ously and obscurely enough of them, to make it questionable, what his Opini∣ons of them were. But the summe of the Controversy betwixt Us and the Schools is this, whether or no the Forms of Natural things, (the Souls of Men alwaies ex∣cepted) be in Generation educed, as they speak, out of the power of the Matter, and whether these Forms be true substanti∣al Entities, distinct from the other sub∣stantial Principle of Natural Bodies, namely Matter.
The Reasons that move me to em∣brace the Negative, are principally these three. First, That I see no necessity of admitting in Natural things any such substantial Forms, Matter and the Ac∣cidents of Matter being sufficient to ex∣plicate as much of the Phaenomena of Nature, as we either do or are like to understand. The next, That I see not what use this puzling Doctrine of sub∣stantial Forms is of in Natural Philoso∣phy; the Acute Scaliger, and those that have most busied themselves in the In∣dagation of them, having freely acknow∣ledg'd, (as the more Candid of the Pe∣ripateticks generally do,) That the true Knowledg of Forms is too difficult and abstruse to be attain'd by them. And how like it is, that particular Phaenome∣na will be explain'd by a Principal, whose Nature is confessedly ignor'd, I leave you to judg: but because to these considerations I often have had, and shall have here and there occasion to
say something in the body of these Notes, I shall at present insist upon the third, which is, That I cannot conceive, neither how Forms can be generated, as the Peripateticks would have it, nor how the things, they ascribe to them, are consistent with the Principles of true Philosophy, or even with what them∣selves otherwise teach. The Manner how Forms are educed out of the Power of the Matter, according to that part of the Doctrine of Forms, wherein the Schools generally enough agree, is a thing so Inexplicable, that I wonder not it hath put Acute men upon several Hypotheses to make it out. And indeed the number of These is of late grown too great to be fit to be here re∣cited, especially since I find them all so very unsatisfactory, that I cannot but think, the acute Sticklers for any of them are rather driven to embrace it by the palpable inconveniences of the wayes they reject, then by any thing
they find to satisfy them, in that which they make choice of: and for my part I confess, I find so much Reason in what each Party sayes against the Explicati∣ons of the rest, that I think they all Con∣fute well, and none does well Establish. But my present way of Writing for∣bidding me to insist on many Argu∣ments against the Doctrine, where they most agree, I shall onely urge▪ That which I confess chiefly sticks with me, namely that I find it not Compre∣hensible. I know the Modern Schoolmen fly here to their wonted Refuge of an Ob¦scure Distinction, and tell us, that the Power of Matter in reference to Forms is partly Eductive, as the Agent ca make the Form out of it, and partly Re∣ceptive, whereby it can receive the For so made; but since those that say this, will not allow, that the Form of a ge∣nerated Body was actually praeexisten in its Matter, or indeed any where else,
'tis hard to conceive, how a Substance can be educ'd out of another Substance totally distinct in Nature from it, with∣out being, before such Eduction, actually existent in it. And as for the Recep∣tive Power of the Matter, That but fit∣ting it to receive or lodge a Form, when brought to be United with it, how can it be intelligibly made out to contribute to the Production of a new Substance, of a quite differing Nature from that Matter, though it harbours it when pro∣duc'd? And 'tis plain, that the Humane Body hath a receptive Power in refe∣rence to the Humane Soule, which yet themselves confess both to be a sub∣stantial Form, and not to be educ'd out of the Power of Matter. Indeed if they would admit the Form of a Natural Bo∣dy to be but a more fine and subtle part of the Matter, as Spirit of Wine is of Wine, which upon its recess remains no longer Wine, but Flegm or Vinegar, then the Eductive Power of Matter
might signifie something; and so it might, if with us they would allow the Form to be but a Modification of the Mattter; for then it would import b that the Matter may be so order'd  dispos'd by fit Agents, as to constitut a Body of such a sort and Denominati¦on: and so (to resume that Example the Form of a Sphaere may be said  lurk potentially in a piece of Brass, in a much as that Brass may by casting, tu¦ning, or otherwise, be so figur'd as  become a Sphaere. But this they w not admit, least they should make Form to be but Accidents, though it is o ought I know as little intelligible, ho what is educ'd out of any Matter, with∣out being either praeexistent, or being any part of the Matter, can be a tr Substance, as how that Roundness, tha makes a piece of Brass become a Sphere can be a new Substance in it. Nor ca they admit the other way of educing  Form out of Matter, as Spirit is out o
Wine, because then not onely Matter will be corruptible against their grounds, but Matter and Form would not be two differing and substantial Principles, but one and the same, though diversify'd by firmness, and grosseness, &c. which are but Acciden∣tal differences. I know they speak much of the efficacy of the Agent upon the Matter, in the Generation of Na∣tural Bodies, and tell us strange things of his manner of working. But not to spend time in examining those obscure niceties, I answer in short; That since the Agent, be he what he will, is but a Physical and finite Agent, and since what way soever he works, he can do nothing repugnant to the nature of things, the difficulty, that sticks with me, will still remain. For if the Form produc'd in Generation, be, as they would have it, a Substance, that was not before to be found any where out of that portion of Matter, wherewith it
constitutes the Generated Body; I say that either it must be produc'd, by re∣fining or subtiliating some parts of the Matter into Form, or else it must b produc'd out of nothing, that is, Cre∣ted, (for I see no Third way, how a Sub∣stance can be produc'd de novo.) If they allow the First, then will the Form b indeed a Substance, but not, as they hol it is, distinct from Matter; since Matter however subtiliated, is Matter still,  the finest Spirit of Wine is as truly Body, as was the Wine it self, that ye∣ded it, or as is the Grosser Flegm, from which it was extracted: besides that, the Peripateticks teach, that the Form is no made of any thing of the Matter; n indeed is it conceivable, how a Physica Agent can turn a Material into an Im∣material Substance, especially Matte being, as they themselves confesse, a well incorruptible as ingenerable. B if they will not allow, as indeed they do not, that the substantial Form is made
of any thing that is Material, they must give me leave to believe, that tis pro∣duc'd out of Nothing, till they shew me, how a Substance can be produc'd other∣wise, that existed no where before. And at this rate every Natural Body of a spe∣cial Denomination, as Gold, Marble, Nitre, &c. must not be produc'd barely by Generation, but partly by Genera∣tion, and partly by Creation. And since tis confess'd on all sides, that no Natu∣ral Agent can produce the least Atome of Matter, tis strange they should in Ge∣neration allow every Physical Agent the power of producing a Form, which, according to them, is not onely a Sub∣stance, but a far nobler one then Mat∣ter, and thereby attribute to the mea∣nest Creatures that power of creating Substances, which the Antient Natura∣lists thought too great to be ascrib'd to God himself, and which indeed is too great to be ascrib'd to any other then Him, and therefore some Schoolmen
and Philosophers have deriv'd Forms immediately from God; but this is not onely to desert Aristotle and the Peri∣patetick Philosophy they would seem to maintain, but to put Omnipotence upon working I know not how many thousand Miracles every hour, to per∣forme that (I mean the Generation of Bodies of new Denominations) in a su∣pernatural way, which seems the most familiar effect of Nature in her ordinary course. And as the Production of Forms out of the Power of Matter is for these Rea∣sons incomprehensible to me, so those things, which the Peripateticks ascribe to their substantial Forms, are some of them such, as, I confesse, I cannot recon∣cile my Reason to: for they tell us posi∣tively, that these Forms are Substan∣ces, and yet at the same time they teach, that they depend upon Matter, both in fieri and in esse, as they speak, so that out of the Matter, that supports them,
they cannot so much as exist, (whence they are usually call'd Material Forms,) which is to make them Substances in name, and but Accidents in truth: for not to ask how (among Physical things) one Substance can be said to depend upon another in fieri, that is not made of any part of it, that very notion of a Substance is to be a self-subsisting Enti∣ty, or that which needs no other Created Being to support it, or to make it exist. Besides that, there being but two sorts of Substances, Material, and Immate∣rial, a substantial Form must appertain to one of the two, and yet they ascribe things to it, that make it very unfit to be referr'd to either. To all this I adde, that these imaginary Material Forms do almost as much trouble the Doctrine of Corruption, as that of Generation: for if a Form be a true Substance really distinct from Matter, it must, as I lately noted, be able to exist of it self, with∣out any other Substance to support it;
as those I reason with confess, that the Soul of Man survives the Body, it did before Death inform: whereas they will have it, that in Corruption the Form is quite abolish'd, and utterly perishes, as not being capable of existing, separated from the Matter, whereunto it was uni∣ted: so that here again, what they call a Substance they make indeed an Acci∣dent, and besides contradict their own vulgar Doctrine, That Natural things are upon their Corruption resolv'd into the first Matter, since at this rate they should say, that such things are but part∣ly resolv'd into the first Matter, and partly either into Nothing, or into Forms, which being as well immaterial as the Souls of Men, must, for ought appears, be also, like them, accounted immortal. I should now examine those Argu∣ments, that are wont to be imploy'd by the Schools to evince their substantial Forms, but, besides that the nature and
scope of my present Work injoynes me Brevity, I confesse that, one or two excepted, the Arguments I have found mention'd, as the chief, are rather Meta∣physical, or Logical, then grounded up∣on the Principles and Phaenomena of Nature, and respect rather Words then Things, and therefore I, who have nei∣ther inclination, nor leasure, to wrangle about Terms, shall content my self to propose, and very briefly answer two or three of those that are thought the plau∣siblest. First then they thus argue. Omne Compositum substantiale (for it is hard to English well such Uncouth Terms) requirit materiam & formam substantia∣lem, ex quibus componatur. Omne corpus naturale est compositū substantiale. Ergo &c. In this Syllogisme some do plau∣sibly enough deny the Consequence, but for brevities sake, I shall rather choose to deny the Minor, and desire the Proposers to prove it. For I know
not any thing in Nature that is com∣pos'd of Matter, and a Substance distinct from Matter, except Man, who alone is made up of an immaterial Form, and a humane Body; and if it be urg'd, that then other Bodies cannot be properly said to be Composita substantialia: I shall, rather then wrangle with them, give them leave to find out some other name for other Natural things. But then they argue in the next place, that, if there were no substantial Forms, all Bodies would be but Entia per acci∣dens, as they speak, which is absurd. To which I answer, That in the Notion, that divers Learned men have of an Ens per Accidens, namely, that tis That which consists of those things, quae non ordi∣nantur ad unum, it may be said, That though we do not admit substantial Forms, yet we need not admit Natural Bodies to be Entia per accidens; because in them the several things that concur to constitute the Body, as Matter,
Shape, Scituation, and Motion, ordi∣nantur per se & intrinsecè to constitute one Natural Body. But, if this An∣swer satisfie not, I shall adde, that for my part, That which I am sollicitous about, is, what Nature hath made things to be in themselves, not what a Logi∣cian or Metaphysician will call them in the Terms of his Art; it being much fitter in my judgment to alter Words, that they may better fit the Nature of Things, then to affix a wrong Nature to Things, that they may be accommo∣dated to forms of Words, that were probably devis'd, when the things themselves were not known or vvell understood, if at all thought on. Wherefore I shall but adde one Ar∣gument more of this sort, and That is, that, if there vvere no substantial Forms, neither could there be any substantial Definitions, but the Consequent is ab∣surd, and therefore so is the Antecedent. To vvhich I reply, that since the Peri∣pateticks
themselves confess the Forms of Bodies to be of themselves un∣known, all that this Argument seems to me to conclude, is but this, That if we do not admit somethings, that are not in rerum natura, we cannot build our De∣finitions upon them: nor indeed could we, if we should admit substantial Forms, give substantial Definitions of Natural things, unlesse we could also define Natural Bodies by things that we know not; for such Nego tibi uilm esse formam nobis notam plenè & pla∣nè, nostram{que} scientiam esse umbram in Sole. Scalig. the substantial Forms are (as we have seen already) con∣fess'd to be, by the wisest Peripateticks, who pretend not to give the substantial Definition of any Natural Compositum, except Man. But it may suffice Us to have, instead of substantial, essential De∣finitions of things; I mean such as are taken from the Essential Differences of things, which constitute them in such a sort of Natural Bodies, and discriminate
them from all those of any other sort. These three Arguments, Pyrophilus, for substantial Forms, You may possi∣bly, as well as I, find variously propos'd, and perhaps with some light alterations multiply'd in the writings of the Peripa∣teticks and Schoolmen; but all the Ar∣guments of this kind that I have met with, may, if I mistake not, be suffici∣ently solv'd by the Answers we have given to these▪ or at least by the grounds upon which those Answers are built; those seemingly various Arguments a∣greeing in this, That either they respect rather Words then Things, or that they are grounded upon precarious Supposi∣tions; or lastly that they urge That as an Absurdity, which, whether it be one or not in those, that admit the Peripate∣tick Philosophy, to me, that do as little acquiesce in many of their other Princi∣ples, as I do in their substantial Forms, doth not appear any Absurdity at all. And tis perhaps for fear that Argu∣ments
of this sort should not much pre∣vaile with Naturalists, that some of the Modern assertors of the Forms we que∣stion, have thought it requisite to adde some more Physical Arguments, which (though I have not found them all in the same Writers, yet) being in all but few, I shall here briefly consider them. First then among the Physical Argu∣ments, that are brought to prove sub∣stantial Forms, I find That the most confidently insisted on, which is taken from the spontaneous return of heated Water to Coldness, which Effects, say they, must necessarily be ascrib'd to the Action of the substantial Form, whose office it is to preserve the Body in its Natural state, and, when there is occa∣sion, to reduce it thereunto: and the Ar∣gument indeed might be plausible, if we were sure, that heated Water would grow cold again (without the Avolati∣on of any Parts more agitated then the rest,) supposing it to be remov'd into
some of the imaginary spaces beyond the World; but as the case is, I see no necessity of slying to a substantial Form, the Matter seeming to be easily explicable otherwise. The Water we heat is surrounded with our Air, or with some Vessel, or other Body contiguous to the Air, and both the Air and the Water in these Climates are most com∣monly lesse agitated, then the Juices in our hands, or other Organs of Touch∣ing, which makes us esteem and call those Fluids, cold. Now when the Wa∣ter is expos'd to the fire, it is thereby put into a new Agitation, more vehe∣ment then that of the parts of our Sen∣sory, which you will easily grant, if you consider, that when the Heat is intense, it makes the Water boyl and smoak, and oftentimes run over the Vessel; but when the Liquor is remov'd from the fire, this acquir'd Agitation must needs by degrees be lost, either by the avola∣tion of such fiery Corpuscles as the
Epicureans imagine to be got into heated Water, or by the Water's com∣municating the Agitation of its Parts to the contiguous Air, or to the Vesse that contains it, till it have lost its sur∣plusage of Motion, or by the ingress o those frigorifick Atoms, wherewith (i any such be to be granted) the Air i these Climates is wont to abound, and so be reduc'd into its former Tempera∣ture: which may as well be done with¦out a substantial Form, as if a Shi swimming slowly down a River, should by a sudden gust of Wind, blowing the same way the Stream runs, be driven o much faster then before, the Vessel upo the ceasing of the Wind may, without any such internal principle, return after a while to its former slowness of Moti∣on. So that in this Phaenomenon, we need not have recourse to an internal princi∣ple, the Temperature of the extern Air being sufficient to give an acco of it. And if Water be kept, (as is u∣sual
in poor mens houses that want Cel∣lars,) in the upper Rooms of the house, in case the Climate be hot, the Water will, in spight of the Form, continue far lesse cold, then, accordng to the Peri∣pateticks, its nature requires, all the Summer long. And let me here re∣present to the Champions of Forms, that, according to their Doctrine, the Fluidity of Water, must at least as much proceed from its Form as the Coldnesse, and yet this does so much depend upon the Temperature of the Air, that in Nova Zembla vast quanti∣ties of Water are kept in the hard and solid Form of Ice all the year long, by the sharp Cold of the ambient Air, not∣withstanding all the pretended Office and Power of the substantial Form to keep it fluid, which it will never be re∣duc'd to be, unlesse by such a thawing Temperature of the Air, as would it self, for ought appears, make it flow a∣gain, although there were no substanti∣al
Form in rerum naturâ. There is another Argument much urg'd of late by some Learned Men, the substance whereof is this; That Matte being indifferent to one sort of Acci∣dents as well as to another, it is necessa∣ry there should be a substantial Form to keep those Accidents, which are said to constitute it, united to the Matter they belong to, and preserve both then and the Body in their Natural state; so since tis confess'd, that Matter hath o appetite to these Accidents, more th to any others, they demand, how with∣out a substantial Form these Acciden can be contain'd and preserv'd? T this I might represent, that I am not  well satisfy'd with the Notion wont i be taken for granted, not onely by the vulgar, but by Philosophers, of the Na∣tural state of Bodies; as if it were unde¦niable, that every Natural Body, (for a to some, I shall not now question it,) has a certain state, wherein Nature en∣deavours
to preserve it, and out of which it cannot be put, but by being put into a Praeternatural state. For the World being once constituted by the great Au∣thor of Things, as it now is, I look upon the Phaenomena of Nature to be caus'd by the Local Motion of one part of Matter hitting against another, and am not so fully convinc'd, that there is such a thing, as Natures designing to keep such a parcel of Matter in such a state, that is cloth'd with just such Accidents, rather then with any other. But I look upon many Bodies, especially fluid ones, as frequently changing their state, according as they happen to be more or lesse agitated, or otherwise wrought up∣on by the Sun, and other considerable Agents in Nature. As the Air, Water, and other Fluids, if the temperature as to Cold or Heat, and Rarefaction or Condensation, which they are in at the beginning of the Spring here at London, be pitcht upon as their Natural state,
then not onely in the torrid and frozen Zones they must have other and very differing Natural states, but here it self they will, almost all the Summer and all the Winter, as our Weather Glasses in∣form us, be in a varying Praeternatural state, because they will be in those sea∣sons either more hot and rarify'd, or more cold and condens'd, then in the be∣ginning of the Spring. And in more sta∣ble and constant Bodies I take, in many cases, the Natural state to be but either the most usual state, or That, wherein that, which produces a notable Change in them, finds them. As when a slender piece of Silver, that is most commonly flexible, and will stand bent every way, comes to be well hammer'd, I count that Flexibility to be the Natural state of that Mettal, because most common∣ly Silver is found to be flexible, and be∣cause it was so before it was hammer'd; but the Springinesse it acquires by ham∣mering is a state, which is properly no
more unnatural to the Silver then the other, and would continue with the Mettal as long as It, if both pieces of Silver, the one flexible, the other sprin∣gy, were let alone, and kept from out∣ward violence: And as the Silver, to be depriv'd of its flexibleness, needed the violent Motion of the Hammer, so to deprive it of its Spring, it needs the vio∣lent Agitation of a nealing fire. These things, and much more, I might here represent, but to come close to the Ob∣jection, I Answer, That the Accidents spoken of are introduced into the Mat∣ter by the Agents or Efficient Causes, whatever they be, that produce in it what, in the sense formerly explain'd, we call an essential (though not a substantial) Form. And these Accidents being once thus introduc'd into the Matter, we need not seek for a new substantial Principle to preserve them there, since by the general law, or common course of Nature, the Matter qualify'd by
them, must continue in the state such Accidents have put it into, till, by some Agent or other, it be forcibly put out of it, and so divested of those Accidents; as in the formerly mention'd Example, borrow'd from Aristotle, of a Brazen Sphaere, when once the Motion of Tools, impell'd and guided by the Ar∣tificer, have turn'd a piece of Brass into a Sphaere, there needs no new Substance to preserve that round figure, since the Brasse must retain it, till it be destroy'd by the Artificer himself, or some other Agent able to overcome the resistance of the Matter, to be put into another figure. And on this occasion let me confirme this ad hominem, by represen∣ting, That there is not an inconsiderable Party among the Peripateticks them∣selves, who maintain, That in the Ele∣ments the First Qualities (as they call them) are instead of Forms, and that the Fire (for instance) hath no other Form then Heat and Drynesse, and the
Water then Coldnesse and Moisture. Now if these Bodies, that are the vast∣est and the most important of the Sub∣lunary World, consist but of the Uni∣versal Matter, and the few Accidents; and if in these there needs no substanti∣al Form to keep the Qualities of the Matter united to it, and conjoyn'd a∣mong themselves, and preserve them in that state, as long as the Law of Na∣ture requires, though besides the four Qualities that are call'd First, the Ele∣ments have divers others, as Gravity and Levity, Firmnesse and Fluidity, Opacousnesse and Transparency, &c. why should the favourers of this Opini∣on deny, That, in other Bodies besides the Elements, Qualities may be pre∣serv'd and kept united to the Matter they belong to, without the Band or Support of a substantial Form? And as, when there is no competent destructive Cause, the Accidents of a Body will by the Law of Nature remain such as they
were, so if there be, it cannot with rea∣son be pretended, that the substantial Form is able to preserve all those Acci∣dents of a Body, that are said to slow from it, and to be as it were under its care and tuition; for if, for instance, you expose a Sphaere or Bullet of Lead to a strong fire, it will quickly loose (not to mention its Figure) both its Coldness, its Consistence, its Malleableness, its Colour, (for 'twill appear of the colour of fire,) its Flexibility, and some other Qualities, and all this in spight of the imaginary substantial Form, which, ac∣cording to the Peripatetical Principles, in this case must still remain in it with∣out being able to help it. And though upon the taking the Lead from off the fire, it is wont to be reduc'd to most of its former Qualities, (for it will not of it self recover its Sphaericity,) yet That may well be ascrib'd partly to its peculiar Texture, and partly to the Coldness of the ambient Air, according to what we
lately discours'd touching heated and re∣frigerated Water, which Temperature of the Air is an extrinsecal thing to the Lead, and indeed it is but Accidental, that the Lead upon refrigeration regains its former Qualities; for in case the Lead have been expos'd long enough to a suf∣ficiently intense fire, it will (as we have purposely try'd) be turn'd into Glasse, and loose its colour, its opacity, its mal∣leableness, and (former degree of) flexi∣blenesse, and acquire a Reddishness, a degree of Transparency, a Brittlenesse, and some other Qualities, that it had not before: and let the supposed substantial Form do what it can, even when the Vessel is remov'd from the fire, to re∣duce or restore the Body to its Natural state and Accidents, yet the former Qualities will remain lost, as long as these Praeternatural ones, introduc'd by the fire, continue in the Matter; and nei∣ther the one will be restor'd, nor the o∣ther destroy'd, till some sufficiently
powerful extrinsick Agent effect the Change. And on the other side I con∣sider, that the Fruit, when sever'd from the Tree it grew on, is confess'd to be no longer animated (at least the Kernels or Seeds excepted) by the Vegetative Soul, or substantial Form of the Plant; yet in an Orange or Lemmon (for in∣stance) pluckt from the Tree, we see, that the same Colour, the same Odour, the same Tast, the same Figure, the same Consistence, and, for ought we know, the same other Qualities, whether sen∣sible, or even occult, as are its Antido∣tal and Antiscorbutical virtues, that must before be said to have flow'd from the Soul of the Tree, will continue, ma∣ny months, perhaps some years, after the fruit has ceas'd to have any com∣merce with the Tree, (nay though the Tree, whereon it grew, be perhaps in the mean time hewn down or burnt, and though consequently its Vegetative Soul or Form be destroy'd,) as when it
grew thereon, and made up one Plant with it. And we find, that Tamarinds, Rhubarb, Senna, and many other Sim∣ples will for divers years, after they have been depriv'd of their former Vegeta∣tive Soul, retain their Purgative and o∣ther Specifick properties. I find it likewise urg'd, that there can be no Reason, why Whiteness should be separable from a Wall, and not from Snow or Milk; unlesse we have recourse to substantial Forms. But in case men have agreed to call a thing by such a name, because it has such a particular Quality, that differences it from others, we need go no farther to find a Reason, why one Quality is essential to one thing, and not to another. As in our former example of a Brass Sphaere, the Figure is that, for which we give it that Name, and therefore, though you may alter the figure of the Matter, yet by that very alteration the Body perishes in the capacity of a Sphaere, whereas its
Coldness may be exchang'd for Heat, without the making it the less a Sphaere, because tis not for any such Quality, but for Roundness, that a Bo∣dy is said to be a Sphaere. And so Firmness is an inseparable Quality of Ice, though this or that particular Figure be not, because that tis for want of fluidity, that any thing, that was im∣mediately before a Liquor, is call'd Ice, and congruously hereunto, though Whiteness were inseparable from Snow and Milk, yet that would not necessarily infer, that there must be a substantial Form to make it so: for the Firmness of the Corpuscles, that compose Snow, is as inseparable from it, as the Whitenesse; and yet is not pretended to be the effect of the substantial Form of the Water, but of the excesse of the Coldnesse of the Air, which (to use vulgar, though perhaps unaccurate, expressions,) puts the Water out of its Natural state of Fluidity, and into a Praeternatural one
Firmness and Brittleness. And the rea∣son, why Snow seldome looses its white∣ness but with its nature, seems to be, that its component Particles are so dis∣pos'd, that the same heat of the ambi∣ent Air, that is sit to turn it into a trans∣parent Body, is also fit to make it a flu∣id one, which when it is become, we no longer call it Snow, but Water; so that the Water looses its whiteness, though the Snow do not. But if there be a cause proper to make a convenient alteration of Texture in the Snow, without mel∣ting or resolving it into water, it may then exchange its Whiteness for Yel∣lownesse, without loosing its right to be call'd Snow; as, I remember, I have read in an eminent Writer, that de facto in the Northern Regions towards the Pole, those parcels of Snow, that have lain very long on the ground, degene∣rate in time into a Yellowish colour, ve∣ry differing from that pure Whiteness to be observ'd in the neighbouring
Snow lately fallen. But there yet remains an Argument for substantial Forms, which though (perhaps because Physical) wont to be overlook'd, or slightly answer'd by their Opposers, will for the same reason de∣serve to be taken notice of here; and it is, That there seems to be a necessity of admitting substantial Forms in Bodies, that from thence we may derive all the various changes, to which they are sub∣ject, and the differing Effects they pro∣duce, [the Preservation and Restitution of the State requisite to each particular Body,] as also the keeping of its seve∣ral parts united into one Totum. To the answering of this Argument, so many things will be found applicable, both in the past and subsequent parts of these Notes, that I shall at present but point the chief particulars, on which the Solu∣tion is grounded. I consider then first, that many and great Alterations may happen to Bo∣dies,
which seem manifestly to proceed from their peculiar Texture, and the Action of outward Agents upon them, and of which it cannot be shewn, that they would happen otherwise, though there were no substantial Forms in re∣rum natura: as we see that Tallow (for instance) being melted by the fire looses its Coldness, Firmness, and its White∣ness, and acquires Heat, Fluidity, and some Transparency, all which, being suffer'd to cool, it presently exchanges for the three first nam'd Qualities. And yet divers of these Changes are plainly enough the effects partly of the Fire, partly of the ambient Air, and not of I know not what substantial Form: and it is both evident and remarkable, what great variety of changes in Qualities, and Productions of new ones, the Fire (that is, a Body consisting of insensible parts, that are variously and vehemently mov'd) doth effect by its Heat, that is, by a modify'd Local Motion. I consider
further, that various Operations of a Body may be deriv'd from the peculiar Texture of the Whole, and the Mecha∣nical Affections of the particular Cor∣puscles or other parts that compose it, as we have often occasion to declare here and there in this Treatise; and particu∣larly by an Instance, ere long to be fur∣ther insisted on, namely, that though Vitriol, made of Iron with a Corrosive liquor, be but a factitious Body, made by a convenient apposition of the small parts of the saline Menstruum to those of the Mettal, yet this Vitriol will do most, if not all, of the same things, that Vitriol, made by Nature in the bowels of the Earth, and digg'd out thence, will perform; and each of these Bodies may be endow'd with variety of differing Qualities, which I see not, why they must flow, in the native Vitriol, from a substantial Form, since in the factitious Vitriol, the same Qualities belong to a Form, that does plainly emerge from
the coalition of Metalline and Saline Corpuscles, associated together and dis∣pos'd of after a certain manner. And lastly, as to what is very confi∣dently, as well as plausibly, pretended, That a substantial Form is requisite to keep the parts of a Body united, without which it would not be one Body. I an∣swer, That the contrivance of conveni∣ently figur'd parts, and in some cases their juxta-position, may without the assistance of a substantial Form be suffi∣cient for this matter; for not to repeat what I just now mention'd concerning Vitriol made by Art, whose Parts are as well united and kept together, as those of the Native Vitriol, I observe▪ that a Pear grafted upon a Thorn, or a Plum inoculated upon an Apricock, will bear good fruit, and grow up with the Stock, as though they both made but one Tree, and were animated but by the same common Form; whereas indeed both the Stock and the inoculated or
grafted Plant have each of them its o Form, as may appear by the differing leaves, and fruits, and seeds they be▪ And that which makes to our presen purpose is, that even Vegetation and the Distribution of Aliments are in such cases well made, though the nourish'd parts of the Total Plant, if I may so ca it, have not one common Soul or Form which is yet more remarkable in the Misletoes, that I have seen growing up∣on old Hazletrees, Crab-trees, Apple-trees, and other plants, in which the Misletoe often differs very widely from that kind of Plant on which it grow and prospers. And for the durableness of the Union betwixt Bodies that a sub∣stantial Form is not requisite to procure it, I have been induc'd to think by con¦sidering, that Silver and Gold, being barely mingl'd by Infusion, will ha their minute parts more closely united then those of any Plant or Animal tha we know of. And there is scarce any
Natural Body, wherein the Form makes so strict, durable, and indissoluble an U∣nion of the parts it consists of, as that, which, in that Factitious Concrete we call Glass, arises from the bare com∣mistion of the Corpuscles of Sand with those Saline ones, wherewith they are colliquated by the violence of the fire: and the like may be said of the Union of the proper Accidents of Glasse with the Matter of it, and betwixt one ano∣ther. To draw towards a Conclusion, I know tis alledg'd as a main Consideration on the behalf of substantial Forms, that these being in Natural Bodies the true principles of their Properties, and con∣sequently of their Operations, their Natural Philosophy must needs be ve∣ry imperfect and defective, who will not take in such Forms: but for my part I confess, that this very consideration does rather indispose then incline me to admit them. For if indeed there were
in every Natural Body such a thing as a substantial Form, from which all its Properties and Qualities immediately flow, since we see that the Actions o Bodies upon one another are for the most part (if not all) immediately per∣form'd by their Qualities or Accidents, it would scarce be possible to explicate very many of the explicable Phaenomen of Nature, without having recourse to Them; and it would be strange, if many of the abstruser Phaenomena were not ex∣plicable by them onely. Whereas indee almost all the rational Accounts to be met with of difficult Phaenomena, are given by such as either do not acknow∣ledge, or at least do not take notice of substantial Forms. And tis evident by the clear Solutions (untouch'd by many vulgar Philosophers,) we meet with of many Phaenomena in the Staticks, and o∣ther parts of the Mechanicks, and espe∣cially in the Hydrostaticks, and Pneu∣maticks, how clearly many Phaenomena
may be solv'd, without imploying a sub∣stantial Form. And on the other side, I do not remember, that either Aristo∣tle himself, (who perhaps scarce ever at∣tempted it,) or any of his Followers, has given a solid and intelligible soluti∣on of any one Phaenomenon of Nature by the help of substantial Forms; which you need not think it strange I should say, since the greatest Patrons of Forms acknowledg their Nature to be Nomina tu lapidis, qi quoidie tuis oculis observatur, formam, & Phyllida solus habeto. Seal. contra Card. un∣known to Us, to explain any Effect by a substantial Form, must be to declare (as they speak) ignotum per ignotius, or at least per aquè ignotum. And indeed to explicate a Phaenomenon, being to deduce it from something else in Na∣ture more known to Us, then the thing to be explain'd by It, how can the im∣ploying of Incomprehensible (or at least Uncomprehended) substantial Forms help Us to explain intelligibly This or
That particular Phaenomenon? For to say, that such an Effect proceeds not from this or that Quality of the Agent, but from its substantial Form, is to take an easie way to resolve all difficulties in general, without rightly resolving any one in particular; and would make a rare Philosophy, if it were not far more easie then satisfactory: for if it be demanded, why Jet attracts Straws, Rhubarb pur∣ges Choller, Snow dazles the Eyes ra∣ther then Grasse, &c. to say, that these and the like Effects are perform'd by the substantial Forms of the respective Bodies, is at best but to tell me, what is the Agent, not how the Effect is wrought; and seems to be but such a kind of general way of answering, as leaves the curious Enquirer as much to seek for the causes and manner of parti∣cular Things, as Men commonly are for the particular causes of the several strang Things perform'd by Witchcraft, though they be told, that tis some Di∣vel
that does them all. Wherefore I do not think, but that Natural Philosophy, without being for That the more De∣fective, may well enough spare the Do∣ctrine of Substantial Forms as an useless Theory; not that Men are yet arriv'd to be able to explicate all the Phaenome∣na of Nature without them, but be∣cause, whatever we cannot explicate without them, we cannot neither intel∣ligibly explicate by them. And thus, Pyrophilus, I have offer'd You some of those many things, that in∣dispos'd me to acquiesce in the receiv'd Doctrine of Substantial Forms; but in case any more piercing Enquirer shall perswade himself, that he understands it throughly, and can explicate it clearly, I shall congratulate him for such happy Intellectuals, and be very ready to be inform'd by him. But since what the Schools are wont to teach of the Ori∣gine and Attributes of substantial Forms, is that, which, I confess, I can∣not
yet comprehend; and since I have some of the eminentest Persons among the Modern Philosophers to joine with me, though perhaps not for the same Considerations, in the like confession, that tis not necessary the Reason of my not finding this Doctrine conceivable, must be rather a Defectiveness in my Understanding, then the unconceivable nature of the thing it self: I, who love not (in matters purely Philosophical) to acquiesce in what I do not understand, nor to go about to explicate things to others, by what appears to me it self in∣explicable, shall, I hope, be excus'd, if, leaving those that contend for them, the liberty of making what use they can of substantial Forms, I do, till I be better satisfied, decline imploying them my self, and endeavour to solve those Phae∣nomena, I attempt to give an account of, without them, as not scrupling to con∣fess, that those that I cannot explicate, at least in a general way, by intelligible
principles, I am not yet arriv'd to the distinct and particular knowledg of. Now for our Doctrine touching the Origine of Forms, it will not be diffi∣cult to collect it from what we former∣ly discours'd about Qualities and Forms together: for the Form of a Natural Body, being according to us, but an Es∣sential Modification, and, as it were, the Stamp of its Matter, or such a conven∣tion of the Bigness, Shape, Motion (or Rest,) Scituation and Contexture, (to∣gether with the thence resulting Quali∣ties) of the small parts that compose the Body, as is necessary to constitute and denominate such a particular Body; and all these Accidents being produci∣ble in Matter by Local Motion, 'tis a∣greeable to our Hypothesis to say, That the first and Universal, though not im∣mediate cause of Forms is none other but God, who put Matter into Motion, (which belongs not to its Essence,) and Establish'd the Laws of Motion amongst
Bodies, and also, according to my Opi∣nion, guided it in divers cases at the be∣ginning of Things; and that, among Se∣cond Causes, the Grand Efficient of Forms is Local Motion, which by vari∣ously dividing, sequestring, transposing, and so connecting the parts of Matter, produces in them those Accidents and Qualities, upon whose account the por∣tion of Matter they diversifie comes to belong to this or that determinate spe∣cies of Natural Bodies, which yet is not so to be understood, as if Motion were onely an Efficient cause in the Genera∣tion of Bodies, but very often (as in, water, fire, &c.) tis also one of the chiefe Accidents, that concurre to make up the Form. But in this last Summary Account of the Origine of Forms, I think my self oblig'd to declare to you a little more distinctly, what I just now intimated to be my own Opinion. And this I shall do, by advertising you, that though I
agree with our Epicureans, in thinking it probable, that the World is made up of an innumerable multitude of singly insensible Corpuscles, endow'd with their own Sizes, Shapes, and Mo∣tions; and though I agree with the Car∣tesians, in believing (as I find that Aristotle speaking of Anaxagoras in the first Ch. of the last Book of his Physicks, hath this passage: Dicit (Anaxagoras) cùm omnia simul essent, atque quesceret tempore infinito, Mentem movisse, a segregasse. A∣naxagoras did of Old,) that Matter hath not its Motion from its self, but Origi∣nally from God; yet in This I differ both from Epicurus and Des Cartes, that, whereas the former of them plain∣ly denies, that the World was made by any Deity, (for Deities he own'd,) and the Latter of them, for ought I can find in his Writings, or those of some of his Eminentest Disciples, thought, that God, having once put Matter into Mo∣tion, and establish'd the Laws of that Motion, needed not more particularly
interpose for the Production of Things Corporeal, nor even of Plants or Ani∣mals, which according to him are but Engines: I do not at all believe, that ei∣ther these Cartesian Laws of Motion, or the Epicurean casual Concourse of A∣toms, could bring meer Matter into so orderly and well contriv'd a Fabrick as This World; and therefore I think, that the wise Author of Nature did not one∣ly put Matter into Motion, but when he resolv'd to make the World, did so re∣gulate and guide the Motions of the small parts of the Universal Matter, as to reduce the greater Systems of them into the Order they were to continue in; and did more particularly contrive some portions of that Matter into Seminal Rudiments or Principles, lodg'd in con∣venient Receptacles, (and as it were Wombs,) and others into the Bodies of Plants and Animals: one main part of whose Contrivance, did, as I apprehend, consist in this, That some of their Or∣gans
were so fram'd, that, supposing the Fabrick of the greater Bodies of the U∣niverse, and the Laws he had establish'd in Nature, some Juicy and Spirituous parts of these living Creatures must be fit to be turn'd into Prolifick Seeds, whereby they may have a power, by generating their like, to propagate their Species. So that according to my ap∣prehension, it was at the beginning ne∣cessary, that an Intelligent and Wise Agent should contrive the Universal Matter into the World, (and especially some Portions of it into Seminal Or∣gans and Principles,) and settle the Laws, according to which the Motions and Actions of its parts upon one ano∣ther should be regulated: without which interposition of the Worlds Architect, however moving Matter may with some probability (for I see not in the Notion any Certainty) be conceiv'd to be able, after numberless Occursions of its insen∣sible parts, to cast it self into such
grand Conventions and Convolutions, as the Cartesians call Vortices, and as, I remember; Epicurus in his Epistle to Pythocles. Epicurus speaks of under the name of ; yet I think it utterly improbable, that brute and unguided, though moving, Matter, should ever convene into such admira∣ble Structures, as the Bodies of perfect Animals. But the World being once fram'd, and the course of Nature esta∣blish'd, the Naturalist, (except in some few cases, where God, or Incorporeal Agents interpose,) has recourse to the first Cause but for its general and ordi∣nary Support and Influence, whereby it preserves Matter and Motion from An∣nihilation or Desition; and in explica∣ting particular Phaenomena, considers onely the Size, Shape, Motion, (or want of it) Texture, and the resulting Quali∣ties and Attributes of the small parti∣cles of Matter. And thus in this great Automaton the World, (as in a Watch
or Clock,) the Materials it consists of, being left to themselves, could never at the first convene into so curious an Engine: and yet, when the skilful Ar∣tist has once made and set it a going, the Phaenomena it exhibits are to be ac∣counted for by the number, bignesse, pro∣portion, shape, motion, (or endeavour,) rest, coapration, and other Mechanical Affections of the Spring, Wheels, Pil∣lars, and other parts it is made up of: and those effects of such a Watch, that cannot this way be explicated, must, for ought I yet know, be confess'd, not to be sufficiently understood. But to return thither, whence my Duty to the Author of Nature oblig'd me, to make this short Digression. The hitherto propos'd Hypothesis, touching the Origination of Forms, hath, I hope, been rendred probable by divers particulars in the past Discour∣ses, and will be both exemplify'd and confirm'd by some of the Experiments,
that make the Latter part of this pre∣sent Treatise, (especially the Fifth and 7th of them,) which, containing Expe∣riments of the Changing the Form of a Salt and a Mettal, do chiefly belong to the Historical or Experimental part of what we deliver touching the Origine of Forms. And indeed, besides the two kinds of Experiments presently to be mention'd, we might here present you a Third sort, consisting partly of divers Relations of Metalline Trans∣mutations, deliver'd upon their own Credit by Credible men, that are not Alchymists; and partly of some Expe∣riments (some made, some directed by us) of Changing both Bodies, totally inflammable, almost totally into Water, and a good part ev'n of distill'd Rain water without Additament into Earth; and distill'd Liquors, readily and totally mingleable with Water, pro parte into a true Oyle, that will not mix with it, This sort of Experiments, I say, I might
here annex, if I thought fit, in this place, either to lay any stresse upon those, that I cannot my self make out, or to trans∣fer hither those Experiments of Chan∣ges amongst Bodies not Metalline, that belong to another The Sceptical Chymist. Treatise. But o∣ver and above, what the past Notes and the Experiments, that are to follow them, contain towards the making of what we teach concerning Forms, we will here, for further Confirmation, pro∣ceed to adde two sorts of Experiments, (besides the Third already mention'd.) The one, wherein it appears, that Bodies of very differing Natures, being put to∣gether, like the Wheels, and other pei∣ces of a Watch, and by their connecti∣on acquiring a new Texture, and so new Qualities, may, without having re∣course to a substantial Form, compose such a new Concrete, as may as well de∣serve to have a substantial Form attri∣buted to it, by virtue of that new Dis∣position
of its parts, as other Bodies that are said to be endow'd therewith. And the other, that a Natural Body be∣ing dissipated, and as it were taken in peices, like a Watch, may have its parts so associated, as to constitute New Bo∣dies, of Natures very differing from its own, and from each other; and yet these dissipated and scatter'd parts, by being recollected and put together again, like the pieces of a Watch, in the like order as before, may recompose (almost, if not more then almost) such another Body, as that they made up, before they were taken asunder.
I. EXPERIMENTS, and THOUGHTS, about the Production and Repro∣duction of FORMS. IT was not at randome, that I spoke, when, in the foregoing Notes about the Origine of Qualities, I intimated, That 'twas very much by a kind of tacit agreement, that Men had distinguish'd the Species of Bodies, and that those Distinctions were more Arbitrary then we are wont to be aware of. For I con∣fesse, that I have not yet, either in Ari∣stotle, or any other Writer, met with a∣ny genuine and sufficient Diagnostick and Boundary, for the Discriminating
and limiting the Species of Things, or to speak more plainly, I have not found, that any Naturalist has laid down a de∣terminate Number and sort of Quali∣ties, or other Attributes, which is suffi∣cient and necessary to constitute all por∣tions of Matter, endow'd with them, di∣stinct Kinds of Natural Bodies. And therefore I observe, that most com∣monly Men look upon these as Di∣stinct Species of Bodies, that have had the luck to have distinct Names found out for them; though perhaps diverse of them differ much lesse from one ano∣ther, then other Bodies, which (because they have been hudled up under one Name,) have been look'd upon, as but one sort of Bodies. But not to lay any weight on this Intimation about Names, I found, that for want of a true Characteristick, or discriminating notes, it hath been, and is still, both very un∣certain as to divers Bodies, whether they are of different Species or of the same,
and very difficult to give a sufficient rea∣son, why divers Bodies, wherein Nature is assisted by Art, should not as well pass for distinct kinds of Bodies, as others, that are generally reckon'd to be so. Whether (for instance) Water and Ice be not to be esteem'd distinct kinds of Bodies, is so little evident, that some, that pretend to be very well vers'd in Aristotle's Writings and Opinions, af∣firme him to teach, that Water looses not its own nature by being turn'd into Ice; and indeed I remember I have read a See Lib. 1. de Gen. & Cor. t. 80. Idem Corpus (sayes he there) quaquam continuum, aliàs liquidum, aliàs concre∣tum videmus, non divisione aut compositione hoc passum, aut conversione, aut attactu, sicuti Democritus asserit: nam neque transpositione, neque Naturae demutatione () ex liquido concretum evadere solet. Text of his, that seems express e∣nough to this purpose, and the thing it self is made plausible by the reducible∣nesse of ice back again into Water. And yet I remember, Galen is affirm'd to make these two, distinct Species of Bo∣dies;
which Doctrine is favour'd by the differing Qualities of Ice and Water, for not onely the one is fluid, and the other solid, and even brittle, but Ice is also commonly more or less opacous in comparison of Water, being also ligh∣ter then it in specie, since it swims up∣on it. To which may be added, that Ice, beaten with common Salt, will freez other Bodies, when Water mingled with Salt will not. And on this occasi∣on, I would propose to be resolv'd, whether Must, Wine, Spirit of Wine, Vinegar, Tartar, and Vappa, be Speci∣fically distinct Bodies? and the like que∣stion I would ask concerning a Hens Egg, and the Chick that is afterwards hatch'd out of it: As also concerning Wood, Ashes, Soot, and likewise the Eggs of Silkworms, which are first small Caterpillars, or (as some think them) but Worms, when they are newly hatch'd, and then Aurelia's, (or husked Maggots,) and then Butterflies, which I
have observ'd with pleasure to be the successive Production of the Prolifick Seed of Silkworms. And whether the Answer to these Quaeries be Affirmative or Negative, I doubt the reason, that will be given for either of the two, will not hold in divers cases, whereto I might apply it. And a more puzling Questi∣on it may be to some, whether a Char∣coal, being throughly kindled, do spe∣cifically differ from another Charcoal? for, according to those I argue with, the fire has penetrated it quite through; and therefore some of the recent Aristoteli∣ans are so convinc'd of its being trans∣muted, that all the satisfaction I could find from a very subtle modern School∣man to the Objection, That if the glow∣ing Coal were plung'd into Water, it would be a black Coal agen, was, That notwithstanding That reduction, the Form of a Charcoal had been once a∣bolish'd by the fire, and was reproduc'd by God, upon the regain'd Disposition
of the Matter to receive it. Nor is it very easie to determine, whether Clouds, and Rain, and Hal, and Snow, be bodies specifically distinc from Water, and from each other, and the writers of Meteors are wont to han∣dle them as distinct. And since if such slight differences as those, that discrimi∣nate these Bodies, or that which distin∣guishes Wind from Exhalations, whose Course makes it, be sufficient to consti∣tute differing kinds of Bodies, 'twill be hard to give a satisfactory Reason, why other Bodies, that differ in more or more considerable particulars, should not en∣joy the same Priviledge. And I presume, that Snow differs less from Rain, then Paper doth from Rags, or Glass made of Wood-ashes does from Wood. And indeed, Men having, by tacit consent, a∣greed to look upon Paper, and Glass, and Soape, and Sugar, and Brass, and Ink, and Pewter, and Gunpowder, and I know not how many others, to be di∣stinct
sorts of Bodies, I see not, why they may not be thought to have done it, on as good grounds, as those, upon which divers other dffering Species of Bodies have been constituted. Nor will it suf∣fice to object, that these Bodies are fa∣ctitious; for 'tis the present nature of Bodies, that ought to be consider'd in referring them to Species, which way soever they came by that Nature: for Salt, that is, in many Countries, made by boiling Sea water in Cauldrons, and o∣ther vessels, is as well true Sea-salt, as that which is made in the Isle of Man, (as Navigators call it,) without any co∣operation of Man, by the bare action of the Sun upon those parts of the Sea wa∣ter, which chance to be left behind in hollow places, after a high Spring-tide. And Silk worms, which will hatch by the heat of humane Bodies, and Chick∣ens, that are hatch'd in Aegypt by the heat of Ovens or Dunghils, are no less true Silk-worms or Chickens, then
those that are hatch'd by the Sun, or by Hens. As for what may be objected, that we must distinguish betwixt Factitious Bodies and Natural, I will not now stay to examine, how far that Distincti∣on may be allow'd: for it may suffice for our present purpose to represent, that whatever may be said of Factitious Bo∣dies, where Man does, by Instruments of his own providing, onely give Figure, or also Contexture to the sensible (not insensible) parts of the Matter he works upon; as when a Joyner makes a Stool, or a Statuary makes an Image, or a Turner a Bowl: yet the case may be very differing in those other factitious Productions, wherein the insensible parts of Matter are alter'd by Natural A∣gents, who perform the greatest part of the work among themselves, though the Artificer be an Assistant, by putting Them together after a due manner. And therefore I know not, why all the Pro∣ductions
of the Fire made by Chymists should be look'd upon, as not Natural, but Artificial Bodies: since the Fire, which is the grand Agent in these Changes, doth not, by being imploy'd by the Chymist, cease to be, and to work as, a Natural Agent. And since Nature her self doth, by the help of the fire, sometimes afford us the like Pro∣ductions that the Alchymists art pre∣sents us: as in Aetna, Vesuvius, and o∣ther burning Mountains, (some of whose Productions I can shew you,) Stones are sometimes turn'd into Lime, (and so an Alcalizate Salt is produc'd,) and sometimes, if they be more dispos'd to be flux'd, then calcin'd, brought to vi∣trification; Metalline and Mineral Bo∣dies are by the violence of the fire colli∣quated into Masses of very strange and compounded Natures. Ashes and Me∣talline flowers of divers kinds are scat∣ter'd about the neighbouring places, and copious flowers of Sulphur, sublim'd
by the internal fire, have been several times found about the Vents, at which the Fumes are discharg'd into the Air: (As I have been assur'd by Ingenious Visiters of such Places, whom I pur∣posely inquir'd of, touching these stores; for of these Travellers more then one answer'd me, they had themselves ga∣ther'd, and had brought some very good.) Not to adde, that I have some∣times suspected, upon no absurd grounds, that divers of the Minerals and other Bodies, we meet with in the lower parts of the Earth, and think to have been formed and lodg'd there ever since the beginning of Things, have been since produc'd there by the help of sub∣terraneal fires, or other heats, which may either by their immediate action, and ex∣ceedingly long application, very much alter some Bodies by changing their Texture; as when Lead is turn'd into Minium, and Tin into Putty by the o∣peration of the fire in a few hours, or by
elevating, in the form of Exhalations or Vapours, divers Saline and Sulphureous Corpuscles or Particles of unripe (or to use a Chymical Term of Art) Embrio∣nated Minerals, and perhaps Mettals, which may very much alter the Nature, and thereby vary the Kind of other sub∣terraneal Bodies, which they pervade, and in which they often come to be in∣corporated; or else may, by convening among themselves, constitute particu∣lar Concretions, as wee see that the fumes of Sulphur and those of Mercu∣ry unite into that Lovely red Mass, which in the Shops they call Vermilion, and which is so like to the Mineral, whence we usually obtain Mercury, that the Latines give them both the same Name Cinnabaris, and in that are imi∣tated by the French and Italians; in whose favour I shall adde, That if we sup∣pose this Mineral to consist of a stony Concretion, penetrated by such Mine∣ral fumes as I have been speaking of, the
Appellation may be better excus'd then perhaps you imagine, since from Cinna∣baris nativa not onely I obtain'd a con∣siderable quantity of good running Mercury, (which is That, Men are wont to seek for from it,) but to gratifie my Curiosity somewhat further, I try'd an easie way, that came into my mind, whereby the Caput mortuum afforded me no despicable Quantity of good combustible Sulphur. But this upon the By, being not oblig'd to set down here the grounds of my Paradoxical Conjecture about the Effects of subter∣raneal Fires and Heats, since I here lay no stress upon it, but return to what I was saying about Aetna, and other Vol∣cans. Since then these Productions of the Fire, being of Nature's own make∣ing, cannot be deny'd to be Natural Bodies, I see not why the like Produ∣ctions of the Fire should be thought unworthy that Name, onely because the Fire, that made the former, was kind∣led
by chance in a Hill, and that which produc'd the latter was kindled by a Man in a Furnace. And if flower of Sulphur, Lime, Glass, and colliquated mixtures of Metals and Minerals are to be reckon'd among Natural Bodies, it seems to be but reasonable, that, upon the same grounds, we should admit flow∣er of Antimony, Lime, and Glass, and Pewter, and Brass, and many other Chymical Concretes, (if I may so call them) to be taken into the same num∣ber; and then 'twill be evident, that to distinguish the species of Natural Bo∣dies, a Concourse of Accidents will, without considering any Substantial Form, be sufficient. But because I need not, on this occa∣sion, have recourse to instances of a di∣sputable nature, I will pitch, for the illu∣stration of the Mechanical Production of Forms, upon Vitriol. For since Nature her self, without the help of Art, does oftentimes produce that Concrete,
(as I have elsewhere shewn by Expe∣rience,) there is no reason why Vitriol, produc'd by easie Chymical Operati∣ons, should not be look'd upon as a Bo∣dy of the same Nature and Kind. And in Factitious Vitriol, our knowing what Ingredients we make use of, and how we put them together, inables us to judge very well, how Vitriol is pro∣duc'd. But because it is wont to be reckon'd with Salt-petre, Sea-salt, and Sal Gem among true Salts, I think it re∣quisite to take notice in the first place, that Vitriol is not a meer Salt, but That, which Paracelsus somewhere, and after him divers other Spagyrists, call a Ma∣gistery, which in their sense (for there are that use it in another,) commonly signifies a Preparation, wherein the Body to be prepar'd has no its Princi∣ples separated, as in Distillation, Incine∣ration, &c. but wherein the whole Body is brought into another form, by the addition of some Salt or Menstruum,
that is united per minima with it. And agreeably to this Notion we find, that from common Vitriol, whether native or factitious, may be obtain'd (by Distil∣lation and Reduction) an acid Saline Spirit, and a Metalline Substance, as I elsewhere mention, that from blew Vi∣triol, Copper may be (by more then one way) separated. And I the rather give this Advertisement, because that as there is a Vitriol of Iron, which is u∣sually green; and another of Copper, which is wont to be blew; and also a white Vitriol, about which it is disputed what it holds, (though that it holds some Copper I have found;) and yet all of these are without scruple reputed true Vitriols, notwithstanding that they dif∣fer so much in Colour, and (as I have discover'd) in several other Qualities; so I see no reason, why the other Minerals, being reduc'd by their proper Menstru∣ums into Salt like Magisteries, may not pass for the Vitriols of those Metals,
and consequently for Natural Bodies▪ which, if granted, will adde some con∣firmation to our Doctrine, though its being granted is not necessary to make it out. For, to confine our selves to Vi∣triol, 'tis known among Chymists, that if upon the filings of Mars one put a convenient quantity of that acid distill'd Liquor, which is (abusively) wont to be call'd Oyl of Vitriol, diluting the mixture with Rain, or with common Water, 'tis easie by Filtrating the So∣lution, by Evaporating the Aqueous superfluity of it, and by leaving the rest for a competent while in a Cellar, (or other cold place) to Christallize, 'tis easie, I say, by this means to obtain a Vitriol of Iron; which agrees with the other Vitriol of Vitriol-stones or Mar∣chasites, presented us, by Nature, with∣out the help of any other Menstruum, then the Rain that falls upon them from the Clouds, in I know not how many Qualities, part Obvious, and part of
them Occult: As, (of the first sort) in Colour, Transparency, Brittlenesse, easiness of Fusion, Styptical Tast, redu∣cibleness to a Red Powder by Calcina∣tion, and other Qualities more obvious to be taken notice of; to which may be annex'd divers Qualities of the second sort, (I mean the more abstruse ones,) as the power to turn in a trice an Infusi∣on of Galls, made in ordinary water, (as also to turn a certain clear Mineral So∣lution, elsewhere mention'd,) into an Inckly colour, to which, in all probabi∣lity, we may adde a faculty of causing Vomits even in a small Dose, when ta∣ken into the Stomach of a Man, and that remarkable property of being en∣dow'd with as exact and curious a shape or figure, as Those, for which Salts have been, by modern Philosophers especially, so much admir'd. But, that no scruple might arise from hence, that in the Vitriolum Martis, wont to be made by Chymists, the Menstruum,
that is imploy'd, is the Oyl of common Vitriol, which may be suspected to have retain'd the nature of the Concrete whence it proceeded, and so this Facti∣tious Vitriol may not be barely a new Production, but partly a Recorporifi∣cation, as they speak, of the Vitriolate Corpuscles contain'd in the Menstruum: To prevent this Scruple I say, (which yet perhaps would not much trouble a Considering Chymist,) I thought fit to imploy a quite other Menstruum, that would not be suspected to have any thing of Vitriol in it. And though Aqua fortis, and Spirit of Nitre, howe∣ver they corrode Mars, are unfit for such a work, yet having pitch'd upon Spirit of Salt instead of Oyl of Vitriol, and proceeding the same way that has been already set down, it answer'd our Expe∣ctation, and afforded us a good green Vitriol. Nor will the great disposition, I have observ'd in this our Vitriol, to resolve, by the moisture of the Air, into
a Liquor, make it essentially differing from other Vitriols, since it has been observ'd, and particularly by Guntherus Belichius more then once, that even the common Vitriol he us'd in Germany, will also, though not so easily as other Salts, run (as the Chymists phrase it) per deliquium. And to make the Ex∣periment more compleat, though we did not find either Oyl of Vitriol, or Spirit of Salt, good Menstruums to make a blew Venereal Vitriol out of Copper, (however fil'd, or thinly lami∣nated,) and though upon more Tryals then one, it appear'd, that Aqua fortis, & Spirit of Nitre, which we thought fit to substitute to the above mention'd Li∣quors, did indeed make a Solution of Copper, but so unctuous a one, that twas very hard to bring any part of it to dry∣nesse, without spoyling the Colour and Shape of the desir'd Body: yet repeating the Experiment with care and watchful∣ness, we, this way, obtain'd one of the
loveliest Vitriols that hath perhaps been seen, and of which you your self may be the judg by a parcel of it I keep by me for a Rarity. To apply now these Experiments, especially That, wherein Spirit of Salt is imploy'd, to the purpose, for which I have mention'd them, let us briefly con∣sider these two things; the one, that our Factitious Vitriol is a Body, that, as well as the Natural, is endow'd with many Qualities, (manifest, and occult,) not onely such as are common to it with other Salts, as Transparency, Brittle∣ness, Solublenesse in Water, &c. but such as are Properties peculiar to it, as Greenness, easiness of Fusion, Styptici∣ty of Tast, a peculiar Shape, a power to strike a Black with infusion of Galls, an Emetick faculty, &c. The other thing we are to consider is, that though these Qualities are in common Vitriol believ'd to flow from the substantial Form of the Concrete,
and may, as justly as the Qualities, whe∣ther manifest or occult, of other Inani∣mate Bodies, be imploy'd as Arguments to evince such a Form: yet in our Vi∣triol, made with Spirit of Salt, the same Qualities and Properties were produc'd by the associating and juxtaposition of the two Ingredients, of which the Vi∣triol was compounded, the Mystery being no more but this, That the Steel being dissolv'd in the Spirit, the Saline Particles of the former, and the Metal∣line ones of the latter, having each their Determinate Shapes, did by their Asso∣ciation compose divers Corpuscles of a mix'd or compounded Nature, from the Convention of many whereof, there re∣sulted a new Body, of such a Texture, as qualify'd it to affect our Sensories, and work upon other Bodies, after such a manner as common Vitriol is wont to do. And indeed in our case, not one∣ly it cannot be made appear, that there is any substantial Form generated anew,
but that there is not so much as an ex∣quisite mixture, according to the com∣mon Notion the Schools have of such a Mixture. For Both the Ingredients retain their Nature, (though perhaps somewhat alter'd,) so that there is, as we were saying, but a Juxta-position of the Metalline and Saline Corpuscles; onely they are associated so, as by the mannner of their Coalition to acquire that new Texture, which Denominates the Magistery they compose, Vitriol. For 'tis evident, that the Saline Ingre∣dient may either totally, or for much the greatest part be separated by Distil∣lation, the Metalline remaining behind. Nay some of the Qualities, we have been ascribing to our Vitriol, do so much depend upon Texture, that the very Beams of the Sun (converg'd) will, as I have purposely try'd, very ea∣sily alter its Colour, as well as spoyl its Transparency, turning it at first from Green to White, and, if they be con∣center'd
by a good Burning glass, make∣ing it change that Livery for a deep Red. Doubts and Experiments, touching the Curious Figures of SALTS. ANd here let me take notice, that though the exact and curious Fi∣gures, in which Vitriol and other Salts are wont to shoot, be made Arguments of the Presence, and great Instances of the Plastick skill of substantial Forms and Seminal Powers, yet, I confess, I am not so fully satisfied in this matter, as even the Modern Philosophers ap∣pear to be. Tis not that I deny, that Plato's excellent Saying, , may be apply'd to these exquisite Pro∣ductions of Nature. For though God has thought fit to make things Corpo∣real after a much more facile and intelli∣gible way, then by the intervention of substantial Forms; and though the Pla∣stick
power of Seeds, which in Plants and Animals I willingly admit, seem not in our case to be needful; yet is the Di∣vine Architect's Geometry (if I may so call it) neverthelesse to be acknowledg'd and admir'd; for having been pleas'd to make the primary and insensible Cor∣puscles of Salts and Metals of such de∣terminate, curious, and exact Shapes that, as they happen to be associated to∣gether, they should naturally produce Concretions, which, though differing∣ly figur'd according to the respective Natures of their Ingredients, and the various manners of their Convening should yet be all of them very curious and seem elaborate in their Kinds. How little I think it fit to be allow'd, that the Bodies of Animals, which consist of so many curiously fram'd and wonderfully adapted Organical parts, (and whose Structure is a thousand times more Ar∣tificial then that of Salts, and Stones, and other Minerals,) can be reasonably
suppos'd to have been produc'd by Chance, or without the Guidance of an Intelligent Author of Things, I have elsewhere largely declar'd. But I con∣fess, I look upon these Figures we ad∣mire in Salts, and in some kinds of Stones, (which I have not been Incuri∣ous to collect,) as Textures so simple and slight in comparison of the Bodies of Animals, & oftentimes in comparison of some one Organical part, that I think it cannot be in the least inferr'd, that be∣cause such slight Figurations need not be ascrib'd to the Plastick power of Seeds, it is not necessary, that the stu∣pendious and incomparably more elabo∣rate Fabrick and structure of Animals themselves should be so. And this pre∣mis'd, I shall adde, that I have been in∣clin'd to the Conjecture about the shapes of Salts, that I lately propos'd, by these Considerations. First, That by a bare Association of Metalline and Saline Corpuscles, a Con∣crete,
as finely figur'd as other Vitriols, may be produc'd, as we have lately seen Secondly, because that the Figures of these Salts are not constantly in all respects the same, but may in diverse manners be somewhat varied, as they happen to be made to shoot more hasti∣ly, or more leisurely, and as they shoot in a scanter, or in a fuller proportion of Liquor. This may be easily observ'd by any, that will but with a little Atten∣tion consider the difference that may be found in Vitriolate Christals or Grains, when quantities of them were taken out of the great Coolers, as they call them, wherein that Salt, at the Works where tis boyl'd, is wont to be set to shoot. And accordingly, where the Experienc'd Mineralist Agricola, describes the seve∣ral wayes of making Vitriol in great Quantities, he does not onely more then once call the great Grains or Chri∣stals, into which it coagulates, Cubes; but speaking of the manner of their
Concretion about the Cords or Ropes, that are wont (in Germany) to be hang'd from certain cross Bars into the Vitrio∣late Water or Solution for the Vitriol to fasten its self to; he compares the Concretions indifferently to Cubes or Clusters of Grapes: Ex his (sayes he, speaking of the cross Bars,) pendent re∣stes lapillis extentae, ad quos humor spis∣sus adhaerescens densatur in translucentes atramenti sutorii vel Cubos, vel Acinos, qui uvae speciem gerunt. I remember al∣so, that having many years since a sus∣picion, that the Reason why Alkalys, such as Salt of Tartar and Pot-ashes are wont to be obtain'd in the form of white Powders or Calces, might be the way, wherein the Water, or the Lixivi∣ums, that contain them, is wont to be drawn off, I fancied, that by leaving the Saline Corpuscles a competent quanti- of Water to swimme in, and allowing them leasure for such a multitude of Georg: Agricola de re metall. lib. 12. p. 462.
Occursions, as might suffice to make them hit upon more congruous Co∣alitions then is usual, I might obtain Christals of Them, as well as of other Salts: conjecturing this, I say, I caus'd some well purify'd Alkalys, dissolv'd in clear water, to be slowly evaporated, till the Top was cover'd with a thin Ice-like Crust, then taking care not to break That, least they should (as in the ordi∣nary way, where the Water is all forc'd off,) want a sufficient stock of Liquor, I kept them in a very gentle heat for a good while; and then breaking the a∣bove mentioned Ice like Cake, I had, as I wish'd, divers figured Lumps of Chri∣stalline Salt shot in the Water, and transparent almost like white Sugar Candy. I likewise remember, that having, on several occasions, distill'd a certain quan∣tity of Oyl of Vitriol, with a strong So∣lution of Sea-salt, till the remaining Matter was left dry, that Saline Resi∣due
being dissolv'd in fair water, filter'd, and gently evaporated, would shoot in∣to Christals, sometimes of one figure, sometimes of another, according as the quantity or strength of the Oyl of Vi∣triol and other Substances determin'd. And yet these Christals, though some∣times they would shoot into Prisme-like Figures, as Roch'd Petre; and sometimes into shapes more like to Allome or Vitriol; nay though often∣times the same Caput mortuum dissolv'd, would in the same Glass shoot into Christals, whereof some would be of one shape, some of another, yet would these differing Grains or Christals ap∣pear for the most part more exquisitely figur'd, then oftentimes Vitriol does. From Spirit of Urine and Spirit of Ni∣tre, when I have suffer'd them to re∣main long together before Coagulati∣on, and free'd the mixture from the su∣perfluous moisture very slowly, I have sometimes obtain'd fine long Christals,
(some of which I can shew you) so shap'd, that most Beholders would take them for Christals of Salt-petre. And I have likewise tryed, that whereas Silver is wont to shoot into Plates exceeding thin, almost like those of Moscovis glass, when I have dissolv'd a pretty quantity of it in Aqua fortis, or spirit of Nitre, and suffer'd it to shoot very lei∣surely, I have obtain'd Lunar Christals, (several of which I have yet by me,) whose Figure, though so pretty as to have given some wonder even to an Excel∣lent Geometrician, is differing enough from that o e thin Plates formerly mention'd; each Christal being com∣pos'd of many small and finely shap'd Solids, that stick so congruously to one another, as to have one surface, that ap∣pear'd Plain enough, common to the all. Thirdly, that insensible Corpuscles of different, but all of them exquisite, shapes, and endowed with plain as well
as smooth sides, will constitute Bodies variously, but all very finely figur'd, I have made use of several waies to mani∣fest. And first, though Harts-horn, Bloud, and Urine, being resolv'd, and (as the Chymists speak) Analiz'd by Distillation, may well be suppos'd to have their substantial Forms (if they had any) destroy'd by the action of the Fire: yet in regard the Saline Particles, they contain, are endow'd with such fi∣gures as we have been speaking of, when in the Liquor, that abounds with either of these volatile Salts, the dissolv'd Particles do leisurely shoot into Chri∣stals, I have divers times observ'd, in these, many Masses, (some bigger, and some less,) whose surfaces had Plains, some of Figures, as to sense exactly Ge∣ometrical, and others very curious and pleasant. And of these finely shap'd Christals of various sizes, I have pretty store by me. And because (as it may be probably gather'd from the Event)
the Saline Corpuscles of Stillatitios acid liquors, and those of many of the Bodies, they are fitted to dissolve, have such kind of Figures as we have been speaking of, when the solutions of these Bodies, upon the recess of the superflu∣ous moisture, shoot into Christals; these, though they will sometimes be differing enough, according to the particular na∣tures of the dissolv'd Bodies and the Menstruum, yet either the Christals themselves, or their Surfaces, or both, will oftentimes have fine and exquisite Figures; as I have try'd by a Menstru∣um, wherewith I was able to dissolve some Gems; as also with a solution of Coral, made with Spirit of Verdigreese, to omit other Examples. And for the same reason, when I try'd whether the Particles of Silver, dissolv'd in Aqu fortis, would not, without Concoagu∣lating with the Salts, convene, upon the Account of their own shapes, into little Concretions of smooth and flat surfa∣ces,
I found, that having (to afford the Metalline Corpuscles scope to move in) diluted one part of the Solution with a great many parts of distill'd Rain water, (for common water will often∣times make such Solutions become white or turbid,) a Plate of Copper be∣ing suspended in the Liquor, and suffer'd to lie quiet there a while, (for it need not be long) there would settle, all about it, swarms of little Metalline and Undia∣phanbus Bodies, shining in the water like the scales of small Fishes, but form'd into little Plates extremely thin, with surfaces not onely flat, but exceeding glossy: and among those, divers of the larger were prettily figur'd at the Edges. And as for Gold, its Corpu∣scles are sufficiently dispos'd to convene with those of fit or congruous Salts into Concretions of determinate Shapes, as I have found in the Christals I obtain'd from Gold dissolv'd in Aqua Regis, and after having been suffer'd to loose its
superfluous moisture, kept in a cold place: and not onely so, but also when by a more powerful Menstruū I had subdi∣vided the Body of Gold into such mi∣nute Particles, that they were sublima∣ble, (for That, I can assure you, is possi∣ble,) these volatile Particles of Gold, with the Salts, wherewith they were ele∣vated, afforded me (sometimes) store of Christals, which, though not all of the near of the same Bigness, resembled one another in their shape, which wa regular enough, and a very pretty one. But of this more elsewhere. §. I remem∣ber I have also long since taken pleasure to dissolve two or more of those saline Bodies, whose shapes we know already, in fair Water, that by a very gent Evaporation I might obtain Concreti∣ons, whose Shapes should be, thoug curious, yet differing from the Figu of either of the Ingredients. But we must not expect, that, in all cases, the Salts dissolv'd together should be totaly
compounded: for oftentimes they are of such different Natures, that one will shoot much sooner then another, and then it frequently happens, that a good Proportion of that will be first Chri∣stalliz'd in its own shape: as is conspicu∣ously to be observ'd in the refining of that impure Pete, (which, from the Country that affords it, the Purifiers call Barbary Nitre,) from the common Salt it abounds with: and (also) as Agricola observes,G. Agricola de re Metallica. lib. 12. that in some cases, where a Vitriolate Matter is mingled with that, which yields Allom, those two kinds of Salts will shoot separately in the same large vessel, (which the Tryals, I have made with the compounded So∣lutions of those two Salts, do not dis∣countenance.) Now in such cases, all that can be expected, or needs be desir'd, is, that the remaining part of the mixture, or some portion of it, afford Christals, or Grains of compounded solid figures.
Though the Venetian Borax, wont to be sold in shops, be known to be a facti∣tious Body, compounded of several Salts, that I shall not now stay to enu∣merate; and though, when we buy it, we usually find it to consist of Lumps and Grains mishapen enough, yet when I dissolv'd some of it in a good quantity of fair water, and made it coagulate ve∣ry leisurely, I had Chrystals▪ upon whose surfaces I could perceive very exquisite and, as to sense, regular Geometrical fi∣gures. And one thing I must not here by any means praetermit, which is, that though the Caput mortuum of common Aqua fortis consists of Bodies of very differing Natures, (for such are Nitre and Vitriol,) and has been expos'd to a great violence of the Fire, yet I have sometimes admir'd the curiousness of those figures, that might be obtain'd barely by frequent Solutions and Coa∣gulations of the Saline Particles of this Caput mortuum in fair water. But be∣cause
the Glasses, wherein my Concre∣tions were made, were too little to af∣ford great Christals, and they ought to shoot very slowly; I choose rather to shew the Curious some large Christals, which I took out of the Laboratory of an Ingenious Person, who, without minding the Figures, had upon my Re∣commendation made great quantity of that Salt, in large vessels, for a Medicine: (it being the Panacea duplicata, so fa∣mous in Holstein.) For divers of these Christals have not onely Triangles, Hexagons, and Rhomboids, and other Figures exquisitely Cut on their smooth & specular surfaces; and others, Bodies of Prismatical shapes: But some of them are no less accurately figur'd then the finest Nitre or Vitriol I remember my self to have observ'd, and some also terminate in Bodies almost like Pyramids, consi∣sting of divers Triangles, that meet in one Vertical point, and are no less admi∣rably shap'd then the fairer sort of
Cornish Diamonds, that have been brought me for Rarities. Besides, the producing of Salts of new shapes, by compounding of Saline Bodies, I have found it to be practicable not onely i some Gross, or, as they speak, Corpo∣ral Salts, such as Sea-salt, Salt-petre, but also in some. Natural and some Chymical Salts dissolv'd together; and, which perhaps you will think more con∣siderable in saline Spirits, made by di∣stillation: Not that all of them are fit for this purpose, but that I have found divers of those, that work upon one ano∣ther with Ebullition, to be so. For i that Conflict the Saline Corpuscles come to be associated to one another, and thereby, or by their newly acquir'd figure, whilst their Coalition lasts, to loose much of their former Volatility: so that, upon Evaporation of the super∣fluous Liquor, they will not fly, as other∣wise they might; but concoagulate into finely shap'd Christals, as I have try'd
among other Saline Liquors, with Spi∣rit of Urine, and Spirit of Nitre, and with Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit of fer∣mented Urine with Spirit of Sheeps bloud, and spirit of Salt, and also with the Spirits of Salt and of Urine; which Last Experiment I the rather mention, because it shews, by the difference of the Christals, afforded by those two Li∣quors, from the Christals resulting from one of them, namely the spirit of Urine, (or if you please, the Volatile Salt, wherewith it abounds,) concoagulated with a fit Dose of Oyl of Vitriol, how much those compounded emergent fi∣gures depend upon the more simple fi∣gures of the saline Corpuscles, that hap∣pen to convene into those new Con∣cretes. For the spirit of Urine, satiated with spirit of Salt, and both very gent∣ly, and not too far, Evaporated, often afforded me Christals, that differ'd ex∣ceedingly in shape from those, which I obtain'd from the same spirit of Urine,
satiated, either with Oyl of Vitriol, or with spirit of Nitre. For, (to adde That upon the By,) that Salt, compoun∣ded of the two Spirits of Urine▪ and of common Salt, is wont to be very pret∣tily figur'd, consisting of one long Beam as it were, whence on both sides issue out far shorter Christals, some∣times perpendicular to that, and paral∣lel to one another like the Teeth in a Combe, and sometimes so inclining, as to make the Whole appear almost like a Feather; which is the more remarkable, because I have (many years ago) ob∣serv'd, that common Sal Armoniack, that is made of Urine and common Salt, both crude, with a Proportion of Soot, will, if warily dissolv'd, and coagulated, shoot into Christals of the like shape. How far the unknown Figure of a Salt may Possibly (for I fear it will not Easi∣ly) be ghess'd at, by that of the Figure, which it makes with some other Salt, whose Figure is already known, I leave
to Geometricians to consider; having, I fear, insisted too long on this subject al∣ready. But yet I must adde one particular more, which will, as well illustrate and confirme much of what has been said a∣bove touching the Origination of Vi∣triol, as shew, that the Shape of Vitriol depends upon the Textures of the Bo∣dies, whereof it is compos'd. Fourthly then, when I consider'd, that (as I formerly noted) Vitriol being but a Magistery, made by the concoa∣gulation of the Corpuscles of a dissolv'd Metal, with those of the Menstruum, the Magisteries of other Metals might, without inconvenience, be added, as o∣ther Vitriolate Concretes to the green, the blew, and white Vitriol, that are without scruple referr'd to the same spe∣cies: and when I consider'd, that Oyl of Vitriol was not a fit Menstruum to dissolve divers of the Metals, nor even all those, that it will corrode; and that the like unfitness also is to be found in
common spirit of Salt, I pitch'd upon Aqua fortis or spirit of Nitre, as that Menstruum, which was likeliest to af∣ford variety of Vitriols: and according∣ly I found, that besides the Lovely Vi∣triol of Copper formerly mention'd, that Liquor would with Quicksilver afford one sort of Christals, with Silver another, and with Lead a third; all which Christals of Vitriol, as they differ'd from each other in other Qualities, (upon which score you will find this Experi∣ment elsewhere mention'd,) so they did very manifestly and considerably differ in Shape: the Christals of Silver shoo∣ting in exceeding thin Plates, and those of Lead and Quick-silver obtaining fi∣gures, though differing enough from each other, yet of a far greater depth and thickness, and lesse remote from the figure of common Vitriol or Sea salt: and yet all these Vitriols, especially That of crude Lead, when it was happily made, had Shapes curious and elaborate,
as well as those, we admire in common Vitriol or Sea-salt. IF then these Curious shapes, which are believed to be of the admirablest Ef∣fects, and of the strongest Proofs of substantial Forms, may be the Results of Texture; and if Art can produce Vi∣triol its self, as well as Nature; why may we not think, that in ordinary Phaenome∣na, that have much less of wonder, re∣course is wont to be had to substantial Forms without any Necessity? (Matter, and a Convention of Accidents being able to serve the turn without them;) and why should we wilfully exclude those Productions of the Fire, wherein the Chymist is but a Servant to Nature, from the number of Natural Bodies? And indeed, since there is no certain Diagnostick agreed on, whereby to dis∣criminate Natural and Factitious Bo∣dies, and constitute the species of both; I see not, why we may not draw Argu∣ments
from the Qualities and Operati∣ons of several of those, that are call'd Factitious, to shew how much may be ascrib'd to, and perform'd by, the Me∣chanical Characterization or Stamp of Matter: Of which we have a noble In∣stance in Gunpowder, wherein by a bare comminution and blending the Ingredi∣ents, Nitre, Charcoal, and Brimstone, which have onely a new, and That an exceeding slight Contexture, each re∣taining its own Nature in the Mixture; so that there is no colour afforded to the pretence of a substantial Form, there is produc'd a new Body, whose Operati∣ons are more powerful and prodigious, then those of almost any Body of Na∣tures own compounding. And though Glass be but an Artificial Concrete, yet, besides that 'tis a very noble and useful one, Nature her self has produc'd very few, if enough, to make up a Num∣ber more lasting and more unalterable. And indeed divers of those factitious
Bodies that Chymistry is able to afford us, are endow'd with more various and more noble Qualities, then many of those, that are unquestionably Natural. And if we admit these Productions into the number of Natural Bodies, they will afford us a multitude of Instances, to shew, that Bodies may acquire many and Noble Qualities, barely by having Mechanical Affections, introduc'd by outward Agents into the Matter, or de∣stroy'd there. As though Glass be such a Noble Body, as we have lately taken notice of, yet since tis Fusibility, Trans∣parency, and Brittleness, that are its onely Constituent Attributes, we can in less then an hour, (or, perhaps halfe that time,) turn an Opacous Body into Transparent Glass, without the Additi∣on of any other Visible Body, by a change of Texture, made in the same Matter, and by another change of Tex∣ture, made without Addition, as former∣ly, we can, in a trice, reduce Glass into, or
obtain from it a Body, not Glassy, but Opacous, and otherwise of a very diffe∣ring Nature, as it had been before. And here let me adde what may not a little conduce to our present Design, That even those, that imbrace Aristotle's principles, do unawares confesse, that a slight change of Texture, without the introduction of a substantial Form, may not onely make a Specifical difference betwixt Bodies, but so vast a one, that they shall have differing Genus'es, and may (as the Chymists speak) belong to differing Kingdoms. For Coral, to pass by all other Plants of that kind, that may be mention'd to the same pur∣pose, whilst it grows in the Bottom of the Sea, is a real Plant, and several times (which suffices for my present scope) hath been there found by an Acquain∣tance of mine, as well as by other In∣quirers, soft and tender like another Plant. Nay, I elsewhereIn the Essays about things supposed to be spontane∣ously generated. bring ve∣ry
good and recent Authority to prove, that it is oftentimes found very succu∣ent, and does propagate its species, as well as other Shrubs; and yet Coral, being gather'd and remov'd into the Air, by the recess of its Soul, no new Lapidifick Form being so much as pre∣ended to, turns into a Concretion, that s, by many Eminent Writers and others, eckon'd among Lapideous ones: as in∣eed Coral does not burn like Wood, or obey Distillation like it; and not onely its Calx is very differing from the Ashes of Vegetables, and is totally so∣ble in divers acid Liquors, and even pirit of Vinegar, but the uncalcin'd Coral its self will be easily corroded y good Vinegar, after the same man∣er as I have seen Lapis stellaris, and o∣er unquestionably Mineral stones dis∣olv'd, some by that Liquor, and some y the Spirit of it. A much stranger ing may be seen in the East-India sland of Sombrero, not very far from
Sumatra, if we may believe our Coun∣tryman Sr James Lancester, who relates it as an Eye witnesse, for which reason, and for the strangeness of the thing, I shall adde the story in his own word Here (Parchas. Pilgr. part. the first. p. 152.sayes he, speaking of the Co of Sombrero) we found upon the sand  the Sea side, a small Twigge growing  to a young Tree, and offering to pluck the same, it shrunk down into the gro & sinketh, unless you hold very hard. A being pluck'd up, a great Worme is the  of it: and look how the Tree groweth  greatnes, the VVorme diminisheth N soon as the VVorm is wholly turn'd i the Tree, it rooteth in the ground,  so groweth to be great. This Transfo¦mation was one of the greatest wo I saw in all my Travels. This  being plucked up a little, the Leaves stra¦ped off and the Pill, by that time it i dry turned into a hard Stone, much  to white Coral. So that (concludes
this worme was twice transformed into different natures: of these we gather'd and brought home many. The Industrious Pis, in his Excellent History of Brasil, vouches a multitude of Witnesses (not having Opportunity to be one himself) for the ordinary Transformation of a sort of Animals not much unlike Grass∣hoppers) into Vegetables, at a certain season of the The passage, which is long, I do not here transcribe, having had occasion to do it elsewhere. It is extant Lib. 5. Cp. 21. and at the close of his Narrative he sub∣joynes, Non est, quod quisquam de veritate dubitet, cum infinitos estes habeat Brasilta, &c. year. But since I sate down this Relation of Sr John Lancester, I have met with another, whose strangeness may much countenance it, in a small Tract newly publish'd by a Jesuite, F. Michael Boym, whom a good Critick much commen∣ded to me. For this Author doth, as an Eyewitnesse, affirme that, which is little lesse to my present Purpose. Floa Sinensis o Traite des Flerus &c. under the title Lozmeoques. Ie vis,
i.e. I saw in a small fresh water, and shal∣low Lake of the Island Hainan, (which belongs to China) Crabs, or Crawfishes, which, as soon as they were drawn out of the water, did in a moment loose both Life and Motion, and became petrify'd, though nothing appear'd to be chang'd either to the External or Internal figure of ther Bodies. What he further addes of these Fishes, is but of their Virtues in Phy∣sick, which, not concerning our subject▪ I shall (Pyrophilus) willingly praeterm it; and even, as to our Country-man' relation, hoping, by means of an Inge∣nious Correspondent in the East-In∣dies, to receive a further Information a∣bout the strange Plant he mentions,  shall, at present, urge onely what ha been taken notice of concerning Co∣ral, to countenance the Observation for whose sake these Narratives have been alleadg'd. And so likewise, as to what I was saying of Glass, and Gu-powder, our receiving of those and the
generality of Factitious Bodies into the Catalogue of Natural Bodies, is not (which I formerly also intimated) neces∣sary to my present Argument: whereto it is sufficient, that Vitriol is granted on all hands to be a Natural Body, though it be also producible by Art. And also to the Argument it affords us, we might adde that memorable Experiment de∣liver'd by Helmont, of turning Oyl of Vitriol into Allom, by the Odour (as he calls it) of Mercury, if, however it be not despicable, we had found it fit to be rely'd on. But reserving an Account of that for another place, we shall substi∣tute the Instance, presented us by our Author, about the Production of Salt∣petre: for if, having dissolv'd Pot-ashes in fair water, you coagulate the filtra∣ted Solution into a white Salt, and on that pour Spirit of Nitre, till they will not hiss any longer together, there will shoot, when the superfluous water is Evaporated, Christals, that proclaim
their Nitrous Nature by their Prisma∣tical, (or at least Prisme-like) Shape, their easie Fusion, their Accension, and Deflagration, and other Qualities, part∣ly mention'd by our Author, and partly discoverable by a little Curiosity in making Tryals. II. Experimental Attempts about the Redintegration of Bodies. THe former of those two Argu∣ments, (Pyrophilus) by which I propos'd to confirme the Origine o Forms, was, as you may remember, grounded upon the Manner, by which such a Convention of Accidents, as de∣serves to passe for a Form, may be pro∣duc'd: and That having been hitherto
prosecuted, it now remains, that we pro∣ceed to the Second Argument, drawn, not (as the former) from the first Pro∣duction, but from the Reproduction of a Physical Body. And though both these Arguments are valid; yet if this Latter could, in spight of the Difficul∣ties intervening in making of the Expe∣riments that belong to it, be as clearly made out as the former, you would, I suppose, like it much the better of the two. For if we could Reproduce a Bo∣dy, which has been depriv'd of its sub∣stantial Form, you would, I presume, think it highly probable, if not more then probable, that (to borrow our Author's Expression) That which is commonly call'd the Form of a Con∣crete, which gives it its Being and De∣nomination, and from whence all its Qualities are in the Vulgar Philosophy, by I know not what inexplicable waies, suppos'd to flow; may be in some Bo∣dies but a Characterization or Modifi∣cation
of the Matter they consist of; whose parts, by being so and so dispos'd in relation to each other, constitute such a determinate kind of Body, endow'd with such and such Properties; whereas, if the same parts were otherwise dis∣posd, they would constitute other Bo∣dies, of very differing Natures from that of the Concrete, whose parts they formerly were, and which may again result or be produc'd, after its dissipati∣on, and seeming destruction, by the Re∣union of the same component Particles, associated according to their former Di∣sposition. But though it were not Impossible to make an adaequate Redintegration of a Chymically Analiz'd Body, because some of the dissipated parts will either escape through the Junctures of the Vessels, (though diligently clos'd,) or, if they be very subtle, will fly away up∣on the disjoyning of the Vessels; or, will irrecoverably stick to the inside of
them: yet I see not, why such a Repro∣duction, as is very possible to be effe∣cted, may not suffice to manifest what we intend to make out by it. For, even in such Experiments, it appears, that when the Form of a Natural Body is a∣bolish'd, and its parts violently scatter'd; by the bare Reunion of some parts after the former manner, the very same Mat∣ter, the destroy'd Body was before made of, may, without Addition of other Bo∣dies, be brought again to constitute a Body of the like Nature with the for∣mer, though not of equal Bulk. And in∣deed, the Experiment, recorded by our Author, about the Reproduction of Salt Petre, as it is the best and successesful∣lest I have ever been able to make upon Bodies, that require a strong Heat to dissipate them; so I hope it will suffice to give you those thoughts about this mat∣ter, that the Author design'd in alledg∣ing it; and therefore, though having premis'd thus much, I shall proceed to
acquaint you with the success of some Attempts he intimates (in that Essay) his Intention of making, for the Redin∣tegration of some Bodies; yet doing it onely out of some Historical Notes I find among my loose Papers, That, which I at present pretend to, is, but partly to shew you the difficulty of such Attempts, which, since our Author's Essay was communicated, have been represented (I fear by Conjecture one∣ly) as very easie to be accurately enough done; and partly, because our Author does not, without reason, intimate the usefulness of Redintegrations, in case they can be effected; and does, not cause∣lesly, intimate, that such Attempts, though they should not Perfectly suc∣ceed, may increase the Number of No∣ble and Active Bodies, and consequent∣ly, the Inventory of Mankind's Goods. Upon such Considerations we attemp∣ted the Dissipation and Reunion of the parts of common Amber; and though
Chymists, for fear of breaking their Vessels, are wont, when they commit it to distillation, to adde to it a caput mortuum (as they speak) of Sand, Brick, &c. (in whose room we sometimes choose to substitute beaten Glass;) which hinders them to judge of and employ the Remanence of the Amber, after the Distillation is finish'd: yet we suppos'd, and found, that if the Retort were not too much fill'd, and if the Fire were slowly and warily enough administer'd, the Addition of any other Body would be needless. Wherefore having put into a Glass Retort four or five Ounces of Amber, and administred a gentle and gradual heat, we observ'd the Amber to melt and bubble, (which we therefore mention, because ingenious men have lately questioned, whether it can be mel∣ted,) and having ended the Operation, & sever'd the vessels, we found, that there was come over in the form, partly of Oyl, partly of Spirit & Flegm, and partly of
volatile Salt, near half the weight of the Concrete: and having broken the Re∣tort, we found, in the bottom of it, a Cake of coal-black Matter, then whose upper surface I scarce remember to have seen in my whole life any thing more ex∣quisitely polish'd; in so much, that, not∣withstanding the Colour, as long as I kept it, it was fit to serve for a Look∣ing Glass: and this smooth Mass being broken, (for it was exceeding brittle,) the larger fragments of it appear'd a∣dorn'd with an excellent lustre. All those parts of the Amber, being put together into a Glass Body, with a blind head lu∣ted to it, were placed in Sand, to be in∣corporated by a gentle heat: but whilst I stept aside to receive a Visit, the Fire having been increas'd without my knowledge, the Fumes ascended so co∣piously, that they lifted up the Vessel out of the Sand, whereupon falling a∣gainst the side of the Furnace, it broke at the top, but, being seasonably call'd,
we sav'd all but the Fumes; and the re∣maining Matter looks not unlike Tarre, and with the least heat may be powr'd out like a Liquor, sticking even when it is cold to the fingers. Yet this open'd Body doth not easily communicate so much as a Tincture to spirit of Wine, (which therefore seems somewhat strange, because another time presume∣ing, that this would be a good way to obtain a Solution of some of the resi∣nous parts of Amber, we did, by pou∣ring spirit of Wine, that (though recti∣fy'd) was not of the very best, upon the reunited parts of Amber, lightly dige∣sted into a Mass, easily obtain a clear Yellow Solution, very differing from the Tincture of Amber, and abounding (as I found by Tryal) in the dissolv'd substance of the Amber:) but in Oyl of Turpentine we have, in a short time, dis∣solv'd it into a bloud red Balsome, which may be of good use (at least) to Chi∣rurgions. And having agen made the
former Experiment with more wariness then before, we had the like success in our Distillation, but, the reunited parts of the Amber being set to digest in a large Bolt head, the Liquor that was drawn off, did, in a few hours, from its own Caput mortuum extract a bloud red Tincture, or else made a Solution of some part of it, whereby it obtain'd a very deep Red; but having been, by in∣tervening Accidents, hindred from fini∣shing the Experiment, we mist the Sa∣tisfaction of knowing to what it may be brought at last. And as for what our Author tels us of this design to attempt the Redinte∣gration of Vitriol, Turpentine, and some other Concretes, wherein it seem'd not unpracticable, he found in it more diffi∣culty then every one would expect. For the Bodies, on which such Experi∣ments are likeliest to succeed, seem to be Allom, Sea salt, and Vitriol. And as for Allom, he found it a troublesome
work to take (as a Spagirist would speak) the Principles of it asunder, in regard, that it is inconvenient to distill it with a Caput mortuum, (as Chymists call any fix'd Additament,) least that should hinder the desir'd Redintegration of the dissipated parts: And when he distill'd it by its self, without any such Addita∣ment, he found, that, with a moderate heat, the Allom would scarce part with any thing but its Phlegm, and if he urg'd it with a strong fire, he found, it would so swell, as to endanger the brea∣king of the Retort, or threaten the boy∣ling over into the Receiver. (Yet having once been able very warily to abstract as much Flegm and Spirit, as I conveniently could, from a parcel of Roch Allom, and having powr'd it back upon that pulveriz'd caput mortuum, and left the vessel long in a quiet place, I found, that the Corpuscles of the Li∣quor, having had time, after a multitude of Occursions, to accommodate and re∣unite
themselves to the more fix'd parts of the Concrete, did by that Associati∣on (or Dissolution) recompose, at the top of the Powder, many Christalline Grains of finely figur'd Salt, which in∣creasing with time, made me hope, that, at the length, the whole or the greatest part would be reduc'd into Allom, which yet a Mischance, that robb'd me of the Glass, hindred me to see.) So likewise of Sea salt, if it be distill'd, as it is usual, with thrice its weight of burn'd Clay, or beaten Brick, twill prove inconvenient in reference to its Redintegration; and if it be distill'd alone, it is apt to be fluxt by the heat of the fire, and, whilst it re∣mains in Fusion, will scarce yield any Spirit at all. And as for Vitriol, though the Redintegration of it might seem to be less hopeful, then that of the other Salts, in regard that it consists not one∣ly of a Saline, but of a Metalline Body, whence it may be suppos'd to be of a more intricate and elaborate Texture
yet because there needs no caput mortu∣um in the Distillation of it, we did, to pursue our Author's intimated designs, make two or three Attempts upon it, and seem'd to miss of our Aime, rather upon the Account of accidental hinde∣rances, then of any insuperable difficul∣ty in the thing it self. For once, we with a strong fire, drew off from a parcel of common blew Vitriol, the Phlegm and Spirit, and some quantity of the heavy Oyl, (as Chymists abusively call it:) These Liquors, as they came over with∣out Separation, we divided into several parts, and the remaining very red Caput mortuum into as many. One of these parcels of Liquor we poured over night upon its correspondent portion of the newly mentioned red Powder. But having left it in a Window, and the Night proving very bitter, in the mor∣ning I found the Glass crack'd in many places by the violence of the Frost, and the Liquor seem'd to have been soak'd
up by the Powder, and to have very much swelled it. This mixture then I took out, and placing it in an open mouth'd Glass in a Window, I found, after a while, divers Grains of pure Vitri∣ol upon the other Matter, and some lit∣tle Swellings, not unlike those we shall presently have Occasion to speak of. I took likewise a much larger parcel of the forementioned Liquor, and its cor∣respondent proportion of Caput mortu∣um; and having leisurely mixt them in a large Glass Bason, I obtain'd divers Phae∣nomena, that belong not to this place, but may be met with, where they will more properly fall in. In this Bason (which I lay'd in the Window, and kept from Agitation,) I perceived, after a while, the Liquor to acquire a blewish Tincture, and after ten or twelve weeks, I found the mixture dry, (for, it seems, it was too much exposed to the Air:) but the Surface of it adorn'd in divers places with Grains of Vitriol very cu∣riously
figur'd. And besides these, there were store of Protuberances, which con∣sisted of aboundance of small vitriolate particles, which seem'd in the way to a Coalition; for having let the Bason a∣lone for four or five months longer, the Matter appear'd crusted over, partly with very elevated Saline protuberan∣ces, partly with lesser parcels, and partly also with considerably broad Cakes of Vitriol, some of above half an Inch in breadth, and proportionably long; and indeed the whole surface was so odly diversifi'd, that I cannot count the trou∣ble, these Tryals have put me to, mis∣pent. Another time in a more slender and narrow mouth'd Glass I pour'd back upon the Caput mortuum of Vitriol the Liquors, I had by violence of the fire forc'd from it; so that the Liquid part did swim a pretty height above the red Calx, and remain'd a while limpid and colourless: but the vessel having stood, for some time, unstop'd in a Window,
the Liquor after a while, acquir'd by degrees a very deep vitriolate colour, and not long after, there appear'd, at the bottom and on the top of the Calx, ma∣ny fair and exquisitely figur'd Grains of Vitriol, which cover'd the surface of the Calx; and the longer the vesel con∣tinu'd in the Window, the deeper did this Change, made upon the upper part of the Powder, seem to penetrate: so that I began to hope, that, in process of time, almost (if not more then almost) the whole mixture would be reduc'd to perfect Vitriol. But an Accident robb'd me of my Glass, before I could see the utmost of the Event. And, on this Occasion, I must not praetermit an odd Experiment I lately made, though I dare not undertake to make it agen. I elsewhere relate, how I digested, for divers weeks, a Quantity of powder'd Antimony, with a greater weight by half of Oyl of Vitriol, and how having at length committed this
mixture to Distillation, and thereby ob∣tained, besides a little Liquor, a pretty quantity of combustible Antimonial or Antimonio Virriolate Sulphur; there remained, in the bottom of the Retort, a somewhat light and very friable Caput mortuum, all the upper part of which was at least as white as common Wood-ashes, and the rest look'd like a Cinder. And now I must tell you what became of this Caput mortuum, whereof I there make no further mention. We could not well foresee what could be made of it, but very probable it was, that it would afford us some new Discovery, by being exposed to the fire, in regard of the copious Sulphur, whereof it seem'd to have been deprived: provided it were urg'd in close Vessels, where no∣thing could be lost. Whereupon com∣mitting it to a naked fire in a small glass Retort, well Coated, and accommoda∣ted with a Receiver, we kept it there many hours, and at length severing the
Vessels, we found (which need not be wonder'd at) no Antimonial Quick-sil∣ver, and much less of Sulphur sublim'd then we expected: wherefore greedily hastning to the Caput mortuum, we found it flux'd into a Mass, covered with a thin Cake of Glass, whose fragments being held against the light, were not at all coloured, as Antimonial Glass is wont to be, but were as colourlesse as common white Glass. The Lump above mentioned being broken, was found, somewhat to our wonder, to be perfect black Antimony, adorn'd with long shining streaks, as common Antimony is wont to be: onely this Antimony seem'd to have been a little refin'd by the sequestration of its unnecessary Sul∣phur; which Ingredient seems by this Experiment, as well as by some other Observations of ours, to be more copi∣ous in some particular Parcels of that Mineral, then is absolutely requisite to the constitution of Antimony. Though
in our case it may be suspected, that the reduction of part of the Mass to a colour∣less Glass, was an effect of the Absence of so much of the Sulphur, and might in part make the remaining Masse some amends for it. What we further did with this new or reproduced Concrete, is not proper to be here told you: onely, for your satisfaction, we have kept a Lump of it, that you may, with us, take notice of what some Philosophers would call the Mindfulness of Nature, which, when a Body was deprived of a not inconsiderable portion of its chiefe Ingredient, and had all its other parts dissipated, and shuffled, and discolour'd, so as not to be knowable, was able to rally those scatter'd and disguised parts, and Marshal or dispose them into a Bo∣dy of the former Consistence, Colour, &c. though (which is not here to be o∣verlook'd) the Contexture of Antimo∣ny, by reason of the copious shining Styriae, that enoble the darker Body, be
much more elaborate, and therefore more uneasie to be restored, then that of many other Concretes. But among all my Tryals about the Redintegration of Bodies, That which seem'd to succeed best, was made upon Turpentine: for having taken some Ounces of this, very pure, and good, and put it into a Glass Retort, I distill'd so long with a very gentle fire, till I had separated it into a good quantity of very clear Liquor, and a Caput mortuum very dry and brittle: then breaking the Re∣tort, I powder'd the Caput mortuum, which, when it was taken out, was ex∣ceeding sleek, and transparent enough, and very Red; but being powder'd, ap∣pear'd of a pure Yellow colour. This Powder I carefully mixt vvith the Li∣quor, that had been distill'd from it, vvhich immediately dissolv'd part of it into a deep red Balsam; but by further Digestion in a large Glass exquisitely stopt, that Colour began to grovv fain∣ter,
though the remaining part of the Povvder, (except a very little propor∣tionable to so much of the Liquor, as may be suppos'd to have been vvasted by Evaporation, and Transfusion out of one Vessel into another,) be perfect∣ly dissolv'd, and so well reunited to the more fugitive parts of the Concrete, that there is scarce any, that by the smell, or tast, or consistence vvould take it for other then good and laudable Tur∣pentine.
The I. Section of the Historical Part (containing the Observations, and beginning at pag, 107.) is mis∣plac'd, and ought to have come in here, and have immediately preceded this II. Se∣ction containing the Experiments.
ADVERTISEMENTS about the ensuing II. SECTION. THe Author would not have the Reader think, that the following Experiments, are the sole ones that he could have set down to the same purpose with them. For they are not the onely that he had actually laid aside for this occasion, till judging the ensuing ones sufficient for his present scope, he thought it fitter to reserve Others for those Notes about the Production of particular Qualities, to which they seem'd properly to belong. Perhaps also it will be requisite for me (because some Readers may think the Omission a little strange) to excuse my having left di∣vers particulars unmentioned in more then One of the en∣suing Experiments. And I confesse that I might easily e∣nough both have taken notice of more Circumstances in them, and made far more Reflections on them, if I would have expatiated on the several Experiments according to the Di∣rections deliver'd in otherContaining some Advices and Directions for the writing of an Experimental Natural History. Papers. But though there, where twas my Design to give imployment to the Curiosity and Diligence of as many Votaries to Nature, as (for want of letter instructions) had a mind to be so set on work, it was fit the proposed Method should be suitable; yet here, where I deliver Experiments, not so much as parts of Natural History, as instances to confirm the Hypotheses, and Dis∣courses they are annexed to; it seemed needlesse, and im∣proper, (if not impertinent,) to set down Circumstances, Cautions, Inferences, Hints, Applications, and other Par∣ticulars, that had no tendency to the scope, for which the Experiments were alledged. These two Leaves are to be placed imme∣diately before the 271 page.
And as for the kind of Experiments, here made choice of, I have the less scrupled to pitch upon Chymical Experiments, rather then Others on this occasion; not onely because of those Advantages which I have ascrib'd to such Experi∣ments in the latter part of the Preface The Preface, here mentioned, is that premissed to the Tract intituled—Sme Specimens of an Attempt to make ∣mical Experiments useful to illustrate the Notions of the Corposcula Philosophy. to my Specimens, but because I have been Encouraged by the success of the Attempt made in those Discourses. For as new as it was when I made it four or five years ago, and as unsual: Thing as it could seem to divers Atomists and Cartesians, That I should take upon me to Confirm and Illustrate the Notions of the Particularian Philosophy (if I may so call it) by the help of an Art, whih many were pleas'd to thck cultivated but by Illiterate Oerators, or it hmsical Ph∣naticks in Philosophy, and useful onely to mae Medicines, or Disguize Metals: yet these Endeavours of ours met with much lesse opposition, then new Attempts are most com∣monly fain to struggle with. And in so short a time I have had the happiness to engage both divers Chymist learn and relish the Notions of the Corpuscular Philosohy, and divers eminent Embracers of That, to endeavour to illustrate and promote the New Philosophy, by addicting themselves to the Experiments, and perusing the Books: Chymists. And I acknowledge, it is not unwelcome to  to have been (in some ttle measure) instrumental to m the Corpuscularian Philosophy, assisted by Chymistry, preferred to that which has so long obtained in the Sch. For (not here to consider, which  elsewhere do, how gi an Advantage. That Philosophy by hath of This, by having a advantage of it in point of clearness,) though divers l∣ned and worthy mn, that knew no better Principles, h in cultivating the Periateick Ones, abundantly exercised and displaid their own Wit: yet I fear they have very ,
if at all, improved their Readers Intellect, or enricht it with any true or useful Knowledg of Nature; but have rather taught him to Admire Their Subtlety, then Under∣stand Hers. For to ascribe all particular Phaenomena, that seem any thing Difficult, (for abundance are not thought so, that are so,) to substantial Forms, and, but nominal∣ly understood, Qualities, is so general and easie a way of resolving Difficulties, that it allows Naturalists, with∣out Disparagement, to be very Careless and Lazy, if it do not make thm so: as in effect we may se, that in about 2000 years since Aristotles time, the Adorers of his Phy∣sicks, at least by vertue of Hs peculiar Principles, seem to have done little more more then Wrangle, without clea∣ring up (that I know of) any mystery of Nature, or pro∣ducing any useful or noble Experiments: whereas the Cul∣tivators of the Particularian Phlosophy, being obliged by the nature of their Hypothesis, and their way of Reaso∣ning, to give the particular Accounts and Explications of particular Phaenomena of Nature, are also obliged, not onely to know the general Laws and Course of Nature, but to enquire into the particular Structure of the Bodies they are conversant with, as that wherin, for the most part, their Power of acting, and Disposition to be acted on, does depend. And in order to this, such Enquiries must take notice of Abundance of Minute Circumstances; and to a∣void mistaking the Causes of some of them, must often Make and Vary Experiments; by which means Nature comes to be much more diligently and in ustriously Studied, and in∣numerable Particulars are discover'd and observed, which in the Lazy Aristorelian way of Philosophizing would not be Heeded. But to return to that Decad of Instances, to which these Advertisements are premised; I hope I need not make an Apology for making choice rather of Chymical Experiments, then others, in the second and concluding
Section of the Historical Part of the present Treatise.  though I prefer that Kind of Instances, yet I would not be thought to overvalue Them in their kind, or to deny, the some Artists may (for ought I know) be found, to whose Chymical Arcana, these Experiments may be little better the Trifles. Nor perhaps are these the considerablest, that I my self could easily have communicated; (though these them∣selves would not be now Divulged, if I would have been ruled by the Disswasions of such as would have nothing of Chymical made Common, which they think Considerable.) But things of greater Value in themselves, and of Noble Ʋse in Physick, may be less Fit for our present purpose, (which is not to impart Medicinal, or Alchymistical Pro∣cesses, but illustrate Philosophical Notions,) then such Experiments as these; which, besides that they containe Variety of Phaenomena, do not (for the most part) require either much Time, or much Charge, or much Skill.
The II. SECTION, containing the EXPERIMENTS. Experiment I. TAke good and clear Oyl of Vitriol, and cast into it a convenient quan∣tity of good Camphire grosly beaten; let it float there a while, and, without the help of external hear, it will insenslibly be resolv'd into a Liquor, which, from time to time, as it comes to be produc'd, you may, by shaking the Glass, mingle with the Oyl of Vitriol, whereunto you may, by this means, impart first a fine Yellow, and then a colour, which though it be not a true Red, will be of kin to it, and so very deep, as to make the mix∣ture almost quite Opacous. When all
the Camphire is perfectly dissolv'd by incorporating with the Menstruum, if you hit upon good Ingredients, and up∣on a right Proportion, (for a slight Mistake in either of them, may make this part of the Experiment miscarry,) you may probably obtain such a mix∣ture, as I have more then once had, namely, such a one, as not onely to me, whose sense of Smelling is none of the Dullest, but also to others, that knew not of the Experiment, seem'd not at all to have an Odour of the Camphire. But if into this Liquor you pour a due quantity of fair Water, you will see (perhaps not without delight) that, in a trice, the Liquor will become pale, al∣most as at the first, and the Camphire, that lay conceal'd in the pores of the Menstruum, will immediately disclose it self, and emerge, in its own nature and pristine form of white floating and com∣bustible Camphire, which will fill not the Viol onely, but the neighbouring
part of the Air with its strong and Dif∣fusive Odour. Now the Phaenomena of this Experi∣ment may, besides the uses we elsewhere make of it, afford us several particulars pertinent to our present purpose. I. For (first) we see a lighter and con∣sistent Body brought, by a Comminu∣tion, into Particles of a certain figure, to be kept swimming, and mixed with a Liquor, on which it floated before, and which is, by great odds, heavier then it self: so that as by the Solution of Gold in Aqua regis, it appears, that the pon∣perousest of Bodies, if it be reduc'd to parts minute enough, may be kept from sinking in a Liquor much lighter then it self: So this Experiment of Ours mani∣fests what I know not whether hitherto Men have prov'd, That the Corpuscles of Lighter Bodies may be kept from e∣merging to the Top of a much heavier Liquor: which Instance being added to that of the Gold, may teach us, that,
when Bodies are reduc'd to very minute parts, we must as well consider their par∣ticular Texture, as the receiv'd Rules of the Hydrostaticks, in determining whe∣ther they will sink, or float▪ or swim. II. This Experiment also shews, that several Colours, and even a very deep one, may soon be produc'd by a White Body, and a clear Liquor, and that without the intervention of fire, or any external heat. III. And that yet this Colour may, almost in the twinckling of an Eye, be destroy'd, and as it were annihilated, and the Latitant Whiteness, as many would call it, may be as suddainly restor'd by the Addition of nothing but fair Wa∣ter, vvhich has no Colour of its ovvn, upon vvhose account it might be sur∣mis'd to be contrary to the perishing colour, or to heighten the other into a Praedominancy: nor does the Water take into its self, either the Colour it destroy'd, or That it restores. For
IV. The more then semi-opacity of the Solution of Camphire and Oyl of Vitriol does presently vanish; and that Menstruum, with the Water, make up (as soon as the Camphorate Corpuscles come to be a float) one transparent and colourless Liquor. V. And tis worth noting, that upon the mixture of a Liquor, which makes the Fluid much Lighter, (for so Water is in respect of Vitriol,) a Body is made to emerge, that did not so, when the Fluid was much heavier. This Experi∣ment may serve to countenance what we elsewhere argue against the Schools, touching the Controversie about Mi∣stion. For whereas though some of them dissent, yet most of them maintain, that the Elements alwaies loose their Forms in the mix'd Bodies they constitute; and though if they had dexterously pro∣pos'd their Opinion, and limited their Assertions to some cases, perhaps the Doctrine might be tolerated: yet since
they are wont to propose it crudely and universally, I cannot but take notice, how little tis favour'd by this Experi∣ment; wherein even a mix'd Body (for such is Camphire) doth, in a further mi∣stion, retain its Form and Nature, and may be immediately so divorced from the Body, to which it was united, as to turn, in a trice, to the manifest Exercise of its former Qualities. And this Ex∣periment being the easiest Instance, I have devis'd, of the preservation of a Body, when it seems to be destroy'd, and of the Recovery of a Body to its former Conditions; I desire it may be take notice of, as an instance I shall after have Occasion to have recourse to, and make use of. VI. But the notablest thing in the Experiment is, that Odours should de∣pend so much upon Texture; that one of the subtlest and strongest sented Drugs, that the East it self or indeed the World affords us, should so soon
quite loose its Odour, by being mix'd with a Body that has scarce, if at all, any sensible Odour of its own, and This, while the Camphorate Corpuscles sur∣vive undestroy'd, in a Liquor, from whence one would think, that lesse sub∣tle and fugitive Bodies, then they, should easily exhale. VII. Nor is it much lesse conside∣rable, that so strong and piercing a Sent as that of Camphire, should be, in a moment, produc'd in a Mixture, where∣in none of it could be perceiv'd before, by such a Liquor as Water, that is quite devoid of any Odour of its own: which so easie and suddain restauration of the Camphire to its Native Sent, as well as other Qualities, by so languid a Liquor as common Water, doth likewise argue, that the Union or Texture of the two Ingredients, the Camphire and the Oyl of Vitriol, was but very slight, upon which neverthelesse a great alteration in point of Qualities depended. And to con∣firme,
that divers of the praeceding Phae∣nomena depend upon the particular Tex∣ture of the Liquors, imploy'd to exhibit them, I shall add, that if, instead of oyl of Vitriol, you cast the Concrete into well deflegm'd Spirit of Nitre, you will ob∣tain no red, nor dark, but a Transparent and Colourless Solution. And when to the above mention'd red Mixture I put, instead of fair Water, about 2 or 3 parts of duely rectifi'd Spirit of Wine, there would ensue no such changes, as those formerly recited; but the Spirit of Wine, that dissolv'd the Concrete, when it was by it self, without loosing its Diaphaneity, or acquiring any Co∣lour, did, when it dissolv'd the Mix∣ture, dissolve it with its new adventiti∣ous Colour, looking like a gross red Wine, somewhat turbid, or not yet well freed from its Lees: so that this Colour appear'd to reside in the Mixture as such, since neither of the two Ingredi∣ents dissolv'd in, or mingled vvith the
Spirit of Wine, would have afforded that Colour, or indeed any other. But if to this Liquor, that look'd like troub∣led Wine, we poured a large Proporti∣on of fair Water, the Redness would immediately vanish, and the Whole would, as to sense, become White throughout; I say, as to sense, because the Whitenesse did not indeed apper∣tain properly to the whole Mixture, but to a huge multitude of little Cor∣puscles of the reviv'd Concrete, where∣of some or other, which at first swamme confusedly to and fro, left no sensible Portion of the Liquor unfurnish'd with some of them; whereas when the Cam∣phorate Corpuscles had leisure to e∣merge, as they soon did, they floated in the forme of a White Powder or Froth at the top of the Liquor, leaving all the rest as clear and colourlesse as the com∣mon Water. But we have not yet mention'd all the use, we design'd to make of our
Mixture, for by prosecuting the Expe∣riment a little further, we made it afford us some new Phaenomena. VIII. For having kept the Mixture in a moderately warme place, (which circumstance had perhaps no influence on the Successe,) and having distill'd it out of a Glass Retort, the Event an∣swer'd our Expectation, and the Liquor, that came over, had a Sent; which, though very strong, was quite differing both from that of the Mixture, and that of the Camphire; and in the remaining Body, though the Liquor and the Cam∣phire it consisted of, were either both transparent, or the one transparent as a Liquor, and the other white, as trans∣parent and colourlesse Bodies are wont to be made by Contusion: yet the re∣maining Mass, which amounted to a good part of the Mixture, was not one∣ly Opacous, but as black as Coal, is some places looking just like polished
Jet; which is the more considerable, because that though Vegetable Sub∣stances, that are not fluid, are wont to acquire a Blackness from the fire, yet neither do Liquors, that have already been distill'd, obtain that Colour upon Redistillation, neither have we, upon Tryal purposely made, found, that Camphire, expos'd to fire in a Retort, fitted with a Receiver, (which was the case of the present Experiment,) would at all acquire a Jetty Colour, but would either totally ascend White, or afford Flores, and a Caput mortuum (as a vul∣gar Chymist would call the Remaines) of the same Colour, both in respect of one another, and in respect of the Cam∣phire. IX. And our Experiment afforded this notable Phaenomenon, That though Oyl of Vitriol be a distill'd Liquor, and though Camphire be so very fugitive a Substance, that being left in the Air, it will, of it self, fly all away; and therefore
Physicians and Druggists prescribe the keeping it in Linseeds or Millium, or other convenient Bodies, to hinder its Avolation; yet, by our Experiment, its Fugacity is so restrain'd, that not onely the Caput mortuum newly mention'd, endured a good fire in the Retort, before it was reduc'd to that pitchy Substance vve vvere lately mentioning, but having taken some of that substance out of the Retort, & order'd it, by a careful Work∣man, to be kept in a closely cover'd Crucible during some time in the fire; when it vvas brought me back, after the Pot had been kept red hot above half an hour, there remain'd a good quanti∣ty of the Matter, brittle, vvithout any smell of Camphire, and as black as or∣dinary Charcoal; so much do the Fixity and Volatility of Bodies depend upon Texture.
Experiment II. AMong those other Experiments of mine, (Pyrophilus) which tend to manifest, that new Qualities may be produc'd in Bodies, as the Effects of new Textures; I remember, some years ago, I writ for a Friend a whole Set of Tryals, that I had made about the Chan∣ges I could produce in Metals and Mi∣nerals, by the Intervention of Subli∣mate. But though the whole Tract, wherein they are recited, might be per∣tinent enough to our present Subject; yet reserving other passages of it for o∣ther places, (especially for our Notes upon those particular Qualities, which they are most proper to illustrate,) it may at this time suffice me to send you a Transcript of what that Account con∣tains, relating to Copper and Silver, the one a mean and fugitive, and the other a noble and fix'd Metal. For those changes
Colour, Consistence, Fusiblenesse, and other Qualities, which you will meet with in these Experiments, will afford us divers Phaenomena, to shew what great Changes may be made, even in Bodies scarce corruptible, by one or more of those three Catholick wayes of Natures working according to the Corpuscular Principles, namely, the Access, the Recess, and the Trans∣position of the minute Particles of Mat∣ter. As for my Method of changing the Texture of Copper, I confess it hath oftentimes seem'd strange to me, that Chymists, plainly seeing the notable Effect, that Sublimate, distill'd from Antimony, has upon that Mineral, by opening it, and volatilizing it, (as we see it do in the making of what they are pleas'd to call Mercurius vitae,) should not have the Curiosity to try, whether or no Sublimate might not likewise produce, if nor the same, yet a conside∣rable
Change in other Mineral Bodies, there appearing no reason, or at least there having been none given, that I know of, why the Reserating Operati∣on (if I may so speak) of Sublimate, should be confin'd to Antimony. Up∣on these Considerations, we were in∣vited to endeavour to supply the Neg∣lect we had observ'd in Chymists, of improving the Experiment of Butyrum Antimonii: and though an Indisposition in point of Health, which befell us be∣fore we had made any great progress in our Enquiries, made us so shy of the Fumes of Sublimate and Minerals, that we neither did make all our Tryals so accurately, nor prosecute them so far as we would have done, had we been to deal with more innocent Materials: Yet we suppose, it will not be unwelcome to You, to receive from us a naked, but faithful, Narrative of our Proceedings; being apt to think, that you will there∣in find Inducements to carry on this
Experiment further then we have done, and to compleat what we have but be∣gun. First then, we took half a pound of Copper plates, of about an Inch broad, and the thickness of a Grain of Wheat, (which we after found was too great,) and of an arbitrary length; then casting a Pound of grosly beaten Venetian Sub∣limate into the bottom of a somewhat deep Glass Retort, we cast in the Cop∣per plates upon it, that the Fumes of the Sublimate might, in their Ascension, be compell'd to act upon the incum∣bent Metal, and then placing this Re∣tort, as deep as we well could, in a Sand Furnace, and adapting to it a small Re∣ceiver, we administer'd a Gradual fire seaven or eight hours, and at length for a while increas'd the heat, as much as we well could do in such a Furnace. The success of this Operation was as follows. 1. There came little or no Liquor at all over into the Receiver, but the Neck &
upper part of the Retort were Candied on the inside, by reason of the copious Sublimate adhaering to them, which Sublimate weigh'd above Ten Ounces; in the Retort we found about two Oun∣ces and a quarter of running Mercury, which had been suffer'd to revive by the acid Salts, which corroding the Copper, forsook the Quicksilver, whereto they had been in the Sublimate united. 2. Upon the increase of the fire, there was plainly heard a Noise, made by the melting Matter in the Retort, not un∣like that of a boyling Pot, or of Vitri∣ol, when being committed to a Calci∣ning fire, it is first brought to flow. And this Noise we found to be a more con∣stant Circumstance of this Experiment, then the revification of part of the Mer∣cury contain'd in the Sublimate; for up∣on another Tryal, made with the former proportion of Copper plates and Sub∣limate, we observ'd, during a very long while, such a Noise as hath been already
mention'd, but the Operation being fi∣nish'd, we scarce found so much as a few Grains of running Mercury, either in the Retort or Receiver. 3. We found the Metalline Lump, in the bottom of the Retort, to have been increas'd in weight somewhat more then (though not half an Ounce above) two Ounces; some of the Copper plates, ly∣ing at the bottom of the Mass, retain'd yet their Figure and Malleablenesse, which we ascrib'd to their not having been thin enough to be sufficiently wrought upon by the Sublimate: the Others, which were much the greater number, had wholly lost their Metalline form, and were melted into a very brit∣tle Lump, which I can compare to no∣thing more fitly, then a lump of good Benjamin; for this Mass, though pon∣derous, was no less brittle, and being broken, appear'd of divers Colours, which seem'd to be almost transparent, in some places it was red, in others of a
high and pleasant Amber Colour, and in other parts of it, Colours more dar∣kish and mix'd might be discern'd. 4. But this strange Mass being bro∣ken into smaller Lumps, and laid upon a Sheet of White Paper in a Window, was, by the next morning, where ever the Air came at it, all cover'd with a lovely greenish Blew, or rather, blewish Green, almost like that of the best Ver∣degreese, and the longer it lay in the air, the more of the internal parts of the Fragments did pass into the same Co∣lour: but the vvhite Paper, which in some places they stain'd, seem Dy'd of a Green colour inclining unto Yellow. And here we had Occasion to take no∣tice of the insinuating subtlety of the Air; for having put some pieces of this Cupreous Gum (if I may so call it) into a little Box, to shut out the Air, which vve have found it possible to exclude by other means, vve found, that not∣withstanding our care, those included
Fragments were, as well as the rest al∣ready mention'd, covered with the pow∣der, as it were of viride Aeris. 5. We must not, on this Occasion, o∣mit to tell you, that, having, the last year, made some Tryals in reference to this Experiment, we observ'd in one of them, that some little Copper plates, from which Sublimate had been drawn off, retain'd their pristine shape, and Metalline nature, but were Whitened over like Silver, and continu'd so for divers Months, (though we cannot pre∣cisely tell you hovv long, having at length accidentally lost them.) And to try vvhether this Whiteness vvere one∣ly superficial, vve purposely broke some of these flexible Plates, and found, that this Silver colour had penetrated them throughout, and vvas more glorious in the very Body of the Metal, then on its Surface, vvhich made us suspect, that the Sublimate, by us imploy'd, had been adulterated vvith Arsenick, (vvhere∣with
the Sophisticators of Metals are wont to make Blanchers for Copper, but not to mention, that rhe Malleable∣nesse continu'd, which Arsenick is wont to destroy,) we discover'd not by Tryal, that the Sublimate was other then sin∣cere. 6. In this Metalline Gum the Body of the Copper appear'd so chang'd and open'd, that we were invited to look upon such a Change as no ignoble Ex∣periment, considering the Difficulty, which the best Artists tell us there is, and which those, that have attempted it, have found, I say not, to unlock the Sulphur of Venus, but to effect lesse Changes in its Texture, then was here∣by made. For this Gum, cast upon a quick Coal, and a little blown, will partly melt and flow like Rosin, and partly flame, and burn like a Sulphur, and with a flame so lasting, if it be re∣kindled as often as it leaves off burning, that we observ'd it, not without some
Wonder; and so inflammable is this ope∣ned Copper, that, being held to the flame of a Candle, or a piece of lighted Paper, it would almost in a moment take fire, and send forth a flame like common Sulphur, but onely that it seem'd to us to incline much more to a greenish colour, then the blewer flame of Brimstone is wont to do. To these Phaenomena of our Experi∣ment, as it was made with Copper, my Notes inable me to subjoyn some o∣thers, exhibited when we made it with Sublimate and Silver. There were taken of the purest sort of Coined Silver we could get, half a scort thin Plates, on which vvas cast double the vveight of Sublimate in a small and strongly coated Retort. This Matter being sublim'd in a naked fire, vve found, (having broken the Vessel,) that the Sublimate vvas almost totally as∣cended to the top and neck of the Re∣tort, in the latter of vvhich appear'd in
many places some reviv'd Mercury, in the bottom of the Retort we found a little fluxed Lump of Matter, which 'twas scarce possible to separate from the Glass, but having, with much adoe ivorc'd them, we found this Mass to be brittle, of a pale yellowish colour, of eer about the weight of the Metal, on which the Sublimate had been cast. And in the thicker part of this Lump there appear'd, when it was broken, some part of the Silver plates, vvhich, though brit∣tle, seem'd not to have been perfectly dissolv'd. This Resin of Silver did, like that of Copper, but more slowly, im∣ibe the Moisture of the Air, and vvith∣n about 24. hours, vvas cover'd vvith a somevvhat greenish Dust, concerning vvhich vve durst not determine, vvhe∣ther it proceeded from that mixture of Copper, vvhich is generally to be me vvith in coyned Silver, or from the compounded Metal. For the more curious sort of Painters do, as they in∣form
us, by corroding coined Silve vvith the fretting steams of saline Bo∣dies, or vvith corrosive Bodies them∣selves, turn it into a fine kind of Azu as we may elsevvhere have opportuni more particularly to declare. I sh novv onely adde, that some small frag¦ments of our Resin, being cast upon r hot Coals, did there vvast themselv in a flame not very differing in colo from that of the former mention'd R¦sin of Copper, but much more durab then vvould have easily been expect from so small a quantity of Matter. This is all the Account I can give yo of our first Tryal, but suspecting, th the Copper, vvont to be mixt as a Alloy-vvith our coyned Silver, migh have too much Influence on the reci Event; coming aftervvards into a pla vvhere vve could procure Refin'd S¦ver, vve took an Ounce of That, a having Laminated it, vve cast it up tvvice its Weight of beaten Sublim
hich being driven away from it with a somewhat strong fire, we took, out of he bottom of the Glass Retort, a Lump of Matter, which in some places, where it lay next the Glasse, was as it were silver'd over very finely, but so very hinly, that the Thicknesse of the Silver carce equall'd that of fine white Paper; the rest of the Metal (except a little that lay undissolv'd almost in the mid∣dle of the Masse, because, as we sup∣pos'd, the Plates had not been beaten, till they were sufficiently and equally thin,) having been, by the saline part of the Sublimate, that stuck to it, colliqua∣ed into a Mass, that look'd not at all like Silver, or so much as any other Metal or Mineral. And tis remarkable, that though Sil∣ver be a fixt Metal, and accounted in∣destructible; yet it should by so slight an Operation, and by but about a quarter of its vveight of Additament, (as ap∣pear'd by weighing the whole Lump,)
be so strangely disguized, and have its Qualities so alter'd. For (first) though an eminent White∣nesse be accounted the colour, which be∣longs to pure Silver, and though beate Sublimate be also eminently White yet the Mass, we are speaking of, w partly of a Lemmon or Amber colour or a deep Amethystinine colour, a partly of so dark a one, as it seem'd black: and it was pretty, that sometime in a fragment, that seem'd to be one con∣tinued and entire piece, the upper par would be of a light Yellow, vvhich ab¦ruptly ending, the lower vvas of a co∣lour so obscure, as scarce to challenge any name distinct from Black. Next whereas Silver is one of the most Opacous Bodies in Nature, and Sublimate a White one, the produc'd Mass was in great part Transparent, though not like Glass, yet like good Amber. Thirdly, the Texture of the Silver
was exceedingly alter'd: for our Mass, instead of being Malleable and Flexible, as that Metal is very much, appear'd, if you went about to cut it with a Knife, like Horn, yet otherwise easily apt to crack and break, though not at all to bend. Fourthly, whereas Silver will indure Ignition for a good while before it be brought to Fusion, our Mixture will easily melt, not onely upon quick coals, but in the flame of a Candle; but this Resin, or Gum (if I may so call it) of our fix'd Metal did not, like that, we for∣merly describ'd, of Copper, tinge the flame of a Candle, or produce with the glowing coals, on which tis laid, either a green or blewish colour. And (Pyrophilus) to discover how much these Operations of the Subli∣mate upon Copper and Silver depend upon the particular Textures of these Bodies, I took two parcels of Gold, the one common Gold thinly laminated,
and the other very well refin'd, and ha∣ving cast each of these in a distinct Uri∣nal, upon no less then thrice its weight of grosly beaten Sublimate, I caus'd this last nam'd substance to be, in a Sand fur∣nace, elevated from the Gold, b found not, that either of the two Par∣cels of that Metal was manifestly alter'd thereby: whether in case the Gold had been reduc'd to very minute particles, some kind of change (perhaps, if any differing enough from those lately reci∣ted to have been made in the Copper and the Silver) might have been made in it, I am not so absolutely certain; but I am confident, that by what I reserve to tell you hereafter of Sublimates O∣peration upon some other Minerals, especially Tin, it will appear, that That Operation depends very much upon the particular Texture of the Body, from whence that Sublimate is Elevated. Before I dismiss this subject, Pyrophi∣lus, I must not conceale from you, that
in the Papers, whence these Experi∣ments made with Sublimate have been transcribed, I annex'd to the whole Dis∣course a few Advertisements, whereof the first was, That I was reduc'd, in those Experiments, to imploy, for want of a better, a Sand Furnace, wherein I could not give so strong a fire as I desir'd, which circumstance may have had some Influence upon the recited Phaenomena; and among other Advertisements there being one, that will not be impertinent to my present Design, and may possi∣bly afford a not unsuccesful Hint, I shall subjoin it in the words, wherein I find it deliver'd. The next thing, of which I am to ad∣vertise you, is this, That this Experi∣ment may probably be further im∣prov'd, by imploying about it various and new kinds of Sublimate, and that several other things may be sublim'd up together either with crude Mercury, or with common Sublimate, he that con∣siders
the way of making vulgar Subli∣mate, will not, I suppose, deny. To give you onely one Instance, I shall inform you, that, having caus'd about equal parts of common Sublimate and Sal Armoni∣ack to be well powder'd and incorpora∣ted, by subliming the Mixture in strong and large Urinals plac'd in a Sand Furnace, we obtain'd a new kind of Sub∣limate, differing from the former, which we manifested ad Oculum, by dissolving a little of it and a little of common Sub∣limate severally in fair water; for drop∣ping a little resolv'd salt of Tartar upon the solution of common Sublimate, it immediately turn'd of an Orange tawny colour, but dropping the same Liquor upon the solution of the Ammoniack Sublimate, if I may so call it, it present∣ly turn'd into a Liquor in Whitenesse resembling Milk: And having from 4 ounces of Copper plates drawn 6 ounces of this new Sublimate after the already often recited manner, we had indeed in
the bottom of the Retort a Cupreous Resin, not much unlike That, made by Copper and common Sublimate; and this Resin did, like the other, in the moist Air, soon begin to degenerate into a kind of Verdigreese. But that which was singular in this Operation was, that not onely some of the Sublimate had carried up, to a good height, enough of the Copper to be manifestly colour'd by it of a fine blewish Green, but into the Receiver there was pass'd neer an Ounce of Liquor, that smelt almost like spirit of Sal Armoniack, and was tincted like the Sublimate, so that we suppos'd the Body of the Venus to have been better wrought upon by this, then by the former Sublimate. And yet I judg'd not this way to be the most effectual way of improving common Sublimate, being apt to think, upon grounds not now to be mention'd, that it may, by convenient Liquors, be so far enrich'd and advanc'd, as to be made capable of
opening the Compact Body of Gold it self, and of producing in it such Chan∣ges, (which yet perhaps will enrich but mens Understandings,) as Chymists are wont very fruitlesly to attempt to make in that almost Indestructible Me∣tal. But of This, having now given you a Hint, I dare here say no more. Experiment III. THere is (Pyrophilus) another Ex∣periment, which many wil find more easie to be put in practice, and which yet may, as to Silver, be made a kind of Succedaneum to the former, and consequently may serve to shew, how the like Qualities in Bodies may be ef∣fected by differing Wayes, provided a like Change of Texture be produc'd by them. Of This I shall give you an Ex∣ample in that Preparation of Silver, that some Chymists have call'd Luna Cornea, which I shall not scruple to
mention particularly, and apply to my present purpose; because though the name of Luna Cornea be already to be met with in the Writings of some Al∣chymists, yet the thing it self, being not us'd in Physick, is not wont to be known by those that learn Chymistry in order to Physick; and the way that I use in making it is differing from that of Al∣chymists, being purposely design'd to shew some notable Phaenomena, not to be met with in their way of proceeding. We take then refined Silver, and ha∣ving beaten it into thin Plates, and dis∣solv'd it in about twice its Weight of good Aqua fortis, we Filtrate it care∣fully to obtain a clear solution, (which sometimes we Evaporate further, till it shoot into Chrystals, which we after∣wards dry upon brown Paper with a moderate heat.) Upon the abovemention'd solution we drop good spirit of Salt, till we find, that it will no more curdle the Liquor
it falls into, (which will not happen so soon, as you will be apt at first to ima∣gine,) then we put the whole Mixture in a Glass Funnel lin'd with Cap-paper, and letting the moisture drain through, we dry, with a gentle heat, the substance, that remains in the Filtre, first washing it (if need be) from the loosly adhaering Salts, by letting fair Water run through it several times, whilst it yet continues in the Filtre. This substance being well dry'd, we put it into a Glass Viol, which being put upon quick coals, first cover'd with Ashes, and then freed from them, we melt the contain'd substance into a Mass, which, being kept a while in Fusion, gives us the Luna Cornea we are now to consider. If to make this Factitious Concrete, we first reduce the Silver into Chrystals, and afterwards proceed with spirit of Salt, as we have just now taught you to do with the solution; we have the ex∣ceedingly Opacous, Malleable, and hard∣ly
Fusible Body of Silver, by the con∣venient interposition of some saline Particles, not amounting to the third part of the Weight of the Metal, re∣duc'd into Chrystals, that both shoot in a peculiar and determinate figure, diffe∣ring from those of other Metals, and al∣so are diaphanous and brittle, and by great odds more easily fusible then Sil∣ver it self; besides other Qualities, wherein having elsewhere taken notice, that these Chrystals differ both from Silver and from Aqua fortis, we shall not now insist on them, but pass to the Qualities, that do more properly be∣long to the change of the Solution of Silver into Luna Cornea. First then we may observe, that though spirit of Salt be an highly acid Liquor, and though acid Liquors and Alkalys are wont to have quite contrary Opera∣tions, the one praecipitating what the other would dissolve, & dissolving what the other would praecipitate: yet in our
case, as neither Oyl of Tartar per deli∣quium, nor spirit of Salt will dissolve Silver, so both the one and the other will praecipitate it; which I desire may be taken notice of against the Doctrine of the Vulgar Chymists, and as a Proof, that the Praecipitation of Bodies de∣pends not upon acid or Alkalizate Li∣quors as such, but upon the Texture of the Bodies, that happen to be confoun∣ded. 2. We may here observe, that White∣ness and Opacity may be immediately produc'd by Liquors, both of them Diaphanous and colourless. 3. That on the other side, a White Powder, though its minute parts ap∣pear not transparent, like those of bea∣ten Glass, Rosin, &c. which, by commi∣nution, are made to seem White, may yet, by a gentle heat, be presently reduc'd into a Mass indifferently Transparent, and not at all White, but of a fair Yel∣low.
4. We may observe too, that though Silver require so strong a fire to melt it, and may be long kept red hot, without being brought to Fusion; yet by the as∣sociation of some saline particles, conveniently mingled with it, it may be made so fusible, as to be easily and quickly melted, either in a thin Viol, or at the flame of a Candle, where it will flow almost like Wax. 5. It may also be noted, that though the Lunar solution and the spirit of Salt would, either of them apart, have readily dissolv'd in Water; yet when they are mingled, they do, for the most part, concoagulate into a substance, tht will lie undissolv'd in Water, and is scarce, if at all, soluble either in Aqua fortis, or in spirit of Salt. 6. And remarkable it is, that the Bo∣dy of Silver being very flexible and malleable, (especially if the Metal be, as ours was, refin'd) it should yet, by the Addition of so small a proportion of
Salt, (a Body rigid and brittle,) as is as∣sociated to it in our Experiment, be made of a Texture so differing from what either of its Ingredients was be∣fore, being wholly unlike either a Salt or a Metal, and very like in Texture to a piece of Horn. And to satisfie my self, how much the Toughness of this Metalline Horn depended upon the Texture of the Compositum, resulting from the respective Textures of the se¦veral Ingredients, I praecipitated a soluti∣on of Silver with the distill'd saline Li∣quor commonly call'd Oyl of Vitriol, instead of spirit of salt, and having wash'd the Praecipitate with common Water, I found agreeably to my conjecture, that this Praecipitate, being flux'd in a mo∣derate heat, afforded a Mass, that look'd like enough to the Concrete we have been discoursing of, but had not its Toughness, being brittle enough to be easily broken in pieces. But the tw considerablest Phaenomena of our Ex∣Experiment
do yet remain unmentiond. For 7thly. 'Tis odd, that whereas a solution of Silver is, as we have often occasion to note, the bitterest Liquor we have ever met with, and the spirit of Salt far sowrer then either the sharpest Vinegar, or even the spirit of it, these two so strongly and offensively tasted Liquors should be so easily and speedi∣ly, without any other thing to correct them, be reduc'd into an insipid sub∣stance, (at least so far insipid, that I have lick'd it several times with my Tongue, without finding it otherwise, though perhaps, with much rowling it to and fro in the mouth, it may at length afford some unpleasant Tast, but exceedingly different from that of either of the Li∣quors that compos'd it:) and This, though the Salts, that made both the Silver, and the praecipitating spirit so strongly tasted, remaine associated with the Silver. 8. And Lastly, it is very strange,
that though the saline Corpuscles, that give the efficacy both to good Aqua fortis, and the like spirit of Salt, be not onely so volatile, that they will easily be distill'd with a moderate fire, but so fugitive, that they will in part fly away of themselves in the cold Air, (as our Noses can witness to our trouble, when the Viols, that contain such Liquors, are unstopt;) yet by vertue of the new Texture they acquire, by associating themselves with the Corpuscles of the Silver and with one another, these mi∣nute particles of salt loose so much of their former Lightness, and acquire such a degree of Fixednesse, that they will endure melting with the Metal they adhere to, rather then suffer themselves to be driven away from it. Nor do I remember, that when I melted this Mass in a thin Viol, I could perceive any sensible Evaporation of the Matter: nay having afterwards put a parcel of it upon a quick Coal, though that were blows
to intend the heat; yet it suffer'd Fusi∣on, and so ran off from the Coal, with∣out appearing, when it was taken up a∣gain, to be other then Luna Cornea, as it was before. Experiment IV. I Am now (Pyrophilus) about to do a Thing, contrary enough both to my Custome and Inclination, that is, To discourse upon the Phaenomena of an Experiment, which I do not teach you to make. But since I cannot as yet, without some breach of promise, plainly disclose to you what I must now con∣ceal your Equity assures me of your Pardon. And as, because the Qualities of the Salt, I am to speak of, are very remarkable, and pertinent to my present design, I am unwilling to pass them by unmention'd; so I hope, that notwith∣standing their being strange, I may be allow'd to discourse upon them to you,
who, I presume, know me too well to suspect I would impose upon you in matters of fact, and to whom I am wil∣ling (if you desire it) to shew the Ano∣malous Salt it self, and Ocular proofs of the chief properties I ascribe to it. I shall not then scruple to tell you, that Discoursing one day with a very Ingenious Traveller and Chymist, who had had extraordinary Opportunities to acquire Secrets, of a certain odd Salt I had thought upon and made, which was of so differing a kind from other Salts, that though I did not yet know what Feats I should be able to do with it, yet I was confident, it must have Noble and unusual Operations. This Gentleman, to requie my Franckness, told me, that I had lighted on a greater Jewel, then perhaps I was aware of; and that if I would follow his Advice, by adding something that he nam'd to me, and prosecuting the Preparation a little further, I should obtain a Salt exceeding∣ly
noble. I thank'd him, as I had cause, for his Advice, and, when I had Oppor∣tunity, follow'd it. And though I found the vvay of making this Salt so nice and intricate a thing, that if I vvould, I could scarce easily describe it, so as to enable most men to practice it; yet having once made it, I found, that, besides some of the things I had been told it would per∣form, I could do divers other things vvith it, vvhich I had good cause to be∣lieve the Gentleman, of whom I was speaking, did not think of; and I doubt not, but I should have done much more with it, if I had not unfortunately lost it soon after I had prepar'd it. Several of the Phaenomena, I try'd to produce with it, which are not so pro∣per for this place, are reserv'd for ano∣ther, but here I shall mention a few, that best fit my present purpose. First then, though the several ingre∣dients, that compos'd this Salt, were all of them such, as Vulgar Chymists must
according to their Principles, look up∣on as purely Saline, and were each of them far more salt then Brine, or more sowr then the strongest Vinegar, or more strongly tasted then either of those two Liquors; yet the Compound, made up of onely such Bodies, is so far from be∣ing eminently salt, or sowr, or insipid, that a Stranger being ask'd, what Tast it had, vvould not scruple to judge it ra∣ther sweet, then of any other Tast▪ though its Sweetness be of a peculiar kind, as there is a difference even among Bodies sweet by Nature; the sweetness of Sugar being divers from that of Ho∣ney, and both of them differing from that of the sweet Vitriol of Lead. And this is the onely instance, I remember, I have hitherto met vvith of Salts, that, vvithout the mixture of insipid Bodies, compose a substance really sweet. I say really sweet, because Chymists often∣times terme the Calces of Metals and other Bodies dulcifi'd, if they be freed
from all corrosive salts and sharpness of Tast, sweet, though they have nothing at all of positive sweetness in them; and by that licence of speaking do often e∣nough impose upon the Unskilful. Another thing considerable in our A∣nomalous Salt is, That though its O∣dour be not either strong or offensive, (both which that of Volatile Salts is wont to be,) yet if it be a little urg'd with heat, so as to be forc'd to evapo∣rate hastily and copiously, I have known some, that have been us'd to the power∣ful stink of Aqua fortis, distill'd Urine, and even spirit of Sal Armoniack its self, that have complain'd of this smell, as more strong, and upon that account more unsupportable then these them∣selves: and yet when these Fumes settle again into a Salt, their Odour will again prove mild and inoffensive, if not plea∣sant. Thirdly, whereas all the Volatile, and Acid, and Lixiviate Salts, that we know
of, are of so determinate and specificated a Nature, (if I may so speak,) that there is no one sort of the three, but may be destroy'd by some one or other of the other two Salts, if not by both, as spirit of Urine, which is a volatile Salt, being mingled with spirit of Salt, or Aqua for∣tis, or almost any other strong and acid spirit, will make a great Ebullition, and loose its peculiar Tast, and several of its other Qualities; and on the otherside, Salt of Tartar, and other Alkalys, (that is, Salts produc'd by Incineration of mix'd Bodies,) will be destroy'd with Ebullition by Aqua fortis, spirit of Salt, or almost any other strong spirit of that Family. And spirit of Salt, Aqua for∣tis, &c. will be (as they speak) destroy'd both by Animal volatile Salts, and by the fix'd Salts of Vegetables; that is, will make an Effervescence with either sort of Salts, and compose with them a new Liquor or Salt, differing from either of the ingredients, and, as to tast, smell,
odour, and divers other Qualities, more languid and degenerous: whereas, I say, each of these three Families of Salts may be easily destroy'd by the other two, our Anomalous Salt seems to be above the being thus wrought upon by a∣ny of all the three, and i the onely Body I know: (which is no small priviledge, or rather prerogative,) for I did not find, that a Solution of it, made with as little Water as I could, which is the vvay whereby we usually make it fluid, would make any Ebullition, either with Oyl of Tartar per Deliquium, or spirit of Sal Armoniack, or strong spirit of Salt, or even Oyl of Vitriol, but would calmely and silently mix vvith these differing Liquors, and continue as long as I had patience to look upon them, without being praecipitated by them. But this is not the onely way I imploy'd to examine, whether our Salt belong'd to any of the three above mention'd comprehensive families of Salts. For
I found not, that the strongest solution of it would turn Syrup of Violets either red, as acid spirits do, or green, as both fix'd and volatile Salts will do. Nor would our Solution turn a clear one of Sublimate made in common Water, ei∣ther white, as spirit of Urine, Sal Ar∣moniack, or others of the same family, or into an Orange Tawny, like salt of Tartar, and other Alkalys: but left the solution of Sublimate transparent, with∣out giving it any of these colours, ming∣ling it self very kindly with it, as it had done with the four lately mention'd Liquors. And to satisfy my self a little further, I not onely try'd, that an undis∣colour'd mixture of syrup of Violets and our solution, would immediately be turn'd red by 2 or 3 drops of spirit of Salt, or green by as much Oyl of Tar∣tar: but, to prosecute the Experiment, I let fall a drop or two of a mixture made of our Anomalous solution, and spirit of Salt well shaken together, upon
some syrup of Violets, which was there∣by immediately turn'd red, and a little of the same Anomalous solution, being shaken together with Oyl of Tartar per Deliquium, turn'd another parcel of the same syrup of Violets into a delightful green; which, hapning as I expected, seem'd to argue, that our Solution, though as to sense it were exquisitely mingled in the several mixtures, to which I had put it, did, as it left them their undestroy'd respective Natures, retain its own; and yet this Salt is so far from being a languid or an insignificant thing, that Aqua fortis, and Oyl of Vi∣triol themselves, as operative and as fu∣rious Liquors as they are, are unable in divers cases to make such Solutions, and perform such other things, as our calme, but powerful, Menstruum can, though but slowly, effect. Fourthly: Though this Salt be a vo∣latile one, and requires no strong heat to make it sublime into finely figur'd
Chrystals without a remanence at the Bottom; yet being dissolv'd in Liquors, you may make the Solution, if need be, to boile, without making any of the Salt sublime up, before the Liquor be totally or almost totally drawn off, whereas the volatile salt of Urine, Bloud, Harts-horn, &c. are wont to ascend be∣fore almost any part of the Liquor, they are dissolv'd in, which is in many cases very inconvenient. And though this be a Volatile salt, yet I remember not, that I have ob∣serv'd any fix'd salt, (without excepting salt of Tartar it self,) that runs near so soon per Deliquium, as this will do; but by abstraction of the adventitious moi∣sture tis easily restor'd to its former sa∣line form: and yet differs from salt of Tartar, not onely in Fixednesse and Tast, and divers other qualities, but al∣so in this, That, whereas salt of Tartar requires a vehement fire to flux it, a gentlier heat, then one would easily ima∣gine,
will melt our Salt into a Limpid Liquor. And whereas spirit of Wine will dis∣solve some Bodies, as Sanderick, Ma∣stick, Gum-Lac, &c. and Water, on the other side, dissolves many that spirit of Wine cannot, and Oyls will dissolve some, for which neither of the other Liquors are good solvents; our salt will readily dissolve both in fair Water, in the highest rectifi'd spirit of Wine, (and That so little, as not to weigh more then the salt,) and in Chymical Oyls themselves, with which it will asociate its self very strictly, and perhaps more too, then I have yet found any other consistent salt to do. Experiment V. THe Experiment I am (Pyrophilus) now about to deliver, though I have not yet had Opportunity to per∣fect what I design'd, when some Noti∣ons,
that I have about Fire and Salt, sug∣gested it to me, is yet such as may far more clearly, then almost any of the Ex∣periments commonly known to Chy∣mists, serve to shew us, how near to a real Transmutation those Changes may prove, that may be effected even in in∣animate, and, which is more, scarce cor∣ruptible Bodies, by the recess of some Particles, and the access of some others, and the new Texture of the residue. The Experiment I have made several wayes, but one of the latest and best I have us'd is this: Take one part of good Sea-salt well dry'd and powder'd, and put to it double its weight of good A∣qua fortis, or spirit of Nitre, then have∣ing kept it (if you have time) for some while in a previous digestion, distill it over with a slow fire in a Retort or a low Body, till the the remaining Mat∣ter be quite dry, and no more; for this substance, that will remain in the bot∣tom of the Glass, is the thing that is sought for.
This Operation being performable in a moderate fire, and the Bodies them∣selves being almost of an incorruptible nature, one would scarce think, that so slight a matter should produce any Change in them; but yet I found, as I expected, these notable Mutations of Qualities effected by so unpromising a way. For in the first place, we may take notice, that the Liquor, that came over, was no longer an Aqua fortis, or spirit of Nitre, but an Aqua Regis, that was able to dissolve Gold, which Aqua fortis will not meddle with, and will not dis∣solve Silver, as it would have done be∣fore, but will rather, as I have purpose∣ly try'd, praecipitate it out of Aqua for∣tis, if that Menstruum have already dis∣solv'd it: But this Change belonging not so properly to the substance it self I was about to consider, I shall not here insist on it. 2. Then, the Tast of this Substance
comes by this Operation to be very much alter'd. For it hath not that strong saltness that it had before, but tasts far milder, and, though it rellish of both, affects the Palate much more like Salt-petre, then like common salt. 3. Next, whereas this last nam'd Bo∣dy is of very difficult Fusion, our factiti∣ous salt imitates salt-petre in being ve∣ry fusible, and it will, like Nitre, soon melt, by being held in the flame of a Candle. 4. But to proceed to a more consi∣derable Phaenomenon, tis known, that Sea-salt is a Body, that doth very much resist the fire, when once by being brought to Fusion, it hath been forc'd to let go that windy substance, that makes unbeaten salt crackle in the fire, and so by blowing it accidentally in∣crease it. Tis also known, that acid spi∣rits, as those of Salt, Vitriol, Nitre, Vi∣negar, &c. are not onely not inflamma∣ble themselves, but hinderers of inflam∣mation
in other Bodies; and yet my Conjecture leading me to expect, that, by this Operation, I should be able to produce, out of two inflammable Bo∣dies, a third, that would be easily inflam∣mable. I found, upon Tryal, not one∣ly that small Lumps of this substance, cast upon quick and well blown coals, though they did not give so blew a flame as Nitre, did yet, like it, burn a∣way with a copious and vehement flame. And, for further Tryal, having melted a pretty quantity of this transmuted Sea salt in a Crucible, by casting upon it little fragments of well kindled Char∣coal, it would, like Nitre, presently be kindled, and afford a flame so vehement and so dazling, that one that had better Eyes then I, and knew not what it was, complain'd, that he was not able to sup∣port the splendor of it. Nor were all its inflammable parts consum'd at one de∣flagration: for by casting in more frag∣ments of well kindled Coal, the Matter
would fall a puffing, and flame afresh for several times consecutively, according to the quantity that had been put into the Crucible. 5. But this it self was not the chief discovery I design'd by this Experi∣ment. For I pretended hereby to devise a way of turning an acid salt into an Al∣kaly, which seems to be one of the grea∣test and difficultest Changes, that is ra∣tionally to be attempted among dura∣ble and inanimate Bodies. For tis not unknown to such Chymists as are any thing inquisitive and heedful, how vast a difference there is between acid Salts, and those, that are made by the combu∣stion of Bodies, and are sometimes call'd Fix'd, sometimes Alkalizate. For whereas strong Lixiviums (which are but strong solutions of Alkalys) will readily enough dissolve common Sul∣phur, and divers other Bodies aboun∣ding with Sulphur; even those highly acid Liquors, Aqua fortis, and Aqua
Regis, though so corrosive, that one will dissolve Silver, and the other Gold it self, will let Brimstone lye in them un∣dissolv'd I know not how long; though some say, that in process of time, there may be some Tincture drawn by the Menstruum from it, which yet I have not seen try'd; and though it were true, would yet sufficiently argue a great dis∣parity betwixt those acid spirits, and strong Alkalizate solutions, which will speedily dissolve the very masse of com∣mon Sulphur. Besides, tis observ'd by the inquisitive Chymists, nor does my Experience contradict it, that the Bo∣dies, that are dissolv'd by an acid Men∣struum, may be praecipitated by an Al∣kalizate; and on the contrary, solutions, made by the latter, may be praecipita∣ted by the former. Moreover, as Li∣tharge, dissolv'd in spirit of Vinegar, will be praecipitated by the Oyl of Tar∣tar per Deliquium, or the solution of its Salt; and, on the contrary, Sulphur or
Antimony, dissolv'd in such a solution, will be praecipitated out of it by the spirit of Vinegar, or even common Vi∣negar. Moreover, Acids and Alkali∣zates do also differ exceedingly in tast, and in this greater disparity, that the one is volatile, and the other fix'd, besides other particulars not necessary here to be insisted on. And indeed, if that were true, which is taught in the Schools, that there is a natural enmity, as well as disparity betwixt some Bo∣dies, as between Oyly and waterish ones, the Chymists may very speciously teach, (as some of them do) That there is a strange contrariety betwixt Acid and Alkalizate Salts; as when there is made an Affusion of oyl of Tartar upon Aqua Regis, or Aqua fortis, to praecipi∣tate Gold out of the one, and Silver out of the other, their mutual Hostility seems manifestly to shew it self, not onely by the noise, and hear, and fume, that are immediately excited by their
conflict, but by this most of all, that afterwards the two contending Bodies will appear to have mutually destroy'd one another, both the sowr Spirit and the fixt Salt having each lost its for∣mer Nature in the scuffle, and degene∣rated with its Adversary into a certain Third substance, that wants several of the Properties both of the sowr Spirit and the Alkaly. Now to apply all this to the Occasion, on which I mention'd it, how distant and contrary soever the more inquisitive of the latter Chymists take Acid and Fixed Salts to be; yet I scarce doubted, but that, by our Expe∣riment, I should, from acid salts, obtain an Alkaly, and accordingly having, by casting in several bits of well kindled coal, excited, in the melted Mass of our transmuted Salt, as many Deflagrations as I could, and then giving it a pretty strong fire to drive away the rest of the more fugitive parts, I judg'd, that the remaining Masse would be (like the fix'd
Nitre I have elsewhere mention'd) of an Alkalizate nature, and accordingly having taken it out, I found it to tast, not like Sea-salt, but fiery enough upon the Tongue, and to have a Lixiviate relish. I found too, that it would turn Syrup of Violets into a greenish colour, that it would praecipitate a Limpid so∣lution of Sublimate, made in fair water, into an Orange tawny Powder. I found, that it would, like other fix'd salts, pro∣duce an Ebullition with acid spirits, and even with spirit of salt it self, and con∣coagulate with them. Nor are these themselves all the wayes I took to ma∣nifest the Alkalizate Nature of our transmuted Sea salt. I did indeed consider at first, that it might be suspected, that this new Al∣kalizatenesse might proceed from the Ashes of the injected Coals, the Ashes of Vegetables generally containing in them more or lesse of a fix'd Salt. But when I consider'd too, that a pound of
Charcoal, burn'd to Ashes, is wont to yield so very little Salt, that the inje∣cted fragments of Coal, (though they had been, which they were not) quite burn'd out in this Operation, would scarce have afforded two or three grains of salt, (perhaps not half so much,) I saw no reason at all to believe, that in the whole Mass I had obtain'd (and which was all, that was left me of the Sea-salt, I had at first imploy'd,) it was nothing but so inconsiderable a proportion of Ashes, that exhibited all the Phaenomena of an Alkaly. And for further confirmation both of This, and what I said a little before, I shall adde, that to satisfie my self yet more, I pour'd, upon a pretty quantity of this Lixiviate salt, a due proportion of Aqua fortis, till the hissing and ebulli∣tion ceased, and then leaving the fluid Mixture for a good while to coagu∣late, (which it did very slowly,) I found it at length to shoot into saline Chry∣stals,
which though they were not of the figure of Nitre, did yet, by their in∣flammability and their bigness, suffici∣ently argue, that there had been a Con∣junction made betwixt the Nitrous spirit, and a considerable proportion of Alkaly. I consider'd also, that it might be sus∣pected, that in our Experiment twas the Nitrous Corpuscles of the Aqua fortis, that, lodging themselves in the little rooms deserted by the saline Corpus∣cles of the Sea-salt, that pass'd over into the Receiver, had afforded this Alkaly; as common Salt-petre, being handled after such a manner, would leave in the Crucible a fix'd or Alkalizate Salt. But to this I answer, that as the Sea-salt, which was not driven over by so mild a Distillation, and seem'd much a greater part then that which had pass'd over, was far from being of an Alkalizate na∣ture: so the Nitrous Corpuscles, that are presum'd to have stay'd behind, were
whilst they compos'd the spirit of Ni∣tre, of an highly volatile and acid Na∣ture, and consequently of a nature dire∣ctly opposite to that of Alkalys; and if by the addition of any other substance, that were no more Alkalizate then Sea-salt, an Alkaly could be obtain'd out of spirit of Nitre or Aqua fortis, the Pro∣ducibleness of an Alkaly out of Bodies of another nature might be rightly thence inferr'd: so that however, it ap∣pears, that by the intervention of our Experiment, two Substances, that were formerly acid, are turn'd into one, that is manifestly of an Alkalizate Nature, which is That we would here evince. Perhaps it may (Pyrophilus) be worth while to subjoyn; That to prosecute the Experiment by inverting it, we drew two parts of strong spirit of Salt from one of purifi'd Nitre; but did not observ the remaining Body to be any thing neer so considerably chang'd as the Sea-salt, from which we had drawn
the spirit of Nitre; since though the spi∣rit of Salt, that came over, did (as we ex∣pected) bring over so many of the Cor∣puscles of the Nitre, that, being heated, it would readily enough dissolve foliated Gold; yet the Salt, that remain'd in the Retort, being put upon quick Coals, did flash away with a vehement and halitu∣ous flame, very like that of common Nitre. Experiment VI. I Come now (Pyrophilus) to an Ex∣periment, which, though in some things it be of kin to that which I have already taught you, concerning the changing of Sea-salt by Aqua fortis, will yet afford us divers other instances, to shew, how upon the change of Texture in Bodies, there may arise divers new Qualities, especially of that sort, which, because they are chiefly produc'd by Chymistry, and are wont to be consi∣der'd
by Chymists, if not by Them one∣ly, may in some sense be call'd Chymi∣cal. The Body, which, partly whilst we were preparing it, and partly when we had prepar'd it, afforded us these vari∣ous Phaenomena, either is the same that Glauberus means by his Sal Mirabilis, or at least seems to be very like it: and whether it be the same or no, its various and uncommon Properties make it very fit to have a place allow'd it in this Treatise. Though of the many Tryals I made with it, I can at present find no more among my loose Papers, then that following part of it, that I wrot some years ago to an Ingenious Friend, who I know will not be displeas'd, if, to save my self some time, and the trouble of Examining my Memory, I annex the following Transcript of it. [To give you a more particular ac∣count of what I writ to you from Ox∣ford of my Tryals about Glauber's Salt,
though I dare not say, that I have made the self same Thing, which he cals his Sal Mirabilis, because he has describ'd it so darkly and ambiguously, that tis not easie to know with any certainty what he means; yet whether or no I have not made Salt, that, as far as I have yet try'd it, agrees well enough with what he delivers of His, and therefore is like to prove either his Sal mirabilis, or al∣most as good a one, I shall leave you to judge by this short Narrative. The strange things that the Industrious Glauber's Writings have invited Men to expect from his Sal mirabilis, in case he be indeed possess'd of such a thing, and the Enquiries of divers Eminent Men, who would fain learn of me, what I thought of its Reality and Nature, in∣vited me, the next Opportunity I got, to take into my hands his Pars altera Miraculi Mundi, whose Title you know promises a Description of this Sal Artis mirificum, as he is pleas'd to call it. But,
I confess, I did not read it near all over, because a great part of it is but a Tran∣scription of several entire Chapters out of Paracelsus, and I perceiv'd, that much of the rest did, according to the custome or Chymical Writings, more concern the Author, then the subject; wherefore looking upon his process of making his sal mirabilis, I soon perceiv'd he had no mind to make it common, since he one∣ly bids us upon two parts of common Salt dissolv'd in common Water, to pour A, without telling us what that A is, wherefore reading on in the same pro∣cesse, and finding that he tels us, that with B (which he likewise explaines not at all, nor determines the quantity of it) one may make an Aqua fortis, it pre∣sently call'd into my mind, That some Years before, having had Occasion to make many Tryals, mention'd in other Tracts of mine, with Oyl of Vitriol and Salt petre, I did, among other things, make a red spirit of Nitre, by the help
onely of Oyl of Vitriol; remembring This (I say) I resorted to one of my Car∣neades's Dialogues,See the Sceptical Chymist. and reviewing that Experiment, as I have set it down, I concluded, That though I had not dis∣solv'd the Salt petre in Water, as Glau∣ber doth his common Salt; yet since, on the other side, I made use of external fire, 'twas probable I might this way also get a Nitrous spirit, though not so strong. And though by calling the Liquor, that must make an Aqua fortis B, whereas he had call'd that, which is to make his spirit of Salt and sal mira∣bilis, A, he seem'd plainly to make them differing things, yet relying on the Experiment I had made, and put∣ting to a solution of Nitre as much of the Oyl of Vitriol as I had taken last, though That be double the quantity he prescribes for the making of his Sal mi∣rabilis, I obtain'd, out of a low glasse Body and Head plac'd in Sand, an indif∣ferent
good Spiritus Nitri, that even before Rectification would readily e∣nough dissolve Silver, though it were diluted with as much of the common Water, wherein Salt-petre had been dissolv'd, as amounted at least to dou∣ble or treble the weight of the Nitrous parts; the remaining Matter, being kept in the fire till it was dry, afforded us a Salt easily reducible (by Solution in fair Water and Coagulation) into Chry∣stalline Grains, of a nature very differing both from crude Nitre, and from fixt Nitre, and from Oyl of Vitriol. For it coagulated into pretty big and well shap'd Grains, which, you know, fix'd Nitre and other Alkalizate Salts are not wont to do; and these Graines were not like the Chrystals of Salt-petre it self, long and Hexaedrical, but of ano∣ther figure, not easie nor necessary to be here described. Besides, this Vitriolate Nitre (if I may so call it) would not easily, if at all,
flow in the Air, as fixt Nitre is wont to do. Moreover, it was easily enough fusible by heat, vvhereas fix'd Nitre doth usually exact a vehement Fire for its Fusion; and though crude Salt-petre also melts easily, yet to satisfie you how differing a substance this of ours was from That, vve cast quick Coals into the Crucible, without being at all able to kindle it. Nay, and vvhen, for fur∣ther Tryal, vve threw in some Sulphur also, though it did flame away it self, yet did it not seem to kindle the Salt, that was hot enough to kindle It; much less did it flash, as Sulphur is wont on such occasions to make Salt-petre do. Add to all this, That a parcel of this white substance, being, vvithout Brim∣stone, made to flow for a vvhile in a Crucible, with a bit of Charcoal for it to vvork upon, grew manifestly and strong∣ly sented of Sulphur, and acquir'd an Alkalizate Tast, so that it seem'd al∣most a Coal of fire upon the Tongue,
if it were lick'd before it imbib'd any of the Aires moisture, and (which many perhaps will, though I do not, think stranger) obtain'd also a very red colour; which recall'd to my mind, that Glauber mentions such a Change observable in his Salt, made of common Salt, upon whose Account he is pleas'd to call such a substance his Carbunculus. Being invited by this success to try, whether I could make his Sal mirabilis, notwithstanding his intimating, as I lately told you, that it is done with a differing Menstruum from that, where∣with the Salt-petre is to be wrought upon; I observ'd, that where he points at a way of making his Salt in quantity without breaking the Vessels, he pre∣scribes, that the Materials be distill'd in Vessels of pure Silver; vvhence I con∣jectur'd, that 'twas not Aqua fortis, or spirit of Nitre, that he imploy'd to o∣pen his Sea-salt: and that consequently, since common spirit of Salt was too
weak to effect so great a Change, as the Experiment requires, 'twas very proba∣ble, that he imploy'd Oyl of Sulphur, or of Vitriol, vvhich vvill scarce at all fret unalloy'd Silver. And however I concluded, that whatsoever the Event should prove, it could not but be worth the While to try, vvhat Operation such a Menstruum vvould have upon Sea-salt, as I vvas sure had such a notable one upon salt-petre. And I remember, that formerly making some Experi∣ments about the differing manners of Dissolution of the same Concrete by several Liquors, I found, that Oyl of Vitriol dissolves Sea-salt in a very odd way, (vvhich you vvill find mention'd among my promiscuous Experiments,) vvherefore pouring, upon a solution of Bay-salt, made in but a moderate pro∣portion of Water, Oyl of Vitriol to the full Weight of the dry Salt, and ab∣stracting the Liquor in a Glass Cucur∣bite plac'd in Sand, I obtain'd, without
stress of fire, besides flegme, good store of a Liquor, vvhich, by the Smel and Tast, seem'd to be spirit of Salt. And to satisfie my self the better, mingling a little of it vvith some of the spirit of Nitre lately mention'd, I found the mix∣ture, even without the Assistance of Heat, to dissolve crude Gold. And having, for further Tryals sake, pour'd some of it upon spirit of fermented U∣rine, till the Affusion ceas'd to pro∣duce any Conflict, and having after∣wards gently evaporated away the su∣perfluous moisture, there did, as I expe∣cted, shoot, in the remaining Liquor, a Salt figur'd like Combs and Feathers, thereby disclosing it self to be much of the nature of Sal Armoniack, such as I elsewhere relate my having made, by mingling spirit of Urine vvith spirit of common Salt, made the ordinary way.] This (Pyrophilus) is all I can find at present of that Account, of vvhich I hop'd to have found much more; but
you will be the more unconcern'd, for my not adding divers other things, that, I remember, I try'd, as vvell before and after the vvriting the above trans∣scrib'd Paper, (as particularly, that I found the Experiment sometimes to succeed not ill, when I distill'd the Oyl of Vitriol and Sea-salt together, with∣out the intervention of Water, (where∣by much time was sav'd,) and also when I imploy'd Oyl of Sulphur, made with a Glass Bell, in stead of Oyl of Vitriol,) if I inform You, that afterwards I found, that Glauber himself, in some of his subsequent pieces, had deliver'd more intelligibly the Way of making what he, without altogether so great a Brag, as most think, calls his Sal mirabi∣lis, (which yet some very ingenious Readers of his Writings have come to Us to teach them,) and that those Ex∣periments of his about it, which I vvas able to make succeed, (for some I was not, and some I did not think fit to try)
you will find, together with those of my Own, in more proper places of o∣ther Papers. Onely, to apply what hath been above related to my present purpose, I must not here pretermit a couple of Observations. And first we may take notice of the power, that Mixtures, though they seem but very slight, & consist of the smallest number of ingredients, may, if they make great changes of Texture, have, in alte∣ring the Nature and Qualities of the compounding Bodies. For in our (above recited) case, though Sea-salt be a Bo∣dy considerably fix'd, requires a naked Fire to be elevated even by the help of copious additaments of beaten Bricks, or Clay, &c. to keep it from Fusion, yet the saline Corpuscles are distill'd o∣ver in a moderate Fire of Sand, whilst the Oyl of Vitriol, by whose interven∣tion they acquire this volatility, though it be not (like the other) a Grosse or (as the same Chymist speaks) corporeal salt,
but a Liquor, that has been already di∣still'd, is yet, by the same operation, so fix'd, as to stay behind, not onely in the Retort, but, as I have sometimes pur∣posely try'd, in much considerabler heats then That needs in this Experi∣ment be expos'd to. Nor onely is the oyl of Vitriol made thus far fix'd, but it is otherwise also no less chang'd. For when the remaining Salt has been expos'd to a competent heat, that it may be very drie and white, to be sure of which, I several times do, when the Distillation is ended, keep the remai∣ning Masse (taken out of the Retort and beaten) in a Crucible among quick coals, you shall have a considerable quantity (perhaps near as much as the Sea-salt You first imploy'd) of a Sub∣stance, which, though not insipid, has not at all the tast of Sea-salt, or any o∣ther pungent one, and much lesse the highly corrosive acidity of Oyl of Vi∣triol.
And the mention of this substance leads me to the second particular I in∣tended to take notice of, which is a Phae∣nomenon to confirme what I formerly intimated, That notwithstanding the regular and exquisite figures of some Salts, they may, by the addition of o∣ther Bodies, be brought to constitute Chrystals of very differing, and yet of curious, shapes. For if You dissolve the hitherto mention'd Caput mortuum of Sea salt (after You have made it very dry, and freed it from all pungency of Tast) in a sufficient quantity of fair wa∣ter, and, having filtrated the solution, suffer the dissolv'd Body leisurely to coagulate, You will probably obtain, as I have often done, Chrystals of a far greater Transparency, then the Cubes wherein Sea salt is wont to shoot, and of a shape far differing from theirs, though oftentimes no lesse Curious then that of those Cubes; and, which makes mainely for my present purpose, I have
often observ'd those finely figur'd Chrystals to differ as much in shape from one another, as from the Graines of common Salt. And indeed I must not, on this occasion, conceal from You, that whether it be to be imputed to the peculiar Nature of Sea salt, or (which I judge much more probable) to the great disparities to be met with in Li∣quors, that do all of them pass for Oyl of Vitriol, whether (I say) it be to this, or to some other cause, that the Effect is to be imputed, I have found my At∣tempts, to make the best sort of Sal mi∣rabilis, subject to so much incertainty, that though I have divers times succee∣ded in them, I have found so little Uni∣formity in the success, as made me rec∣kon this Experiment amongst Contin∣gent ones, and almost weary of medling with it.
Experiment ƲII. Though this VII. Experiment, being considerable and very pertinent, the Author thought fit to menti∣on it, such as it is here delivered, when he writ but to a private friend; yet, after he was induc'd to publish these Papers, twas the (now raging) Plague, which drove him from the Accommodations requisite to his purpose, that frustrated the Designe he had of first repeating that part of the Experiment, which treats of the Destruction of Gold: for as for that part, which tea∣ches the Volatilization of it, he had tryed That often enough before. I Remember (Pyrophilus) I once made an Experiment, which, if I had had the Opportunity to repeat, and had done so with the like success, I should be tempted to look upon it, though not as a Lucriferous Experiment, (for tis the quite contrary,) yet as so Luciferous a one, as, how much soever it may serve to recommend Chymistry it self, may no lesse displease Envious Chymists, who will be troubled, both that one, who admits not their Principles, should
devise such a thing, and that having found it, he should not (Chymist like) keep it secret. But to give you a plain and naked Account of this matter, that you may be able the better to judge of it, and, if You please, to repeat it, I will freely tell You, That supposing all Metals, as well as other Bodies, to be made of one Catholick Matter common to them all, and to differ but in the shape, size, moti∣on or rest, and texture of the small parts they consist of, from which Affections of Matter, the Qualities, that difference particular Bodies, result, I could not see any impossibility in the Nature of the Thing, that one kind of Metal should be transmuted into another; (that being in effect no more, then that one Parcel of the Universal Matter, wherein all Bo∣dies agree, may have a Texture produc'd in it, like the Texture of some other Parcel of the Matter common to them both.)
And having first suppos'd this, I fur∣ther consider'd, That in a certain Men∣struum, which, according to the vulgar Chymists doctrine, must be a worthless Liquor, according to my apprehension there must be an extraordinary efficacy in reference to Gold, not onely to dis∣solve, and otherwise alter it, but to in∣jure the very Texture of that supposed∣ly immutable Metal. The Menstruum then I chose to try whether I could not dissolve Gold with, is made by pouring on the rectifi'd oyl of the Butter of Antimony as much strong spirit of Nitre, as would serve to praecipitate out of it all the Bezoarticum Minerale, and then with a good smart Fire distilling off all the Liquor, that would come over, and (if need be) Co∣hobating it upon the Antimonial pow∣der. For though divers Chymists, that make this Liquor, throw it away, upon Presumption, that, because of the Ebul∣lition, that is made by the Affusion of
the spirit to the Oyl, and the consequent precipitation of a copious Powder, the Liquors have mutually destroy'd or dis∣arm'd each other; yet my Notions and Experience of the Nature of some such Mixtures invites me to prize this, and give it the name of Menstruum per acu∣tum. Having then provided a sufficient quantity of this Liquor, (for I have ob∣serv'd that Gold ordinarily requires a far more copious Solvent then Silver,) we took a quantity of the best Gold we could get, and melted it with 3 or 4 times its weight of Copper, which Me∣tal we choose rather then that which is more usual among the Refiners, Silver, that there may be the lesse suspicion, that there remain'd any Silver with the Gold, after their separation; this Mix∣ture we put into good Aqua fortis, or spirit of Nitre, that all the Copper be∣ing dissolv'd, the Gold might be left pure and finely powder'd at the bottom;
this Operation with Aqua fortis being accounted the best way of refining Gold that is yet known, and not sub∣ject, like Lead, to leave any Silver with it, since the Aqua fortis takes up that Metal. And for greater security, we gave the Powder to an Ancient Chy∣mist, to boile some more of the Men∣struum upon it, without communica∣ting to him our Design. This highly refin'd Gold being, by a competent degree of heat, brought, as is usual, to its Native Colour and Lustre, we put to it a large Proportion of the Menstruum peracutum, (to which we have some∣times found cause to adde a little spirit of Salt, to promote the Solution,) wherein it dissolves slowly and quietly enough; and there remain'd at the bot∣tom of the Glasse a pretty quantity (in shew, though not in weight) of white Powder, that the Menstruum would not touch, and, if I much misremember not, we found it as indissoluble in Aqua
Regis too. The Solution of Gold being abstracted, and the Gold again reduc'd into a Body, did, upon a second Soluti∣on, yield more of the white Powder, but not (if I remember aright) so much as at the first; now having some little quanti∣ty of this Powder, twas easie with Bo∣rax or some other convenient Flux, to melt it down into a Metal, which Metal we found to be white like Silver, and yielding to the Hammer, if not to a less pressure, and some of it, being dissolv'd in Aqua fortis or spirit of Nitre, did, by the odious Bitterness it produc'd, suffici∣ently confirm us in our Expectation, to find it true Silver. I doubt not, but you will demand (Py∣rophilus) why I did not make other Tryals with this Factitious Metal, to see in how many other Qualities I could verifie it to be Silver, but the quantity I recover'd after Fusion was so small, some of it perhaps being left either in the Flux, or in the Crucible, that I had
not wherewithall to make many Tryals, and being well enough satisfied by the visible Properties, and the Tast peculi∣ar to Silver, both that it was a Metal, and rather Silver then any other, I was willing to keep the rest of it for a while, as a Rarity, before I made further Try∣als with it; but was so unfortunate, as with it to loose it in a little Silver Box, where I had something of more Value, and possibly of more Curiosity. You will also ask, why I repeated not the Experiment? to which I shall answer, that, besides that one may easily enough faile in making the Menstruum fit for my purpose, I did, when I had another Opportunity, (for I was long without it,) make a Second Attempt; and ha∣ving, according to the above mention'd Method, brought it so far, that there remain'd nothing but the melting of the White Powder into Silver, when ha∣ving wash'd it, I had layd it upon a piece of white Paper by the fires side to dry,
being suddenly call'd out of my Cham∣ber, an ignorant Maid, that in the mean time came to dress it up, unluckily swept this Paper, as a foul one, into the fire: which Discouragement, together with multiplicity of Occasions, have made me suspend the Pursuit of this Experiment, till another Opportunity. But in the mean time I was confirm'd in some part of my Conjecture by these Things. The first, by finding, that with some other Menstruums which I try'd, and even with good Aqua Regis it self, I could obtain from the very best Gold, I dissolv'd in them, some little quantity of such a White Powder, as I was spea∣king of; but in so very small a propor∣tion to the dissolv'd Gold, that I had ne∣ver enough of it at once, to think it worth prosecuting Tryals with. The other was this. That a very Experienc'd Mineralist, whom I had ac∣quainted with part of what I had done,
assur'd me, that an eminently Learned and Judicious person, that he nam'd to me, had, by dissolving Gold in a certain kind of Aqua Regis, and after by redu∣ction of it into a Body, redissolving it again, and repeating this Operation ve∣ry often, reduc'd a very great, if not much the greater, part of an Ounce of Gold into such a White Powder. And the Third thing, that confirm'd me, was, the Proof given me by some Tryals that I purposely made; That the Menstruum peracutum I imploy'd, had a notable Operation upon Gold, and would perform some things (one of which we shall by and by mention,) which Judicious Men, that play the great Criticks in Chymistry, do not think feasible: so that there seems no greater cause to doubt, that the above mention'd Silver was really obtain'd out of the pure Gold, then onely this, That Men have hitherto so often in vain at∣tempted to make a real Transmutation
of Metals, (for the better or for the worse,) and to destroy the most fix'd and compacted Body of Gold, that the one is look'd upon as an Unpracticable Thing, and the other as an Indestructi∣ble Metal. To reflect then a little upon what we have been relating, if we did not mistake nor impose upon our selves, (I say, upon our Selves, the Project being our own, and pursued without acquainting any body with our Aime,) it may afford us very considerable Consequences of great moment And in the First place, it seems pro∣bably reducible from hence, that how∣ever the Chymists are wont to talke ir∣rationally enough of what they call Tinctura Auri, and Anima Auri; yet, in a sober sense, some such thing may be ad∣mitted, I say, some such thing, because as on the one hand, I would not counte∣nance their wild Fancies about their matters, some of them being as unin∣telligible,
as the Peripateticks substan∣tial Forms, so, on the other hand, I would not readily deny, but that there may be some more noble and subtle Corpus∣cles, being duely conjoyn'd with the rest of the Matter, whereof Gold con∣sists, may qualifie that Matter to look Yellow, to resist Aqua fortis, and to ex∣hibit those other peculiar Phaenomena, that discriminate Gold from Silver, and yet these Noble parts may either have their Texture destroy'd by a very pier∣cing Menstruum, or by a greater con∣gruity with its Corpuscles, then with those of the remaining part of the Gold, may stick more closer to the former, and by their means be extricated and drawn away from the latter. As when (to explain my meaning by a gross Ex∣ample) the Corpuscles of Sulphur and Mercury do, by a strict Coalition, associ∣ate themselves into the Body we call Vermilion, though these will rise toge∣ther in Sublimatory Vessels, without
being divorc'd by the fire, and will act, in many cases, as one Physical Body: yet tis known enough among Chy∣mists, That if You exquisitely mix with it a due proportion of Salt of Tartar, the parts of the Alkaly will associate themselves more strictly with those of the Sulphur, then these were before as∣sociated with those of the Mercury, whereby You shall obtain out of the Cinnabar, which seem'd intensely red, a real Mercury, that will look like fluid Silver. And this Example prompts me to mind You, (Pyrophilus) That, at the beginning of this Paragraph, I said no more, then that the Consequence, I have been deducing, might probably be inferr'd from the Premises. For as tis not absurd to think, that our Men∣struum may have a particular Operati∣on upon some Noble, and (if I may so call them) some Tinging parts of the Gold, so it is not impossible, but that the Yellowishness of that rich Metal
may proceed not from any particular Corpuscles of that Colour, but from the Texture of the Metal; as in our lately mention'd Example, the Cinna∣bar was highly Red, though the Mer∣cury, it consisted of, were Silver-colou∣red, and the Sulphur but a pale Yellow; and consequently, the Whiteness, and other Changes, produc'd in the new Metal we obtain'd, may be attributed not to the Extraction of any tinging Parti∣cles, but to a Change of Texture, where∣on the Colour, as well as other Pro∣perties of the Gold did depend. But That, which made me unwilling to re∣ject the way, I first proposed, of ex∣plicating this Change of Colour, was, That a Mineralist of great Veracity hath several times assur'd me, that a known Person in the Relators Country, the Netherlands, got a great deal of Money by the way of Extracting a Blew Tin∣cture out of Copper, so as to leave the Body White; adding, that he himself,
having procur'd from a friend (to satisfie his Curiosity) a little of the Menstru∣um, (whose chiefe Ingredients his friend communicated to him, and he to me,) he did, as he was directed, dissolve Cop∣per in common Aqua fortis, to reduce it into small parts, and then having kept the Calx of the Powder of this Copper for some hours in this Menstruum, he perceiv'd, that the clear Liquor, which was weak in Tast, did not dissolve the Body of the Metal, but onely extract a blew Tincture, leaving behind a very White Powder, which he quickly re∣duc'd by Fusion into a Metal of the same Colour, which he found as Mallea∣ble as before. Which I the lesse won∣der at, because the Experienc'd Chy∣mist Johannes Agricola, in his Dutch Annotations upon Poppius, mentions the making of a White and Malleable Copper in good quantities upon his own knowledge; and that of such a kind of Copper, I have with pleasure made
Tryal, I elsewhere relate. But of these matters we may possibly say more in a convenient place. The Second thing, that seems dedu∣cible from our former Narrative, is, That however most (for I say not all) of the Judiciousest among the Chymists themselves, as well as among their Ad∣versaries, believe Gold too fix'd and permanent a Body to be changeable by Art, insomuch that tis a receiv'd Axiom amongst many Eminent Spagyrists, that facilius est aurum construere, quàm de∣struere; yet Gold it self is not absolute∣ly indestructible by Art, since Gold be∣ing acknowledg'd to be an Homogene∣ous Metal, a part of it was, by our Ex∣periment, really chang'd into a Body, that was either true Silver, or at least a new kind of Metal very differing from Gold. And since tis generally confess'd, that among all the Bodies we are al∣low'd to observe near enough, and to try our skill upon, there is not any,
whose Form is more strictly united to its Matter then that of Gold, and since also the Operation, by which the White Powder was produc'd, was made onely by a corrosive Liquor, without violence of Fire, it seems at least a very probable Inference, That there is not any Body of so constant and durable a Nature, but that, notwithstanding its persisting inviolated in the midst of divers sensible Disguises, its Texture, and consequent∣ly its Nature may be really destroy'd, in case this more powerful and appro∣priated Agent be brought by a due man∣ner of Application to work upon the Body, whose Texture is to be destroy'd. But this Matter we elsewhere handle, and therefore shall now proceed to the Last and chief Consectaries of our Ex∣periment. Thirdly then, it seems deducible from what we have deliver'd, that there may be a real Transmutation of one Metal into another, even among the perfectest
and noblest Metals, and that effected by Factitious Agents in a short time, and, if I may so speak, after a Mechanical manner. I speak not here of Proje∣ction, whereby one part of an Aurisick Powder is said to turn I know not how many 100 or 1000 parts of an ignobler Metal into Silver or Gold, not onely because, though Projection includes Transmutation, yet Transmutation is not all one with Projection, but far ea∣sier then it: but chiefly because tis not in this Discourse you are to expect what I can say, and do think, concerning what Men call the Philosophers Stone. To restrain my self then to the Experi∣ment we are considering, that seems to teach us, that, at least among inanimate Bodies, the noblest and constantest sort of Forms are but peculiar Contrivances of the Matter, and may, by Agents, that work but Mechanically, that is, by lo∣cally moving the parts, and changing their Sizes, Shape, or Texture, be
generated and destroy'd; since we see, that in the same parcel of Metalline Mat∣ter, which a little before was true and pure Gold, by having some few of its parts withdrawn, and the rest transpos'd, or otherwise alter'd in their structure, (for there appears no token, that the Menstruum added any thing to the Matter of the produc'd Silver,) or by both these wayes together, the Form of Gold, or that peculiar Modification which made it Yellow, indissoluble in Aqua fortis, &c. is abolish'd, and from the new Texture of the same Matter, there arises that new Forme, or Convention of Accidents, from which we call a Me∣tal Silver; and since Ours was not one∣ly dissoluble in Aqua fortis, but exhibi∣ted that excessively bitter Tast, which is peculiar to Silver, there seems no neces∣sity to think, that there needs a distinct Agent, or a particular Action of a Sub∣stantial Form, to produce in a Natural Body the most peculiar and discrimina∣ting
Properties. For twas but the same Menstruum, devoid of Bitterness, that, by destroying the Texture of Gold, chang'd it into another, upon whose ac∣count it acquir'd at once both White∣ness in colour, Dissolublenesse in Aqua fortis, and aptnesse to compose a bitter Body with it, and I know not how ma∣ny other new Qualities are attributed. I know tis obvious to object, that tis no very thrifty way of Transmutation, instead of Exalting Silver to the condi∣tion of Gold, to degrade Gold to the condition of Silver. But a Transmu∣tation is neverthelesse more or lesse real, for being or not being Lucriferous, and since That may inrich a Brain, that may impoverish a Purse, I must look upon your humour as that of an Alchymist, rather then of a Philosopher, if I durst not expect that the Instructiveness in such an Experiment will suffice to re∣commend it to You. And if I could have satisfied my self, that good Au∣thors
are not mistaken about what they affirm of the Transmutation of Iron into Copper, though, the Charge and Pains consider'd, it be a matter of no Gain, yet I should have thought it an Experiment of great Worth, as well as the Trans∣mutation of Silver into Gold. For tis no small matter to remove the Bounds, that Nature seems very industriously to have set to the Alterations of Bodies; especially among those Durable and al∣most Immortal Kinds, in whose Con∣stancy to their first Forms, Nature seems to have design'd the shewing her self in∣vincible by Art. I should here (Pyrophilus) conclude what I have to say of the Experiment, that hath already so long entertain'd us, by recommending to You the repetition of what I had not the Opportunity to try above once from end to end, were it not, that I remember something I said about the Menstruum peracutum, may seem to import a Promise of communicating to
You something of the Efficacy of that Liquor upon Gold. And therefore partly for that reason, and partly to make sure, that the present Discourse shall not be uninstructive to You, I would adde, That though not onely the generality of Refiners and Mineralists, but divers of the most Judicious Culti∣vators of Chymistry it self, hold Gold to be so fix'd a Body, that it can as little be Volatiliz'd as Destroy'd, and that upon This ground, that the processes of subliming or distilling Gold to be met with in divers Chymical Books, are ei∣ther mystical, or unpracticable, or fal∣lacious, (in which Opinion I think them not much mistaken;) though This, I say, be the perswasion even of some critical Chymists, yet, upon the just Expectati∣on I had to find my Menstruum very operative upon Gold, I attempted and found a way to Elevate it to a conside∣rable height, but far less proportion of Additament, then one that were
not fully perswaded of the possibility of Elevating Gold; and though I have indeed found, by two or three several Liquors, (especially the Aqua pugilum, aenigmatically describ'd by Basilius,) that the Fixedness of Gold is not alto∣gether invincible, yet I found the Effect of these much inferior to that of our Mixture, touching which I shall relate to You the easiest and shortest, though not perhaps the very best, manner of im∣ploying it. We take then the finest Gold we can procure, and having either Granulated it, or Laminated it, we dissolve it in a moderate heat, with a sufficient quanti∣ty of the Menstruum peracutum, and ha∣ving carefully decanted the Solution into a conveniently siz'd Retort, we ve∣ry gently in a Sand-Furnace distill off the Menstruum, and if we have a mind to elevate the more Gold, we either pour back upon the remaining substance the same Menstruum, or, which is bet∣ter,
redissolve it with fresh; the Liquor being abstracted, we urge the remaining Matter by degrees of Fire, and in no stronger a one, then what may easily be given in a Sand Furnace, a considerable quantity of the Gold will be Elevated to the upper part of the Retort, and ei∣ther fall down in a Golden colour'd Li∣quor into the Receiver, or, which is more usual, fasten it self to the Top and Neck in the form of a Yellow or Red∣dish Sublimate, and sometimes we have had the Neck of the Retort inrich'd with good store of large thin Chry∣stals, not Yellow but Red, and most like Rubies, very glorious to behold; (though even these being taken out, and suffer'd to lie a due time in the o∣pen Air would loose their saline Form, and run per Deliquium into a Liquor.) Nor see I any cause to doubt, but that by the Reaffusions of fresh Menstruum upon the dry Calx of Gold, that stayes behind, the whole Body of the Metal
may be easily enough made to pass through the Retort, though, for a cer∣tain reason, I forbore to prosecute the Experiment so far. But here (Pyrophilus) I think my self oblig'd to interpose a Caution, as well as to give you a further Informati∣on about our present Experiment. For first I must tell You, that though even Learned Chymists think it a sufficient proof of a true Tincture, that not onely the colour of the Concrete will not be separated by Distillation, but the ex∣tracting Liquor will pass over tincted into the Receiver; yet this supposition, though it be not unworthy of able men, may, in some cases, deceive them. And next I must tell You, that whereas I scruple not, in several Writings of mine, to teach, That the Particles of solid and consistent Bodies are not alwaies unfit to help to make up Fluid ones, I shall now venture to say further, That even a Liquor, made by Distillation,
how volatile soever such Liquors may be thought, may in part consist of Cor∣puscles of the most compact and pon∣derous Bodies in the World. Now to manifest Both these things, and to shew You withall the Truth of what I elsewhere teach, That some Bo∣dies are of so durable a Texture, that their Minute parts will retain their own Na∣ture, notwithstanding variety of Disgui∣zes, which may impose, not onely upon o∣ther men, but upon Chymists themselves; I will adde, that to prosecute the Ex∣periment, I dropp'd into the Yellow Liquor afforded me by the Elevated Gold, a convenient quantity of clean running Mercury, which was immedi∣ately colour'd with a Golden colour'd Filme, and shaking it to and fro, till the Menstruum would guild no more, when I suppos'd the Gold to be all praecipi∣tated upon the Mercury, I decanted the clarifi'd Liquor, and mixing the remai∣ning Amalgam (if I may so call it) of
Gold and Mercury, with several times its Weight of Borax, I did, as I expe∣cted, by melting them in a small Cruci∣ble, easily recover the scatter'd Particles of the Elevated Metal, reduc'd into one little Mass or Bead of Corporal or Yel∣low (though perhaps somewhat palish) Gold. But yet whether the Gold, that tinged the Menstruum, might not, be∣fore the Metal was reduc'd or praecipi∣tated out of it, have been more succes∣fully apply'd to some considerable pur∣poses, then a bare Solution of Gold, that hath never been Elevated, may be a Question, which I must not in this place determine, and some other things that I have try'd about our Elevated Gold, I have elsewhere taken notice of; Onely this further Use I shall here make of this Experiment, that, whereas I speak in other Papers, as if there may be a vo∣latile Gold in some Oars, and other Mi∣nerals, where the Mine-men do not find any thing of that Metal, I mention such
a thing upon the Account of the past Experiment and some Analogies. And therefore as I would not be understood to adopt what every Chymical Writer is pleas'd to fancie concerning Volatile Gold; so I think Judicious men, that are not so well acquainted with Chymical Operations, are sometimes too forward to condemn the Chymists Observati∣ons; not because their Opinions have nothing of Truth, but because they have had the ill Luck not to be warily enough propos'd. And to give an in∣stance in the Opinion, that some Mine∣rals have a Volatile Gold, (and the like may be said of Silver,) I think I may give an Account, rational enough, of my admitting such a thing, by explicating it thus: That as in our Experiment, though after the almost total abstracti∣on of the Menstruum, the remaining Body being true Gold, and consequent∣ly, in its own Nature, fix'd, yet it is so strictly associated with some volatile
saline Particles, that these, being press'd by the fire, carry up along with them the Corpuscles of the Gold, which may be reduc'd into a Mass by the admistion of Borax, or some other Body fitted to divorce the Corpuscles of the Metal from those, that would Elevate them, and to unite them into Grains, too big and ponderous to be sublim'd; so in some Mineral Bodies there may be pret∣ty store of Corpuscles of Gold, so mi∣nute, and so blended with the unfix'd Particles, that they will be carried up together with them by so vehement a heat, as is wont to be imploy'd to bring Oars, and even Metalline masses to Fu∣sion. And yet tis not impossible, but that these Corpuscles of Gold, that in ordinary Fusions fly away, may be de∣tain'd and recover'd by some such pro∣per additament, as may either work up∣on, and (to use a Chymical Term) mor∣tifie the other parts of the Mass, with∣out doing so upon the Gold; or by as∣sociating
with the Volatile and ignobler Minerals, some way or other disable them to carry away the Gold with them, as they otherwise may do; or by its Fixedness and Cognation of Nature make the dispers'd Gold imbody with it. On which Occasion I remember, that a very Ingenious Man, desiring my Thoughts upon an Experiment, which he and some others, that were present at it, look'd upon as very strange, namely, that some good Gold, having, for a cer∣tain Tryal, been cuppell'd with a great deal of Lead, instead of being advanc'd in Colour, as in Goodness, was grown manifestly paler then before; my Con∣jecture being, That so great a Propor∣tion of Lead might contain divers par∣ticles of volatile Silver, which, meeting with the fix'd Body of the Gold, by in∣corporating therewith, was detain'd, was much confirm'd by finding, upon Enquiry, that the Gold, instead of loo∣sing its Weight, had it considerably in∣creas'd;
which did much better answer my Ghess, then it did their Expectation, that made the Experiment, and were much surpriz'd at the Event. But this is no fit place to prosecute the considera∣tion of the Additaments, that may be us'd to unite and fix the Particles of the nobler Metals, blended with volatile Bodies; though perhaps what hath been said may afford some Hint about the matter, as well as some Apology for the Chymical Term, Volatile Gold: the possibility of which, I presume, we have evinc'd by the latter part of this Expe∣riment, (in which I am sorry I cannot remember the proportion of the re∣maining Salts, that were able to Elevate the Gold;) for That I have several times made, and therefore dare much more confidently rely on it, then I can press You to do on the former part, (a∣bout the Transmutation, or at least De∣struction of Gold,) till You or I shall have Opportunity to repeat that Tryal.
Experiment VIII. THough (Pyrophilus) the Experi∣ment, I am about to subjoin, may, at the first glance, seem onely to concern the production of Tasts, and be indeed one of the principal, that I devis'd con∣cerning that subject, and that belongs to the Notes I have made about those Qualities: yet if You do not of your self take notice of it, I may hereafter have Occasion to shew You, that there are some particulars in this Experiment, that are applicable to more then Tasts. And since I had once thoughts (however since discouraged by the difficulties of the Attempt) to make my Notes ex∣tend even to divers Qualities, which the operations of Chymists, and the pra∣ctice of Physicians have made men take notice of; (such as the powers of corro∣ding, praecipitating, fixing, purging, bli∣stering, stupifying, &c-) I presume You will not dislike, that one, who had
thoughts to say something even of Chymical and of Medical Qualities, if I may so call them, should give You here an Experiment or two about more ob∣vious, though particular, Affections of Bodies, when there are several things in the Experiment, that may be of a ge∣neral import to the Doctrine of the O∣rigine of Qualities and Forms. We took then an Ounce of refined Silver, and having dissolv'd it in Aqua fortis, wee suffer'd it to shoot into Chry∣stals, which being dried, we found to ex∣ceed the weight of the Silver by several Drachms, which accrued upon the con∣coagulation of the acid Salts, that had dissolv'd, and were united to the Metal. These Chrystals we put into a Retort, and distill'd them in Sand, with almost as great a heat as we could give in a ham∣mer'd Iron Furnace, wherein the Ope∣ration was made; but there came over onely a very little sowrish Flegm with an ill sent, wherefore the same Retort being suffer'd to cool, and then coated,
it was remov'd to another Furnace, ca∣pable of giving a far higher degree of Heat, namely, that of a naked fire, and in this Furnace the Distillation was pur∣sued by the several degrees of heat, till at length the Retort came to be red hot, and kept so for a good while; but though even by this Operation there was very little driven over, yet That sufficiently manifested what we aimed at, shewing (namely) that a Body ex∣treamly Bitter might afford, as well as it consisted of, good store of parts that are not at all bitter, but (which is a ve∣ry differing tast) eminently Sowr. For our Receiver being taken off even when it was cold, the contain'd spirit smoak'd out like rectify'd Aqua fortis, and not onely smelt and tasted like A∣qua fortis, to the Annoyance of the Nose and Tongue, but being pour'd upon Filings of crude Copper, it fell immediately to corrode them with violence, making much hissing, and sen∣ding
up thick fumes, and in a trice pro∣duc'd, with the corroded Copper, a blew∣ish colour, like That, which that Metal is wont to give in good Aqua fortis. Afterwards we took Minium and Aqua fortis, and made a Solution, which being filtred and evaporated, left us a Saccharum Saturni, much like the com∣mon made with spirit of Vinegar, then taking this sweet Vitriol of Lead, (as we elsewhere call it) we endeavour'd in the formerly mention'd Sand Furnace to drive it over in a Retort; but finding That degree of fire incompetent to force over any thing save a little fleg∣matick Liquor, we caus'd the Retort to be coated, and transferr'd to the other Furnace, where being urg'd with a naked Fire, it afforded at length a spirit some∣what more copious then the Silver had done. This Spirit smoak'd in the cold Receiver as the other had, and did, like it, rankly smell of Aqua fortis, and was so far from retaining any of the sweet∣ness
of the Concrete that had yielded it, that it was offensively acid, and being pour'd upon Minium, it did with noise and Bubbles fall upon it, and quickly afforded us a Liquor, which being fil∣tred, did, by its Sweetness as well as o∣ther proofs, assure us, that there would have needed but a gentle Evaporation (if We had leisure to make it) to ob∣tain from it a true Sugar of Lead; and tis remarkable, that the Concrete, which appear'd White before Distillati∣on, remain'd, for the most part, behind in the Retort in the form of a black Caput mortuum, (sometimes We have had it in a Yellowish Lump,) which was nei∣ther at all sweet, as the Vitriol of Lead it self had eminently been, nor at all sowr, as the Liquor, distill'd from it, was in a high degree, but seem'd rather insipid, and was indeed but a Calx of Lead, which the heat of the fire had in part reduc'd into true and manifest Lead in the Retort it self, as appear'd by ma∣ny
Grains of several Sizes, that We met with in the Caput mortuum, (the rest of which is easily enough reducible by fu∣sion with a convenient flux into mallea∣ble Lead it self.) There are some Phaenomena of this Experiment, that We may elsewhere have Occasion to take notice of; as par∣ticularly, That, notwithstanding Silver be a Body so fix'd in the fire, that it will (as tis generally known) endure the Cuppel it self, and though in the dry'd Chrystals of Silver, the Salt, that ad∣heres to the Silver, increases the weight of the Metal but about a 4h or a 3d part; yet this small proportion of saline Cor∣puscles was able to carry up so much of that almost fixedst of Bodies, that, more then once, We have had the inside of the Retort, to a great height, so cover'd o∣ver with the Metalline Corpuscles, that the Glass seem'd to be Silver'd over, and could hardly, by long scraping, be freed from the copious and closely ad∣hering Sublimate.
But the Phaenomenon, that I chiefly desire to take notice of at present, is this, That not onely Aqua fortis, being concoagu∣lated with differing Bodies, may produce very differing Concretes, but the same numerical Saline Corpuscles, that, being associated with those of one Metal, had already produc'd a Body eminent in one. Tast, may afterwards, being freed from that Body, compose a Liquor emi∣nent for a very differing Tast; and after That too, being combin'd with the par∣ticles of another Metal, would with them constitute a Body of a very emi∣nent Tast, as opposite as any one can be to both the other Tasts; and yet these Saline Corpuscles, if, instead of this se∣cond Metal, they should be associated with such a one as That, they are driven from, would therewith exhibit agen the first of the three mention'd Tasts. To prove all this, We took Chrystals of refined Silver made with Aqua fortis, and though these Chrystals be, as We
often note, superlatively bitter; yet ha∣ving, by a naked fire, extorted from them what Spirit we could, and found That, as we expected, extremely Acid, we put one part of it upon a few Filings of Silver, of which it readily made a Solution more bitter then Gall, and the other part of the distill'd Liquor We poured upon Minium: and though, whilst it had been an Ingredient of the Chrystals of Silver committed to Di∣stillation, it did with that Metal com∣pose an excessively bitter substance, yet the same Particles, being loosned from that Metal, and associated with those of the Lead, did with them constitute a Solution, which by Evaporation affor∣ded us a Saccharum Saturni, or a Vitriol sweet as Sugar. And for further con∣firmation, We varied the Experiment, having, in a naked Fire, distilled some dry'd Saccharum Saturni made with Aqua fortis, the little Liquor that came over, in proportion to the Body, that
afforded it, was so strong a spirit of Ni∣tre, that for several hours the Receiver was fill'd with red Fumes; and though the smoaking Liquor were hugely sharp, yet part of it, being pour'd upon a piece of its own Caput mortuum, (in vvhich We perceiv'd not any Tast) did at length (for it vvrought but very slowly) exhibit some little Grains of a Saccharine Vitriol, but the other part, being put upon Filings of Silver, fell upon it immediately vvith noise and store of smoak, and a while after con∣coagulated vvith part of it (vvhich it had dissolv'd) into a Salt excessively bitter. Experiment IX. THe Artificial Transmutation of Bodies, being as the rarest and dif∣ficultest Production, so one of the no∣blest and usefullest Effects of Humane skill and power, not onely the clear In∣stances
of it are to be diligently sought for and priz'd, but even the Probabili∣ties of effecting such an extraordinary Change of Bodies are not to be negle∣cted; especially, if the Version, hop'd for, be to be made betwixt Bodies of Primordial Textures, (if I may so call them,) and such Bodies, as by the great∣nesse of their Bulk, and by their being to be found in most of the mix'd Bodies here below, make a considerable part of those, that we Men have the most imme∣diately to do with. Invited by these con∣siderations, Pyrophilus, I shall venture to give you the Account of some Ob∣servations, and Tryals, about the Trans∣muting of Water into Earth, though it be not so perfect as I Wish, and as I Hope, by Gods blessing, to make it. The first Occasion, afforded me to do any thing about this matter, was my be∣ing consulted by a Gentleman, (an anti∣ent Chymist, but not at all a Philoso∣pher,) who relating to me how much he
had (with the wonted success of such Attempts) labour'd after the Grand Arcana, complain'd to me among other things, that, having Occasion to imploy great quantity of purifi'd Rain-water, he obtain'd from it much less then he wish'd of the substance that he look'd for, but a great deal of a certain whitish excrementitious Matter, which he knew not what to make of. This gave me the Curiosity first to desire a sight of it, in case he had not thrown it away, (which by good fortune he had not,) and then, taking notice of the unexpe∣cted plenty, and some of the Qualities of it, to ask him some Questions which were requisite and sufficient to perswade me, that this Residenee came not from accidental foulness of the Water, nor of the Vessels twas receiv'd in. This I af∣terwards often thought of, and indeed it might justly enough awaken some sus∣picions, that the little Motes, that have been sometimes observ'd to appear
numerous enough, in pure Rain water whilst it is distilling, might not be meerly accidental, but really produc'd, as well as exhibited by the action of the Fire. I thought it then worth while to prosecute this matter a little farther: And having put a pretty quantity of distill'd Rainwater in a clean Glass Bo∣dy, and fitted it with a Head and a Re∣ceiver, I suffer'd it to stand in a Dige∣stive Furnace, till, by the gentle heat thereof, the Water was totally abstra∣cted, and the Vessel left dry: which being taken out of the Sand, I found the bot∣tom of the Glass all cover'd over with a white (but not so very white) substance; which, being scrap'd off vvith a Knife, appear'd to be a fine Earth, in vvhich I perceiv'd no manifest Tast, and vvhich, in a vvord, by several Qualities seem'd to be Earth. This incourag'd me to redistill the Rain-water in the same Glass Body, vvhose Bottom, vvhen the Water vvas
all drawn off, afforded me more of the like Earth: but though the Repetition of the Experiment, and my having, for greater caution, try'd it all the while in a new Glass, that had not been imploy'd before to other uses, confirm'd me much in my conjecture, That unless it could be prov'd, which I think will scarce be pretended, that so insipid a Liquor as Rain-water should, in so gentle a heat, dissolve the most close and almost Inde∣structible Body of Glass it self, (which such corrosive Menstruums as Aqua fortis, and Aqua Regis are wont to leave unharm'd,) the Earthy powder, I ob∣tain'd from already distill'd Rain water, might be a Transmutation of some parts of the Water into that substance, yet having unhappily lost part of my Powder, and consum'd almost all the rest, (for I kept a little by me, which you may yet see,) I should, till I had more frequently reiterated my Experiments, (which then I had not Opportunity to
do, though I had thoughts of doing it also with Snow-water, that I had put into Chymical Glasses for that purpose, and with liquor of melted Hail, which I had likewise provided,) and thereby also obtain'd some more of this Virgin Earth (as divers Chymists would call it) to make farther Tryals with, have retain'd greater suspicions, if I had not afterwards accidentally fall'n into dis∣course of this matter with a learned Phy∣sician, vvho had dealt much in Rain-vvater, but he much confirmed me in my conjecture, by assuring me, that he had frequently found such a White Earth, as I mention'd, in distill'd Rain Water, after he had distill'd the same Numerical Liquor (carefully gather'd at first) I know not how many times one after another, adding, that he did not find (any more then I had done) any cause to suspect, that if he had continu'd to redistill the same portion of Water, it would have yielded him more Earth.
But the Odness of the Experiment still keeping me in suspence, it was not without much delight, that afterwards mentioning it to a very Ingenious Per∣son, whom, without his leave, I think not fit to name, well vers'd in Chymi∣cal matters, and whom I suspected to have, in order to some Medicines, long wrought upon Rain vvater, he readily gave me such an Account of his procee∣dings, as seem'd to leave little scruple a∣bout the Transmutation we have been mentioning: for he solemnly affirm'd to me, that having observ'd, as I had done, that Rain-vvater would, even after a Distillation or two, afford a Terrestrial substance, which may sometimes be seen swimming up and down in the Limpid Liquor, he had the Curiosity, being settled and at leisure, to try how long he could obtain this substance from the Water. And accordingly having freed Rain Water, carefully collected, from its accidental, and as it vvere faeculent
Earthiness, vvhich it vvill deposite at the first slovv Distillation, (and vvhich is oftentimes colour'd, vvhereby it may be distinguish'd from the White Earth made by Transmutation,) he redistill'd it in very clean Glasses, not onely 8 or 10 times, but neer 200, vvithout find∣ing that his Liquor grevv weary of af∣fording him the White Earth, but ra∣ther that the Corpuscles of it did ap∣pear far more numerous, or at least more conspicuous in the latter Distillation, then in the former. And vvhen I ex∣pressed my Curiosity to see this Earth, he readily shevv'd me a pretty quantity of it, and presented me vvith some, vvhich comparing vvith vvhat I had re∣maining of mine, I found to be excee∣ding like it, save that it vvas more purely White, as having been, for the main, af∣forded by Rain Water, that had been more frequently rectify'd. And to compare this welcome Powder with That I made my self, I try'd with This
divers things, which I had before try'd with my own, and (because the quanti∣ty presented me was less inconsiderable) some others too. For I observ'd in this new Powder, as I had done with my Own, that being put into an excellent Microscope, and plac'd where the Sun beams might fall upon it, it appear'd a White Meal, or heap of Corpuscles so exceeding, not to say unimaginably, small, that, in two or three choice Mi∣croscopes, both I and others had occasi∣on to admire it; and their extreme Lit∣tleness was much more sensibly di∣scern'd, by mingling some few Grains of Sand amongst them, which made a Mixture that look'd like that of Pibble stones, and of the finest Flower. For our Earth, even in the Microscope, ap∣pear'd to consist of as small Particles, as the finest Hair-powder to the naked Eye. Nor could We discern this Dust to be transparent, though, when the Sun shin'd upon it, it appear'd in the Micro∣scope
to have some Particles a little gli∣stering, which yet, appearing but in a glaring light, we were not sure to be no deceptio visûs. 2. I found, that our White Powder, being cast into Water, would indeed for a while discolour it by somewhat Whitening it, which is no more then Spaud will do, and the fine dust of white Marble, and other stones, whose Corpuscles, by reason of their Minuteness, swimme easily for a while in the Water, but when it was once set∣led at the bottom, it continu'd there undissolv'd (for ought I could perceive) for some dayes and nights, as Earth would have done. 3. Having weigh'd a quantity of it, and put it into a new clean Crucible, with another inverted over it for a Cover, I plac'd it among quick Coals, and there kept the Cru∣cible red hot for a pretty while, causing the Fire afterward to be acuated with a blast of a Bellows, but taking out the Powder, I neither found it melted, nor
clotted into lumps, nor, when I weigh'd it again, did I see cause to conclude that there was much of it wasted, besides what stuck to the sides of the Crucible, and to a little Clay, vvherewith I had luted on the Cover, and which (to shew you, that the Heat had not been incon∣siderable) was in several places burnt red by the vehemence of the fire; and when I afterwards kept this Powder in an open Crucible among glowing coals, neither I, nor one that I imploy'd to as∣sist me, perceiv'd it all to smoak; and having put a little upon a quick Coal, and blown That too, I found that which I had not blown away, to remain fix'd (which some Bodies will not do) upon quick Coals, that will endure the fire in a red hot Crucible. 4. I found this pow∣der to be much heavier in specie then VVater. For imploying a nice pair of Gold Scales, and a Method that would be too long here to describe, I found that this Powder weigh'd somevvhat
(though not much) more then twice so much common VVater, as vvas equal to it in Bulk. And least some Corolla∣ries, that seem obviously contain'd in the common, but groundless, conceipts of the Peripateticks, about the Propor∣tions of the Elements in Density &c. should make you expect, that this povv∣der ought to have been much more ponderous, I shall adde, that having had the Curiosity, vvhich I wonder no body should have before me, to examine the Gravity of the Earth, which seems the most Elementary of any we have, I took some sifted Wood-ashes, which I had caus'd to be three or four times boyl'd in a plentiful proportion of Wa∣ter, to free them from Salt, and ha∣ving put them very dry into common Water, I found them but little heavier then our newly mention'd Powder, sur∣passing in weight Water of the same Bulk but twice, and a little more then a 6th part, (Water and It being very little
more then as 1 to 2 1/6.) And that you may the less doubt of this, I will yet subjoyn, that, examining the Specifick Gravity of (white) Glass it self, I found that compact Body to be very little, if at all more then 2 times and a half as heavy as Water of equal Bigness to it. So that the Gravity of that Powder, which, borrowing a Chymical term, we have been calling Virgin-Earth, being added to its Fixtness, and other Quali∣ties, it may seem no great impropriety of Speech to name it Earth, at least, if by Earth we mean not the pure Ele∣mentary Earth of the Schools, which many of themselves confesse not to be found actually separate, but a Body dry, cold, ponderous, induring the fire, and, which is the main, irresoluble by Wa∣ter and Fire into other Bodies specifi∣cally different. [But to return to the Guise of the Powder, when I ask'd this Learned man, whether he observ'd the Glass he di∣still'd
in to have been fretted by the Li∣quor, and whether This lost of its Sub∣stance, according as it deposited more Powder, He answer'd me, (and he is a Person of unsuspected Credit,) that he found not his Glass to have been injur'd by the Liquor, and that the Water wa∣sted (though he were carefull it should not do so by Evaporation and Trans∣fusions) by degrees so much, that there remain'd, by his aestimate, but about an 8th part of the first quantity: and though, for certain reasons, he kept by him the Liquor last distill'd, yet he doubted not, but that it might be very nigh totally brought into Earth, since out of an Ounce of distill'd Rain-water he had already obtain'd near 3 quarters of an Ounce, if not more, of the often mention'd Earth.] These several Relations will, I sup∣pose, perswade You, Pyrophilus, that this Experiment is hopeful enough to be well worth your pursuing, if not that
perhaps none but such a scrupulous Per∣son as I, would think the prosecution of it other then superfluous. And if You do acquiesce in what hath been already done, you will, I presume, think it no mean confirmation of the Corpuscula∣rian Principles, and Hypotheses. For if, contrary to the Opinion that is so much in request among the generality of mo∣dern Physicians and other Learned Men, that the Elements themselves are transmuted into one another, and those simple and Primitive Bodies, which Na∣ture is presum'd to have intended to be the stable and permanent ingredients of the Bodies she compounds here below, may be artificially destroy'd, and (with∣out the intervention of a Seminal and Plastick power) generated or produc'd: if, I say, this may be done, and that by such slight means, why may We not think, that the Changes and Metamor∣phoses, that happen in other Bodies, which are acknowledg'd by the Mo∣derns
to be far more lyable to Alterati∣ons, may proceed from the Local Mo∣tion of the minute or insensible parts of Matter, and the Changes of Texture that may be consequent thereunto? Some bold Atomists would here be de∣termining, by what particular Wayes this strange Transmutation of Water into Earth may be perform'd, and would perchance particularly tell you, how the continually, but slowly, agitated parts of the Water, by their innumerable oc∣cursions, may by degrees rub, and as it were grind themselves into such Surfa∣ces, as either to stick very close to one another by immediate contact, (as I elsewhere observe polish'd pieces of Glass to do,) or implicate, and intangle themselves together so, as to make, as it were, little knots; which knots (he would add,) or the newly mention'd clusters of coherent Particles, being then grown too great and heavy to be supported by the Water, must subside to the bottom in
the form of a Powder, which, by reason of the same Gravity of these Moleculae, and the strict Union of the leser parti∣cles that compose them, obtain an in∣disposition to dissolve in water, and to be elevated or dissipated by the fire; as their Insipidness may be accounted for by its being but the same with that of the Liquor, whence they were made, and their Transparency by that of the Water they were made of, and by the multitude of the little Surfaces that be∣long to so fine a Powder. But though in favour of such conjectures, I could somewhat illustrate them, partly by ap∣plying to this Occasion what I elsewhere observe of the reducing of the fluid Bo∣dy of Quicksilver by a bare Circulati∣on, (which is but a repeated Distillati∣on) with a proportionable heat, into a real Powder, vvhich also vvill not so easily be rais'd by the fire, as the fluid Body, vvhence by change of Texture it was made; and partly by subjoining, a∣mong
other things, how by the conjun∣ction of two distill'd Liquors digested together, I have obtain'd good store of an insipid Substance, that would not dis∣solve in Water, and that would long e∣nough indure no inconsiderable degree of Fire; though, I say, by these and o∣ther such particulars, I could make our Atomists conjectures lesse improbable, yet the full disquisition of so difficult a Subject is too long and intricate to be proper for this place.What is here delivered may be, for the main, veri∣fy'd by what the Reader will meet with in the (follow∣ing) Xth. Experiment, though That be not It which the Author meant. And therefore, without here exami∣ning our Atomists explication of this Me∣tamorphosis, we will give him leave for a vvhile to suppose the Transmutation it self to be real, and thereupon to con∣sider, whether the Historical part of it do not much disfavour some of the chief Doctrines of the Chymists, and a
fundamental one of Helmonts. For if the purest Water may be turn'd into Earth, it will not be easie to make it improba∣ble, that the other Ingredients of mixt Bodies, which the Chymists call their Hypostatical Principles, are capable of being transmuted into one another, which would overthrow one of the main Foundations of their whole Phi∣losophy; and besides, if out of the sim∣plest Water it self, a moderate fire can produce a large proportion of Earth, that was not formally praeexistent in it, how shall We be sure, that in all the Analyses, which the Fire makes of mixt Bodies, the Substances thereby exhibi∣ted are obtain'd by Separation onely, without any Transmutation? As for Helmont, tis well enough known, that he makes Water to be the Material Principle of all Bodies here below, which he vvould have to be either Wa∣ter it self, or but Water disguis'd by those Forms, vvhich the Seeds of
things have given it. I will not here ex∣amine, whether this Opinion, if he had restrain'd it to Animals and Vegetables, might not, with some restriction and ex∣planations, be kept from appearing ab∣surd, since my Eleutherius hath (though without absolutely adopting it) else∣vvhere pleaded for its not being so ex∣travagant, as it hath been thought. But whereas Helmont's Grand Argu∣ment from Experience is grounded on this, That the Alkahest doth, as he af∣firms, by being digested with, and di∣still'd from other tangible Bodies, re∣duce them all at last into a Liquor, no way differing from Rain Water, though we should grant the matter of fact, yet the Experiment of our Powder will warrant me to question their Ratiocina∣tion. For if all mix'd Bodies be there∣fore concluded to be materially from Water, because they are, by the Opera∣tion of the Fire, and a Menstruum, after having pass'd through divers praevious
Changes, reduc'd at length into insipid Water; by the same way of arguing (and with greater cogency) I might conclude, that all those Bodies are materially but disguis'd Earth, since without interven∣tion of a Seminal Principle, (for Hel∣mont will not allow that Title to Fire, which he stiles the Artificial Death of Things) Water it self may be turn'd in∣to Earth. Indeed if that acute Chymist were now alive, and had such an immor∣tal Liquor, as he describes his Alkahest to be, I would gladly put him upon try∣ing whether that Menstruum would re∣duce our White Earth into Water. But there being no more probability of that, then that such reproduc'd Water, being just what it vvas before, might be turn'd into Earth again; it may be probably said, that since these Bodies are mutual∣ly convertible into one another, (and, as to the version of Water into Earth, by a seemingly slight Operation,) they are not either of them ingenerable and
incorruptible Elements, much less the sole matter of all tangible Bodies, but onely two of the Primordial, and of the most obvious Schematisms of that, which is indeed the universal Matter, vvhich, as it comes to have its minute Particles associated after this or that manner may, by a change of their Tex∣ture and Motion, constitute, with the same Corpuscles, sometimes Water, and sometimes Earth. But (Pyrophilus) to leave these Re∣flexions, to return to the bold Conje∣ctures that they are grounded on; though if I had leisure and indulgence enough, I could, I confess add many things in favour of some of those Thoughts:Of the possible wayes of turning Liquors into consi∣stent Bodies, by bending, breaking, twisting, and by otherwise changing the Texture of the Liquor, see more particularly the History of Fluidity and Firmnesse, publishd by the Author. yet I would not have you wonder, that, whilst I vvas mentioning
the many particulars, that seem to e∣vince the change of Water into Earth, I should let fall some Words, that inti∣mate a Diffidence about it. For, to dis∣guize nothing unto You, I must confess, that having, in spight of an unusual care, unluckily lost a whole paper of the Powder I had made my self, and having unexpectedly been oblig'd to remove from my Furnaces, before I had made half the Tryals I judg'd requisite in so nice a case, I have not yet laid aside all my Scruples. For 1. I would gladly know, whether the untransmuted Rain water, by the de∣position of so much Terrestrial Matter, were grown lighter in specie then be∣fore, or sharp in tast. Next, I would be throughly satisfied, (which I confess I am not yet, notwithstanding all that the followers of Angelus Sala have confi∣dently enough written,) whether and hovv far insipid Liquors (as Rain Wa∣ter is) may, or may not work as Men∣struums
upon Stones or Earthy Bodies: not to question, vvhether the Particles of Rain Water may not, by their mutu∣al Attrition, or some other action upon one another, be reduc'd into Shapes and Sizes fit to compose such a Men∣struum, as the Liquor was not before; as in divers Plants, that seem to be nou∣rish'd onely with Water, the Sap is en∣dow'd with a sharp Tast, and great pene∣trancy, and activity of parts. 2. It were also fit to know, whether the Glass Body, wherein all the Distillations are made, do loose of its VVeight any thing neer so much, as the obtained Powder amounts to, over and above the Decrement of VVeight, which may be imputed to the action of the Heat upon the substance of the Glass, in case it ap∣pear by another Glass, kept empty in an equal heat, and for the same time that the Glass looses by such Operations any thing worth reckoning. And it vvere also not impertinent to try, whether
the Gravity of the obtain'd a Powder be the same in specie with that of the Glass, vvherein the Distillations were made: (for that is differ'd but about a 5th part from the weight of Chrystalline Glass I lately mention'd.) Which Scrupe, and some of the former, I might have pre∣vented, if I had had convenient Metal∣line Vessels, wherein to make the Di∣stillations instead of Glass ones. 3. I could wish likewise that it were more demonstrably determin'd, what is on all hands taken for granted, (as it appears indeed highly probable,) that distill'd Rain Water is a perfectly Homogeneous Body, vvhich if it be not, divers suspicions might be sugge∣sted about its Transmutation into Earth, and if it be, 'twill be as a very strange thing, so a matter of very great difficulty to conceive, hovv a perfectly and exqui∣sitely Homogeneous Matter should, without any Addition, or any Seminal and Plastick Principle, be brought to af∣ford
great store of a Matter of much more Specifick Gravity then it self, since we see, that no Aggregate we can make of Bodies but aequiponderant in specie with water, doth, by vertue of their Convention, grow specifically heavier then it. 4. Having had the Curiosity to try, whether Corrosive Liquors would work upon our white Powder, I found, that not onely good Oyl of Vitriol would corrode it, but strong and de∣flegm'd Spirit of Salt did readily work upon part of it, and that without the as∣sistance of heat, though not without hissing, and exciting great store of bub∣bles, as I have known such Menstruums do, when put upon Lapis Stellaris, or Ossifragus, or some such soft Stone; as if that so much defaecated Rain water, actuated by heat, had resolv'd some of the looser Corpuscles of the Sand or Stone, that, together with some Salts, compose common Glass, as I have ob∣serv'd
in some Petrifying VVater, that some of the Bodies I took up, and which were presum'd to be petrify'd, were but crusted over with Stone, that seem'd generated but by the successive apposi∣tion of Stony Particles, that, lying in∣visibly mingled with the running VVa∣ter, stuck in their passage to the conve∣niently dispos'd Bodies that lay in the Streams way. But yet I must not omit, that, when I suffer'd this Mixture to set∣tle, as much of the Powder, as seem'd to be a very great part of it, remain'd in the lower part of the Liquor, as if that had rather fretted then dissolv'd i, and that not because the Menstruum was o∣vercharg'd or glutted, as I found by put∣ting in afterwards several fresh parcels of Powder, which it readily fell upon, not without noise and froth. Nor must I forget, that sometimes I have excited such an Ebullition, by powring the same Liquors upon the Earthy part of Wood-ashes, several times wash'd in
boyling water, (though, I confess, I af∣terwards somewhat suspected there might remain some little adhering Al∣kaly, which might occasion those Bub∣bles, notwithstanding that both I and another, whom I also invited to tast it, took the Earth to be quite Saltlesse.) I might (Pyrophilus) adde, that some∣times also me thought I found this Powder (which yet likewise sometimes hapned to me with the lately mention'd Earth of Wood-ashes) somewhat gritty between my Teeth, and subjoin divers other particulars, if it were not too te∣dious to mention to You all the doubts and considerations that have occurr'd to me about the recited Change of Wa∣ter into Earth: which yet are not such as ought to hinder me from giving You the Historical account I have set down, since to some of my Scruples I could here give plausible Answers, but that I cannot do it in few words. And if any part of our white Powder prove to be
true Earth, no body perhaps yet knows to what the Experiment may lead saga∣cious Men: and whether in a strict sense it be true Earth or no, yet the Phaeno∣mena, that are exhibited in the produ∣ction of it, are sufficient to give this 9th Experiment a place among the others (of the same Decad) with which tis as∣sociated. For since out of a substance that is universally acknowledg'd to be Elementary and Homogeneous, and which manifestly is fluid, transpa∣rent, much lighter in specie then Earth, moist and fugitive, there is artificially generated or obtain'd a Substance con∣sistent, vvhite, and consequently opa∣cous, comparatively ponderous, dry, and not at all fugitive; the Alteration is so great, and effected in so simple a way, that it cannot but afford us a considera∣ble Instance of what the varied Texture of the minute parts may perform in a Matter confessedly similar. And if fre∣quently distill'd Rain Water should not
be allow'd Homogeneous, our Expe∣riment will at least shew as, better then perhaps any hath yet done, how little we are bound to believe what the Chy∣mists, and others tell us, when they pretend manifestly to exhibit to us Ho∣mogeneous Principles, and Elementary Bodies, and how difficult it is to be cer∣tain when a Body is absolutely iireso∣luble into specifically differing substan∣ces, and consequently what is the deter∣minate number of the perfectly simple Ingredients of Bodies: (supposing that such there are.) Though I must confess, that my onely aime is not to Relate what hath been done, but to Procure the prosecution of it. For if the obtain'd Substance be, by the Rain Water, dis∣solv'd out of the Glasse, this will both prove a noble and surprizing Instance of what may be one by insipid Men∣struums, even upon Bodies that are just∣ly reckon'd among the compactest and most indissoluble that we know of, and
may afford us many other considerable hints, that have been partly intimated already: and if on the other side, this Powder, whether it be true Elementa∣ry Earth or not, be found to be really produc'd out of the Water it self, it may prove a Magnale in Nature, and of grea∣ter consequence then will be presently foreseen, and may make the Alchymists hopes of turning other Metals into Gold, appear less wild, since that by Ex∣perimentally evincing, that two such dif∣ficult Qualities to be introduc'd into a Body, is considerable degrees of Fixity & Weight, (whose requisitenesse to the making of Gold are two of the Princi∣pal things, that have kept me from ea∣sily expecting to find the Attempts of Alchymists successeful,) may, with∣out the mixture of a Homogeneous Matter, be generated in it, by varying the Texture of its parts. I will not now adventure to adde any thing of what I have been attempting
about the transmuting (without addita∣ments) of pure Alkalizate Salts into Earth, because I do not yet know, whe∣ther the Tryals will answer my Hopes: (for I do not yet call them my Expe∣ctations.) But upon this subject of Transmutations, I could, if it did not properly belong to another Treatise, tell you something about the Changes, that may be wrought upon highly re∣ctify'd Spirit of Wine, vvhich vvould perchance make You think of other things of the like kind lesse infeasible. For vvhereas tis a known thing, that That spirituous Liquor being kindled, (and that, if you please, by other Spirit of Wine actually fir'd) will, for ought appears, burn all away, that is, be to∣tally turn'd into flame; if I durst rely, in so important a case, on a couple of Tryals, whilst I hope for an Opportu∣nity of making farther ones, I would tell You, that by a way unthought on (that I know of) by any Body, I have,
vvithout any addition, obtain'd, from such Spirit of Wine, as, being kindled in a Spoon, would flame all away, with∣out leaving the least drop behind it, a considerable quantity of downright incombustible Flegm. And by another way (mention'd indeed by Helmont, but not taught to almost any of his Rea∣ders) some Ingenious Persons, that you know and esteem, vvorking by my di∣rections, (but vvithout knowing vvhat each other vvas doing) did both of them reduce considerable quantities of high rectify'd Spirit of Wine (that vvould before have burnt all away) into a Li∣quor, that was for the most part flegm, as I vvas inform'd as well by my own tast, as by the Tryals I order'd to be made: (being forc'd my self to be most commonly absent.) From which change of the greatest part of that at first liquid Splrit into Flegm, it seems deducible, that the same portion of Matter, vvhich, by being kindled, may be turn'd all into
Fire, may be, by another vvay of hand∣ling, turn'd into Flegm or Water, and this vvithout the addition of any thing, and vvithout being vvrought upon by any visible Body, but one so extremely dry as duely prepar'd Salt of Tartar; and that it self is not so indispensably neces∣sary to the obtaining of flegm out of totally inflammable Spirit of Wine, but that, as I was saying, I did, by another way, obtain that dull Liquor vvithout imploying the Salt, or any other visible Body vvhatsoever. But I make a scru∣ple to entertain you any longer with Extravagances of this Nature, and yet, if I were sure You vvould contain your smiles, I would adde for conclusion, That, if I had had time and Opportunity to furnish my self with any quantity of that Water, I had it in my thoughts to try, vvhether that vvould have afforded me such a Terrestrial substance, as Rain Water had done, and thereby have un∣dergone a new and further Metamor∣phosis.
The X. Experiment. THere is one Experiment more, two of the chief Phaenomena of vvhich belong to another Discourse; (vvhere I particularly mention Them,) and yet I shall conclude this little Treatise vvith the recitation of the Experiment it self, not onely because divers of the Phaeno∣mena do eminently belong to our pre∣sent subject, but because I have scarce met vvith any Experiments more sui∣table to the Design I have of shevving, before I conclude this Discourse, vvhat great and sudden Productions and De∣structions of Qualities may be effected by the composition of the smallest Number of Ingredients, even among Liquors themselves, and such too as are believ'd to be both of Them simple and Homogeneous, and incapable of Putrefaction, that so it may appear, what notable Alterations of Qualities
even seemingly slight and easie mix∣tures can perform among Bodies, both of them fluid, as well as among those that were either both of them stable, or one of them stable, and the other con∣sistent. Take then of good Oyl of Vitriol, and of Spirit of Wine, that will burn all away, equal parts, not in quantity, but in Weight; put them together by little and little, and having plac'd the Mixture in a Bolt-head, or Glass Egg with a long neck, and carefully stopp'd it with a Cork and hard Wax, set the Vessel in a moderate heat to digest for a competent while; (two or three weeks may do well,) then pour out the Mix∣ture into a tall Glass Cucurbite, to which lute on a Head and a Receiver with extraordinary care, to prevent the Avolation of the Spirits, which will be very subtle: then with a very gentle fire abstract the spirit of Wine, that will first ascend, and when the Drops begin to
come over sowrish, shift the Receiver, and continue the Distillation with great care, that the Matter boyl not over, and when you judge that about half the acid Liquor is come over, it will not be a∣miss, though it be not necessary, to change the Receiver once more; but whether you do this or no, your Distil∣lation must be continued, increasing the fire towards the latter end, till you have brought over all you can, and what re∣mains in the bottom of the Cucurbite must be put into a Glass well stopp'd, to keep it from the Air. N B. 1. That to the Production of most, if not of all the Phaenomena of this Experiment, it is not absolutely ne∣cessary, that so long a Digestion, (not to say, not any,) be premis'd; though if the time above prescrib'd be allow'd, the Experiment will succeed the better. 2. That, I remember, I have sometimes made use of Oyl of Sulphur per Cam∣panam (as they call it) instead of Oyl of
Vitriol, to produce the recited Phaeno∣mena; and though the Attempt succee∣ded not ill, as to divers particulars, yet I afterwards chose rather to imploy oyl of Vitriol, both because it did, in some points, better answer my Expectation then the other Liquor, and because I would not give occasion to suspect, that the Odours, hereafter to be mention'd as Phaenomena of our Experiment, were due to the common Sulphur, whence the unctuous Liquor, made per Campanam, was obtain'd, as such, and did no way proceed from the acid Vitriolate Salt, which that Oyl (as tis improperly call'd) doth abound with. 3. That I had likewise the Curio∣sity to digest Oyl of Vitriol with Spanish Wine, instead of Spirit of Wine, by which means I obtain'd an odd Spirit, and residence, and some other Phaenomena, which I content my self to have in this place given hint of, in regard that Wine being a Liquor of a much less simple nature then its Spirit,
the Phaenomena, afforded me by This, are much fitter for my present purpose. 4. That great care must be had in re∣gulating the fire, when once a good part of the Acid spirit, mention'd in the pro∣cess, is come over. For if the Fire be not increas'd, the rest will scarce ascend, and if it be increas'd but a little too much, the Matter will be more apt, then one would suspect, to swell exceedingly in the Cucurbite, and perhaps run over into the Receiver, and spoil what it finds there, as it hath more then once hapned to me, when I was fain to commit the management of the Fire to others. Now the oyl of Vitriol, and the spi∣rit of Wine, being both of them distill'd Liquors, and the Latter of them seve∣ral times redistill'd, and one of them be∣ing drawn from so simple and familiar a substance as Wine, and the other from a Concrete not more compounded, then what Nature her self (which, as I else∣were shew, can, without the help of Art,
produce Vitriol) doth divers times pre∣sent us with; these Liquors, I say, being both or them distill'd, and consequent∣ly volatile, one would expect, that by distilling them, they should be brought over united, as I have tryed, that the spirit of Wine, and of Nitre, or also of common Salt may be; and as the spirits of differing Vegetables are wont to be; or that, at least, the Distillation should not much alter them, from what it found them, after they had been well mingled together. But this notwith∣standing, these two Liquors being of very odd Textures in reference to each other, their conjunction and distillati∣on will make them exhibit divers con∣siderable and perhaps surprizing Phae∣nomena. For First, whereas spirit of Wine has no great Sent, nor no good one, and moderately deflegm'd Oyl of Vitriol is wont to be inodorous; the Spirit, that first comes over from our mixture, hath
a Sent not onely very differing from spi∣rit of Wine but from all things else, that. I remember, I ever smelt. And as this new Odour doth to almost all those, whose Opinions I have asked about it, seem very fragrant and pleasant, so I have sometimes had it so exceeding sub∣tle, that, in spight of the care that was taken to lute the Glasses exactly toge∣ther, it would perfume the neighbou∣ring parts of the Laboratory, and would not afterwards be kept in by a close Cork, cover'd with two or three seve∣ral Bladders, but smell strongly at some distance from the Viol wherein it was put, I did not think it unlikely, that so noble and piercing a Liquor might be of no mean efficacy in Physick; and though I miss'd of receiving an account of its Effects from some ingenious Phy∣sicians, into whose Hands I put it to have Tryals made of it, yet I cannot des∣pair of finding it a considerable Medi∣cine, when I remember, partly what
hath been done by some acquaintances of mine with bare flegme of Vitriol, upon the account (as is suppos'd) of that little Sulphur of Vitriol, that, though but sparingly, doth inrich that Liquor; and partly, what the Masters of Chy∣mical Arcana tell us of the wonderful vertues of the Volatile Sulphur of Vi∣triol, and what I have observ'd my self, that may invite me to have a good O∣pinion of Remedies of that nature. 2. But to shevv how much the O∣dours of Bodies depend upon their Texture, I shall now adde, That after this volatile and odoriferous Spirit is come over, and has been followed by an Acid Spirit, it will usually, towards the latter end of the Distillation, be suc∣ceeded by a Liquor, that is not onely not fragrant, but stinks so strongly of Brim∣stone, that I have sometimes known it almost take away the Breath (as they speak) of those, who, when I had the Receiver, newly taken off, in my hand,
did (either because to make sport I gave them no vvarning, or because they would not take it, as thinking what I told them impossible,) too boldly ad∣venture their Noses in the Tryal. 3. There is in this Operation produc'd a Liquor, that will not mingle either with the fragrant, or with the foetid Spi∣rit hitherto describ'd, but is very diffe∣ring from both of them, and is so very pleasant, subtle, and Aromatical, that it is no less differing as well from Spirit of Wine, as Oyl of Vitriol. But of this Liquor I give a further Account in a more convenient place. 4. When the Distillation is carried on far enough, You will find at the bot∣tom, that the two above mention'd Diaphanous Spirits (for Oyl of Vitriol is indeed rather a Saline Spirit, then an Oyl) have produc'd a pretty Quantity of a Substance, not onely very opacous, but black almost like Pitch or Jet. 5. And this Substance, though pro∣duc'd
by two Bodies, that were not one∣ly fluid, but distill'd, will not alone be consistent, but (if the Distillation have been urg'd far enough) brittle. 6. And though Spirit of Wine be reputed the most inflammable, and Oyl of Vitriol the most corrosive Liquor that is known, yet I could not find, that this black Substance would easily, if at all, be brought, I say not to flame, but to burn; nor that it had any discernible Tast, though both the Liquors, from whose mixture it was obtain'd, have ex∣ceeeding strong and pungent Tasts. 7. And whereas both Oyl of Vitri∣ol and Spirit of Wine will each of them more readily, then most Liquors that are yet known, mingle with common Water, and diffuse it self therein, I ob∣serv'd, that this pitchy Mass, if the Di∣stillation had been continued till it was perfectly dry, would not, that I could perceive, dissolve in common water for very many hours, and, if I much misre∣member
not, for some dayes. 8. And Lastly, whereas the Oyl of Vitriol, and the Spirit of Wine, were both of them distill'd Liquors, and one of them exceeding volatile and fugitive; yet the black Mass, produc'd by them, was so far fix'd, that I could not make it rise by a considerably strong and la∣sting fire, that would have rais'd a much more sluggish Body, then the heaviest of those that concurr'd to produce it. The remaining particulars, that I have observ'd in this Experiment, belong to another Treatise, and therefore I shall forbear to mention them in this: nor shall I at present adde any new Phaeno∣mena to those I have already recited; those freshly mention'd Experiments, and those that preceded it, being, even without the assistance of the four Ob∣servations I have delivered before them, sufficient to manifest the Truth I have been endeavouring to make out, For in the Experiments we are speaking of,
it cannot well be pretended, or at least not well prov'd, that any Substantial Forms are the Causes of the Effects I have recited. For in most of the (above mention'd) cases, besides that, in the Bodies we imploy'd, the Seminal Ver∣tues, if they had any before, may be suppos'd to have been destroy'd by the fire, they were such, as those I argue with would account to be Factitious Bodies, artificially produc'd by Chy∣mical Operations. And tis not more manifest, that, in the production of these Effects, there intervenes a Local Mo∣tion, and change of Texture by these Operations, then tis inevident and pre∣carious, that they are the Effects of such things, as the Schools fancy Substanti∣al Forms to be: since tis, in these new Experiments, by the Addition of some new particles of Matter, or the Recess, or Expulsion of some praeexistent ones, or, which is the most frequent way, by the Transposition of Minute parts, yet
without quite excluding the other two, that no more skilful a Chymist then I have been able to produce by Art a not inconsiderable number of such changes of Qualities; that more notable ones are not ordinarily presented us by Na∣ture, where she is presumed to work by the help of Substantial Forms; I see not, why it may not be thought probable, that the same Catholick and fertile Prin∣ciples, Motion, Bulk, Shape, and Tex∣ture of the Minute parts of Matter, may, under the Guidance of Nature, (whose Laws the modern Peripateticks acknowledge to be establish'd by the all-wise God,) suffice likewise to pro∣duce those other Qualities of Natural Bodies, of which we have not given par∣ticular Instances.
