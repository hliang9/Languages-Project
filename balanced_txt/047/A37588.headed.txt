❧ ANNO XVII. Caroli Regis. ¶ An Act for the speedie and effectuall reducing of the Rebells in His Majesties Kingdom of Ireland to their due obedience to His Majestie and the Crown of England. WHereas the Lords and Com∣mons, taking into their seri∣ous considerations, as well the necessity of a speedie reducing of the Rebells of Ireland to their due obedience, as also the great sums of money that the Commons of this Realm have of late paid for the publike and necessary affairs of this King∣dom, whereof the Lords and Commons are very sensible, and desirous to imbrace all good and honourable wayes, tending to His Majesties great∣nesse and profit, the setling of that Realm, and the ease of His Majesties Subjects of England;
And whereas divers worthy and well-affected persons, per∣ceiving that many Millions of Acres of the Rebells Lands of that Kingdom, which go under the name of profitable Lands, will be confiscate, and to be disposed of; And that in case two Millions and a half of those Acres to be equally taken out of the four Provinces of that Kingdom, may be allotted for the satisfaction of such persons as shall disburse any sums of money for the reducing of the Rebells there, would effectu∣ally accomplish the same, have made these Propositions en∣suing (viz.) 1. That two Millions and an half of those Acres may be assigned, allotted, and divided amongst them after this proportion, (viz.) For each Adven∣ture of two hundred pounds, one thousand Acres in Ulster: For three hundred pounds, one thousand Acres in Conaght: For four hundred and fifty pounds, one thousand Acres in Munster: For six hun∣dred pounds, one thousand Acres in Leinster. All ac∣cording to the English measure, and consisting of Meadow, Arable, and profitable Pasture, the Bogs, Woods, and barren Mountains being cast in over and above these two Millions and a half of Acres, to be holden in free and common Soccage of the King, as of His Castle of Dublin. 2. That out of these two Millions and a half of Acres, a constant yeerly rent shall be reserved to the Crown of England, after this proportion, (viz.) out of each Acre thereof in Ulster one penie; Out of each Acre in Conaght, three half pence; Out of each Acre in Munster, two pence farthing; And out of each Acre in Leinster, three pence; whereby His Ma∣jesties Revenue out of those Lands will be much improved, besides the advantages that he will have by the coming to his hands of all other the Lands
of the Robells, and their personall Estates, without any charge unto His Majestie. 3 That for the erecting of Mannors, setling of Wasts, and Commons, maintaining of preaching Ministers, Creating of Corporations, and Regu∣lating of the severall plantations, one, or more Commissions be hereafter graunted by authoritie of Parliament. 4 That Moneys for this great occasion may be the more speedily advanced, All the Vndertakers in the Citie of London, and within twentie miles di∣stant thereof, shall underwrite their severall sums be∣fore the twentieth day of March, one thousand six hundred fourtie one, and all within sixtie miles of London, before the first day of Aprill, one thousand six hundred fourtie two, and the rest of the Kingdom before the first day of May, one thousand six hundred fourtie two. 5 That the severall sums to be underwritten, shall be paid in at four paiments, (viz.) One fourth part within ten dayes after such underwriting, and the other three parts at three Moneths, and three Moneths, all to be paid into the Chamber of London. 6 That for the better securing of the said severall sums accordingly, every one that doth so Vnderwrite shall at the time of his Subscription pay down the twentieth part of the totall sum that shall be by him then underwritten. And in case that the residue of his first fourth part be not paid in to such person, or persons as shall be appointed to receive the same,
within the ten dayes before limited, then such party shall not onely forfeit the twentieth part of the sum totall formerly deposited, but so much more of his first fourth payment to be added thereunto, as shall make up the one Moyetie of the said fit payment. And if the same person shall fail in any other of the three paiments, he shall then forfeit his entire first fourth part, and all the benefit of his Subscription, which forfeiture shall accrue to the common benefit of the rest of the underwriters.
