THE PIN-MAKERS CASE In Opposition to Mr. KILLIGREW'S Monopolizing BILL. THE Pin-makers were Incorporated by King James the I. and greatly encouraged by succeeding Princes, so that the Art of Pin-making is at this time arrived to a greater Perfection than ever in this Kingdom, and the Pin-makers are able to make better Wares at easier Rates than any foreign Nati∣on; whereby their Trade at home is secured from the Intrusion of Foreigners, while they quietly carry on a very considerable Trade abroad into almost all the parts of the World, there being exported at least a third part of what Pins are made in England; the Trade of which Manufacture being only to be improved by a free exercise thereof, which the intended Act will altogether destroy by setting up so gross a Monopoly in so considerable a Ma∣nufacture which must inevitably reduce the Pin-makers to the same condition the Card-makers are now brought to, by the like means, in the Reign of King Charles the II. even to the ruine of their Trade and themselves together. Objection, But it may be Objected this is no Monopoly but only a good design to take care of the Poor, whereof there are great Numbers in that Company. Resp. I. A great cause hereof is from themselves, the Company generally taking poor Peoples Children Apprentices, who when they come out of their times presently set up for Masters, without Stock or Credit, and are thereby forced to under-sell their Goods by reason of their necessities, which might be prevented, and they get a good Livelihood, would they continue and work Journey-work; and by this means the Number of Apprentices are increased to such an unlimited Number, notwithstanding the Companies care in restraining them, many Master-Pin-makers not being able now to procure sufficient hands to work their Goods. Resp. II. This is a plain Monopoly, if these Insidents be considered. 1. The Inhancing the Price very extravagantly to the Burthen of the Subject, and Inriching some private Persons, as appears by the advance of near 40000 l per Annum in the Pins. 2. By discouraging this Art in giving encouragement to Foreigners to stock our Market by putting the dealers in these Goods to seek to be supplyed at easier rates than is proposed by this Act, if it pass, as was done in the like case of the Card-makers. 3. By improverishing the makers by stinting them in their Work, and obliging them to sit still at the pleasure of the Ʋndertakers, a Method very strange to enable the Poor workmen to live, who cannot now the Trade is Free and Open. 4. By causi the Commodity to be worse made, which will necessarily ensue, because the Prices being set, the Workers are to have a certain Price for such sorts, good or bad, and by that means the Pins will be ill made; and so, in a short time, will deservedly lose their Reputation both at home and abroad, the natural consequence whereof will be to give this so considerable a Trade to the Dutch. Besides, many other inconveniences will necessarily attend this Design, if this Bill should pass, as is shewn more particularly in the Opponent's Reasons, and many more will be made appear, if they may be Heard, both in reference to the Merchant, Worker, and Buyer.
