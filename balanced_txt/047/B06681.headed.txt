A FURTHER ACCOUNT FROM Colonel VVolesely, OF THE DEFEAT of the IRISH, Written from Belturbat, the 14th of February 1690. SInce I writ my last, a Gentleman is come hither from the Countrey of West∣meath, who tells me he saw, after the Fight at Cavan, great numbers of Soldiers all without Arms, having thrown them away in their Flight so, that the Road and Ditches were fill'd with them; that he saw likewise a great ma∣ny wounded men, among whom were several Officers; that Brigadier Nu∣gent was mortally wounded, and that the Irish owne the loss of 300 Men, and of 14 Commission Officers that were kill'd upon the place. He says there is a great quantity of Hay laid up at Finagh, and that all the Horses in the Coun∣trey were press'd to carry the same to Cavan, but that the noise of this defeat have put a stop to it. We have taken from the Enemy 4000 l. in Brass∣money. Just now Sir John Lanier sends us word that he marched last Friday night from Nury towards Dundalk, that passing by Bedloe Castle, in which there was an Ensign with 34 Men, Colonel Leveson's Dragoons immediately storm'd it, kill'd 10 of the Irish, and took the rest Prisoners, and burnt the Castle, in which there was a great deal of Provisions; then they advanced to the back of the Town of Dundalk Brigadier Steward marching at the same time with the Foot to the other side of the Town, and burnt about 20 Houses, the Garison keeping close within their Intrenchment: After which they re∣turn'd to Nury, with a Booty of 1000 Cows, and 200 Garrones, having had a French Lieutenant kill'd, and four or five Dragoons wounded. Our Men shewed in this, as in former Occasions, a very great forwardness to engage the enemy, notwithstanding the inequality of their number, and gave new Proofs of their Courages and Bravery, particularly Major-General Kirke's Men. The eight French Officers your Grace sent hither behaved themselves likewise very well. Printed at London, and Re-printed at Edinburgh, 1690.
