The Voyages and Travels of Sir Francis Drake. SIr Francis Drake was born at Ipswich, and in his Youth put Ap∣prentice to a Master of a Vessel, during which time he gave himself wholly to the study of Marine Affairs and grew so per∣fect therein, that he in the end became the World's Wonder, the Nation's Glory and Terror to his Enemies; in demonstration of which, I shall declare his several Voyages and great Atcheivements, till his Death. First, Having by his many Exploits gained great Applause, and the Reputation of an able Sea-man, was made Captain of a small Vessel by Queen Elizabeth, and imployed against the Spaniard, her mortal Ene∣my, from whom he took divers Prizes near Home; but not so con∣tented, he, on the 24th of May, 1575, set sail in the Paschal of Ply∣mouth, a Ship of 70 Tuns, and mounted with 10 Guns, accompanied with the Swan, a Ship of 25 Tuns, and 8 Guns, commanded by his Brother John Drake; having on Bord both the Vessels, 73 Men and Boys, with other Necessaries, and having a fair Wind, came to Guadalupa, one of the West India Islands, on the 29th of June, but found nothing there, except some few Cottages made of Boughs, and covered with Plmata Leaves, which secured them from Rain, in the Nature of Tiles yet they had sight of two Canows but could not reach them, by reason the Calm was so great. These Canows are Boats which the Indians use, being for the most part cut out of Trees like Troughs, and a piece of Wood fixed on either side, to keep them from overturn∣ing: Whereupon, after they had watered there, they weighed Anchor, and sailed to Port Phesant, so named, because of the abundance of that sort of Fowl found there; and there going on Shoar, found that one Mr. Garret of Plymouth had been lately there, and had left an Inscrip∣tion in Lead nailed to a Tree, to warn him not to stay in that Port, forasmuch as the Spaniards had notice of his Arrival; yet landing more Forces, he resolved to stay and build a Pinnace, which he effected, for∣tifying the Port in the mean while, to prevent any Surprize. And whilst they stayed there, a Bark came from the Isle of Wight, bringing in a Spa∣nish Prize, which joyn'd with Capt. Drake; so that having finish'd the Pinnace, the 3 Ships and Pinnace sailed to the Isle of Pinos, where they found 2 Spanish Ships of Nombre de Dios, lading Timber by the Negroes. By those Vessels they were informed of the State of the City and Coun∣try, and that new Forces wee daily expected, to defend it against the
Symerons, a black People, with long Hair, who had revolted from the Spaniards, by reason of their Cruelty, and since chosen themselves two Kings. Whereupon setting the Negroes on Shoar with some gifts, Capt. Drake resolved to go to Nombre de Dios, which he entered by Night, beating the Spaniards from their Defences, who hung Lines a thwart the East-end of the Street, to make the English believe, by the lighted Matches tyed thereon, that their Forces were greater than indeed they were, and immediately fired, which was answered with a like num∣ber of Fire-shot and arrows from the English; they came to push of Pike, and Butt-end of the Musket, upon which the Spaniards fled, and the King's Treasury consisting of 360 Tun of Silver Bars, and a like Va∣lue of Gold, had fell into the Hands of the English, had not Capt. Drake been unfortunately wounded in the Leg, which caused the loss of so much Blood that he fainted; yet nevertheless he perswaded his Men to persist, for that the like Advantage could not be expected to be regained, if it was once omitted; but they preferring their Captain's Life before the Treasure, forced him on Ship-board. In this Battle only one Eng∣lish Man was killed, and three or four wounded by the Weapons the E∣nemy had cast away in their Flight; several of the Spaniards were kil∣led, and taken Prisoners. But Capt. Drake being now on Ship-board, and well perceiving the Spaniards had encreased their Forces, thought it not convenient with so small a Number, to make a second Attempt, therefore taking a Vessel laden with Wines, which at his coming he found in the Port, he set sail for the Port Plenty, and there, by the Ad∣vice of a Negro, carressed the Symerons found there, who being mor∣tal Enemies to the Spaniards, joyned friendship with him, and greatly furthered his Affairs: and sailing thence towards Carthagena, he took a great Ship richly laden, and after that another, in which were two of the Spanish King's Scrivendoes, who were sent from Nombre de Di s, with the News of what had hapne there. Yet he acted not so secretly, but that his coming was known to the Cartagenians, who taking the Ala∣rum, came dovvn to the Shoar in great numbers, insomuch that Drake thought it no vvays convenient to land there: And that his Pinnaces might be the better manned, he caused his great Ship to be sunk, after all things necessary vvere taken out of her, and sailed from that Port, ly∣ing for some time undiscovered, about a League thence, and caused the Negroes to build Houses, to shelter his Men from the violent Storms of Rain that fell during his stay: To vvhich place the Indians brought store of Water and Victuals, for vvhich they vvere amply gratified. At vvhich
place leaving one Ship, he, with the two Pinnaces, sailed to Rio Grand, where roving up a great River, the Marriners were much afflicted with the insufferable stinging of Flyes, called Muskatos, against which there is no Remedy, but Juice of Lemons, with which the Skin being wet, they will not fasten. In the River he met two Indian Canows, in which were Fisher-men, but took no notice of them, for fear of being disco∣ver'd, but passing for Spaniards, the Captain and his Men came to a Store-house on the River-side, where they found great plenty of Provision, pre∣pared for the Fleet that was to return into Spain; after which, having notice that the Spaniards were coming down, they returned to their Pinnaces, and soon after took five or six small Barks laden with Provi∣sion, setting the Men on Shoar, and so sailed to the Country of the Sy∣merons, who kindly received them. These Symerons are a People inha∣biting between Cabezas, and Rio-piego, who by certain Negroes, were given to understand, That Drake came as a Friend, and would protect them against the Attemps of the Spaniards; which caused them to ad∣mit the English to confer with them, and furnish them with such Ne∣cessaries as they required; promising Drake, that as soon as the five rainy Months were past, in which the Spaniards never carry their Treasure by Land, they would so order the matter, that he should make himself Master of much Gold. Whereupon he ordered them to build him six Houses, for sheltering his Men, which they did, as likewise with the help of the English a Fort Triangle, which the Captain fortifyed to prevent any Surprize; and leaving part of his Men there, sailed a∣mongst the pleasant Islands, in the River replenished with Gardens, and delicious Fruits, where the Indians were at his Devotion, deli∣vering up their Bows and Arrows, bringing Baskets of Fruit and Jui∣ces of Bails, as an Oblation of these People. Drake inquired into the State of the Country, and then sailed towards Charesha, and anchored between the Island, and the Main-land to defend which, the Spaniards had lined the Shoar vvith Shot, firing incessantly at the English, so that they vvere oblig'd to stand off, the Captain having one of his Men sore wounded; and next Morning took a Bark laden with Provision and Sweet-meats, bound for Cartagena, setting all the Men on Shoar, ex∣cept a Negro, whom the Captain kept, to be by him instructed in the Affairs of the Country; and anchoring at the Mouth of the Haven of Cartagena, took two other Barks, which caused the Spaniards to send a Scrivaneo with a Flag of Truce, who desired to be admitted on Board, which was accordingly granted; But Drake finding his Message was on∣ly
to protract time, till the Forces came down to surprize him, would not accept of his Invitation on Shoar, which Treachery was soon ap∣parent. For the Spaniards perceiving Drake's Wariness, and that they could not get him within their reach by Land, sent two Ships of War to fight him by Sea, which he perceiving, went joyfully to encounter them: But after the exchange of several shot, the Spaniards finding their Entertainment too warm, put themselves under the Protection of the Castle, and soon after came two other Pinnaces, who fared no better than the former: Whereupon Drake landed several of his Men, and drove the Spaniards from the Shoar, and for their Safety, to betake themselves some to the Town, and others to a thick Wood standing close by; but Victuals growing scarce, he was obliged to stand away to Rio Grand, where a little before he had found store of Provision, but now was frustrated in his Expectation, for the Spaniards had caused the Na∣tives to retire to the Mountains, and carry away with them all their Cattle, &c. But at length meeting with several small Vessels which he took, their Want was in some Measure supplyed, yet the Scarcity caused a Sickness to rage among the Marriners, but providence so or∣dered it, that only one of them dyed. The Sickness ended, Drake returned to the Fort, vvhere he had left part of his Men, together vvith the Symerons; but upon his arrival; to his great Grief, found his Brother, and one Richard Allen, dead of the Wounds they received in attempting to Board a Spanish Ship of considerable Force. Nor was this all the Loss, for Joseph Drake, ano∣ther of the Captains Brothers, soon after dyed of a Calenture; yet he took Courage, and being supplyed by the Symerons, he attended his better Fortune, and vvas soon after informed by those People (vvho like Grey-hounds ranged the Country to learn vvhat they could) that the Spanish Fleet vvas arrived at Nombre de Dios; vvhereupon Drake sent the Lyon Frigat to descry them, vvho upon her approaching that Port fell in vvith a small Spanish Vessel laden vvith Mace, Hens, and Pompi∣ons, from Tolon. The Spaniards that vvere found therein, the Captain used courteously, protecting them from the Fury of the Symerons, vvho are mortal Enemies to the Spaniards. Upon certain notice that the Fleet vvas arrived, Drake conferred vvith the native Symerons, about the Necessaries that vvere to be provi∣ded for the Expedition, to surprize such Carriages of Gold and Sil∣ver, as vvere to come over Land; vvho told him he must be vvell fur∣nished vvith Weapons and Shooes, and that for the rest they would not
be wanting; which being provided, 48 Men set forward, of which, 30 were Symerons, and the rest English; the former serving instead of Sumpeteres for carrying Provision, and when the store failed, they would range the Woods, and catch such Provision as they could, sel∣dom missing to return without a Buck or Faun, or store of Foul, bear∣ing about them many Arrows, headed with Iron, Wood, or Fishes Bones; which they will cast so dexterously, that they seldom miss the Iron, with which their Arrows are headed, and is frequently found to be more precious in their Estimation than Gold. This March they continued over Land through many thick Woods, from Sun-rise, till ten in the Morning, and then resting in watery plaaes till four in the Afternoon, they walked till eight; and when Darkness came on, the Symerons laying aside their Burthens, would cut down Boughs to build Harbours with, covering them to keep out the Rain, if any should fall, building them with Planata Leaves, decent∣wise according to the Fashion of Norway Cottages; insomuch that no Rain would enter for the space of 24 Hours; nor were they wanting to bring several sorts of Fruits, as Mammeas, Guyanas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Lemons, &c. After three Days travel, they came to a Town of Symerons, situate on a Hill near a River, composed with a Dike of eight Foot broad, and a thick Mud-wall ten Foot in height, containing one broad Street from East to West, and two cross Streets of a lesser breadth; all con∣sisting of sixty Families, who in their Apparel, somewhat imitated the Spaniards: This Town is distant from Nombre de Dios 35 Leagues, and 45 from Panama, being sufficiently stored with all manner of Plenty. As for their Religion, they have no Priests, yet they hold Crosses in great Veneration; but at the Perswasion of the English they laid their Crosses aside, and in some measure embrace the Worship of the true God, learning the Lord's-Prayer, and many other necessary Articles of Belief; they continually were upon their Guard, for fear of the Spaniards, who daily molested them, aiming at the Subversion of that Place, on which they made several Attempts, but without Success, their Scouts upon the Frontiers continually giving notice of their approach, and so alarumed their neighbouring Towns, especial∣ly that wherein the King resided, in which were supposed to be 1700 fighting Men; and fain would they have entreated the Captain to a long∣er Residence amongst them, but he being intent on his Journey, with many Expressions of Kindness took his leave, and so marching with
four Symerons, who knew the way about a Mile before him, who by breaking off Boughs, and strewing them in the way, gave Directions; and the other twenty four divided equally for his Vaunt-guard, and Rear-guard, the English continuing in the middle. After passing ma∣ny gloomy Woods, which shelter'd them from the Sun's hot Beams, they came to a great Hill, on which stood a high Tree, in which were cut several Steps, that led to a pleasant Bower, situate on the top, in which, ten or twelve Men might sit, and from thence take a View of the North and South Atlantick Ocean; and from thence they passed on to a plain Champain Country, abounding in Grass so high, that the Inhabitants are obliged to burn it twice or thrice a Year, to give their Cattle advantage of feeding; through which they travel∣led to Panama, and for fear of being discovered, struck through a gloomy Grove, on the right Hand, and at the Edge thereof resting, they sent a Symeron disguised like a Negro, to Panama, to enquire what Night, for by Day they travelled not, by reason of the heat of the Sun, the Recoes passed to Venta Cruz, in order to their Passage to Nombre de Dios, to land the Fleet, and by him, upon his return had notice, That that Night eight Mules laden with Gold and Silver, and one with Jewels, together with fifty others laden with Provisions and Merchandize, were to pass the Road; whereupon Drake, with his Men, and the Symerons, placed themselves in the Grass, and thick Shrubs, near to the Way-side, in expectation of the rich Booty: The Truth of which was likewise confirmed by a Spanish Soldier, taken by two Symerons, and brought to the Captain; and so placed them∣selves, that whilst one Party was seizing on the foremost Mules, the other might take the hinder-most. And all things had succeeded to their Wish, had not an English Man and a Symeron, though contrary to the strict Command of the Captain, suddenly started out to seize a Cavalier coming from Venta-Cruz, who perceiving them by the Eng∣lish Man's white Shirt, which he and the rest had put over his Cloaths, the better to distinguish them if it should come to a Skirmish, as in all likelyhood it would, he suddenly put Spurs to his Horse, and out∣stripped them; about a League distance meeting with the Recoes, he informed the Conveyors of what he had seen, tell ng them, that he was sure that either Drake, or some of his Men, lay in Ambush for them; So the Reooes, laden with Gold and Silver, and Jewels, turned back again, only that laden with Provision, Merchandize, and a small quantity of Treasure, come forward, which was accordingly taken,
and declared the manner of the Prevention; imploring Drake to de∣fend them from the Rage of the Symerons. Matters being at this pass, it was not thought safe to stay in those parts, but to return to their Ships, which they could not do, but by the tedious way they came, or by cutting their way through Venta-cruz, the latter of which was less difficult, Drake resolved on, and therefore com∣manding his Men to refresh themselves, asked Pedro, Captain of the Sy∣merons, whether he would stand by him or no? Who answered, he would dye at his Feet, e're he would leave him; and thereupon on they marched till they came near the Town, and there taking out of the Re∣coes what was best Portable, they turned back the Mules and their Dri∣vers, commanding them on pain of Death, not to follow them; and cen∣tering the way, cut through a thick Wood, as thick as our English Hedges, they were encountered by a Company of Spaniards, under the leading of a Convent Fryer; when after a hot Skirmish (in which John Harris, an English Man, and one Symeron were killed) the Spaniards were put to Flight, many of them being killed, wounded, and taken Prisoners; the Symerons at that time behaving themselves valiantly, doing with their Arrows great Execution. But far they had not marched e're the Spani∣ards, who had retired, being reinforced, had fortify'd themselves in a Wood, by which the English must pass; into which Wood the Symerons in a dancing Posture rushed, singing in their Tone, Yo-peho, Yo-peho, and with their Arrows drove the poor Spaniards thence, with the loss of but one Man; who, wounded as he was, e're he dyed, killed two Spa∣niards. The Out-guards beaten, those that remained in the Town made but small Resistance, so that the English and Symerons entring, found most of their Houses abandoned. This Town of Venta-cruz, consists not of above fifty Houses, besides one Monastery, and a few Store-houses. Here likewise they found three Spanish Gentlewomen that had lately been delivered of Children came some Days before from Nombre de Dios; for that it had been observed, that no Spaniard, or White, had e∣ver been delivered at the latter place, but that the Child soon after dy∣ed: But that being brought to Bed at Venta-cruz, or any other place adjacent, the Children came to Maturity. In Compassion of this, Drake strictly commanded, that neither his own Men or the Symerons, should Out-rage them: And so having set a Guard upon all the Passes, they took some small Pillage and departed, having first beaten back twelve Horse-men, who supposing them gome, came thither from Panama.
Thus the chief Ends, for which the Journey was undertaken, being unluckily frustrated, Drake (after a tedious March, in which many of his Men had perished by Hunger and Thirst, had not the Symerons pro∣ved their Purveyors) arrived to his Ships; those on Board, who before were in great Heaviness for his Absence, abundantly rejoycing at his return; and so staying on Board in the River Fortugos, for some time a Consult was held, what Enterprize was next to be undertaken; in which the Opinion of the Symerons was held necessary, as they who best knew the Country, and where the Treasure lay; who gave Council, that near a Town called Varagna, lived one Senior Pezero, who had for∣merly been Master to some of them, and whom for his Cruelty they had abandoned; and that this Man, in a strong Store-house, guarded by a 100 Slaves, had heaped up great Treasure, being Proprietor of several rich Mines. This Advice pleased them, yet they were prevented at that time by another Advice; for one of the Frigats being abroad, had taken a small Spanish Prize, in which was a Genoway Pilot; the said Pilot, upon his being kindly entreated, informed Drake, that in the Bay of Vicarague, lay a Vessel ready to depart, in which was a Million of Gold, and that by his Knowledge of the Channel, if he might partake in the Gains, he could bring him in undiscovered, and that he might have time to dispatch his business, e're the Town could be allarum'd. Whereupon the Captain giving such of the Symerons (who were willing thereto) leave to depart, giving them many large Gifts, he took the rest with their Captain on Board, and set sail on this so-much-desired Prize; but entering the Harbour, altho' it was not yet dark, he under∣stood by the firing of several Chambers, which were answered by others a distance thence, that he was discovered, and the Wind turning against him, he thought it not fit to attempt any thing further in the matter. So returning to his Station, he met the Bear Frigat, a small Vessell that he had fitted up, who had taken a Spanish Bark, laden with twenty fat Hogs, two hundred Hens, and great store of Mace; which is a kind of Grain like Rice, and in it ten Spaniards, who informed him, that the Fleet was arrived at Nombre de Dios, and that two Gallies were building there to waft them to and fro, but not yet lanced. Whereupon Drake feasting his Men in this manner on Easter-day, which that Year fell on the twentieth of March, he resolved to attempt something on the Fleet, and weighing Anchor, bore with the Wind, till at length they espyed a small Vessel plying to the West-ward, which after some sailing. was discryed to be a French Vessel; whose Captain likewise supposing
it was Drake, stood with him, and in a most submssive manner, he beg∣ged some fresh Water, for that he had nothing but Wine and Cider on Board; the which, by reason of the hot Weather, had much impaired the Health of his Men with which Drake supplyed him, willing to stand with him to the next Port, which he accordingly did, making him there a Present of a Case of Pistols, and a Gilt Scimeter, which he said had been the late King of France's, who was killed in Just with Moun∣sieur de Gomery; in requital of which, Drake gave him a Chain of Gold, and a further Supply of necessary Provision. So that in the end he was willing to accompany him in his Voyage and take such part as should befal him; yet Drake not altogether satisfied in his Fidelity, so divided either Nation, that it was not in the Power of the French Men, if they would, to have injured the English; and then sending for the Symeron Captain, he approved of what was done, and thereupon it was agreed, that twenty French, fifteen English, and a considerable number of Sy∣merons, should pass over Land, to intercept the Ricoes that were com∣ing from Panama, to Nombre de Dios, when having gone seven Leagues, the Bells of the Camels and Mules were heard, which made the Syme∣rons rejoyce, assuring Capt. Drake, that he should have more Gold and Silver, than he could dispose of; and so indeed it fortuned, for the Ricoes being seized, a rich Booty appeared; but there being a Guard of forty Spaniards attending it, a hot Dispute hapned; but in the end, the Spaniards were put to Flight, and the Gold and Silver unladed, and every one took what he could conveniently carry; but scarce had they hid the rest, and entered the Wood, e're a great number of Horse and Foot came on, yet they kept their way, all escaping, except on Syme∣ron that was killed, and a French Soldier that was taken Prisoner, who being put to the Torture, confessed where the Gold was hid; in the Conflict the French Captain was dangerously wounded: But what was most amazing, was, that when they came to the Sea-side, where the Pinnaces had order to attend them, they perceived seven Spanish Pin∣naces, which were sent to take the English Vessels, then but weakly manned, whom Drake and the rest imagined to have executed their De∣sign; but taking Courge, he resolved to make a Raft of such Trees as were driven on Shoor, and put to Sea, in order to seek his Vessels, which he accordingly put in practice, accompanied with one English Man, two French Men, and two Symerons, with a great joy found the Vessels safe, riding it out behind the Point and in spite of the Spaniards, ac∣cording to his Promise, fetched o his Companions, when having re∣freshed
themselves, they went to look for the hidden Treasure, but found as aforesaid, that the Spaniards, by the French Captain's Confessi∣on, had discovered it. Yet had they not searched so narrowly, but that they had left several Bars of Silver behind them, as also some Quo∣its of Gold; but what troubled the French Men most, their Captain sore wounded as he was, fell into the Hands of the Spaniards, yet upon sharing the Booty equally amongst them and the English, they were comforted, especially upon the Arrival of one of their Companions, who had escaped the Hands of the Spaniards. Yet being desirous to depart into their own Country, they left the English, yet fearing the Danger they might incur, by falling into the Hands of the Spaniards, they repented their Rashness, and lingered till Drake overtook them: When notice being had that the Spanish Fleet richly laden were about to depart from Carthagena, Drake sailed to the Mouth of the Harbour, and there dropping his Anchor, braved them with all Streamers flying, and Flag astern, and took a Frigat of fifty Tuns, laden with Provision, within sight of 'em, and not to be cumbered with the Men taken there∣in, set them on Shoar, and so without longer stay sailed to Cabezas, ha∣ving first burnt the Ship, that it might no more advantage the Spaniards. During Drake's Stay at Cabezas, Pedro, the Captain of the Symerons, importun'd him for certain Iron Instruments belonging to Navigation, which he frankly gave him for the good Service he had done for him: further promising that he would look out some Silk and Linnen for his Wife, not intending to hold any thing from him that he could conve∣niently spare. But whilst he was looking in his Chest, the Indian espyed the Scimeter, given him by the French Captain, and was greatly desi∣rous of it, but being bashful himself, he gave another a Quoit of Gold to ask for it; and having his Request granted, he gave Drake four Quo∣its of Gold in requital, saying, He would present it to his King, who would highly promote him for such a Present. And now Drake being desirous to return into England, rewarded the Symerons with divers Giefts, and after leave taken, tho' to the great Grief of those Indians, who earnestly desired the Company of the Eng∣lish, they stood away to the Island that bespangled the Ocean, and coast∣ing that Tract, came to the Cape St. Anthony, where they took two hundred and fifty Turtles, which they powdered and eat, as occasion required; and from thence sailing North-west, after touching at seve∣ral places, they, to the great Joy of their Friends, who concluded them lost, arrived safe at Plymouth, on the 9th Day of June, 1573, bringing
home to the Value of 80000 Pounds in Gold and Silver, and other Merchandize, besides the great Credit and Applause they obtained of all that heard of their strange Adventures. Drake himself being Knighted, and the rest amply rewarded. Sir Francis Drake, his Second Voyage, in which he compassed the World: In which is comprehended the many strange and wonderful Discoveries he made, during that extraordinary Navigation. DRake impatient of remaining at Shoar, importuned his Soveraign Queen Elizabeth, that he might be Commissioned to make a se∣cond Voyage, the which after some Delays, was granted; whereup∣on the Adventurers furnished him with five Ships, viz. The Pelican Ad∣mirable, burthened 100 Tuns, in which he imbarqued himself; The Elizabeth Vice-Admirable, Commanded by Capt. Joseph Winter, being a Ship of 80 Tuns; The Marrygold, a bark of 30 Tuns; Capt. John Thomas Commander; The Swan, a Fly-boat of 50 Tuns, John Chester Commander, and a small a Pinnace of 15 Tuns. These Vessels being manned with 164 able Seamen, and Soldiers, and furnished with all things necessary, sailed out of Plymouth Road on the 15th of November, 1577; yet met with many Difficulties, by reason of Tempests, and contrary Winds, e're they could get clear of the Land's End; at what time sailing towards the Coast of Barbary, they came to an Anchor on the Coast of Magadore, lying three Degrees, forty Minutes, being part of the Territories of the King of Fez, being a small Island not above three Leagues in Cir∣cumference, abounding with Foul and Fish, though of an unusual Shape. There some of the English going on Shoar, the Negroes, who inhabit that place, were desirous to be conducted on board, for whose Security Drake left a Pledge on shoar, the Moors seemingly desiring to Traffick for such Commodities as the English had, bring∣ing to the Sea-side, Camels laden with Merchandizes. But when the Negroes were returned, some of the English going on shoar in a boat, one of them, named John Fry, was detained, which much in∣censed Drake, so that he was about to revenge the Indignity, to that Purpose landing his Men: But when he understood no Injury was of∣fered him, they departed, and altho' he went not with them, yet af∣ter the Governour of that Island understood of what Nation he was, he sent him home in an English Ship, having upon his causing him to
be surprized, conjectured him a Portugal, and that Drake was the Fore∣runner of the Portugal Fleet, preparing to indamage that Coast. Departing from this Island, Drake took a small Spanish Fisher-boat conducted but with three Men only; and after that, sailing under the Tropick Cancer, fell in with a Spanish Caravel, which he took, and then sailing to Cape Barbas, he there took another, though indiffe∣rently laden with Provision; where having plenty of all things neces∣sary, he stayed a while, during which space, the Natives came down to view the English, bringing with them a Negro Woman half starved, with a Child at her Breast, offering her to sale, but Drake would not traffick for such Commodities; whereupon they brought Gums, and Amber-greese, offering it for fresh Water, which above all things is most scarce in that Country. Water they had, but Drake would not take any thing for the common Element, as like∣wise some Provision, for which they were very thankful for, eating greedily. Having thus far proceeded, they set the Spaniards on Shoar, and after trimming their Ship, sailed to Cape de Verde, and so coasted Bomavista, falling in with the Isle of Mayo, inhabited by the Portu∣guese, and so touching at several Islands, came to St. Jago, on the South-West of which Island, they took a Portuguese Vessel, laden with Wine, Woollen, and Linnen-Cloath, on its return from Bra∣zil, and in Defiance of those on Land, fired pon three or four of their Towns, standing on the Sea-coast. Near to the Island of St. Jago, is the burning Island called Fogo, continually up casting Flames; and near to that, lies a pleasant Island, always clad with green, exceeding fruitful, abounding especially with Figs, Cocos, Planatoes, Oranges and Lemons; it is also repli∣nished with pleasant Streams, though the Harbours about it, are not capable of receiving any Ships of Burthen: and in all the Island, was only one House supposed to be inhabited by an Hermet. From this Island, after having taken some of what it afforded, they stood away to the Coast of Brazil, but by contrary Winds were kept out so long at Sea, that Provision grew scanty, and espe∣cially Water, which in that burning Climate was most requisite. But when they despaired of obtaining any, God so ordered it, that there fell great store of Rain, which supplyed their Necessity: And amongst many other strange Creatures found in those Seas, they de∣lighted
themselves with viewing the flying Fishes, which are as big as ordinary Pilchards, having Fins the length of their Bodies, so that when they are pursued by any Fish, and fear to be devoured, they save themselves by leaving their Element, and flying in the Air; but cannot continue it long, for that their Fins wanting moisture become unser∣viceable, by reason of the thin Film that Joyns the Bones, or Quill, &c. Sailing from thence to the Coast of Brazil, they beheld huge Fires on the Shoar, made by the Inhabitants, in which they sacrificed two De∣vils, using many Conjurations to raise Whirlwinds and Tempests, thereby to wreck such as approached their Coast: Which Hellish In∣cantations, the Portugals to their cost found fatal, when they first dis∣covered those Countries; But the Engllsh sustained no other Dammage than the Separation of their Ships, when leaving that Coast altoge∣ther rocky and inaccessible, Drake stood away to another Point, which he called Cape Joy, by reason he re met the Ship he lost in the Storm, and having Watered and refreshed his Men at Cape Verd, and taken store of Deer, which that Country affords in abundance, he stood away twelve Leagues from the Main to a convenient Harbour, sheltering from the South-wind; and North-winter growing fast upon him, he sought out a Harbour where he might ride safe: and at last coming to Cape Hope, he entered with a Shallop, to sound the Bay, which pro∣mised good Anchorage. But e're he could return so great a Fog arose, that he could not see the Ships, and a Storm withal arising, he was great∣ly endanged to be lost: But Captain Thomas, suspecting some Dan∣ger had befallen him by reason of his stay, entered with his Ship, and by firing a Gun, directed him to the Vessel, and having not yet received him on Board, dropped Anchor, and there lay till the Storm was over: And the next Day going on Shoar, made great Fires, as a Sign to the dispersed Ships to return into the Haven, who all met, except the Swan. Upon their landing the People fled, they entred a homely House near a Rock, where they found fifty Estriches of a Prodigious size, whose Weight were such, that they could not fly, but run as fast as Grey∣hounds, so that they are not catched, but by decoying them into a Net, by the likeness of an Estrich made of their Feathers. Drake not find∣ing this Harbour for his Purpose, stood away South-west, about twelve Leagues, where entering a Port, a great number of the Natives pre∣sented themselves upon a Hill, leaping and dancing after an extrava∣gant manner, and at first landing seemed fearful of the English, but soon
after became more familiar, bringing Estriches-feathers and Bones, variously carved and Arrows of Reed, which they delivered for Eng∣lish Commodities. They went all naked, except a skin of Fur cast o∣ver their Shoulders when they sit in the cold, but when they are doing any thing, they gird it about their Waste: Their Hair is long, which when they travel, they bind it up with Estriches Feathers, of which likewise they make thir Quivers. Their Bodies are painted with di∣vers Colours, and their Faces they wash with Sulphur: Upon them appear the Figures of Suns, Moons, and Stars, which they term the Marks and Characters of their Gods. Their Victuals is Roots, and Wild Beasts-flesh, which they eat raw; they have no Boats; and sel∣dom enter the Water? those that appeared, were fifty in number; they use for their Weapons, Boms headed with Bone, and Flint-stones, artificially cut. Having stayed some time with these People, and caught in the Bay about 200 Seals, they weighed Anchor, and stood towards the An∣tartick Pole, till they cae to St. Julian, so named by Magelen, otherwise the Land of Gyants; for here are found People of a mighty Size, who at first received several of the English kindly, but in the end seeing their Advantage, killed one, and wounded two or three others, e're they could recover their Boat, yet not without the fall of two or three of their own Men, especilly of him who first began the Mischief, which Injury, Drake resolved to revenge. But upon their repenting what they had done, and de∣claring they supposed his Men to be Spaniards, who had slain many of their People, he departed that Coast, and soon after had notice of a Conspiracy against himself, and his Principal Captains, by one on Board: of which the Conspirator being detected, was wor∣thily executed, worse Execution being thereby prevented. And so keeping on, came to three Islands lying Triangle-wise, which he called Elizabethides, in Honour of our Virgin Queen; On one of them he found store of Birds, as big as Stubble-geese, without Fea∣thers, being only matted down on their Backs, and Beaks like a Crow: they cannot run fast, but swim exceeding swift; they lay their Eggs in the Ground, where they make Holes with their Beaks like Conies. Of these they killed 3000, and with them made mer∣ry: and then coming to another Island, inhabited by People of little Stature, he found them Rowing in Canows, made of the Bark of a Tree; But that place affording no Variety, he stood away to
the South-Sea, sailing amongst the Islands 150 Leagues: but a Storm arising, his Fleet separated, and some Ships lost their Anchors, narrowly escaping the devouring Waves. But God so ordered it, that entering Mare Delzur, they got under the Tempest, and re∣mained safe till the Storm was over: and then stearing North-ward along the Coast of Peru, they entered an Island full of birds, inha∣bited by Spaniards, and Native Indians; and being fallen with the Land, they sailed along the Coast two Degrees, where going on Shoar, the Natives at first received them kindly, and offer'd to Traffick with them: but having trained them into Danger, shot at them, as they were in their boat, killing and wounding divers others, as amongst which Drake was one, having an Arrow shot into his Nose, and another hit him on the Fore-head, yet he valuing not the loss of his Men, worth a hundred of theirs, thought not fit to go on Shoar to revenge the Injury. These People inhabiting the Islands, are such as the Cruelty of the Spaniards had driven from the Main, which Cruelty renders them unhospitable to all Strangers. Their Weapons are Spears, and Darts of Reed, headed with Stone and Bone. These harbrous People thus left, they not far distant, found an Indian Fishing in his Canow, who being taken, and brought on Board, was courteously entertained: who in Requital thereof, be¦ing set on Shoar, returned with divers others, bringing store of Pro∣vision, and directed the English to a Watering-place, of which at that time they stood in great need; and soon after the Governour of the Country came on board, and they afterwards going on Shoar with him, found store of Chinly Wine, and other Rarities, in a homely Town, consisting mostly of Ware-houses. Being thus refreshed, Drake saild to seek the Ship separated from him in the Storm, carrying with him an Indian Pilot, the better to know those Seas, and stood away towards the Line; and by the way, putting into a convenient Harbour, built a Pinnace, and then en∣tering a Bay South-ward, came to the Town of Cyppo, inhabited by the Spaniards, who discovering them e're they could Land any consi∣derable number of Men, came down with 100 Spanish Horse, and 200 Indians on foot, running after them like Dogs. But e're they could prevent it, all but one Man was got on board, but he, bolder then the rest staying to out-face them in a bravery, was shot by one of them, and then by the Indians, stuck full of Arrows made of green Wood,
cutting off his Head, and right Hand, and pulling out his Heart: yet what they left of him, his Companions came the next Day land∣ing, buried. And leaving these butcherly Spaniards, sailing North∣ward, they came to the Cape of Mormorena, where finding four In∣dians in their Canows, they promised to bring them to a place where they might Water, which accordingly they did, where lighting on a Spaniard a sleep, with thirteen Bars of Silver weighing 4000 Spa∣nish Duckates, they eased him of the Burden: and not far from thence they met another Spaniard, and an Indian Boy, driving four Perva∣nian Sheep, each Sheep bearing two bags, in each of which was fifty Pound weight of silver, which became likewise their Prize, and so returned on board: and a little from thence, met several Indians row∣ing in Boats of Leather sowed together, with these they carryed Knives and Glass Beads, for Fish. Sailing along the Tract, they came to another Island, near the Pro∣vince of Cusco, where they found Sheep as big as Cows, whom the In∣habitants use in carrying their Burthens, the Wool and Flesh of which are excellent Cloathing and Provision. This Coast inhabited by the Spaniards, which made our Men hope for some rich Booty, nor were they deceived in their Expectation; for the first thing they happened on, was a Bark with forty odd Bars of Silver, and soon after another laden with Linnen, and so sailed to Lima, 12 Degrees, 30 Minutes South-latitude, where they Anchored, although in the Harbour were 30 Spanish Vessels, boarding a Vessel that had in her 15000 Bars of Silver, of which, and some other Commodities found there, they ea∣sed her: And having notice of a rich Ship, bound for Panama, they set sail, and falling with Francisco, about Noon they discovered her, and bearing up without Resistance boarded her, finding in her Fruits, Conserves, Sugars, and a great quantity of Jewels, 13 Chests of Plate Rial, 80 l. weight of Gold; and 26 Tun of uncoyned Silver, valued at 360000 Pezoes, for which they only gave the Master a little Linnen in Exchange, which he took, supposing that better than nothing, as well knowing Drake would be his own Carver. Sailing from thence one Degree, North Latitude, they met with a Ship laden with Linnen, and China Dishes; and besides found in it a Paulcon, with a great Emrald in its Breast, which they took, and so passed by the Port of Papagaia, and divers dangerous Gulphs, conti∣nually sending forth violent Winds. And entering the Port of Guaia∣lio,
inhabited by the Spaniards, they furnished them with all things necessary, and compounded for their Safety, with a Pot of Riats, as big as a bshel, a Gold Chain, and a Jewel, whence sailing 500 Leagues, they came under sixty Degrees North Latitude, where, al∣though it was about the middle of June, they were so afflicted with Cold. that they were obliged to haste thence, to save their Lives, all the Countries round being covered with Snow, and the Seas with Globes of Ice; so that sailing South-ward to thirty eight Degrees, the Weather was very temperate, where bearing with the Land, the Natives sent a Man in a Cannow, to invite them on shoar, who made a long Oration in his own Country Language, and by his Gestures, expressed his meaning, and being dismissed, he came again; and the third time bringing Presents of Estrich Feathers, which none but those about their Kingdom are suffered to wear, he brought also a basket filled with Herbs, called Taback, in Requital of which, Drake preffered him many things, but he would receive nothing but a Hat. Upon this Invitation Drake put to shoar, and landed his Men, e∣rected a Tent, and armed it well, to prevent any Danger, if the Natives should prove Treacherous, who no sooner perceiving the Eng∣lish come forth of their Ships, but they came down with great haste from the Hill, and fell down at their Feet, worshipping them as Gods, throwing away their Bows and Arrows, and made many Laments and Cries. These People Drake treated courteously, bestowing shirts, and o∣ther things upon them, wherewith to cover their Nakedness; signify∣ing unto them, that he was but a Man, and that all his Company were Mortals, and no Gods, as these poor deluded People supposed them to be; to the belief of which they could hardly perswade them. In Recompence of what they had received, they bestowed upon the Eng∣lish Bows, Quivers of their Arrows, and the like; and so with Joy, which they expressed by their leaping and Dancing, they departed to their Houses, which they digged round into the Earth, having Chests of Wood set up, and joyned close at the top like a Spire, without Chim∣neys. Their Door is like an ordinary Scuttle in a Ship, sloap wise; their Men for the most part go naked, being of a loving and tractable Nature: their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, with which, though they are Skilful, they do but little Execution, they being of no Force: Their Women make themselves loose Garments of bulrush∣es, to cover their Secrets, wearing on their Shoulders beasts skins, be∣ing altogether obedient to their Husbands.
Two Days after, a great Multitude of them came down to the Tent, leaving their Women and bows some distance behind them, upon a Hill; who as soon as they were arrived at the Tent, fell to scratch∣ing their Faces, and casting themselves upon the Ground, with lamen∣table cries, as they use to do when they offer Sacrifice to their Gods, not being yet perswaded but that the English were such, though Drake and his Company, endeavoured to undeceive them, with pointing to∣wards Heaven, Praying, and singing Psalms. Three Days after their King came down, attended by a great number, who sung in a lamentable Tone about him; before him one bore a Scepter, made of black Wood, about a yard and half long, whereon hanged three Crowns, two Chains, and a bag of Herbs, called Tabak; the King had on a Caul of Net-work, re∣sembling a Crown on his Shoulders, and his Waste a Coat of Coney-skins; his Guards had Coats of other Skins, and Cauls with Feathers in them, of divers Colours, or covers with down, which grroweth on a Herb like a Lettice, which Down is not permitted to be worn, but by those about the King, the Seed of it is only used in Sacrifice to their Gods. The common sort were for the most part naked, with long Hair, tyed with bunches of Feathers, every one having their Faces painted. Lastly, The Women came with Baskets on their Arms, made of Rushes, so closely Woven, that they would hold Water, being hanged with Pearl-shells, and other shells, and with two or three links of a Chain, signifying they were Vessels dedicated to their Gods. He that bore the Scepter, made an Oration for the space of half an hour, which ended with a general Amen, and all (save the Children) came down the Hill. Being come near, he that bore the Scepter, with a stately Carri∣age began a Song, and a Dance, as also did the King and all the rest (save the Women) who daunced, but did not sing. Which ended, they entered the Tent, where the King caused his Crown to be set upon Drake's Head, desiring him, which by many Signs he made to take upon him the Kingdom, saluting him by the Name of Hyoh, ending the Solemnity with a Song and a Dance, which Drake received, to the behoof of her Majesty. When as the Com∣mon People leaving the King with Drake, went amongst the rest of the English, and finding such as pleased their Fancies, which were commonly the Youngest, and most beautiful, they inclosed them
round, and offered Sacrifices to them, crying with lamentable Shricks, weeping, scratching, and tearing their Flesh from off their Faces. This Country abounding with all things necessary for the Use of Man, Drake named Albion, and at his departure, set up her Majesty's Picture and Title to the Kingdom, ingraven in Brass. Loath were these People, that the English should forsake them, and great Laments they made, running to the tops of high Hills, and climbing Trees, to send their Eyes after them as far as they could, making Fires, and offer∣ing Sacrifices, that they might oblige them to return again, and become their Protectors. From this Country they sailed to the Islands of Molacos, where the Inhabitants in their Canows, under Pretence of Trafficking with them, sought to surprize them, but soon found to their Smart, that Drake came not to that end; whereupon naming it the Isle of Thieves, they stood away to Tatnate, where the King of that Country sent his Deputy to intreat them to come on Shoar, whereupon Drake cast Anchor, and sent a Messenger to the King with a Scarlet Cloak, desiring that he might be supplyed with Provision, and other Necessaries; who returned Answer by his Vice-Roy, that he would do any thing to serve them, and that he would shortly visit them at their Ships, who accordingly came in his Canow, attended by several of the Nobility, cloathed in White Calico. When as the King did Obeysance in humble manner, being of a tall Stature, Corpulent, and of a Princely Countenance; his Respect amongst his Subjects was very great, none of his Attendants daring to speak to him but on their Knees; he was received on Board with Drums beating, Trumpets sounding, and Vollies of great and small Shot: his Attire from his Wast downwards, was Cloath of Gold, his Legs bare, on his Feet Shooes of Red Cordivant: on his Cap were divers Rings of Plated Gold, an Inch and half broad about his Neck, and on his right Hand Rings, set with rich Stones. After he had been treated and welcomed, he returned to Shoar, and sent store of Provision, for which those that brought it, received good Presents: He sent one of his Brothers the next Day, to invite Drake to his Palace, but some Suspition arising, by words let fall, he would not go, but sent some of his Gentlemen, detaining the Vice-Roy as a Pledge of their safety, who upon their Arrival were honourably received.
These People are Moors, and live in a very plentiful Country, and fertile Clime, but after the English had trafficked with them for such Necessaries as they wanted, they, on the 9th of October set sail, and arrived at the South of the Island Caelibes, where they repaired their Ships, &c. there they found Bats as big as Bullets, and Crab-fish that lived on the Land, making holes in the Earth, and running up Trees, and Worms that shined in the Night like Fire. De∣parting from this Island, they sailed to another, but could find no Ground near it at a hundred Fathom, wherefore sailing to the West, Drake's Ship happened to run on a Shole that extended it self seven Leagues, where, had the Wind been high, she had been lost: But Providence so ordered it, by the heaving and setting of the Sea, and the Saylors Endeavours, she got off, and sailing amongst the Islands of the Sea, came at last to Java, where the chief King of the Country came on Board, sending before him Store of Provision; him they welcomed in the best sort, with Musick and Provision, e∣specially with Wine, who within a while after, returned highly satisfied: And there having Trafficked a while, they took their leaves, and sailed towards the Cape of Good Hope; Coasting along part of Africa, they came to the Main of Rio de Sesto, and watering in the Mouth of Tagoine, passed the Tropick Cancer, and stand∣ing off to the Sea, on the 26th of September, came safe to Plymouth, after two Years, ten Months, and some odd Days Absence, bringing with them in Gold, Silver, Jewels, and other Merchan∣dizes, to the Value of 100000 l. having incompassed the whole Earth. The Voyage of Sir Francis Drake into the West-Indies, wherein are ta∣ken the Town of St. Domingo, St. Jago, St. Augustina, and Cartage∣na. THe Spaniards great Armado, routed in 88, the Queen to re∣venge the treacherous Design against her Crown and Life, fit∣ting out a Fleet consisting of twenty five Sail, on which were Imbar∣ked 2585 Marriners, and Soldiers, Sir Francis Drake being Admi∣ral, the said Fleet set sail for the West-Indies, taking by the way se∣veral Spanish Vessels, when coming to Vigo, they took several Boats and Caravals, among others, a small Vessel laden with the Furniture of the great Church of St. Virgo, in which was much Plate; and a∣mongst
other things, a great Silver Cross double Gilt, all amount∣ing to the Value of 30000 Duckates. In the mean time the Govern∣ment of Galicia came down with three hundred Horse, and two thousand Foot, to defend the shoar, desiring Parley with the Ad∣miral, promising Water and other Necessaries for Money, which was expected; and after a Supply of all things they required, weigh∣ed Anchor, and sailed for the Canaries, they fell in with Palma, with purpose to have landed there: but finding the Shoar strongly fortifi∣ed, changed their purpose, and so sailing by Faro Cape Blank, and Cape Verd, they came to the Isle of St. Jago, and landed 1000 Men, under the Leading of Lieutenaant General of Carlile; and marching over Land undiscovered, surprized the Town of St. Jago, Situate in a Valley, and planted St. George's Cross upon the Wall, not a Spaniard daring to make Resistance. After which, they marched to St. Domingo, and found it abandoned, and although the Treasure was conveyed thence, yet in both places store of Plunder was found, as also in the Town of Praje; all Scituate in this pleasant Island, abound∣ing with all things necessary for the support of Man. The Country thus allarumed, the Spaniards in great numbers run to their Arms, but durst attempt nothing; so that the General com∣manded Praje to be burnt, which so perplexed the Spaniards, that they resolved to compound for Domingo, and St. Jago; but whilst the Treaty was in hand, the English had withdrawn themselves out of Do∣mingo, the Spaniards fortifyed it, planting Canons in the Gate, and laying an Ambuscade. Whereupon Drake's 1200 Men went to force the Guard, which accordingly they did, making great slaughter of the Spaniards, so that they fled to the Castle; but Fear so far prevailed with 'em, that they stay'd not long there, but fled; upon which the Town being gained, a Negro Boy was sent to such Spaniards as were retired to the Mountains, with a Flag of Truce, giving them leave to return in Safety. But as he was going he was run through by a Spaniard, which so enraged the General, that he caused two Fryers to be sent to the same place, and there hanged; protesting, that unless the Mur∣derer was delivered up, he would hang two Prisoners every day, till none was left: Which Pennance so troubled the Spaniards, that they delivered up the Murderer to Justice, who according to his Deserts was executed. The Spaniards not coming to Agreement for their City and Town, Drake gave order to Fire them, but being most stone Building, it
proved a Task very difficult; yet the Spaniards desirous to preserve them, offered 25000 Duccates, which offer was accepted. One thing in the King's House denoting his Ambition, was remarkable, viz. An Escutcheon, containing a Globe, and a Horse standing in one part in it, and the other part leaping out of it, with this Motto, Non sufficiat Orbis, The World is not enough; which the Spaniards them∣selves were even ashamed of. From this Island they put over to the main Land, and came within sight of Carthagena, when landing about four in the Afternoon, Lieu∣tenant General Carlile about Mid-night came before the City, ha∣ving put a Party of Spanish Horse to flight by the way: Whilst the Vessels on the Road, attacked a small Fort that stood on the Sea Coast. Half a Mile before they came at the City, the Land grew straight, having the Main on the one side, and the Harbour on the other: Which straight was fortifyed with a Wall and a Ditch, only a space left for passage, and on it planted six Pieces of Cannon, that bent upon the said passage. Moreover, the Spaniards had drawn two Gallies into the Harbour, into which, they had put one Ordinance, and 400 small shot, and on the Land-side 300 Men stood armed with Pikes: but the English taking the lower ground, constrained them to flight, and did not Fire till they came up to the Wall, when letting fly a Volly in the Faces of the Spaniards, and seconding it with the Butt-end of their Muskets, they beat them first from their Baracadoes, and secondly, caused them to fly, entering the the Town Pell-mell with them: and obtaining the Market Place planting there a strong Guard, notwithstanding they had Baraca∣doed every street, set Indians with Poysoned Arrows at each cor∣ner, and stuck up poysoned sticks, with sharp points to disable the Soldiers. The City thus won, the Joy was not great, by reason of a Mortal Distemper that raged amongst the Soldiers, occasioned by ill Airs, which killed a gret many of them, and caused some to loose their Wits, which utterly frustrated the Design upon Nom∣bre de Dios, and Panama, where all the Treasure was. Whilst they lay here, they took two small Spanish Prizes, in attempting which, Captain Varny, and Captain Moon were slain with Musquet∣shot, out of the Bushes where the Spaniards had run their Vessels on shoar.
The General having given order for the Firing of Carthagena, the Bi∣shop, Governour, and some other Principal Men of the Island, in∣treated him to spare it, and they would ransom it at 11000 Duckates, which was accordingly done; and for an Abby that stood some di∣stance from it, they gave a 1000 Duckates; but refusing to give so much as was demanded for a Castle without the City, it was blown up, so the Army Imbarking, sailed to Cape St. Anthony, to Water; but sinding none there, passed over to Florida, where sailing up the River, they took a Fort of the Spaniards, and found in it several pie∣ces of Ordnance, and 2000 pounds in Money; and so Coasting along came to Virginia, where several English resided, under Mr. Lane the Governour; to whom Drake offered a Ship with Provision; or if they pleased, to transport them into England, the latter of which they accepted: not being greatly desirous to stay in a Country where they had found such cold comfort. From this place the whole Fleet set Sail, and arrived safe at Plymouth, the 28th of July; the Booties got, besides the defraying of Charges, amounted to 6000 pounds, of which the Companies that travelled in the Voyage, were to have 2000 l. and their Adventures for their Merchandize, 40000 l. In this Voyage, a 150 Men were lost, the great Ordnance taken from the Spaniards, were 240 of which 230 were Brass. On the 27th of January they came to Villa Porta, where to the Grief of all English Men, the Renowned and truly Worthy Sir Fran∣cis Drake, ended his Days, and was set down in a Coffin of Lead in∣to the Sea, on which he had so often Triumphed; the Drums beat∣ing, Cannons sounding at his last Farewel to the World. The General being dead, all concluded to return home, which they accordingly did, being forced to fight their way through the Spanish Fleet, that was sent to interrupt them, after they had been a Year abroad.
