❧ By the King. WHereas the Kings Maiestie hath alwayes bene ready to imbrace and cherish such a perfect amitie and friendship betweene him and the King of Spaine, and the Archdukes his good brethren, as might stand with his owne Honour, and the common good of his people (For the better and more particuler obseruation whereof, there hath bene lately passed a Treatie, wherein his Maiesties royall will and pleasure is made so notorious to the world in all things, as whosoeuer doeth, or shall crosse the sinceritie of his Maiesties intention by any action of theirs, cannot auoyd the censure of high & wilfull contempt against his person and State,) Although his Maiestie is not ignorant, that these offences for the most part, are dayly committed by such, as (partly out of their owne originall corruption, and partly by habite of spoile and rapine) are become so insensible or desperate of the perill they draw vpon themselues, and the imputation they cast vpon the honour of their Soueraigne (so precious to him) as his Maiesty is driuen for repaire thereof, to make open profession of his sinceritie in this kinde, more often then otherwise he would: Neuerthelesse, his Maiestie hauing lately found by many circumstances, that most of these great faults do grow and multiply, by negligence of inferiour Officers, (especially such as are resident in the Ports, and dwell in the Maritime Counties,) from whom his Maiestie expecteth so continuall care and vigilancie (not onely out of feare of his Maiesties displeasure, but euen for conscience sake,) as they should bee rather industrious watches ouer those that runne such wicked courses, then (in any degree) Receitors or A∣bettors of the same, considering that those are as well accomptable to God, that hinder not the euill of others (being in their power, and incident to their peculiar places and dueties) as those that are the personall Actors, or contriuers of the same: His Maiestie hath thought it necessary once againe to publish to all persons of what place or condition soeuer within his Maiesties Dominions, these Rules and Ordinances following, as things whereunto hee commandeth all persons (whatsoeuer) to yeeld their duetifull obedience, vpon perill of his heauie indignation, and the grieuous paines belonging to the same. FIrst, his Maiestie commandeth that no Seaman or Mariner whatsoeuer, shalbe suffered to put himselfe into any Warlike seruice at Sea of any forreine Prince or State, straightly charging all that are in any such Seruice already, to leaue the same presently and without delay, and to record their apparance in their natiue Countrey, to some of his Maiesties Officers, vpon paine to be held and punished as Pirats. Item, If any person offending, doe at any time hereafter come into any port, or place of his Ma∣iesties Dominions, vpon what pretext soeuer: his Maiestie expresly chargeth all his Officers foorth∣with to apprehend the same, and to commit them to prison without Baile or Mainprise, and the Certi∣ficat thereof to be presently returned into the Admiraltie Court, to the ende that they may bee procee∣ded withall, according to the Lawes of the Realme, and the contents of his Maiesties former Proclamations. Item, His Maiestie commandeth all his Subiects, (as they will auoyd his heauie indignation) to forbeare to be aiding or receiuing of any Pirats, or such persons as shall continue in any such Warlike seruice, as aforesaid, or any person not being a knowen Merchant, by contracting, buying, selling, or by victualling of them, or any of their Company, vpon paine for so doing, to be punished presently, as the principall Offendors and Pirats ought to be. Item, That no shipping, or men of warre, of what estate or condition soeuer, going forth with commission of reprisall, or in any other warlike maner to serue at Seas, shall be permitted in any of his Maiesties ports, or in the members thereof to victual or relieue themselues with any warlike pro∣uisions, thereby to enable themselues the better, to any acts of hostilitie at Sea against any of his Maiesties friends: but onely in their returne homewards, if they happen to come into any of his Maiesties ports, that then it shall be lawfull for them to relieue themselues with victuall, or other necessaries to serue them onely for the space of twentie dayes and no more, which is a proportion rea∣sonable to vse in trade of merchandize.
Item, That all vice admirals, Customers, or other officers of the Ports shall not suffer any Ship of his Maiesties subiects to goe to the Seas, before such time as they (respectiuely in their seuerall ports) haue duely searched and visited the same, to the intent to stay such persons as apparantly shall be furnished for the warres, and not for merchandise or fishing. And if there shall be any maner of suspition, that the said person (though he shall pretend to trade for merchandise or fishing) hath or may haue any other intent by his prouisions or furniture, then to vse the trade of merchandise or fishing, that in such case of suspition, the officers of the Ports shall stay, and no wayes suffer the same to passe to the Seas, without good bands with sufficient sureties first had, to vse nothing, but the lawfull trade of merchandise or fishing. And if the said officers shall suffer any persons otherwise to repaire to the Seas, then aboue is mentioned, they shall not onely answere for any Pyracies, which any such person shall chance hereafter to commit vpon the Seas, but shall suffer imprisonment vntill the of∣fenders may be apprehended, if they shall be liuing. And further, as his Maiestie declareth and denounceth generally all such Pyrates and Rouers vpon the Seas to be out of his protection, and therefore to be lawfully pursued and punished to the vttermost extremitie: so because his Maiestie presumeth, that all other States and persons in peace and friendship with him, will thinke it iust and honourable to proceede towardes him, with the same sinceritie, which hee obserueth towards them: His Maiestie doeth also hereby notifie to the world, that where it falleth out that diuers of his Subiects are or may bee enterteyned to serue at Sea vn∣der Captaines and Commaunders belonging to some forreine Prince or State, (which are now or may be in termes of Hostility with any of his Maiesties friends) thereby imagining, when they shal (vpon occasion) enter with their Shippes into any of his Maiesties Harboroughs, that they shall be free from any interruption, according to the libertie of Common Amity and correspondency which is vsually obserued betweene Princes in such cases, onely because the Commaunder or Captaine with some few persons besides are straungers, and the rest onely discouered to be his Maiesties Subiects: For as much as his Maiestie (hauing made his iust and equall intentions thus apparant to all men by his publike Proclamations) would be loath to frustrate the expectation of any his friends whome it doth or may concerne: He doth hereby declare to all the world, that if hee shall hereafter finde any such fraudulent course taken, in hope colourably to auoid the true construction of his so iust and ne∣cessarie ordinances, the breach wherof giues cause of further trouble and iealousies to arise betweene his Maiestie and other Princes in the mutuall exercise of their Subiects free trade and entercourse: he will make absolute stay of any such shippes and persons, which shalbe so brought into his Portes or Harboroughs, as persons and thinges wholly exempted from that protection and fauour, which hee entendeth to maintaine and affoord to all others which shall not in such kinde goe about to abuse his Maiesties integritie, whose desire is to receiue no better measure in any thing, then he is willing to yeeld to others vpon the like occasions. Giuen at our Castle of Windsor the viij. of Iuly 1605. in the third yeere of our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. ANNO DOM. 1605.
