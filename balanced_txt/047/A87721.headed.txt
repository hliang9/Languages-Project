SEEKERS SVPPLYED, OR Three and forty Non-Church Que∣ries by Scripture answered. Penned and pub∣lish't for the vindication of Christs Commands, and edification and confirmation of his people. By Thomas Killcop, Servant to Christ Iesus, the King of Kings. CANT. 2.14.15. O my Dove, that art in the Clefts of the rock, in the se∣cret places of the staires: let me see thy countenance, let me heare thy voice, for thy voice is sweet, and thy countenance is comely. Take (for) us the Foxes, the little Foxes: which spoile the Vines, for our Vines have tender grapes. IUDE 3. Beloved it is needfull to write unto you, and to exhort you to contend, and that earnestly too: for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints. LONDON, Printed by Tho. Paine for George Whit∣tington, and are to be sold at his Shop at the Blew Anchor in Corn-hill neer the Royall Exchange. 1646.
To the Christian Reader. AS Israel departing out of Babell, to repaire Zion, were hindred: so now spirituall Israel departing spiritually from spirituall Babell, to repaire and build up spirituall Zion, are also hindred by such as are called (Non-Worshippers) and as they built and held weapons too, so must we spiritually. Of these are three sorts, some deny worship only, some believers al∣so, and some deny Scripture too. The first sort are most consciencious, but the last are truest to their principles; for such gifts as they say, must accompany Administrators, and confirm administrations. Are rather by Scripture speech to accompany believing, and to confirme the word to be the word A Mat. 16.17.20. Heb. 2.4. Mar. 1.27. Iohn 12.37. Therefore that Non-Worshipper that is not also a Non-Believer, yea that doth not by Scripture deny Scripture, is not true to his principles. And if the first sort (which I have to deale with) dare own Scripture to be Scripture, and themselves Believers, though they want gifts, much more hold might they be, to practice this received word, and declare their faith by obedience, though they want the same gifts. These I take to be the Foxes specified, Can. 2 15. there is first the speech of Christ to his people, and therein, Exhortations, and provocations to worship, verse 14. And then their reply to him, declaring their grie∣vances, in that the Vines are injured, and their small fruit hindred by little Foxes. These vines are believers, fruit is obedience, Iohn 15.8. and these Foxes are such as (what in them lies) hinders the Saints fruitfullnesse as I conceive.
They petition, and so doe I, (not to man, but God) that Christ (not the Woolfe) would take them, and bind them, with the cords of love and pierce them, (not in the flesh with a sword of steele, but) in the heart with the sword of the spirit. For the weapons of our War∣fare are not carnall, but spirituall, and mighty through God, to cast downe, &c. Acts 2.37. Heb. 4.12. 2 Cor. 10.4. Their way is to study suttle queries, which pussles, and puts at a stand, the (weake, but) consciencious people. For tis easie to propound what is hard to answer, they are suttle, and I simple, they in parts strong, and I weake. But I have the word on my side, which they have not, and truth feares no cullers, and I faint not, knowing that God makes babes to praise him, Mat. 21.16. they quote Scriptures, so do I Let the Reader weigh theirs and mine, and see whose are suta∣ble to what they are brought for, and whose not. I have covited brevi∣ty, therefore read deliberately, weigh carefully, practice conscionably. Farewell. Thine in Christs cause. Thomas Killcop.
SEEKERS SVPPLYED. Or 43. Non-Church queries breifly and plainly answered by Scripture. WHether the visible congregated Churches of Christ did, or ever should suffer defection under Antichrist, from these and other Scriptures. Jer. 10.20. Dan. 8.13. and 9.25. and 11.31. and 12.7.11. Hos. 3.4, 5. Amos 5.13. and 8.12.11. Mich. 3.6 7. Luk. 17.22.23. Joh. 9.4. 1 Thes. 2.3. 1 Tim, 3.5. Rev. 11. and 12.6. and 15.8. Whether the defection, should be totall, or in part only? Though some of these Scriptures concerne the Jewes only, some Christs personall presents, some the day of glory, hardly any seemingly for the thing in hand. Yet I grant a defection hath been (in part; yea, wholy) but this defection is vicious, not vertuous: and though it hath been, it should not be. As Luk. 19.13. Rev. 2.25. 1 Tim. 6.14. 2 Pet. 1.19. And a recoverie from this defection, (either in whole or in part) is vertuous, not vicious. Cant. 1.7, 8. Iude 3. Rev. 2.5. God may justly, for the abuse of Gifts, Ordinances, or Administra∣tions: take them away and still with-hold them? From those that abused them he may, but for their abuse, to with-hold them from their successors: is to set childrens teeth an edge, for fathers eating sower grapes. Ezek. 18.2, 3, 4. Whether there hath been a restauration, since that defection? When, and how far this restauration hath been? That a Restauration hath been in part, (even in England) both in doctrine, and practice: thousands can experimentally testifie. Which restauration will be more and more, Cant. 2.12.13.15.
Dan. 12.4.9.10. In the meane while we ought to walke by our, rule, so far as we have attained. Phil. 3 16. Whether there be any pattern of a true Church under the Gospel that ever was gathered without Baptisme? No, for the 3000. Acts 2.41. were added by baptisme, which could not be, if the Church they were added to, were not also baptized, and baptisme is the entrance into Christ, (in respect of order) Gal. 3.27. Iohn 3.5. Rom. 6.1, 2. Whether any people (how godly so ever) may gather and baptize themselves, and others: unlesse they have a Commission from Heaven, (as Iohn, the Apostles and Ananias had) either imediatly, or mediatly, by the visible gifts of the Holy Spirit? As Iohn 16.33. and 17.18. Math. 28. Acts. 9.10. This querie declares much ignorance in the querer. For first, never had Iohn, the Apostles, Ananias, nor any o∣ther, a Commission to baptize themselves. Secondly, (Visible gifts) is not Scripture language, but very improper, because though the baptisme of the Spirit, was some∣time visibly seen like a Dove, or like firie tongues, Math. 3.16. Acts 2.3. Yet it was not alwaies seen. For the Iewes knew not that the Gentiles had it, tell they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God. Acts 10.46. And never was any other gift vi∣sible, no not once, though their effects were visible, as healing the sick, raising the dead, &c. A knowing man can distinguish be∣twixt a thing it selfe, and the effects it produceth. Thirdly, These gifts (improperly called visible) are not Commissions from Heaven, nor so called. Fourthly, they fit not for administrator-ship. For Iohn had a commission from Heaven, and was a lawfull Administrator, Mat. 21.25. Iohn 1.33. though he had not these gifts, Iohn 10.41. And Christs Disciples, were lawfull Administrators, Ioh. 3.22. and 4.1 2.3. When they had not Apostle ship, nor power to worke miracles, nor the baptisme of the spirit, for this Admi∣nistrator-ship, was before Iohns imprisonment, Iohn 3.34. or
Christ returne to Galilee, Iohn 4.3. But after these things; many of the twelve came to Christ, Mark. 1.14.16.19. and 2.14. and after this, Christ chose the twelve, from other Disciples: and after this choice, he called them Apostles, and then gave them power to heale sicknesses, cast out Devills, &c. Mark. 3.13.14.15. Mat. 10.2. And their baptisme with the spirit, was not till after Christs assension, Acts 1.4.5. and 2. chap. Whether Iohns baptisme, and ministrie, were not to end when  Christs were fully come? Iohn 3.30. Act. 13.25. No verily, for first, those places speake no such thing, 2. Iohn began Christs Gospel, prepared his way, made his pathes straight, Mark, 1.1, 2, 3, 4. Whether any were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus, or of  Christ, before the assension, or with Iohns baptisme after the assension? Yea verily, for these differ not, being both the baptisme of water, Acts 1.5. and 10.47.48. and both the baptisme of repen∣tance, for the remission of sins. Mar. 1.4. Acts 2.39. Whether there be not a baptisme for the giving, and receiving of  the holy spirit, distinct from that of Iohn or Christ, seeing Philip it seemes, could not administer that of the holy spirit, though he did ad∣minister the other. Act. 8.12.15.16.17. The baptisme of water, and the baptisme of the holy spirit, are doubtlesse two distinct baptismes, Act. 1.5. Whether the baptisme in the Apostles Commission, Mat. 28. Mar. 16. were the baptisme of John, so called, Mat. 3.7. and 21.25. Act. 1.22. and 18.25. and 19.3. or the baptisme of Christ, or in the name of the Lord Iesus, so called, Act. 2.38. and 8.16. and 10.48. and 19.5. or the baptisme with, or in the name of the holy spirit so called, Math. 3.11. and 28.19. Mark. 1.8. Luk. 3.16. or all these baptismes together? I have proved the two first not to differ, (querie 8.) secondly, the baptisme of, or with the holy spirit, is not called a baptisme in the name of the holy spirit, this is a meer deluding falshood of purpose to pervert, Mat. 28.19. which place speakes not of
the baptisme of the spirit, but of the baptisme of water. For it is the disciplising baptisme, and that is that with water, Ioh 4.1.2. compared with Ioh. 3.22.23. Secondly, it is that baptisme to which is annex▪t the promise of the spirit. Mat. 28.20. Mark. 16.17. and that is that with water. Mat. 3.11. Mark. 1.8. Act. 2.38. Where is that baptisme said to be in the name of the father, son and spirit? The baptisme with water, is the baptisme in the name of the Lord Iesus, but the baptisme of the spirit is not. Act. 8.15.16. and 10.47.48. and he (as man) is his fathers deputie, doing and speaking his fathers will. Heb. 1.1.2. Ioh. 7.29. Therefore what is done in his name, or in obedience to him, is in the name of, or in obedience to the Trenity or God-head, Luk. 10.16. Whether the baptisme of Christ, be to be administred with water? Yea, Act. 8.38. and 10.47.48. Whether the baptisme of the spirit be administred with water? No, Act. 1.5. Whether the baptisme of Iohn, or the baptisme of Christ, in the ministration with water, be to be administred with these words (in the name of the father? Christ did not bid say, I baptize thee in the name, &c. He bid doe it in the name, &c. Whether all that were visibly baptized in the name of the Lord Ie∣sus, received, or were they visibly baptized, with the holy spirit? All baptized Beleevers, had more or lesse, sooner or later, that baptisme of the spirit, which you call visible, Act. 2.38 39. Whether ever any particular Churches of Christ, officers, officer, or People (as by vertue of particular Church priveledges) did, or had power to administer, either all, or any of the aforesaid baptisme? Any Church that had abilitie, had also authority to admini∣ster either baptisme, but some wanted abillitie to administer that of the spirit, so much as on themselves, Act. 8.16, 17, 19. Whether Elders, Bishops, Pastors or Deacons, had any more power by vertue of these titles of office, to administer in matters of worship,
then any other in the Church had, or might have: though they were no officers? Disciples as Disciples, have power from Christ, to admini∣ster, Iohn 4.1, 2. Mat. 25.16, 18, 19. Acts 9.10. yet may a Church, I conceive, make use most usually, of her ablest Mem∣bers Acts 13.1. with Acts 15.22.35. Whether the Officers afore said, were not only civell? No, Christ is a soule Bishop, or Shepheard, 1 Pet. 2.25. And these are his Deputies, 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3, 4. Also the flock and food is spirituall, therefore Pastors also. Whether the visible presence of Christ, or any other of his visible ministries or ministrations of worship: were to continue any longer time, then the visible power and presence of the holy spirit by gifts, which was before told should accompany them, and was fulfild accor∣ding to these and other Scriptures, Mat. 3.11. Mark 16.17, 18, 20. Iohn 1.33 and 7.39. and 14.26. and 16 13. Act. 1.25. and 2.38.43. and 8.16.17. and 11.15.16. and 19.5 6. Heb. 2.3.4. This querie declares horrible sottishnesse in the querer. For first, the spirit was not in this sort present, till Christs visible presence was gone, Iohn 16.7. Secondly, not one of these Scriptures doe fore tell that these gifts should accompanie mi∣nistries and ministrations of worship. Thirdly, not one of them affirmes such a thing to be fulfild. Fourthly, some of them de∣clare the word to be confirmed by them, As Mar. 16.20. Heb. 2. But that being confirmed, and people receiving that for Gods word, they are to submit to it, without seeing miracles for such as now give nor heed to but neglect it, cannot escap. Because Christ and others, at first preach it, and God even then bore witnesse to it, or to them preaching it, with miracles, and other gifts of the spirit, as he at that time pleased, Heb. 2.1, 2, 3, 4. These gifts were to confirm doctrin while it was new, Mar. 1.27. Thus with Moses and the Prophets so also with Christ. But now Gods last spokes-man, hath already uttered, and con∣firmed his last message, Mar. 21.36.37. Heb. 1.1. and 2.3.4.
therefore Gods use and end for miracles, or gifts, termed visible, is null. For whosoever teacheth otherwise now, then what is al∣ready taught, is to be accurst, Gal. 1. Whether the visible gifts of the holy spirit, were not the life, power, &c. of the visible ministries and ministrations of the Gospel, as much at least as the holy anointing oyle, and the bodie of Christ was the life of those under the law? To compare oyle with Christs body, I account it blasphemie, Secondly these gifts, termed visible, are not the life and power of Gospel ministrations, for they lived and acted without them, as I minded in querie the 6. how Iohn and Christ Disciple admi∣nistred in a Gospel way, when they had not such gifts. That John was a Gospeller, see further Mat. 11.10.12. Marke 1.12.4. Luke 16.16. Whether the death of the Ʋisible bodie of Christ, was not the death of the visible ministries and ministrations of the Law? Yea, and well it may, being the substantiall Antitype of those Types and shadowes, Col. 2.17. Heb. 9.9, 10, 11. & 10 1, 2. Whether the death of the visible power of Christ, by the ceasing of the visible gifts of the holy spirit, was not the death of the visible mi∣nistries and ministrations of the Gospel? The ceasing of gifts cannot kill Gospell ministries or mini∣strations of Worship, first because they never had life by them, as querie 6. and 18. Secondly, neither were Gospel administrati∣ons shadowes of these gifts, as the ministeries of the Law were of Christs death. Whether it be possible for any man to be a true visible Preacher or Minister of worship in any other kind, according to Rom. 12.6.7. 2 Cor. 12.3, 7. Ephes. 4.7. 2 Tim. 4.14, 15. 1 Pet. 4.10.11. unlesse he hath received, or been visiblie baptized with the holy spirit that if way be manifest to sence, that it is imediatly, or mediatly after a supernaturall way from God? Tis doubtlesse possible, for such to be visible Preachers, and Ministers of worship, that have neither gift of miracle, nor the spirits baptisme, as is proved in quetie 6.
Whether if any can, or at least will pretend to administer in a Gospell way, vi∣sibly (who are dead to it, for want of visible life by gifts) why may not every one that can and will pretend it? I have oft proved that the want of gifts make not men dead to admi∣nistrations, Secondly, though beleeving men in the ways of God may administer, yet first, unbeleevers may not. Psal. 50.16.17. Secondly, Non-participaters, (though beleevers) may not, (when Christs wayes are afoot) for Christ himselfe would not preach the Gospel, but first be baptized, to fulfill righteousnesse, even a righteous order. Mat. 3.15. and 4.23. And Paul though appointed to witnesse Christ to the Gen∣tiles, must first be baptized. Acts 22.15, 16. Thirdly, beleeving wo∣men (though baptized) may not in the Church (by administring) u∣surp authority. 1 Cor. 14.34 1. Tim. 2. Whether any beleever now living in the world, can truly say he is visibly baptized with the holy spirit? according to Acts 8 15 16.17. and 10 44.45. and 19.2. and many other places? First, I have proved this baptisme, not to be alwayes visible, from Acts 10.45.46. Secondly, everie baptized beleever (since Christ assen∣tion) is, or shall be, little or much baptized with the holy spirit, or else God keeps not promise. Acts 2.17, 18.38.39. Iohn 7.38.39 Be∣leevers without this, are without their earnest, and likewise unsealed, Ephes. 1.13.14. which I doubt the Querer is. Whether any beleever now living in the world, can shew what this particu∣lar gift, or gifts are, and after what manner or forme particular gifts are to be administred, as the gift of knowledge, wisedome, faith, miracles, prophesie, disearning of spirits, tongues, interpretation of tongues? &c. 1 Cor. 12.8.9. What the baptisme of the spirit, (the Birth-right of every called one) is? I purpose (God assisting) to declare fully, from Acts 19. In a booke which I shall intitle, (A two fold baptisme) in the meane while, see the substance of it, in Acts 2.18. in these words. (On my servants and hand∣maids, will I poure my spirit, and they shall prophesie.) God will poure his spirit on them, (that is the gift) and they shall prophe∣sie, (that is the effect) they shall be filled with the holy spirit, as a foun∣taine is filled with water, that is the gift, and the fulnesse within, shall bubble forth, that is the effect, as Iohn 7.38, 39. Acts 2.4 The appea∣rance of fierie tongues, is an overplus in the gift, and the speaking with tongues, is an overplus in the effect. Whether any that hath a visibile gits, or gifts of the spirit, must not of necessi∣ty know that he hath so?
Tis likely he should, yet I conceive, it may possibly be otherwise. For Sampson thought the spirit abode with him, when it was gon. Iudg. 16.20. Whether any that hath a visible gift or gifts of the spirit: must not of necessi∣ty administer infallibly, when he administers by them? Yea doubtlesse. 1 Cor. 12.3. Whether any one that hath a visible gift or gifts of the spirit, administring sometime by them, and sometime beside them, must not of necessitie know, when he administers infallibly by them, and when beside them: As well at least as any Officer in commission, or any Souldier of, or in any Armie, or any Officer, or member of a civill state; can tell when he administers or acts, according to his commission, institution, bith, priveledges, &c. and when it is not? We have our Commissions, institutions, &c. not from gifts, but from the written word. 1 Cor. 14.37. Gal. 1 8 9 2 Pet. 1.17.18.19. Secondly, there is a possibillity for people thus gifted, to be mistaken in this kind. For the Corinthians which came short in no gift, 1 Cor. 1.5, 6.7. Supposed the spirit taught them to let women teach in the Church. 1 Cor. 14.35, 36, 37, 38. and the Galatians had these gifts, and yet that was errour, which they tooke for truth, and they fell backward, when they thought they went forward, Gal. 3.2, 3.5. and yet all the Saints, (gifted or not gifted) are in some things infallible. Iohn 21.24. and 1 Iohn 5 18, 19, 20. Whether any that hath a visible gift, or gifts of the spirit, must not of necessi∣tie know, when he administers each severall gift? No, we may possibly thinke, we administer the gift of wisedome, when envie is in us: or the gift of knowledge, when pride hath possest us, or uncharitablenesse: but are deceived. Iam. 3.13.14, 15. 1 Cor. 8.1, 2, 3. Whether it be not necessary that the visible gifts of the holy spirit, should con∣tinue in the Church, as long as there is a Church, to distinguish between chri∣stian and antichristian spirits. As in civill affaires, officers and members of a ci∣vill state should have visible commissions, institutions, birth-priveledges, &c. to distinguish them from false intruders? First, any man indude with reason, will deny those gifts (which you call visible) to be Commissions and institutions. Secondly, civill Com∣missions and institutions are written, so are ours, as before minded, Thirdly to distinguish between Antichristian and Christian spirits, was not Christs end for gifts, as querie 18. Fourthly, Antichristians, shall by miracles deceive all except the Elect. Mat. 24.24. Rev. 13.13, 14, 15. Whether the visible Church, want not members, when any of the gifts are wanting in it? according to 1 Cor. 12.
That chapter, speakes only of the Church generall, whereof the church at Corinth, was a body or members in particular. A part of the whole as verse 27. So that this Church wants not members, if ever these gifts were, though particulars have them not, and whoever now hath in∣trest in the Church generall, hath intrest in them gifts. Ioh. 20.30, 31. Whether visible gifts, and consequently visible ministries, and mini∣strations of worship, were not to cease all at one time, seeing they came all from one spring. 1 Cor. 12 4.5, 8, 9, 11, 13. and 13.8.13. These administrations, 1 Cor. 12.4.5. are Christs administrations of gifts, not our administration of worship, (a great mistake) I confesse that when these gifts cease, our Lord ceaseth to administer them, and these administrations of gifts, spring not from a command, as our admi∣nistrations of worship doe, Ioh. 15.14. Whether the food of the Church, (after visible gifts) should not be imediatly from God, without any visible meanes. As the Saints witnes∣ses, &c. according to Ier. 31.33.34, Ezek. 34.11, 12, 13, 14.15. Revel. 12.6.14. First, your Scripture, Rev. 12.6. saith, they shall feed her. Secondly, your other Scriptures, ate not fulfilled in this life, for now we know but in part, and see as in a glasse darkly. 1 Cor. 13. But when Christ againe appeares, then, and not tell then we shall see him as he is, even face to face, and know as we are known. 1 Cor. 13. 1 Iohn 3.2, 3. and tell then, we are to make use of word and ordinances. 2 Pet. 1.19 1 Cor. 11.26. Rev. 2. Whether there be in the Scripture, any cleere proofe for the time, rule for manner, and discriptinn of the power, for restoring the Church from the defection, from faith, order, &c. as there was under that defection of the law. 2 Chron 36.22.23. That place discribes no rule for manner, nor power fot restoring, but only the time when: but our Gospel rule gives a commanding power to restore its faith or order. Iude 3 Rev. 2.4, 5. As of old, their written commands, and institutions, gave power, and their restaurations were squared thereby Ezra 3.2.4 10. Nehe. 8.14 15.16. so now. Whether it be not cleere from Ezra 1.12. and 6.14. Zach. 4.6. and many other places that Ezra and the rest, went not about to reforme, tell they had a particular command from God, with power and particu∣lar promises of protection, and successe, and strengthned with most sweet and gracious promises? First, to expect imediate Revelations from Heaven to Prophets, and from them to people now, is to deny Christ, as come in the flesh
Former Prophets, typifying ours, and he is the Antytipe of them, Acts 3.22.23. Heb. 1.1 Secondly, these Prophets gave them not their 1. com∣mission. But (the worke by opposition ceasing) their prophecying did only reincourage them. As is cleere. Ezra 4 24. and 5 1.2. Hag. 1.2.3. Whether 1 Cor. 12.1. As concerning spirituall gifts brethren, I would not have you ignorant, &c. Doth it not lay an absolute necessity upon eve∣ry one that will administer in a Gospel way, to be really possest with such gifts as also, rightly to understand them. Want of gifts hinders not administring in a Gospel way, as querie. 6. Ioh. 3 22.23. Mar. 1.1.2.3.4. Yet I grant that none is to administer beyond his abillitie, Rom. 12.3.6. He that hath but one tallent is not to use five: nor yet to hide his one because he hath not five. But every one is to administer, as he hath received. 1 Pet 4 10.11. Or he shall be bound and cast into utter darkenesse, Mat. 25.30. Whether it be not player like childish, apish, improper, and Anti-christian: for any to pretend to administer visibly in the name of the father son and spirit, that wants power to give the holy spirit, &c. or at least that hath not visibly Gospel life himselfe by it, for matter of faith, order, &c. Here is horrible impiety discovered, first reckoning Christs service, apishnesse, Secondly, accounting people ungifted, to be lifelesse, touch∣ing either faith, or order. First, Iohn and Christs disciples, querie 6 and Philip as you grant, que∣rie 9 administred the baptisme of Christ, when they could not conveigh the spiit, Secondly, the Samaritanes, had visible life touching faith, and order. For they beleeved and were baptzed. Acts 8 12. or received the word of God, vers 14 and the Ephesians had visible life touching faith and order. For Paul, (though a stranger) found them to be beleeving disciples. Act. 19 1.2. when both the Samaritanes, and Ephesians, wan∣ted (as yet) your least degree (to wit) the baptisme of the spirit, as Acts 8.16. and 19. 2 6. Which you falsly call vissible life, &c. Whether ministring visibly in the name of God or Christ, in a bare forme, without the visible anointing baptisme, presence &c of the holy spirit, by and with gifts to administer without the power and authoritie of Iesus Christ, be not plain deceiving, cozning, a false vision, a divina∣tion of their own hearts, a thing of naught, false dreames, lyes lightnesse, &c. Ier. 14.14 and 23.21.25, 26, 27 32. Mat. 24. Yet all in the name of Christ, &c. and from running before sending, and climbing up some other way, then God and Christ hath ordained. Incurring to him∣selfe that heavie vengeance, Numb. 18.7 Deut. 18.20 Ier. 13.14. Revel 20.10.
To affirme (as you doe) that such administrations, that are in the name of God, or Christ, are without the authoritie of Christ, if not accompanied with gifts, must needs be deceiving, cozning, a false vision, &c. and from running, before sending, &c. Because (as often minded) Iohn and others that wanted these gifts, did administer by authoritie from God or Christ, Iohn 1.33. Math 21. Whether administring visibly, or rather seeming to administer in a Gospel way, without a true visible power & commission by gifts &c Or to partake of such ministries or ministra∣tions: be not to set up an Idoll, yea Idolatrie in the highest degree: as farr above Ieroboams calvos, as Gospel is above the law, Christ above Moses, and spirituall Babell with her plagues, Rev. 18.21. above literall Babell with hers. Ier. 51.63.6. Then had Iohn and others a commission, to set up Idolatrie in the highest degree (they wanting these gifts as aforesaid.) Secondly, if these gifts, be visible power and commission, then Iohn and others (that had not these gifts) had no visible commission at all, opposite to Iohn 1.33. Whether to partake of such ministries and ministrations, either in respect of time, place, matter or forme of worship, or whatever comes under institution of Antichrist, (as everie institution doth, that is not from Christ) be not to receive the mark of the Beast, number of his name, and to worship the beast and his image, and so to be liable to those dreadfull plagues, Ier 14.13, 14, 15, 16. & 29.15.16.17, 18. Rev. 14.9 10, 11. &c. read and tremble. Your speech is at randome, not having (as yet) proved our time, place, matter or forme of worship: to be of Antichrist, or not from Christ. I can prove the neglecters, (much more the opposers) of Gods way of worship, to be resisters of his counsell, and that against themselves, and liable to be plagued, Luke 7.30. Math. 12.30. Rev 4.7 12. read and trimble. Whether it doth not highly concerne every one that feares the Lord, to be infallibly assured of the warrantablenesse of their practice, and power in matters of visible worship, least the Lord account them, takers of his name in vaine, will worshippers, and Antichri∣stians, and so guilty of, and liable to that sin and vengeance, Ex. 26.5. Deu. 4.2 and 12.32. Pro. 30.6. Rev. 21.10. This is a truth and good counsell, but not well applyed, for first not true, but false worshippers are herein tardie. Rev. 14.7.9. Secondly fearers of the Lord, are also wor∣shippers of the Lord and non-worshippers are non-fearers. Psal. 2.11. Psal. 5.7. Rev. 1.7. and many more places. Whether Exod. 25.9.40. and 10.33. Levit. 10. 1, 8. Numb. 16.7. Psal. 138.2. Ezek. 15.6. and 43.8.9.11.12. and many other places, Especially Psal. 138.2. I will worship toward thy temple and praise thy name, for thy loving kindnesse, and truth, for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy names. Doth it not eminently declare the excee∣ding transcendencie of Gods worship, above all other his name, workes and ordinances whatsoever. And consequently that all the murders, rapes, oppressions plunderings, blas∣phemies, or whatever grievious sins, have been, or shall be committed, are little or no∣thing in comparison of this great blasphemie, to wit, abuse of this great and glorious name of God, by false and will worship. Therefore you might even trimble thus to murder, rape, and plunder this glorious name of God, to wit, his worship, for not false and will worship, but true worship, you raile a∣gainst the consideration of the excellencie of this name, wrought a contrary effect in Da∣vid, who therefore worshipt toward his holy temple. Psal. 138.2. Here O heavens, and wit∣nesse O earth, (at the great day of Christ) against this horrible and desperate plundering of this glorious name. Whether it may not be gathered from Scripture, that there should be, &c. a time for beleevers, &c to be silent, &c. and that there should be night to visible worship, &c. and
they should wait on the Lord for a restauration and reformation, &c. Eccles. 3.7. Cant. 1.13. and 3.1. and 5.2. Esay 5.30. and 13.9, 10. and 26.20. and 28.26. and 60.2. Ier. 13.16. and 14.22. Dan. 12.12. Hos. 3.4, 5. Ioel 2.2, 10. Amos 5.13. and 8.9, 10.11. Mich. 3.6.7. and 7.7, 8.14.15. Hab. 2.3. Zeph. 1.4.15. and 3.8.9 Zach. 12.14.17. Math. 24 29. Mar. 15.43. Luke 2.25, Ioh. 9.4. 1 Cor. 1.7, 8. Rev. 8.1. Indeed these words, silence; night; weight, are often in these Scriptures, but not once to pur∣pose, but each Scripture is horribly abused. First, Solomons all things, are all accidents that befall us, his time of silence Eccle. 3.7. is an accidentall silence, as by death, &c. and not an allowed time to be silent God-ward. As Eccles. 12.13. and if the righteous through feare, be altogether thus silent. As Amos 5.11.13. tis vice, not vertue, to be shund, nor followed as Esay 62.6, 7. Mal. 3.15, 16, 17. And Christ will not owne such hereafter, thus own not him novv. Mark 8.38. Iohns halfe houre silence Rev. 8.1 sets forth Gods forbearing; to plague the ungodly, while the Saints acceptably worship, as verse 2, 3, 4, 5. of this silence in other words, see further, Rev. 7.2, 3. 2 Pet, 3.9, 10. This night Cant. 1.13. & 3.1. and 5.2. is the whole time before Christs second comming, and that time is day time Rom. 13.12. Heb. 10.25. 2 Thes. 2.1, 2, 3. bed is worship, true worship is Christs, or Gods bed, false worship, is a Whorish bed and idolatrie is whoredome God-vvard, or Christ ward, Esay 57.7, 8. There we learne from Cant. 1.13. &c. That night time is bed time, that is the time before Christs comming, is the only time of worship. See further, Luk. 19, 13. 1 Cor. 11, 26. 1 Tim. 6.13.14. 2 Pet. .19. Kevel. 2.25. This night then, is not night too, but night for worship, and this bed is not a want, but a joyfull enjoyment of Ordinances. Cant. 1.16, 17. And this Waiting, so often specified, is sometime a waiting for succour from God, as Esay 25.9. and 26.8. Mich. 7.7, 8. Zepa. 3.8. sometime for Israels consolation, Luk 2.5. Gods Kingdome, Mark. 15.43. the resurrection or Christs comming, Dan. 12.12, 13. 1 Cor. 1.7, 8. sometime for raine Ier. 14.22. Hbacuk for a vi∣sion, 2.3. the Iewes waited on Zachoriah for the word of God Zach. 11.11.17. Christs Disciples by command waited for the promise of the father, to wit the baptisme of the spi∣rit, Act. 1.4. but not one of these Scriptures speakes of a waiting for worship but this last place hath greatest shew, and is the speciall place, which all seekers, or waiters in gene∣rall cleave too, from that therfore note. First, they waited not for ordinances, restaurati∣ons, nor reformations of worship, but for the spirits baptisme, Acts 1.4, 5. Secondly, for this they waited in a way of worship, or in the use of Ordinances, as first baptisme, Acts 1.5. compared with Marke 1.8. Secondly prayer, Acts 1.14. Thirdly, preaching, verse 16.17.18.19.20. Fourthly, exhortation, v. 21.22. Fiftly, ordination, v. 23. Sixtly ca∣sting of lots, v. 29. and all before this baptisme. Hence note first, that waiting for wor∣ship, or use of ordinances, is Scripture-lesse, and so groundlesse, secondly, waiting unbap∣tized with water, for the baptisme of the holy spirit is also groundlesse yet, horrible pre∣sumption. Acts 2.38. for though the baptisme of the spirit preceeded the other only one time, Acts 10.47. yet the promise ran not so, neither were any ever taught, so to expect it, but contrariwise, Acts 2.38. Mar. 1.8. Luke 3.16. Iohn 1.33. I also find in these Scripture, some words not minded in the querie, of them a word or two, by darknesse is meant sometime sorrovv, as Esay 5.30. Ier. 13.16. with ver. 14. Zeph. 1.14.15. some∣time ignorance, Esay 60.2. Mich. 3.6.7. sometime litterall darkenesse Esay 13.10. Ioel 2.10. explained in Math. 24.29. that famine Amos 8. is not now, (if the writings of the Prophets and Apostles be Gods word) and though the Iewes, were and are Kinglesse, Hos. 3 4.5. beleevers are not nor shall be, Luke 1.32.33. Beleevers make not hast, Esay 28.1. that is, they hasten not to abtain by right or wrong, but expect the accomplishment of their lawfull desires in a lawfull way, but they doe hasten to keep Gods commands, Psal. 9.60. Acts. 2 41 & ought so to do. Acts .16. Thus briefly I have discovered how horribly these Scriptures are abused, and how groundlesse now worship is, if thou art hereby beni∣fitted praise God, and practice thy light. FINIS.
