The Epistle Dedicatory to His Excellence the Earle of ESSEX. MAy it please Your Excellence, to accept the affectio∣nated tender of your humble servant, for why your Noble and Iuditious Honor hath still been held a Patron of the Muses, a Lover of Arts, and Art∣like Siences, and all good Arts ingenious man attaines to; Let not me then dispaire, though the first dip of my weak forward Pen ascend unto so high a Dedication, I gently crave it might not meet refection, because it is my love, if so, it would quite kill my hopes prepared journey, and that sacred Mount I now am labouring up, fall from't, and perish, and made a scorne unto the Law∣rell tree, in my desire to touch it, but noble Nature mixt with gentill Spi∣rits, ascends like Mirrh unto the saving Heavens, and gives the same de∣sire to you on earth, from whose favours warmth, I hope my spring flourish, and these few mixt Poems here in Prose and Verse, he mildly sensured; and my obedient Service, with my love thought free from flattery, to whose Noble and Iuditeous sensure I recommend them unto Your Excellencies view. And desire to be found, Your Excellencies most humble Servant, William Cooke.
The true description of a Noble Generall: In Prose and Verse. A Noble Generall, by the generall assent of the high voice of great Authority, being handed to the Piramide of Honour, over whose top the golden Truucheon, and the Verdant Wreath, his worthinesse as worthily receives, should be just such a man as hath it: In which discretion shewed her Ma∣ster-piece in calling such a Pillar of the State to their securer and more State supportance, for as the lightning cleeres the troubled Aire, when hot contagion mixeth amongst the Clouds, and gives the Earth a healthier tem∣perature: so choosing of a man whose noble minde in all his actions, was his Names expressor, The peoples loves, in whose hearts hee was wrapt in, chose themselves forth to be his followers, forsooke their wives, their children and their sttates, And when his Drummes beat up old Englands March, and waving Ensignes cut the fleeting Aire, Their Airey spirits back't their mettled steeds. whose hot disdainfull pride champing their burnish't bits, foame snow'd the earth, as scorning it should bare them: So diligence still waits upon love, And as a Generall in all his state, the very Pageant of Collosius warre, being heavens great man, should so be heavens good man, as questionlesse he is that weares this charge, for when Mars calls him to his maled throne, and with the Plumes of honour crownes his head, acquaints him with his whole artillery, shewes him the rules and husbandrie of Warre, brings him through all the cunnng la∣borinthes, tells him his Statutes, Lawes, Edicts and Councells: with it the Christians Conscience, and the care, the golden Plummets of the hearts even ballence, where pure integrity from hearts corrupt, reignes Monarch of the whole Celestiall frame, shaping his life so cleane, so white so good, that he de∣fies all stratagems against him, though hell should for him make a Machivill, whose own hot braine contains the quintiscence of all that ever from that man∣ion leapt: Yet the just Souldier spurnes at him, and that; were all the dangers from the Corners brought, wrap'd up in Whirl-windes, on an Earth quake mounted, and every danger usher'd with new death, according to the nature of each terrour? yet all this to the Noble Martialist, makes not feares breath so
strong to shake the smallest haire upon his head, There is the confidence of honesty, whose Hoaste reignes under his command, with love: And where his love leads on with good discretion, not justled by vaine glory, thorough the applause of wide-mouth'd rumor, popularity but knows true Martial distance to an Inch, how to bring on with courage and with care, And with the same care to bring oft againe, to husband lives to cheri, and repaire the ruines that red warre makes breaches thorough: not he that in a tempest hurries men like vio∣lent thunder, bursting through the Clowdes to set his Souldiers at a doubtful stake, and at one cast to winne or loose the set to fill the fields with groanes of dying men, and Citie Hospitalls with halting Criples, making their deathes and maymes his recreation, and with hosterities over-ruling sway, comand ther Loves obedience, thoough fear to say He this and that did by his Valour, his fame like terrour shouting through the eares of those that gives the names of Enemies, such Souldiers are, and men of great esteem and praise, though there be difference in equality: Yet where sweet mildnesse swayes it is the best, and shewes him most a Gentleman, to whose known deserts, brave worthy Sir, in all things (sance flattery) I give you but your due. The same in Verse. WHo mount will to the top of Golden honour, And there display bright fame, and fortunes banner, Must be discreet, and all his Actions such Envie may tremble his fair Name to touch: 'Tis not to say I have been here and there, In Holland' gainst the Spaniard or else-where; Where testimonie of his valours soe, Hee took a Towne, yet no re strook a blowe. How he was shot in scaling such a Fort. And how came off, making his paine his sport; How hee was threatned by the States to be At least an Ensigne for his Chevalrie Such guilded motes, but dance in Souldiers beames, Whose praise is like a bubble full of Dreames, To this truthes historie of man saith so, They weare the name of Souldier but, for showe, But shaddowes banish, for I now discry The rising of the Sunne, whose glories high
There needs no more addition then thy Name To get ovr loves, yet thou hast gotten fame, With it a Title of High Excellence, Which doth so well become thee in my sense, That it is farre more honour'd in thy wearing, Then is thy goodnesse by the Titles bearing: Great Sonne of Warre and Love, put on thy Bayes, Expell Romes Idolls, bring home Haltian dayes, That thy bright Fame in this Exchange of Warre. May ESSEX Name convert into a Starre, And may it to those  thee not appeare A Meteor to or'e-whelme their hearts with feare, By goodnesse I hate flattery, and yet my love is so, I must run thus whether I will or no; I should with Injury abuse thy Worth, Giving thy High deserts abortive birth, If I not write my thoughts, For if all that loves thee could or would thus doe, What volumnes could be dedicate to You: If it were otherwise Great Sir, bee't knowne, People have hearts that would not thus be showne, For two Conditions guides thee, popular state, Either pure Love, or else deteste hate. Bigg swells the sailes where the strong gale blowes full, But a still silence where affections dull; Honour winnes Fame, either for state or warres, But he most merrits venters his for scarres. Boeatus spread not forth her brazen wing. Frther then fame, the name of Souldier sing, Which Name the Tented field bestowes on Thee; The Gule dipt warre: and brave Artillery: The Fife the Drum and shrill Bellonaes noate Of warre (great Captaine hath given thee the vote, The Name thy Father had survives in thee, His Love, His Vertue is thy Legasie.
The Description of Envie. ENVIE, a monster who leapt out of Hell, being a brother of the deadly seven, can no contentment finde upon the earth, for still his agony in∣creaseth here so that even the locall pit from whence he up ascended, af∣fords him not worse torment then the earth, the hissing consort of his Snake∣weath'd head, shewes him a brother to fell Medusa, who as his charmed po∣wer, turnes into astone and on the sudden freezeth flesh and blood into the hardnesse of a Statue, so would he blast and sting to death all living goodnesse, that he knowes or heares of: for if a nature▪ sweet as the perfume, the heaven∣ly spring breathes ore the Bryery budds give e sunke eyes of Envie such a visite, how he flings scorching lightning after it, That had his Power entranoe to his will, he would melt the very marrow thorow the bone, so thicke his forkt Artillery shes after it, Let vertue whiter then the Planners path, meeke as the Dove and harmlesse as the sleepe of tender Babes, though all the graces hung like stately lemmes to deek the out-side of this edifice, and the three steps un∣to eternity, the outward signe Wart, for the parties knowing, yet what would this availe, o ever sweeten bitter envie, gaul, but straight he shootes reproa∣ches after them, armes, hearts and hands against them like his own, spotting with infamy that silver roabe, that wore a tincture like the morning light, before Aurora blush'd at Tytans rising springs beautie, with the mixture of those flo∣wers that ever strove for superioriy, the spreading Lillie, and the blooming Rose yet this foul Canker, both ilhew'd and scented, would suck the juice of Hemlock from the weeds, mixt with the rancour of her own foul lungs, from her more foul togue to blast perfection, wearing her eyes so fiery blood-shed with her indignation, that where she not prevailes, she turnes that hatred on her hatefull self, and feeds upon her own detested Name, Envie, who from the breaking of the worlds first day, brought her Consumption even along with her, still bringing with it, till time make his stop, and all destroying death meet her destruction. Let honour, whose ever grafted flock sprung forth such branches, be possest with Natures whole enrease assisted with the adition of rich Arts be his Helme, steered by the highest hand, and all his Actions leavyed by a line squar'd out of the hand of equity, stand he betwixt the Compasses two points, supported by the Gospel and the Law, were his deserts by highest powers com∣peelld to advance up to the Alpes of State, plum'd Honour, were he Commander of more lives then hairs, and had of every life a care, as great as the preserving of those blood-branch'd Veines, that issue from the crimson Conduit-head, the bodies fountaine, where the thoughts sit crownd, even his own heart, yet Envie would spit at him, and muster up ill thoughts to fight against him, contempts,
eproaches, infamies and scornes, Though goodnesse dwelleth at the signe of greatnesse, and heavens white finger point him out a man of Saint-like disposi∣ion and of sufferance, a smiler on his injuries with forgivenesse, whose inward oncave is a school of pitty, the Master good Discretion, and his hands both word and Ballance swayes, Justice with equity, yet all this with his whole ife guard of heart-loving friends, such as would emptey all their veines dry rom him, and call new life to asist tem (had they power) can make no bull∣worke to keep Envie out, but he will call his Councell up against him. the wift-wing'd malice arm'd with lasting hate, with all the Synod of Anatomies whose Skellitons of skin-o're-covering bones can weare no flesh, but bloods, heir nourishment. Authority and power his hate pursues, grinnes at the pompe and state of Potent Kings, derides all Scepters, Rule or Covernment, and most pene belcheth where there is least cause, yet seldome dares this Caniball be seen, hees of so base a coward disposition, but lurkes in corners▪ where he may obscur'd reigne over his disturbed self alone Monarch of fretts, of self-devour∣ing hate, if factions seede he sowes, brings forth no fruit, so that of all envies the poorest, and paies himself worst wages, is basest of all evills, and most de∣spised by goodnesse. The same in Verse. SVVell Envie till thou burst: a good mans fence Dare stand thy power and Hell with Innosence, I sit above thy Ire, let all thy spleene Poson thy arrows, make thy point so keene, That fortitude nor Fates fell hand, Can ward or Check the power of thy command. What pittie Lewdnesse showes thy hell-borne minde, To be so verie brainelesly inclinde, To warre against thy self: for wise men knowes. Thou often strikst, but oftner feelst the blowes. Thou art ever poore ever unfortunate, Nay, be it then, when thou triumphst in state, Having thy ends: Here's that the world will say, Twas Envie did it, give the dogg his day. Thou darst not look the bould man in the face, But Sculk in corners with thy actions base, And there in secret fight against his Name; Wounding his credit, and his worth defame
Where still the Noble is, thy base aspect Foames out thy venome, and doth hate direct To poyson the cleer spring, for Envie still Forsakes the valleyes, and climbes up the hill; Shrubs he regards not, tis the Cedar tree, Heel either shake, or scorch with infamis: The low grounds lie secure, the mountain top, The stormy clowdes doth up in tempest wrap, Hell is all envie, yet nor them nor thee, With all their fiery Lgions can blast thee. Fix Pelion and Ossa, on whose high top, Once more let envie into hell down drop, Blow him about in windes, or let blue fire; Pay Envie for his envie, Hells hot fire Take him from amongst us, for tis hee With Englands blood, writ Englands tragedy; Sinke him for ever to the depth of Bisse, For robbing us of our firme peacefull blisse; O once againe may the faire Olive tree, The Parliament untte vith Majestie: His Majestie with them, that broyles may cease, And welcome England to her former Peace; That Romes high Babell, with her triple Crown, May fall to raise the Protestants renown, That envie ever may forsake this Glime, And each man live under his fuitfull Vine. INIS.
