THE TIMES DISSECTED. OR, A LEARNED DICOVRSE Of Severall OCCVRRENCES Very worthy of SPECIALL OBSERVATION, To deter evill men, and in∣courage good. Printed in the yeare, 1642.
THE TIMES. EVROPE afflicted, mournes, an Age it may be accounted when ruine is from time to time; but great Brittaine, as the last in the world in re∣servation of punishment, is assailed with an Inundation of troubles; a Country found no danger, therefore sought no remedy, as a Province, when a Comet hath no relation to it, feares not; this caused her make no use of others harmes, as wisedome should have done, when a neighbours house is on fire: there∣fore either because God chasteneth more the faults of us hee loveth, a signe of good will, or because he punisheth our er∣rors, he is most obliged to pay with revenge; the surce of which Malady, if we take the Elevation from the past, inward or outward causes proceed: First, from our sinnes, which did cast a Epidemicall Lethargy of unthankefulnesse for mer∣cies received, the greatest sicknesse, a conceit of health when most in danger. The second, because there was not heretofore a perfect union twixt England and Scotland, in∣corporting both into one body and minde, if possible it might have beene; a reason hath caused Portugall and Cata∣lonia to revolt from the King of Spaine, and Transilvania, Va∣lachia, and Moldavia, under Vayvodes,
and not Bashaes, easily elapsed to disobedience; in these turbulent, and lachrymable times enter the yeare 1639. when two Armies in hostile manner oppose each other, but cured with a pacification, the ulcer not killed, it revived the yeare 1640. inveoming the mindes of both Kingdomes, as in a hecticke, or rather a bur∣ning feaver, with much corrupt matter ascendng: caused a new Parocisme to devour the substance of the King and peo∣ple, which was prognosticated by divine anger threatned by the Ministers, the Church conspurgated with errors, the Common-wealth loaded with projects, Monopolies, and Impositions, a Tyrannical Government propounded and assai∣ed, Parliamentary wayes denied, the Road, and Highway to justice, the petitions of the people not heard, nor answe∣red, all which chalked out ruine: whereupon finding their lawfull desires made vaine, they doe not so willingly obey the soveraignes edicts and commands, finding the Diadem led with pernitious councells, so that the Feaver of disobedience growing high, the Scots invaded, our souldiers had no will to fight, the subjects no desire to pay to such a warre, where∣by the precepts of the head were of no availe over purse and spirit to oppose such invasion, this distemper caused the King summon the Peerary to Yorke to consult and play Physitians to cure the present malady, with a purpose King and Lords, might doe all things without the Commons; but they out of a sincere minde petitioned his Majesty for a Parliament, be∣cause they could not accomplish the businesse without com∣mon consent, to set in joynt the factions and fractions of the Kingdome, which appeared by the miserable condition, the face of the Common-wealth was beheld withall, now bet∣ter by a thousand degrees (thankes be given to God) for ma∣ny wrinckles are worne away, and I hope it will come to be in good health, since the Parliament cannot be dissolved till all things desired be accomplished, of which the Trieuniall Parliament will be the touchstone to try the truth. But fin∣ding the Episcopall government, caused divers distempers in the State by introducing new innovations in the Church, as Altars removed for adoration, a new unlawfull oath imposed
by the Canons, and not confirmed by the Parliament, with∣out which it was of no validity. Secondly, Service said at the Altar, that the greater part of the people could not heare, and the Pontificall Divines teaching and preaching in bookes, and sermons, that the King might invade our liberties; this caused a research of the Episcopall power, by whose autho∣rity this poyson was infused, that a Bill issued from the Com∣mons to the Lords, and passed their House, in all but one point, which was putting out of the House; but since some pride from the Bishops and Petitions from some parts of the Kingdome, finding Church and republike impostumated, the House of Commons hath committed a Bil for the eradicating of roote and branch. (Noble Friend) to satisfie the appetite of your desires, I will tell you the various opinions of men, some there are haters of Reformation, and pure formes, like those that live in corrupt aire, cannot breath in pure, or used to brackish water, delight not in sweet fountaines; others there are who adhere to Rome, and would have that forme of Church, which but by a paire of sheeres devides from that Hierarchy, that they might easily in that path goe to the An∣tichristian way, which if it were hedged up, had no gap to Babylonian errors, for they found none but the Bishops, and their followers brought in the Arminian and Socinian errors, the bridges for Popery. Some they say there are who have sucked in errors at the Vniversity by reading Papisticall bookes, admitted by the Bishops, and allowed by the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, and are so infected in judgement, that they had need of Spectacles to discerne the truth, or of eye salve to cure and cleere their judgements. Likewise others affirme many great Ladies, because they are esteemed, and flattered of Bishops, would have them in their Pontificalibus, some Protestants whose knowledge is not great, would have them without other reason giving them, because they have beene bred in that way: And further, the Papists whose Re∣ligion for the most part is in reverence and devotion, are mightily for them, because by that Hierarchy, they confirme their opinions in Popery, as an antiquity derived from
Popish Bishops, who first instituted, inducted, and confirmed them in the beginning of Queene Elizabeths time, so that all our Pontificall Clergy derive the pedegrees of their rites and ceremonies from Rome, so that if they are not in the first in∣stitution, there may be a retrogradation to Rome by the same steps, as in a maze goe backe againe the way they came in. The politique sort finding the predominant constellation of their aime and pride are carried with other considerations, that Monarchy had better give a loose to Hierarchy; for there is nothing Aristocraticall but Parliaments, which consists of Lords Spirituall, Lords Temporall, and Commons, the three last are Aristocraticall: now if one of these three be dissol∣ved, the Monarchy wil shine cleerer, for that none can oppose the Supremacy of the King in great Britaine and Ireland, but the Bishops, who would, if they had occasion, draw the power to themselves from Rome and Peter, and disseize his Majesty; moreover some of the Lords Spirituall being Temporall Lords, it may be feared there may be Parliaments without the Temporall Peeres, for some of the Bishops are Tempo∣rall and Spirituall, so that it is possible that the Lords Tempo∣rall may be barred (which God forbid.) And further, it is ap∣parent the Commons shall passe nothing, because the Bishops will not, who sway the Lords House much with the Catho∣lique party and proxies, for this cause it were fit the Bishops were hindred of votes. Another Argument is, there is no reason they should take place of their benefactors, which they doe in the Lords House, which will be, if not excluded. The third reason, the Nobility and Gentry gave land, and were benefactors to Bishops estates, but the erection of Bi∣shops came from the Pope anciently, as appeares by many records, and therefore their erections being Papisticall, they may come to owe more service to the Pope then to the King, which I leave to the consideration of the Parliament. Now to declare the opinion of Lawyers not Catholicke, there have beene Parliaments say they without Bishops, E. 1. 24. a Parliament held. Excluso Clero. 7. R. 2. cap. 3. 7. R. 2. cap. 12. No Bishops, and many other Parliaments had
no Bishops, and therefore it is the opinion, of the best Law∣yers at this day, that they ought to be put out of the Lords House. Lastly, how many upright and sincere men have been put out by them, and silenced. Now let us touch the antiquity of Bishops, to see whether they have anciently medled with temporalities or no: From Christs time they were only Overseers of Churches in the Apostolicall function and superintendent Pastors of the Church, appointed so by the Holy Ghost, Acts 20 23 who by common consent did assemble together, in which for more orderly proceeding in their charges, they choose one a∣mongst them to be Moderator and President, this is he whom after the fathers called Bishop; but not meerely from Christ and the Apostles, for the name of all Elders, and Ministers in the beginning was Bishop, which after by the usuall lan∣guage of the fathers, was appropriated to the Presidentship of the Elders and Ministers, therefore it was Saint Cyprian reproved the Elders for receiving those who were fallen a∣way in time of Persecution; before the Bishop had advised of it with them and others, because they should make pub∣licke satisfaction; and therefore I conceive it an error, that they had not power given before in generall Synods, if any should returne to the faith to be restored in the interim to the Church, upon confession and penitency in the congregation before a Synod called, who otherwise might despaire in the meane time, or by ill counsell fall away, so that it is apparent that Bishops did deale in matters of the Church government by the counsell and consent of the Elders and no further; but it is observed, the Bishops in every succession and in every City caused all orders for to stand as the law, the Prophets, and our Lord did preach, as Hegesippus said, but how many an Apostolicall waies have they introduced contrary to the Scriptures, witnesse the reverence to Altars, kneeling at the Sacrament, and many more; as silencing Ministers for matters of conscience, for no authority hath power of the confcience but
God, and nothing bindes the conscience, semper & ad semper, but the decalogue, so that it was never in the primitive times heard that the Clergy medled with Temporall affaires, as they now doe, which superabundancy of power causeth such corruption, impurity of Religion, and hurt to the Commonwealth: therefore they seeke to crop their power, or that they may have no more then in the first institu∣tion, and manage affaires of Church with primitive temper, to the good of the Common-wealth and glory of God, and felicity of the Church, but they have commanded what they list without controule, & are so insolent as of late, Laud Arch-Bishop of Canterburies vices the more visible were by how much hee was more potent in power, and gracious in the Princes eye to perswade the sequestration of zealous and pi∣ous in the Church, and the Majesty to be aloofe off in matter of state, from Ministers able and sincere, or else to give the Soveraigne over to such as might lose his subjects hearts, and cause them fall into the Malady of disobedience, a thing incident to misguided governments, so he brought in inno∣vations into the Church, making her of a pure Virgin a very Strumpet. Ship, Coat, and Conduct money, and other sterne imposi∣tions he brought in, not according to abilities, but what the Iudges wickedly affirmed to be Law, constraining inferiours to be instruments in execution, for hope of advancement, or over awing them by feare; for acts that fill Princes coffers with unjust demands of money not due, are ever the ruine of the first founders: times are not bad, but the wicked that live therein make them so, who are the fathers of ill counsell as well as those who are the begetters of bad children, which seasons make the best Ministers oftentimes minister fuell to illegall and wicked desires of great men, wherein Kings themselves passe not blamelesse, who chuse not instruments by the ballance of merit, but with the sailes of will and pas∣sionate affection; for as their mindes are large in respect of potency, so their election is rather to satisfie their various humours then solid judgement, like those who looke for the Philosophers stone, and
finde out nothing but fine conceits not worthy the looking for. The Bishop alone manageth the State under the Diadem, chooseth his chiefe instrument Wentworth into office of best trust, and both together weave the web, whose woofe was the mislike of the people; flocks that love no fleaing the skin, can indure the shearing, this violent deporment bred a great distemper in the hearts of Scotland, and caused the English murmure, and draw to a defection or mutiny, but no power gotten by wickednesse of Ministers is durable, nor to such is any stability betwixt mediocrity and precipitation, which cause doubtfull and am∣biguous speeches of the Soveraigne, when the fault ought to be imposed on the Ministers: so dangerous are the wayes of Majesty, that the folly of great ones strive for ruine. Suppose those misconstructions the multitude have of the Diadem force Majesty to seeke advice and helpe from strangers, when he cannot purchase duty at home, what a lamentable consequence may follow, to invite an ancient enemy to the funerall obsequies of her liberties, the cure being worse then the disease? And such is our state now, that the House of Com∣mons are constrained to be helpers, a Theame most displea∣sing to Soveraignty, though in a distracted state a rule infalli∣ble; on Wentworth the affection of the Soveraigne was so placed, as his power was boundlesse in Ireland, and here un∣sufferable, though a Gentleman of transcendent parts, and of the highest ranke under the degree of Barony, yet of a swoulne ambition which no republike can indure, for all preferment pas∣seth by him, and all suits addresse to him, who finding so full a Moone of favour, thought he could not dye for Treason, the price of his life: surely I blame not a Prince for taking a repose∣full friend to participate his intimate thoughts, to temper the affaires of state, so as he infects not the effects of his prin∣cipality, nor sullieth his parentall respect to the subject, by hatred or Tyranny; but Strafford sicke of the Kings well governing, studied wayes of an arbitrary rule, thinking his high tyde of favor would never come to an ebbe of fortune, but she fooled him at last to the losse of all he held in this life most deare; Great must be the art of ambition to keepe
afloat the streame of a power, seeing sublimity changeth as the spoke of the wheele, or as the hand of the Diall, at the highest 12. comes to one, ee affected the honour and service of his Master with the ruine of the sub∣ject, beating downe competitors of the worthy Patriotship, and wrought by pride precipitation, when by humility hee might have had a good station, for he should have made it the operation of others, rather then any appetite of his owne to gormondize the property of subjects goods, and swallow their liberty, putting fetters on the Law, that nothing could be ac∣complished but what he and the Archbshop pleased. And last∣ly, they barre from the King alwaies to heare the groanes of his people, and wickednesse of their ministery. This fatall de∣port of both might have proved Tragicall to the Kingdome, where the ingredience of popular humour is mixed as well with armed forces not to be disbanded without great danger, as with a mighty Schismaticall party, as well Papists, Brownists, Anabaptists, people pleased to fish in troubled waters, and the malecontened Clergy, who have corrupted th pure foun∣taines rather then they will be depressed in power (it is to bee feared) may all act a busie part in this Tragicke story. In such designes Churchmen are never wanting to adde fuell to popular fires, for though they worke it not with the meanest, they ef∣fect it by head and chiefe-causing weaknesses in government, and oppression of people, for it is not the best doctrine a warre with subjects to advance their Hierarchy, no Bishop, no King. When the fist Church rose by fasting and praying, therefore they ought not so much teach us rules of loyalty, as to know our owne duties in difficult points of Rligion, nor ought they make the Soveraigne believe the Parliament only breath out thir passions in a time of liberty, and expresse the poverty of their Master to lessen his reputation abroad and credit at home, when then the State is so festred, it is a paine to fetch out the dead flesh without corasives which they are constrained to, to keepe it from gangrening, when that their whole aime next to religion is to looke into the Kings necessities, to discharge the Armies, take away the impeachments of the Common∣wealth, and provide for the royall sustentation
much weakned by bad Counsells, so that he may be potent at home, and glo∣rious abroad, beginning to set things in order when so great disorder hath chalked the way to amendment, for a mighty expence ever ends in the rapine and spoile of subjects: but now if it please the King to follow the counsell of Machiavill, doe as the time permits, and be not weary of the strict enquiry of the Parliament, he shall accomplish as full a Soveraignity as ever, and greater. This may cause the King with incomparable wisedome to suite himselfe to the necessity of the Time, and expect future good from those mean it so fervently, and act it so painefully. The King delivered of ill counsells, by this bles∣sed fortune, freed and obeyed, may begin to search the ground of the misery, why that vertue and fortune, which had setled and maintained so long his Ancestors in glory of Empire, seemes to be in a trance at this time, as if the Genious of the State had forsaken her, and found out (the way) the reason of this mis∣chiefe, namely a wastfull hand too quicke for the fortunes and persons of his people, the griping avarice of Ministers, lawlesse liberty of Martiall forces, uncivill actions of the Multitude, and affording too much care to greedy and unworthy Ministers, whose counsell was more subtill then solid, seeing moderation, reward and punishment, are the supporters of Crownes, and to be just of word is required of Subjects from Kings them∣selves, so shall he effect a wondrous change in the State, bring∣ing the three Kingdomes home with wonder to his devotion, and their obedience laying his foundation of government on religion, quietnesse and justice, so that peace and tranquility shall attend a long life though death be let in at last, and fashion to his successors a most royall paterne to follow from his expe∣rience, and authority to make him superior to Kings, and as he is the first King of his name in our Empire since the conquest, so shal he be most worthy to be stiled Britaines CHARLEMAINE, and be not only capable to governe these three Realmes, but the whole world, so that the wrongs of fortune sometimes make Princes more then their prosperity both wise and for∣tunate. FINIS.
