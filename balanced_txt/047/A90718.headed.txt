VVith som signal Remarks upon the Nativity of CHARLS the second, &c. LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1660.
A Letter sent from the City of Florence Written by a Great Counsellor there, touching the present Distempers of England, wherein Hee, with som of the Prime Statesmen in Florence passe their Judgements which is the only way to compose the said Distempers. My Honored, and most Endeared Patron. IT is no small diminution to my for∣mer happinesse that I have not re∣ceiv'd your commands any time these two months, which makes me lodg within me certain appre∣hensions of fear that som disaster might befall you in those new Distractions, there∣fore I pray be pleased to pull this thorn out of my thoughts as speedily as it may stand with your conveniency. We are not here so barren of Intelligence, but we have weekly advice of your present Confusi∣ons, and truly the severest sort of speculative per∣sons here who use to observe the method of Provi∣dence,
do not stick to say, that the hand of Heaven doth visibly stirr therein, and that those Distracti∣ons in Army, State, and City are apparent Judge∣ments from above, for if one revolve the Stories of former Times as I have done many (but you more) he will find that it hath bin allwayes an in∣evitable Fate which useth to hang over all popular Insurrections to end in confusion and disorders a∣mong the chief Actors themselfs at last; And we have had divers examples thereof here among us, which hath caus'd us to be so long in quietnesse and peace. But truly Sir, give me leave to tell you that your Nation hath lost much of their Repute abroad all the World over in statu quo nunc; Som do laugh at you; Others do scorn, and hate you; And som do pitty and comiserat you. They who laugh at you, think you are no better than Madmen having strange Magots in your brains bred out of the fat of so long wanton plenty, and peace. They who scorn and hate you, do it for your Sa∣crilege, your horrendous Sacrileges, the like whereof was never committed on Earth since Chri∣stianity had first a hole to put her in. They who pitty you are few, and We are of the nomber of Them, as well in the common sense of Humanity, as for the advantages, and improve∣ment of Wealth which this State hath receiv'd by your Trading at Ligorne, for that Town doth ac∣knowledge her prosperity, and that she is arrived
to this flourishing Estate of Riches, of Buildings and bravety by the correspondence she hath had this latter Age with England in point of Commerce, which yet we find doth insensibly impair evry day, and I believe you feel it more; Therefore out of the well-wishes, and tru affections we bear unto Eng∣land, som of the most serious, and sober'st Per∣sons of this place who are well season'd in the World, and have studied men under divers Climes, and convers'd also much with Heavenly Bodies, had lately a privat Junta, or meeting whereunto I was admitted for one, and two of us had bin in England where we receiv'd sundry free Civilities; Our main business was to discourse, and descant upon these sad confusions, & calamitous condition wherin England with the adjoyning Kingdoms are at present involv'd, and what might extricat Her out of this laberinth of Distractions, and reduce Her to a setled Goverment; Having long canvas'd the business, and banded arguments pro & con with much earnestness, all our opinions did concenter at last in this point, That there was no probable way under Heaven to settle a fast, and firm Go∣vernment among you, then for the Men that are now upon the Stage of power to make a speedy ap∣plication to their own King, their own Liege Lord and Soverain, whom God, and Nature hath put over them; Let them beat their brains, scrue up their witts, and put all the Policy they have upon the tenterhooks as farr as possibly they can, yet they will never be able to establish a durable standing Government otherwise, They do but
dance in a circle all this while, for the Goverment will turn at last to the same point it was before, viz. to Monarchy, and this King will be restored to his Royal Inheritances Maugre all the Cacodae∣mons of Hell: Our Astrologers here specially the famous Antonio Fiselli hath had notes to look into the horoscope of his Nativity, and what predicti∣ons hee hath made hitherto of him have prov'd tru to my knowledg, Hee now confidently averrs, with the concurrence of the rest, that the aspect of all the starrs, and conjunction of the Planetts much favour him the next two yeers; Nam Medium caeli in Geni∣tura Caroli secundi Regis Angliae juxta axiomata Astrolo∣giae Genethliacae dirigitur ad radios Sextiles Lunae Anno Dom. 1660. & significat accessum ad Dominium, For the Medium caeli in the Geniture of Charles the se∣cond according to the axiomes of Genethliacall A∣strology is directed to the Sextile rayes of the Moon and signifies an accesse to Dominion. Add herun∣to that a most lucky conjunction followes the same yeer, in the very Centre of the said Kings horo∣scope betwixt Jupiter & Sol in the month of September. When I was employed by this State in Paris not many yeers agoe, I had occasion to make my addresse to your young King, and when I observ'd his Physiognomy, and the Lineaments of his face, I seem'd to discern in it somthing extraordinary a∣bove vulgar countenances, & that he carried a Ma∣jesty in his very looks, and noting besides the good∣ly procerity, and constitution of his body he seem'd to be cut out for a King. Now, in point of extraction, and linage it can∣not
bee denied but he is one of the greatest born Princes that ever was in the world, for whereas his Gran-Father, and Father were allied only if you regard Forren Consanguinity, to the House of Den∣mark & the Guyses, this King bears in his veins not only that bloud, but also the blouds of all the great Princes of Christendom, being neerly linked to the House of Bourbon and France, to the House of Au∣stria, and consequently to the Emperour, and Spaine, as also to the Duke of Savoy, and our Gran-Duke: Moreover he is neerly allied to all the greatest Princes of Germany, as the Saxe, Brandenburg, Bava∣ria, the Palsgrave, & to the Duke of Lorain who de∣scends in the directest line from Charlemain; Add hereunto that the young Prince of Orenge, is his Nephew, and which is considerable hee is a pure Englishman born, whereas your two former Kings were Forreners. The Queen his mother is of as glo∣rious an extraction, which makes me admire the frontlesse impudence of som of your poor Pamphle∣tors who call her ever and anon the Little Queen notwithstanding that the world knowes Her to bee the Daughter of Henry the Great, and Queen of Great Britain, which Title and Character is indeli∣ble, and must die with Her. Hereunto may be adjoyn'd, that this young King is now mounted to the Meridian of his Age, and maturity of judgment to govern, and doubtlesse hee is like to make a rare Governour, having this ad∣vantage of all other Soverain Princes in the world to have been bredd up in the Schoole of Affliction so long, to have Travell'd so many strange Coun∣treys,
and observed the humours of so many Nations. But to come to the Cardinal point of our Com∣munication, after divers debates, & alterations how England might be brought to a stable condition of tranquility & perfect peace, to her former lustre, and glory, the final result of all, ended in this, that ther was no other imaginable means to do it then for you to make a timely and fitting humble address unto your own King, and without question it is in his power to grant you such an absolut pardon, such an abolition of all things pass'd, such a gracious Amnestia, such Royall concessions that may extend to the security of every person for the future that was engaged in these your revolutions, both touch∣ing his life and fortunes; Unlesse their guilt of conscience be such that like Cain or Judas they think their Sin is greater then can be forgiven them. Now the mode of your application to Him may avail much, for if you chopp Logique with him too farr, and stand upon Puntillios, and too rigid termes, if you shew your selfs full of feares, jealou∣sies, and distrusts it will intangle, and quite mart the businesse, for in a Soverain Prince ther must be an Implicit, unavoidable necessary trust repos'd by his peeple which all the Laws that mans brain can possibly invent cannot provide against; Therfore if you proceed in a frank, and confident tru English way you may work upon his affections more pow∣erfully, and overcome him sooner so, then by any outward Arms, This way will make such tender impressions upon him that he will grant more then you can possibly expect.
Som Forein Historians as the French Comines, and our Guicciardin do cry up the English Nation for u∣sing to love their King in a more intense degree then other peeple, and to regard his honor in a higher strain, to support which they have bin alwayes so ready, and cheerful both with their persons and purses; Ther is now a fair opportunity offer'd to rake up the embers of these old affections, and to recover the Reputation of tru Englishmen; Ther is no peeple but may somtimes stand in their own light, go astray, and err, for Error was one of the first frailties that were entayl'd upon Man (and his posterity) as soon as he was thrust out of Paradis; 'Tis a human thing to err, but to persevere in an error is diaboli∣cal; You shall do well and wisely to follow the ex∣ample of the Spanish Mule, who out of a kind of wantoness being gone out of the high beaten road into a by path, which led her to a dirty narrow lane full of pitts and holes, at last she came to the top of a huge hideous Rock where she could go no farther, for before her ther was inevitable destructi∣on, and the lane was so narrow that she could not turn her body back, therupon in this extremity she put one foot gently after another, and Crablike went backward untill she came again to the common road; This must be your course, by a gentle retrogra∣dation to come into the Kings high road again, and there is no question but He will meet you more than three parts of the way, If you do not, truly in our opinions you will precipitat your selfs down a Rock of inevitable destruction; For Heaven & Earth are conspir'd to restore Him, and though all the Spirits of the Air shold joyn with you, you shall not be able
to oppose it. I presume you are not ignorant how the two great Monarks of Spain and France (which may be said to be the main Poles wheron Europe doth move) have comprehended him within the private capitulations of peace, The Emperour hath promi∣sed to wed his quarrel, and there is no Prince or State in Christendom but wold gladly reach a frend∣ly hand to restore him, being depriv'd of his birth∣right, and his Royal indubitable Inheritance (as you your selfs confesse) for observing the fifth Com∣mandement, for obeying his Father and Mother; From which Birthright he may be said to have bin thrust out when he was in the state of Innocency, be∣ing but in a manner a Child, and very young then. Now touching your selfs I will not flatter you, but plainly tell you that you have not one frend any where beyond the Seas, nay your great Confede∣rate the Swed (as I had good intelligence) could upbraid one of your Ambassadors that are now there, that He had not washed his hands clean since they had bin embrued in his Princ's bloud. The time that I sojourn'd in England I was curi∣ous to read your Annals, and to make som inspecti∣ons into your Laws, and Method of Government, as also into the Genius of the peeple, and I find there is no species of Government that suits better with the nature of the Inhabitants, the quality of the Clime, and relates more directly to the civil consti∣tutions, Laws, and Customs of the Land then Mo∣narchal; The Ile of Great Britain hath bin allways a Royal Iland from her very Creation, from her Infancy, she may be said to have worn a Crown in her Cradle, and although she had four or five Revo∣lutions
and changes of Masters, yet she still continued Royal, whereunto alludes a saying that I observ'd in your old Records, Britannia ab initio mundi semper fuit Regia, & Regimen Illius simile illi caelorum: Great Britain hath bin from the beginning of the World Royal, and her Government like that of the Heavens. Therfore, all these premises being weighed in the balance of tru judgment you shall do well, and wisely to recollect your selfs, and call in your hopeful young King, whose Title your consciences do acknowledg to be unquestionable, otherwise it is not only improbable but impossible for England to be Herself again, and to be settled in any stable Government which may reach to posterity; you may wind up your wits as high as you can, you may consult with your first, second, and third thoughts, but you will never be able to settle a fix'd Goverment, you will be still at a losse, your Deputies will be like a skeyn of ravell'd threed, you will be in a laberinth of confusions, and the end of one, will be still the beginning of another. To conclude, the current & concurrent opinion of all Ministers of State here both Forren and Florentine is, that if you do not make a timely application to your King, you will have all the Princes of Christendome about your ears, and what a sad calamitous Country, what an Akeldama will England be then? Therfore if ther be a tru patriot, and publick soul amongst you, if ther be ever any drops of tru English bloud running in your veins, or the least spark of national fire & affections glowing in your bosomes toward your own dear Country, pre∣vent these imminent dangers, and invite your King by discreet and moderat proposals; The gallant Samnit General could tell the Romans who had over power'd them, that if they gave them easy and gentle capitula∣tions they wold perform them, but if they wold tye
them to too high and strict terms, they wold observe them no longer then they cold have opportunity to break them. Touching the affairs of Italy, we are like to have a general blessed peace this side the Alpes, and Lombardy who hath bin so pittifully harass'd a long time, and hath had her face so often scratch'd, is in a fair way to recover her former beuty; Signor Giovanni Palavicino, and D. Lorenzo Minuccio convey their most affectionat respects unto you, and so doth Your Entire, and Faithful Servant. F. P. Florence this 12th, of Octob. 1659. FINIS.
