Orthodox State-Queries, Presented to all those who retain any Sparks of their ANCIENT LOYALTY. Gentlemen, WE presume again to kiss your hands, according to our promise; and although (like the Fashion-Mongers of the times) we have put on a different garb; we hope the Crime is venial, for that we thought it convenient, since our present Subject is grave and weighty, (though but slightly handled) not to appear in our Fanatique Dress. LEt every rational man that is not blinded with ignorance, or carried away by self-interest, in plain English, that is not branded with the Title of Fool or Knave, consider, whether (as the case now stands) these, or the like Queries may not very fitly be propounded. 1 Whether the generality of the people of England are not experimentally sen∣sible of their great folly and madness, in opposing their lawful King, either direct∣ly, in their own persons, or indirectly, by any way aiding or abetting his enemies: And whether their intrenching upon his Prerogatives, were not an inrode to the throwing down the hedge of their own proper Rights, Priviledges, and Freedoms? 2 Whether the Author of the Ʋtopian Commonwealth, stiled the Rota, may not be thought to have a rotation in his Pericranium; and whether it be not probable that his wit is wasting, and may be trussed up in an Egg-shell, since his books do pass but for waste paper? 3 Whether it be not an act of great imprudence, novelty, and innovation in a∣ny, to endeavour the introduction of a strange Government in these Nations, con∣trary to the Genius and complexion of the people; and whether Gen. Monk can do any thing more pleasing to God, and more acceptable to his Country, then to restore unto it its antient Monarchical Government, being to be preferred before all others, and that which is not only exercised by God himself, but (as Natura∣lists observe) by almost all the creatures? 4 Whether since Monarchy is generally concluded to be the best of Govern∣ments, the English Monarchy may not challenge a precedency before all others, Chri∣stian or Heathen, sith its power is not absolute in all cases, but admits of a Parlia∣ment consisting of Peers and Commons, whereof the King is the Head, by which Parliament all grievances whatsoever are redressed and amended, whether relating to Prince or people; and all things necessary to the mutual support of the King, Peers, and Commonalty provided? A most excellent constitution of three Estates, the second being equally concerned in both the other, and in prudence as well as Justice, obliged to defend the Dignities and Prerogatives of the first, with the pri∣viledges and Freedomes of the third. 5 Whether any reasonable man can expect that these Nations can be established in a condition of peace and happiness, until they be settled upon their old Basis a∣gain, which is the Good Old Cause indeed, every honest Christian, and true Son of them, ought earnestly to pray and contend for. 6 Whether this present Parliament, notwithstanding the readmission of the Members secluded in 48. in case they do not act in order to a speedy bringing in of their lawful exiled King, may not as fitly be called a Rump, (though of a larger size) as the former, since they are but the lower parts, the upper part of the body, together with the head, being still wanting? And whether if they do not be∣gin, where they left off, in receiving the Son, according to their Articles with the Father, at the Isle of Wight (being the most probable way of restoring these almost ruined Nations to their pristine flourishing condition) they do not stigma∣tize themselves with all those indelible marks of Infamy, Injustice, and oppression, which Mr. Prynne (a Member of them) hath so manifestly by the Laws of God, Nature, and the Land, proved the little Rump to be highly guilty of? 7 Whether it be consistent with Religion, Equity, or common reason, that the Free-born people of England, &c. should submit to a new kind of Government, by way of a Commonwealth, or otherwise, (being not only against the grain of their affections, but also of their apprehensions) meerly to support the unjust interests of some particular men in the three Nations, who have advanc'd them∣selves by the ruines of our Church and Crown; and in case these Purchasers (con∣sidering their fat penniworths) should be compelled to a restitution of their unlaw∣ful and sacrilegious possessions, it be not more then an even lay, they would prove no loosers? 8 Whether Charles Stuart, since it hath pleased God to lead him through a series of such various kinds of providences, and to indue him with a spirit of admired moderation on the one hand, as well as continual patience on the other, be not in great reason to be judged as fit a person (of his age) to sway a Scepter, as any Prince in Christendome? 9 Whether the foresaid Charles be not (as was his Father before him) the firm∣est Adherer to the true Protestant Religion in the world, who (notwithstanding the many and great temptations to Popery, proceeding from his adverse fortune, the malice of his enemies, the alluring promises of several Catholique Princes, toge∣ther with his Holiness of Rome, to furnish him with men and moneys to regain his Kingdomes) continues fixt and immoveable to his first principles and profession, wherein he was educated from his Infancy? 10 Whether since (as Mr. Prynne evidently demonstrates) all our divisions and distractions have been chiefly fomented by Popish Emissaries and Jesuites, who tri∣umphed at the beheading and horrid murder of the late King, concluding that then their work was done, he being the Defender of our Faith, and under God, the Keeper and Preserver of his holy Vineyard, the Church, there can any way be found out by the wit of man so expedient for the healing up of our breaches, both in Church and State, and the restoring of unity, peace, and order amongst us, as the establishment of his Son upon his Throne? 11 Whether the trading of the City of London were ever at a lower ebbe (since the memory of man) then it is at this day; and whether it be not most just with God to inflict upon her those lamentable Judgements of Sword and Famine, who was the greatest cause of all these sad calamities that befel these Nations in the late Wars, and whose hands were deeply imbrued in Her Soveraigns blood, until such time as she hath been truly humbled for these hainous crimes, and shall to Her utmost ability recompence her wrongs and Rebellion against Her Martyred King, by Her beneficence to his whole Posterity, and Her most strennuous endea∣vour to enthrone him that ('tis not to be doubted) in Gods due time must and will be his Successor? 12 Whether it be not a duty incumbent upon every true Christian that desires the glory of God, and the peace and prosperity of the three Nations, to offer up daily Sacrifices of Prayer to the Almighty, that he would be pleased to bless King Charles, to settle him upon his Throne, to make him a Nursing Father to our de∣plorable and almost ruined Church, and to put an end to these dismal dayes of Blood, Rapine, and Oppression; which will never be, untill that happy and long-wisht-for time come, when all Free-born honest hearts shall throw up their hats in∣to the ayr with loud acclamations, and rend the very Skies with the noyse of God save the King. Printed for Philo-Basileuticus Verax.
