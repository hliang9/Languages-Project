¶Erasmus Roterdame sendeth gretyng to the reuerende father in Christ (and lorde) the lorde Paule Uolzius / the moste religyous abbot of the monastery the whiche is comenly called Hughes courte. ALl be it moste vertuous fa∣ther that the lytle booke / to the whiche I haue gy∣uen this name  En∣chiridion militis christiani / whiche many a day a go I made for my selfe only / and for a certayne frende of myne beyng vtterly vnlerned / hath begon to mistyke and displease me the lesse / for as moche as I do se that it is alowed of you and other vertuous and lerned men suche as you be / of whome (as ye are in dede endued with godly ler∣nynge / and also with lerned godlynesse) I knowe nothynge to be approued / but
that whiche is bothe holy and also clerk∣ly: yet it hath begon well nyghe also to pleas & lyke me now / whan I se it (after that it hath ben so often tymes printed) yet styll to be desyred and greatly called for / as if it were a newe werke made of late: if so be ye printers do not lye to flat∣ter me withall. But agayne there is an other thyng whiche often tymes greueth me in my mynde / that a certayne wel ler∣ned frende of myne longe a go sayd / very properly and sharply checkynge me / that there was more holynesse sene in the ly∣tell booke than in the hole authoure and maker therof. In dede he spake these wor¦des in his iestyng bourdyngly / but wolde to god he had not spoken so trewly as he bourded bytterly. And that greueth me so mo he more bycause ye same thyng hath chaunsed to come lykewyse to passe in hym / for the chaungyng of whose ma∣ners principally I toke vpon me this la∣bour and trauayle / for he also not onely hath not withdrawen hym selfe from the courte / but is dayly moch deper drowned therin than he was afore tyme / for what good purpose I can not tel / but as he cō∣fesseth hym selfe with moche great myse∣ry.Trouble or aduersyte cor∣recteth some. And yet for all that I do not greatly pety my frende / bycause that peraduēture
aduersyte of fortune may teche hym ones to repent hym selfe / and to amende / seyng that he wolde not folow and do after my counsayle and admonytions. And veryly thoughe I / enforsynge me to the same thyng and purpose / haue ben turned and tossed with so many chaunces and tem∣pestes / that Ulixes a man lyuyng euer in trouble (which Homer speketh of) myght be coūted in comparyson to me euen Po∣lycratesFortunate Polycrates. / whiche euer lyued in prosperyte without any maner trouble. I do not vt∣terly repente me of my labour / seynge it hath moued and prouoked so many vnto the study of godly vertue: nor I my selfe am not vtterly to be blamed and rebuked although my lyuynge be not in all poyn∣tes agreynge to myn owne preceptes and coūsayles. It is some parte of godlynesse whan one with al his herte desyreth and is wyllyng to be made good & vertuous: nor suche a mynde so well intendynge I suppose is not to be caste away / although his purpose be not euer luckely perfour∣med. To this we ought to endeuoyre our selfe all our lyfe longe / and no doute but by the reason that we so often tymes shal attempt it / ones at the laste we shall at∣tayne it. Also he hath dispatched a good pece of a doutfull iourney whiche hath
lerned wel of the iourney the way. Ther∣fore am I nothing moued with y• mockes of certayne psons which dispyse this lytle boke / as nothing erudite & clerkly / sayeng that it myght haue ben made of a chylde that lerneth his A / b / c / bycause it entrea∣teth nothynge of Dunces questyons: as though nothyng without those coude be done wih lernynge. I do not care if it be not so quick / so it be godly: let it not make them instructe & redy to disputacyons in scholes / so that it make them apte to kepe Christes peace. Let it not be profytable or helpyng for y• disputacyon in diuynite / so it make for a diuyne lyfe. For what good shulde it do to entreate of that thyng that euery man entremedleth with? who hath not in handlyng questions of diuynite / or what  do all our swarmes of schole men? There be almost as many cōmenta¦ryes vpon y• mayster of the sentence as be names of diuynes. There is neyther me∣sure nor nombre of summularies / whiche after the maner of potycaries myngle of∣ten tymes sondry thynges togyther / and make of olde thyng{is} newe / of newe thyn∣ges olde / of one thynge many / of many thynges one. Howe can it be that these great volumes instructe vs to lyue well and after a christen maner / whiche a man
in all his lyfe can not haue layser ones to loke ouer. In lyke maner as if a phisycien shulde prescribe vnto him that lyeth sicke in parell of deth to rede Iacobus de par∣tibus / or suche other huge volumes / say∣eng that there he shuld fynde remedy for his disase: but in the meane tyme the pa∣cyent dyeth / wantynge presente remedy wherwith he myght be holpen. In suche a fugytyue lyfe it is necessary to haue a redy medycyne at the hande. Howe ma∣ny volumes haue they made of restytuci∣on / of confessyon / of sclaunder / and other thynges innumerable? And though they boulte and serche out by pecemeale euery thyng by it selfe / & so diffyne euery thyng as if they mistrusted all other mens wyt∣tes / ye as though they mistrusted y• good∣nesse & mercy of god / whyles they do pre∣scribe how he ought to punish & reward euery facte eyther good or bad: yet they agre not amongest thē selues / nor yet som¦tym{is} do open the thyng playnly / if a man wolde loke nere vpon it / so moche dyuer∣syte bothe of wyttes and circumstaunces is there. Moreouer although it were so that they had determyned all thyng{is} wel and trewly / yet besydes this that they handle and treate of these thynges after a barbarous and vnpleasaunt fassyon /
there is not one amongest a thousande that can haue any layser to rede ouer these volumes:The great volumes. Or who is able to beare aboute with hym Secundam secunde / the werke of saynte Thomas? And yet there is no man but he ought to vse a good lyfe / to the whiche Christ wolde that the waye shulde be playne and open for euery man / and that not by inexplicable crok{is} of dis∣putations / not able to be resolued / but by a trewe and a sincere faythe & charyte not fayned / whom hope doth folowe whiche is neuer asshamed.The theology appertayneth to fewe men / but the salua∣cion appertay¦eth to all. And fynally lette the great doctours / whiche muste nedes be but fewe in comparyson to al other men / study & besy them selfe in those great vo∣lumes. And yet neuer the lesse the vnler∣ned and rude multytude whiche Christe dyed foght to be prouyded for: and he hath taught a great porcyon of christyan vertue whiche hath inflamed men vnto the loue therof. The wyse kynge whan he dyd teache his sonne trewe wysdome / toke moche more payne in exhorting hym thervnto than in teachyng hym / as who shulde say that to loue wysdom were in a maner to haue attayned it.Those be no∣ that of pur¦pose make the  which they  It is a great shame and rebuke bothe for lawyers and phisycions that they haue of a sette pur∣pose / and for the nones / made their arte
and science full of diffyculty / and harde to be attayned or come by / to thentent that bothe their gaynes and auaūtage myght be the more plentyfull / & their glory and prayse amonge the vnlerned people the greater: but it is a moche more shamefull thyng to do the same in the philosophy of Christ: But rather cōtrary wise we ought to endeuer our selues with al our streng∣thes to make it so easy as can be / & playn to euery man. Nor let not this be our stu∣dy to apere lerned our selues / but to alure very many to a christen mans lyfe.The warr agaynst the turkes. Pre∣paracyon and ordynaunce is made nowe for warre to be made agaynst the turkes / whiche for what so euer purpose it is be∣gon / we ought to praye not that it maye turne to y• profyte of a fewe certayne per∣sons / but that it may be to y• men & ge∣nerall {pro}fyte of all men. But what thinke you shulde come of it / if to suche of them as shall be ouercomen (for I do not sup∣pose y• they shall all be kylled with wea∣pons) we shall lay the werkes of Occam / Durandus / Duns / Gabriell / Aluaros / or any such schole men / for thentent to bring thē in mynde to take Christes professyon vpon them? what shall they ymagyn and thynke in their myndes (for surely euyn they / though they be naught els / are men
and haue wyt & reasone) whan they shall here those thorny & combrous inextricable subtyll ymagynacions of instātes / of for∣malytes / of quiddites / of relacion: namely whan they shall se these great doctours & teachers of religyon & holynesse so farre disagreyng / and of so sondry opinyons a∣mongeThe discorde amonge . them selfe y• often tymes they dis∣pute & reason so longe one with another / vntyll they chaūge colour & be pale / and reuyle one another spytting eche at other and fynally dealynge buffettes & blowes eche to other, whan they shall se y• blacke freres fyght & skolde for their Thomas / & than the gray freres matched with them / defendyng on y• other partye their subtyle and feruēt hote doctours / which they call seaphicos / some spekyng as reals / some as nomis. whan they shall also se the thyng to be ofso gret diffyculte y• they can neuer discusse suffyciētly with what wor∣des they may speke of Christ: as though one dyd deale or had to do with a way∣warde spyrit whiche he had reysed vp vn∣to his owne distructyon / if he dyd fayle neuer so lytle in the prescript word{is} of cō∣uryng / & not rather with our moste mer∣cyfull sauyour / whiche desyreth nothyng els of vs but a pure lyfe and a symple. I beseche the for the loue of god shew m
what shal we bring aboute with all these reckenyng{is} / specially if our maners & our lyfe be lyke to y• proude doctryne and ler∣nyng?The lyfe vsed amōgest chri∣sten people. and if they shall se & well perceyue our ambycion & desyrousnesse of honoure by our gorgyousnesse / more thā euer any tyrāt dyd vse: our auaryce & couetousnesse by our bribyng & pollyng / our lecherous∣nesse by y• defyling of maydens & wyues / our cruelnes by y• oppressions done of vs? with what face or how for shame shal we offre to them y• doctryne of Christ whiche is farre away cōtrary to all these thyng{is}. The best way and most effectuell to ouer∣comewith what ar∣tylery chefely the turk{is} ought to be ouercōe. & wyn the turkes / shulde be if they shal {per}ceyue y• thyng which Christ taught and expressed in his lyuing / to shyne in vs. If they shal perceyue y• we do not hyghly gape for their empyres / do not sire their golde and good / do not couet their posses∣syon / but that we seke nothynge els but only their soules helth & the glory of god. This is that right trewe & effectuous di∣uynite / the which in tyme passed subdued vnto Christ arrogāt and proude phyloso∣phers / and also the myghty & inuincible princ{is}: And if we thus do / than shal Christ euer be present & helpe vs.The parte of a christen man is to saue and not to distroy. For trewly it is not mete nor cōuenient to declare our sel∣ues christen men by this profe or token / if
we kyll very many / but rather if we saue very many: not if we sēde thousād{is} of he∣then people to hell / but if we make many infydels faythful: not if we cruelly curse & excomunycate thē / but if we with deuout prayers & with all our hertes desyre their helth & pray vnto god to sende thē better myndes. If this be not our entent it shall soer come to passe y• we shall degenerate & turne in to turkes our selues / than that we shal cause thē to become christen men. And although y• chaūce of warre / whiche is euer doutfull & vncertayne / shulde fall so luckely to vs y• we had goten the victo∣ry / so shuld it be brought to passe that the popes domynion & his cardynals myght be enlarged / but not the kyngdome of ChristeThe kyngdom of Christe. / whiche fynally florissheth and is in prosp if faythe / loue / peace / & cha∣syte be quicke and stronge / whiche thyng I trust shalbe brought to passe by y• good gouernaunce and prouisyon of the pope Le the tenth / vnlesse the great trouble and rage of worldly besynesse plucke him frō his very good purpose another way. Christ dothe professe to be primate & heed him selfe in the heuenly kyngdom / which neuer dothe florisshe but whan celestyall thing{is} be aduaunced. Nor Christ dyd not dye for this purpose that goodes of the
worlde / that rychesse / that armure / & the rest of rufflynge fassyon of the worlde / be nowe in the handes and rule of certayne preestes / whiche thynges were wonte to be in the handes of the gentiles / or at the leest amongest lay princes / not moche dif∣feryng from gentyles. But in my mynde it were ye best / before we shulde trye with them in batayle to attempte them with epystels and some lytell bokes: but with what maner of epystels? Not with thret∣nyng pystels / or with bok{is} full of tyrāny / but with those whiche myght shewe fa∣therly charyte / & resemble the very herte and mynde of Peter and Paule / & whiche shulde not onely pretende and shewe out∣wardly the tytle of ye apostels / but which also shuld sauour and taste of the effycacy and strength of the apostels.The diffyculte of the holy scripture. Nt bycause I do not knowe that all the trewe foun∣tayne and vayne of Chrites philosophy is hydde in the gospell and the epystels of the apostels: But the straunge maner of phrase / and often tymes the troublous spekynge of dyuers croked fygures & tro∣pes be of so great diffyculte / that often ty∣mes we our selfe also muste labour ryght sore before we can perceyue them. Ther∣fore in myne oppinyon the best were that some bothe well lerned men and good of
lyuing shuld haue this offyce assyned and put vnto them / to make a collectyon and to gather the some of Christ{is} phylosophy out of the pure fountayne of the gospell and the epystels and moste approued in∣terpretours / and so playnly that yet it myght be clerkly & erudyte / and so breue∣ly that it myght also be playne.The breuenes of Christes doctryne. Those thyng{is} whiche concerne faythe or byleue / let them be contayned in a fewe artycles. Those also that appertayne to the ma∣ner of lyuynge lette them be shewed and taught in fewe wordes / and that after suche fassyon that they may perceyue the yoke of Christe to be pleasaunt and easy / and not greuous and paynfull: so that they may perceyue that they haue goten fathers and not tyrantes / feders and not robbers / llers nor pollers / & that they be called to their soule helthe / and not compelled to seruytude.The turken be men. Undouted they also be men / neyther their hertes be of so harde yron or adamante but that they may be molyfyed and wonne with bene∣fites and kyndnesse / wherwith euen very wylde beestes be woren gentle and tame. And the moste effectuous thynge is the trewe veryte of Christe. But lette the pope also cōmaunde them whome he ap∣poynteth to this besynesse / that they ne∣uer
swarue nor go from the trewe patron and example of Christe / nor in any place haue any respecte to the carnall affectes and desyres of men. And suche a thynge my mynde was aboute to bringe to passe as well as I coulde / whan I made this booke of Enchiridion.The corruptnesse of the worlde. I dyd se the co∣men people of christendome / not onely in effecte / but also in opinyons to be corrup∣ted. I consydred the moste parte of those whiche professe thēselues to be pastours and doctours to abuse the tytles of Christ to their propre aduauntage. And yet wyll I make no mencyon of those men after whose wyll and pleasure the worlde is ruled and tourned vp and downe / whose vyces though they be neuer so manyfest / a man maye scarsely ones wynche. And in suche great darknesse / in suche great troublous rufflynge of the worlde in so great dyuersyte of mens opynions / why∣ther shulde we rather flye for socour than to the very great and sure ankerThe sure anker. of Chri∣stes doctryne / whiche is the gospell. who beyng a good man in dede / dothe not se and lamente this meruaylous corrupte worlde? whan was there euer more tyrā∣ny? whan dyd auaryce reigne more large∣ly and lesse punysshed? whan were cyre∣monyes at any tyme more in estymacion
whan dyd our iniquyte so largely flowe with more lyberty? whan was euer cha∣ryte so colde? what is brought / what is redde / what is decreed or determyned but it tasteth and sauoureth of ambytion and lucre? Oh howe infortunate were we if Christe had not lefte some sparkes of his doctryne vnto vs / & as it were lyuely and euerlastynge vaynes of his godly mynde. Hereto therfore we must enforce our selfe to know these sparkes / leauyng the coles of mens fantasyes:In thynges confused we must haue re∣course to the gyles. Let vs seke these vay∣nes vntyll we fynde fresshe water whiche springeth in to euerlastyng lyfe. we delue and dygge ye grounde meruaylously depe for to plucke out rychesse / whiche nourys∣sheth vyce: And shall we not labour than the ryche erthe of Christe to get out that thing whiche is our soules helthe? There was neuer no storme of vyces that dyd so ouercome and quenche the heate of cha∣ryte / but it myght be restored agayne at this flynt stone.. Con .x. Christ is a stone / but this stone hath sparkes of celestyall fyre / and vaynes of lyuely water.Gene xvj. In tyme passed Abraham in euery lande dyd dygge pytt{is} and holes / sertchynge in euery place the vaynes of lyuely water: but those same beyng stopped by agayne by the phylisty∣ens with erthe / Isaac and his seruauntesGene .xxvj.
dyd delue agayne / and not beynge onely content to restore the olde / dyd also make newe. But than the philistyans dyd scolde and chyde / yet he dyd not cease from dyg∣gynge. And in this our tyme we haue phylistyansThe  of our tim whiche do preferre y• naughty erthe to the lyuely foūtaynes / euen those whiche be worldly wyse / and haue their respect to erthly thinges / and wringe and wraste goddes doctryne and his gospel to their carnall affections / makynge it serue to their ambycion / bolstryng vp therwith their fylthy lucre & tyranny. And if nowe any Isaac or any of his family shulde dyg and fynde some trewe and pure vayne / by and by they brable and crye against hym / perceyuynge ryght well that that vayne shulde hurte their aduaūtage / shulde hurt their ambycion / although it ma neuer so moche for the glory of Christ: streyght∣wayes they caste in naughty erthe / and with a corrupte interpretacyon they stop vp the vayne / and driue away ye dygger: or at the leste they make it so muddy with claye & fylthynesse / that who so euer drin∣keth therof shall drawe vnto hym more slyme & naughtynesse than he shall good lycour.Hiere  They wyll not that those y• thurst and desyre ryghtousnesse do drinke of the pure lycoure / but they bringe them vnto
their olde worne & all troden cesternes / whiche haue broken stones and morter / but water they haue none. But yet for all this the very trewe children of Isaac that be the trewe worshyppers of Christ / must not be weryed & driuen awaye from this labour: for veryly euen they whiche thrust naughty erthe in to the fountayne of the gospell / wolde be counted the very wor∣shyppers of Christe. So that in dede no∣thynge nowe adayes is more peryllous than to teache trewly Christes lernynge / so greatly haue the philistyens preuayled fyghtyng for their erthe / preachyng erthly thynges for celestyall / and mens inuency∣ons for goddes cōmaundementes: that is to say / not teachyng those thyng{is} whiche make for ye glory of Christ / but those thyn∣ges whiche be for their owne aduaūtage / whiche be pardonsThe marchāt{is} of pardn / composycions / & such lyke pelfare. And these they do so moche more peryllously bycause they cloke their couetousnesse with the tytles & names of great princes / of the pope of Rome / ye of Christ also him selfe. But there is no man that doth more for the popes {pro}fyte or be∣synesse / than he that teacheth Christ{is} ler∣nyng purely & truly / wherof he is ye chefe teacher. There is no man that doth more good to princes or deserueth more of thē /
than he whiche indeuereth him selfe y• the people may be welthy & in prosperite. But some of the flocke of schole men wyll here speke agaynst me / sayeng it is easy to any man to gyue generall precept{is} what is to be desyred & what is to be eschewed: but what shalbe answered than to those that aske coūsayle for so many fortunes & chaū¦ces? First I answer y• there be mo dyuers kynd{is} of suche worldly besynesse thā that any lyuing person can gyue dyrecte & sure answere to eche one of thē.A man can make no certē answere to eue¦ry thynge. Secondaryly there is suche diuersyte of cyrcumstaūces / whiche if a mā do not know / it is not wel possyble to make an answer. In cōclusion I doute greatly whether they thē selues haue any sure answere y• they may make / seyng they differre in so many thynges a∣mongest thēselues. And those also whiche amongest them be more wyse than other do not thus answere: This ye shall do / this ye shall not do / but of this maner. This in myne oppynion were the better / this I suppose to be tollerable. But if we haue that symple and bryght eye whiche the gospell speaketh of / if the house of our mynde haue in it the candell of pure faytheThe lyght of faythe. set vpon a candelstycke / all these tryfles shall easyly be put awaye and a∣uoyded as it were clowdes or mystes.
If we haue the rule and patrone of Chri∣stes charite / to it we may apply and make met all other thynges ryght easely. But what wyll ye do whan this rule doth not agre with those thynges whiche hath be comenly vsed so many hundred yeres / and whiche be ordayned & stablysshed by the lawes of princes / for this thyng chaūseth very ofe. ye must not condempne y• thing whiche princes do in executynge their of∣fyce / but agayne do not corrupte & defyle the heuenly philosophy with mens ded{is}. Let ChristeChryste is the Centre. contynewe and abyde / as he is in dede / a very centre or myddle poynte vnmoued / hauyng certayne circles. Cyrcles. goyng rounde aboute hym: moue not the marke out of his owne place. Those whiche be in the first cyrclethe fyrst of mē of the chyrche next to the centre (that is to say t to Christ) as preest{is} / bysshops / cardynalles / poes / and suche to whome is belongeth to folow the lambe whyder so euer he shall go / let them enbrace and holde faste that moste pure parte / and so farre forth as they may let them cōmuny∣cate and plentuously gyue the same vnto their next neyghbours. In the secōde cyr∣cle all temporall & ley princesThe seconde of prynces. be / whiche in kepyng warre and makyng lawes / af∣ter a certayne maner do seruyce to Christ / eyther whan with ryghtfull batayle they
driue away their enemyes / & defende and mayntayne the publyke peace and tran∣quilyte of the comen welthe: or els whan with punysshment acordyng to y• lawes / they punyssh malefactours & yuell doers. And yet bycause they can not chose but of necessyte be occupyed and besyed in suche thynges as be ioyned with the most vyle dregges and fylthe of the erthe / and with the besynesse of y• worlde / it is ieopardous leste they do fall further from the centre and marke / as leste they shulde make som∣tymes warre for their owne pleasure / and not for the comen welthe: leste vnder the pretext of iustyce they shulde vse crueltye vpon those whom they myght refourme with mercy: leste vnder the tytle of lord∣shyp they shulde pyll and polle those peo∣ple whose goodes they ought to defende. And moreouer as Christ lyke y• fountayne of euerlastyng fyre / doth drawe next vnto hym the ordre of preestes / & maketh them of lyke nature / that is to say pure & clene from all corrupcyon of worldly dregges and fylthynysse:The offyce of Sacerdotes. So in lyke case it is the offyce of preestes / & specially of y• hyghest / somoche as they can to call and drawe vn¦to them those that be princes and haue power and authorite. And if it fortune at any tyme that warre do ryse sodaynly in
any place / let the bysshoppes endeuoyre them selues so moche as in them is / ey∣ther to ende the stryues and varyaunces without shedyng of bloode: or if that can not be brought to passe / by reason of the great stormes of worldly besynesse / yet let them so do that as lytle bloode as may be be shedde / and that the warre may shortly be brought to an ende. In tymes paste the bysshoppes authorite had place euen in iuste punysshmentes / and hath goten dyuers tymes (as saynt AugustyneAugustyne. playn∣ly in his epystle dothe testyfye) the male∣factour from the handes of temperall iu∣ges. For some thynges there be so neces∣sary vnto the ordre of the comen welthe that partly yet Christe dyd dissymule at them / and partly he put them from hym / and partly neyther approuynge nor disa∣lowyng them dyd in a maner wynke and loke besyde them. He wolde not knowe the money of Cesar nor ye scripture vpon it.what thynges & how farforth they apertayn to the heedes of the chyrche The trybute he cōmaūded to be payde if it were due and dette / as though it lytle pertayned to hym / so that god had his dutye. The woman taken and founde in adultery he neyther condempned neyther openly absolued / but onely dyd byd her y• she shulde no more do so. Of those whiche were cōdempned of Pylate / whose bloode
he entremyngled amongest their sacryfy∣ces / he neyther sayde it was well doone nor yuell / but onely threttened euery man that they shulde be punysshed with a lyke distructyon if they dyd not amende. More ouer whan he was desyred to de∣uyde the enherytaūce bytwene y• two bre∣therne / he plainly refused it as an vnwor∣thy thīg for hym to gyue iugemēt of such grosse maters / whiche dyd teche thynges heuenly. And also of the other parte there be certayne thyng{is} whiche he openly ab∣horred / as y• couetous phariseys / the ypo∣crytes / the prowde ryche folkes / sayeng vnto them wo be vnto you. He neuer re∣bukedwhat thynges chryste openly rebuked. y• apostels more sharply than whan they wolde haue ben auēged / or whā they were ambycious. whan they asked hym whether they shulde cōmaunde fyre to be sent downe frō heuen to haue burned vp the cyte from whēce they were shyt forth / he answered & said to thē / ye know not of what spyrit ye are. whā Peter was about to haue called him vnto ye world from his passyō suffrīg / he called him an aduersary. whā they cōtēded about p̄eminēce which of thē shulde be ye best / howe often & howe many wayes dothe he call thē backe to a cōtrary mynde?what thynges christ teacheth openly. And other thing{is} there be whiche he teacheth & cōmaundeth openly
to be obserued / as not to resyst yuel / to do good to thyne enemyes / to vse mekenesse of mynde / and other lyke. These muste be departed in sondre / and euery of thē set in ordre in his owne place.Princes lawes or of the mean sort of thinges Let vs not ther∣fore strayte wayes make Christe an au∣ctoure of all thynges whiche be done by princes & temporall offycers / nor defende it (as we call it) to be done by godd{is} lawe. They deale and meddle with many thyn∣ges whiche be lowe and grosse / not al to∣gyther of the very purenesse of a christen man: yet they be not to be rebuked in as moche as they be necessary to the mayn∣teynaūce of ordre to be obserued. Nor we be not by the mynistrynge of their offyce made good / all be it that by thē it is cau∣sed that we be lesse yuell / and that they whiche be yuell do lesse hurte & noyaunce to the comen welthe. And therfore they also ought to haue their honour bycause they do somwhat serue the iustyce of god and the publyke and comen tranquilyte / without the which somtyme those thyn∣ges be troubled & vexed whiche belonge to godly holynesse. They must be honou∣red whan they do their offyce: and if som∣tymes they vse their power for their own plesure or profyte / yet {per}aduenture it were the best to suffreEuell rulers must be suffred them / leste more hurte
shulde spring therof: for there apereth an ymage or rather a shadowe of the diuyne iustyce in them / whiche iustyce yet ought to shyne more euydently and more purely in the lyuynge and lawes of preestes. An ymage dothe of another maner shewe in a myrrour of glasse / than it dothe in yron. And in the thyrde cyrcleThe thyrde Cyrcle. must al the comen people be / as the moste grosse parte of all this worlde / but not yet so grosse but that they pertayne vnto the mistycall body of Christ: for the eyen be not only membres of the body / but also the legges / the fete / and the priuy partes. And those whiche be in the thyrde cyrcle we ought so to suffre in their infirmyte / y• as moche as is pos∣syble we do call them vnto those thynges whiche be more approued of Christe. For in the mistycal body he that but late was the foote may be the eye. And lyke as the princes if they be not al the best / must not with chyding be exasperate / leste (as saint Augustyne saythe) whan they be moued they styrre vp more peryllous tragedyes / so the weake people lyke as Christ suffred his apostels and nourysshed them / muste be suffred / and after a fatherly maner che∣rysshed vntyll they were more aged and strōge in Christ.The weake must be for∣borne. For godlynesse also hath his infancye / it hath mene age / it hath full
strength and perfyte age. yet all men after their degre muste endeuoyre them selfe to attayne and come vnto Christe. The ele∣mentes haue euery one his propre place / but the fyre which hath the hyghest place by lytell and lytell draweth all the other vnto hym / and so moche as he can tour∣neth them in to his nature.The chaūge of one Elemente in to an other. The clere water he tourneth in to the ayre / and the ayre clarifyed he transfourmeth into his owne nature. Saynte Paule dothe in many thynges suffre and pardon the Corynthyans / but in the meane season puttynge difference bytwene those thyn∣ges whiche he dyd profer in the name of his lorde vnto them that were perfyte / and those thynges whiche he dyd par∣don that were written in his owne name to them that were yet weake & yonge in Christ: but euer on this trust y• they shulde profyte and go forwarde to more strength and perfectyon. And also he trauayleth agayne to bringe forthe the galathyans vntyll Christe be fassyoned in them. Nowe if any man wyll thynke this cyr∣cle to be more conuenyent for princes / I wyll not stryue greatly with hym. But what so euer is without the thyrde cyrcle is at all tymes and in all poyntes to be hated and refused / as ambycion and de∣syre
of money / lechery / yre / vengeaunce / enuy / backbytyng / and suche other pesty∣lences / whiche than onely be made incu∣rable / whan they disgysed with the vyser and cloke of holynesse & vertue do crepe in to the cyrcle afore spoken: that is whan vnder the pretexte of executynge the lawe and iustyce we vse our tyranny. whan by the occasyon of religyon we prouyde for great lucre. whan vndre the tytle of de∣fendyng the churche we hunte for world∣ly power and authoryte: and whan so∣euer those thynges be commaunded as thynges pertaynyng vnto Christ whiche be disagreynge moche from his lernynge. Therfore the marke muste be sette before euery man whiche they ought to shote at: and there is but one markeThe marke maye not be chaunged. / whiche is Christe and his moste pure lernynge. If thou sette forthe a worldly marke in the stede of a celestyall marke / than shall there be nothyng whervnto a man ought iustly enforce hym selfe / whiche labou∣reth to profyte and go forwarde. Euery man ought to enforce hym selfe to that whiche is best and moste perfyteAl must labour to perfytnesse. / that at the leste we maye attayne and come to the meane thynges. And there is no cause whye we shulde put awaye any kynde or maner of lyuynge from this marke.
The perfectyon of Christ consisteth onely in the affectes / & not in the maner or kynde of lyuing: it consysteth in the myndes and not in the garmentes or in meates & drin∣kes. There be amonge the monk{is} whiche be scarce able to be put in ye thyrde cyrcle / and yet I speke of those whiche be good / but yet weake and not perfyte. There be amōgest these that haue had two wyues whiche Christe thynketh worthy for the fyrst cyrcle. Nor yet in the meane tyme I do no wronge to any maner of lyuyng or professyon / though I propounde and set forth afore euery man that thyng whiche is best and most perfyte: Onlesse ye wolde thīke Plato to haue done iniury agaynst all cytes bycause in his boke of the gouer¦nynge of a cyte or a comen welthe / he fay∣ned suche example of a comen welthe / as yet neuer any man coude se. Or except ye do thynke that Quintilian hath hurt the hole ordre of oratours / bycause he feyned suche an example of an oratour as yet ne∣uer was. And though thou be farre from the princypall and chefe patron Christe / thou arte not yet therfore caste away / but extymulate & moued to go forwarde and profyte. Arte thou nere the marke? than art thou monysshed and counsayled to a∣proche more nere: for there was neuer yet
any man that went so farre forwarde / but that he might haue gone moch more nere the marke. There is no kynde of lyuynge but it hath some peryllous poyntes an∣nexed vnto it / to cause men to degenerate from the truth: and who so euer sheweth those ieopardous and daungerous poyn∣tes / dothe not derogate or mynisshe tho∣nour of the ordre / nor speake agaynste it / but rather is for the profyte therof. As the felicyte of princesThe comen vy¦ces of princes is in daūger to fall into tyrāny / is in daunger and ieopardy of fo∣lysshnesse & flateryng / nowe who so euer sheweth those daungers to be eschewed / doth deserue thankes of the ordre of prin∣ces. Nor he dothe not speke agaynst their maiesty / wherin they glory / which dothe shewe in what thyng{is} their very maiesty dothe cōsyste / whiche also dothe put them in remēbraunce wherto they were sworne whan they toke their authorite: what is their dutye vnto their people / and what they ought to do vnto their offycers.Bysshops and other. The heedes and rulers of the churche haue in a maner affynite with two pestylent vy∣ces / auaryce and ambycion / whiche well perceyuyng saynt Peter. petri .v. the chefe pastour next vnto Christ / dothe monysshe the bys∣shoppes to fede theyr flocke / and not to pyll / poll / and fley them: Nor that they
shulde not fede them bycause of any fylthy aduauntage / but of their free and redy wyll: nor that they shulde vse them selfe as lordes vpon them / but that by the ex∣ample of lyfe / they shulde prouoke them to godlynesse rather than by thretnynge and power. Dothe he than speke agaynst the ordre of preestes whiche dothe shewe by what meanes / and howe the bysshops may trewly be great / myghty / and ryche? More ouer the kynde of religyous men is accompanyed moste comenly (besydes o∣ther enormytes) with superstycionTo which vy∣ces the cōmune sorte of mōkes be proue. A sentence. / pride / ypocrysy / and backbytyng. He dothe not strayte condempne their maner of lyuyng whiche dothe shewe & admonysshe them in what thynges most true religyon doth stande or rest / and howe moche the trewe godlynesse of a christen man is away from pride / and how farre true charyte is from all feynynge and disceyte: howe moche backbytyng and slaundring & venemous∣nesse of tonge is cōtrary to pure and true holynesse. And specially if he shewe what is to be eschued after suche sobre and dis∣crete maner / that he do neyther name any man nor touche any ordre.A sentence. what thynge is that in this mortall lyfe so fortunate and prosperous / but hath some pestylent thynges annexed vnto it? Therfore lyke
as he dothe not noye the helth of the bo∣dye but helpeth it / who so euer sheweth what thinges corrupteth helth and what thynges preserueth it: so dothe not dis∣swade men from religyon / but exhorteth them rather vnto it / whiche sheweth the corruptous infections therof and also the remedyes.The quarell of some persons. For I am infourmed that ther be dyuers which so iudgeth of this boke / as though the preceptes therof dyd with∣drawe and tourne awaye mens myndes from the lyfe of relygyous men / bycause they do not so moche prayse and alowe cyremonyes neyther yet mannes consty∣tucions as some wolde / whiche in dede ouer moche regarde them. And there can be nothynge so circumspectly spoken / but that therof leude and yuell persones done take occasyon eyther of quarellynge or els of synnynge: So that it is daunger∣full nowe a dayes to any man to teache any thynge well.Nothing is re from the caue∣lacion of lewde persons. If a man shulde dis∣swade frome suche warre and batayle whiche nowe of longe tyme hath been vsed / worse than was euer any amongest the gentyles / for thynges of no valure / he shulde be noted by and by of the pyke-quarelles to be one of those whiche that thynketh that no warre is lawfull for a chrysten man. For these whiche were
the bringers vp and auctours of this sen∣tence we haue made heretykes / bycause a pope / I wotte not who / dothe seme to approue and alowe warre. And yet he is not suspected nor noted of heresy / whiche dothe prouoke and styrre vp men to ba∣tayleBatayle. / and bloweth the trumpet thervnto for euery tryfelynge mater / agaynste the doctryne bothe of Christe and of his apo∣stels. If a man admonysshe that this is a dede trewly belongynge to the succes∣sour of an apostle to bring the turkes vn∣to relygion with Christes helpe / rather than with warre: anone he is suspected as thoughe he affyrmed not to be laufull for christen men to withstande the turkes / whan they inuade vs.Pouerte. If a man shewe and prayse the temperaunce that was in the apostels / and speke any thing agaynst the great superfluyte that is vsed nowe adayes / he shulde be noted as a fauourer of the Ebyonytes. And if a man dyd ex∣horte dyligently that these whiche be ma∣ryed / shulde rather be ioyned togyther by the consentes and agreyng of their myn∣des / than by the enbrasynges of their bo∣dyes / and so purely to vse matrymonye / that as moche as myght be it were made lyke to virgynite: he shulde be anone su∣spected to thynke that euery acte of ma∣trymonye
were synne and vnlawfull / as the marcionytes dyd. If a man do admo∣nysshe that in exercyse and disputacyons / specyally of diuynite / there shulde be no ambycious pertynacy to ouercome his fe∣lowe in defendynge his owne opinyons / nor no ambycion to shewe what they can do in comen places: he is wrongfully ac∣cused as though he dyd cōdempne vtterly all schole lernynge. Nor saynt Augustyne whan he gyueth warnynge to the logyci∣ens that they shulde be ware of luste to braule and chyde / dothe not cōdempne lo∣gike / but sheweth y• pestylence therof that it myght be eschewed.The subuerte iudgemente of vertues & vyc Also he dothe not disprayse vertue nor prayse vyce / whiche sheweth the preposterous & wronge iuge∣ment of the comen people / which amōge vertues esteme those to be of moste great value and chefest whiche be of the lowest sorte: and amonge vyces most sore hateth and abhorreth those moste small fautes and tryfles / and so contrary wyse. Anone he is accused as though he shulde fauour those vices whiche he sheweth to be more greuous than other / and as thoughe he shulde condempne those good dedes & be∣nefyt{is} to whom he preferreth other more holy & better. As if a man dyd admonisshe and gyue vs warning / that it is more sure
to truste vnto good dedes than to truste to the popes pardonePardons. / yet he dothe not forsothe condempne the popes pardons / but preferreth that whiche by Christes learnynge and doctryne is of more cer∣tayntye. Also if a man do teache those for to do better whiche tary at home and prouyde for their wyfe and children / than those whiche goo to se Rome / Hierusa∣lemThey whiche go to hierusa∣lem do no gret thynge. / or saynte Iames / and that money whiche they shulde spende in that longe and peryllous iourney to be better and more deuoutly spente vpon poore folkes / yet condempneth not he their good en∣tent / but preferreth that whiche is more nere to very godlynes. And this is a thing not onely vsed nowe in our tyme but also in tymes here tofore past / to abhorre some vyces as thoughe there were none other / fawnynge vpon the rest as they were no vyces at all whan in very dede they be more detestable than those whiche we so hate & abhorre.Only volupt nes is ab∣hored in sacer oe. Saynte Augustyne dothe complayne in his epystels that lastimy∣ousnesse of the flesshe is onely imputed vnto the preestes of Affryke as a vyce / and that the vyce of couetousnesse and dron∣kennesse be taken well nygh for a prayse. This specially we speke moste agaynste / and crye out vpon & exagerate for an ex∣cedyng
abhomynable facte / if one touche the body of Christe with the same handes wherwith he hath touched the body of a harlotte. And there be some ouer ragyng bolde that be not a frayde openly to af∣fyrme that it is lesse synne for a woman to commytte carnall acte with a brute beest than to lye with a preest. Nowe he that somthynge rebuketh their vnsham∣fastnesse / dothe not therfore fauoure the naughtynesse of preest{is} / but sheweth that they regarde not those offences whiche be a great deale more to be cryed out vpon. But if a preest be a dysar / a fyghterA sacerdote bynge a dycer or fyghter. / a brauler / al vnlerned / drowned and wrap∣ped in temporall besynesse / all gyuen to the yuell seruyce of yuell princes / yet a∣gaynste hym they crye nothynge at all whiche all togyther worldely and pollu∣ted dothe handle and entremeddle with holy mysteryes. whan a preest is a flat∣terer or a pyke quarellA sacerdote pyke quarell. / whiche with his bytter tongue and false lyes dothe hurte the names of those whiche neuer offen∣ded hym / but rather hath done hym plea∣sures / why do we not nowe crye out? Oh what an horryble synne is this to receyue thy lorde god / whiche suffred his passyon for synners with yt tonge whiche is full of poyson of hell / & with y• mouth wherwith
thou kyllest & sleest an innocent. But this yuell and vngracyousnesse we set so lytell by y• in a maner those men are euen pray∣sed for it / whiche {pro}fesse them selues to be the moste religyous amongest relygyous men. There is no man that denyeth but they be to be reprehended and sore rebu∣ked whiche nourysshe and kepe at home cōcubynes / to the yuell example of all the comen people: but yet these other yuel vy∣ces be more hatefull to god. Nor he dothe therfore say that butter is naught whiche saythe that hony is better and more to be preferred: Nor yet dothe not approue the feuer that counsayleth the phrenesy more to be auoyded. And it is harde to tell & ex∣presse how great infection of maners and disposycion dothe spring of these peruers and wronge iugemētes. There be dyuers thynges nowe a dayes receyued in to the ordre of vertues / whiche rather haue the vyser and apparaunce of godlynesse than the nature and strength of it / in so moche that onlesse me loke well vnto them and take good hede of them / they do quenche and vtterly distroye vertue. If it had ben but a lytell pestylence of relygyon whiche in cyremones do lye couerte / Paule wolde neuer so sharply haue spoken agaynst thē in all his epystels. And yet do not we con∣dempne
in any place cyremonyes that be moderatly obserued / but that al holynesse be ascrybed vnto them we can not suffre.Cyremonyes be of the mea sorte. Saynte AugustyneA rule of saynt Augustyne. dyd prohybyte those of the clergye whiche were in house with him to vse any notable vesture / but if they wolde be cōmended of y• people / that they shulde rather bringe that to passe by their maners and vertuous lyuyng than by a∣ny sondry fassyon of rayment. But nowe a dayes it is a worlde for to se what newe and wonderfull fassyons of aparayle and vesture there be.The rules of men. But yet I speke not a∣gaynst that / but this I meruayle of / that those thinges are so ouer moche regarded and set by / whiche peraduēture myght by ryght be reprehended. And agayne that those thyng{is} be so lytell regarded whiche we shulde only beholde and regarde. I do not rayle agaynst the grey freres & blacke monkes that they make moche of theyr owne rule / but bycause certayne of them regarde more their owne rules than they do the gospell: whiche thing wolde to god were not foūde in the most parte of them. I do not speke agaynste that / that some eate fysshe / some lyue with yerbes / other with egges: but I admonysshe those to erre and to be farre out of the way whiche wyll of those thynges iustify them selues
after the maner of the iewes / thynkynge them selfe better / and preferrynge them selfe to other for suche tryfles of mennes inuencyon / and take it for no defaulte at∣all to hurte another mannes good name with false lyes.Dyuersyte of meates. Of the dyuersyte of meate and drinke Christe neuer commaunded a∣ny thynge / nor the apostels: But Paule often tymes dyd disswade vs from it. Christ curseth bytter slaundringe / whiche also all the apostels dothe detest and ab∣horre: and yet that not withstandyng we wyll apere relygyous in suche vsynge of meates / and in hurtyng mennes fame we be bolde and hardy. I praye you thynke you that he whiche dothe admonysshe these bothe in generall not touchyng any man / and also louyngly / dothe hurte re∣lygyon? who is so madde that he wolde be accompted eloquent for shewynge and bringynge to lyght the vyces that belon∣gen to monkes? But these peraduenture feare leest their couentes and bretherne wolde be lesse obedyēt / and leest also there do not so many desyre to be shauen in to their ordre: yet verily / no man is more obe¦dyēt to his heed than he whiche inspyred with the holy ghost is free & at lybertie. Trewe & very charyte taketh all thynges well in worthe / and suffreth all thynges /
refuseth nothynge / is obedyent vnto ru∣lers / not onely to those that be sobre and gētle / but also to those that be sharpe and rough.The infery∣ours obedyēce maye not be abused. But yet rulers must be wise of this that they do not tourne the obedyence of other men in to their owne tyranny / and that they had leuer therfore to haue them su{per}stycious than holy & vertuous / wher∣by they myght be more obedyent at euery becke. They haue pleasure to be called fa∣thers: but what carnall father is ther that wolde haue his chyldren euer infātes and yonge bycause he myght vse his power vpon them at his owne pleasure? And of the other parte all those y• purpose to pro∣fyte in ye lyberty of Christ / this they must beware of / leest as saint Paule dothe ad∣monysshe they make their lyberty a cloke or couert to their carnall lyuynge: Or as saynt Peter teacheth / with their lybertye they make a couer and a cloke to malyci∣ousnesse. And if that one or two do abuse this lyberty / yet it is not ryght forthwith that all other therfore be euer kept in su∣perstyciousnesse & bondage of cyremonyes lyke vnto y• iewes. And who so euer wyll marke it shal {per}ceyue y• amongest these re∣ligious mē no man causeth ye cyremonies to be more straitly obserued thā they whi∣che vnder y• precept{is} therof doth bere rule
and serue their bellyes rather thā Christ. More ouer they nede not be afrayde leste such kynde of essenes be not ynough spred a brode in so great dyuersyte of mens na∣tures / wherby it is caused that nothynge is so vnreasonable but dyuers and many wyl loue & desyre it / although their selues ought more to desyre that they had trewe professours of religyon rather thā many.The more reli∣gyous a mā is the lesse he yel∣deth to cyre∣monyes. But wolde to god that it were prouyded and ordayned by a lawe y• no man shulde be taken in such snares afore he were .xxx. yeres of age / before he somthyng knewe hym selfe / or knewe what the nature and vertue of true religyon is.th. xxii. But these whi∣che lyke vnto the phariseys / doynge their owne besynesse and prouydynge for their owne profyte / wāder aboute to make no∣uesses bothe by see and lande / shall neuer fayle of yonge men lackynge experyence whom they maye alure in to their veyles and nettes / and also disceyue. There be a great nombre of fooles and symple soules in euery place. But I desyre euen with all my herte / and I doubte not but so do all that be very good men / that the religyon of the gospell shulde be so plesaūt to euery man that they beyng cōtented therwith / shulde not desyre the relygyon of blacke monkes of grey freeres. And I doute not
but so wolde saynt Benedicte & Fraunces them selues.Al thing{is} gyue place to the glory of chryst. Moyses dyd reioyce that his owne honour was defaced and dymmed with the glory of Christe: and so shulde those other be glad if for the loue of Chri∣stes lawe we set nothynge by mans con∣stytucions. I wolde that all christen men shulde so lyue that these whiche nowe be called onely relygyous / shulde apere lytell religyous / whiche thyng euen at this day is of truthe and that in many: for whye shulde I dissymule that thynge that is so manyfest?The fyrst be∣gynnynge of monk{is} in olde tyme. And yet in the olde tyme the be∣gynnyng of the monasty call lyfe was no∣thing els but a goyng a syde in to a secrete place from the cruelnesse of ydolaters. And anone after the maner of lyuynge of religyous men whiche folowed thē / was nothyng els but a reformacyon & callyng agayne to Christ: for the courtes of prin∣ces in the olde tyme shewed them christe∣ned in their tytles / rather than in their ly∣uyng. The bysshoppes anone after were corrupt with ambycion & couetousnesse / and the comen people also faynted and woxen colde from y• charyte whiche was in y• primytyue churche: and for this pur∣pose dyd saynt Benet seke a solytary lyfe / and than after hym Barnarde / and after that dyuers other dyd assocyat thē selues
togyther / for this entent onely that they myght vse the pure & symple lyfe of chri∣sten men. Than after in processe of tyme whan their rychesse and cyremonyes dyd encrease / their trewe godlynesse and sym∣plenesse dyd abate and decrease.From whence cyremonyes came. And nowe althoughe we se men of relygyon to be ouermoche out of good ordre / and to vse maners lyke vnto gentyles / yet is the worlde fylled with newe instytucions and kyndes of relygyon as though they shulde not fall to the same poynte here af∣ter that other haue done afore them. In tymes passed / as I sayd / a religyous lyfe was nothynge but a solytary lyfe. And nowe these be called religyous whiche be altogyder drowned in worldlyMonkes most worldly. besynesse / vsyng plainly certayne tyranny in world∣ly maters / and yet these for their aparayle and tytle I can not tell what / dothe cha∣lenge suche holynesse to their selues that they do accompte all other in comparison of them selues no christen men at all. why do we make so strayte and narowe chri∣stes relygyon whiche he wolde haue so large? If we be moued with magnifycall and hyghe termes / I praye you what thing els is a cyte but a great monastery?A Cyte is a great mona∣sterye. Monkes be obedyent to their abbot and gouernours / the cytezyns obey the bys∣shoppes
and curates / whom Christe hym selfe made rulers and not the authorite of man. The monkes lyue in ydlenesse / and be fedde of other mennes lyberalyte possessynge that amongest theym in co∣men / whiche they neuer laboured or swet for (yet speake I nothynge of them that be vycious).Obedyēce / po∣uerte / chastyte The cytezyns bestowe that whiche they haue gotten with their la∣boure and great trauayle / to them that haue nede / euery man as he is of haby∣lyte and power. Nowe as concernyng the vowe of chastyte I dare not be bolde to expresse what dyfference is bytwyxte the relygyous man vnmaryed / and the chaste matrymonye of the other. And to be shorte he shall not very greatly lacke those thre vowes of mannes inuencyon / that dothe kepe and obserue purely and syncerely y• fyrste onely vowe whiche we all solemnly make vnto Christ / and not vnto manne / whan we receyue our bap∣tysme. And if we compare those that be yuell of one kynde / with those that be yuel of the hother / without doute the tem∣perall men be moche better. But if we cō∣pare those which be good of the one sorte with those that be good of y• other there is lytell dyfference / if there be any at all /
sauynge that those apere to be more rely∣gyous that kepe their religyon and dutye with lesse coactyon. The rest is therfore that no man folysshly stande in his owne conceyte / neyther for his dyuersyte of ly∣uyng from other men / nor dispyse or con∣dempne the rule or ordre of other mennes lyuyng.No kynde of lyfe ought to be reproued. But in euery kynde of lyuyng let this be our comen study / that euery man accordyng to his power endeuoyre hym selfe to attayne vnto the marke of Christ / whiche is set open to al men / & that euery man do exhorte other to it / and also helpe other / neyther enuyeng them y• ouer rōne vs in this course / nor disdaynynge them that be weake and can not yet ouer take vs.The cōfydence in our selfe is moost perny∣cions. In conclusyon whan euery man hath done that he can / let him not be lyke vnto the pharisey whome the gospell maketh mencyon of / whiche dothe hoste his good dedes vnto god sayeng: I fast twyse in the weke / I paye al my tythes & suche forthe. But after Christes coūsayle let hym speke from the herte and to hym selfe / and not to other / sayeng I am an vnprofytable seruaunt / for I haue doone nomore than I ought to do. There is no man that bet∣ter trusteth than he that so dystrusteth. There is no man further from trewe re∣ligyon than he that thinketh hym selfe to
be very religyous. Nor Christ{is} godlynesse is neuer at worse poynt / than whan that thyng whiche is wordly is writhen vnto Christe / and the authorite of man is pre∣ferred vnto the authorite of god. we must all hange of that heed if we wyll be true christen men. More ouer who so euer is obedyent to a man whiche doth perswade and call hym vnto Christ / he is obedyent vnto Christ / and not vnto man.how farre pr∣lates must be obeyed. And who so euer dothe tollerate & suffre those men whiche be subtyle / cruell and ymperious / teachyng that thyng whiche maketh not for religyon / but for their tyrāny / he vseth the pacyence mete for a chrysten man / so that these thyng{is} whiche they cōmaunde be not vtterly wicked & contrary to Chri∣stes doctryne / for than it shalbe cōuenient to haue y• answere of thapostels at hande: we must rather be obedyēt vnto god than to any mail. But we haue lōge ago passed the measure & quantyte of an epystle / so greatly y• tyme disceyueth vs / whyles we comen and talke most plesaūtly with our well be loued frende. This booke is sent vnto you in Frobentus printe / as though it were newe borne agayne / moche more ornate and better corrected than it was before. I haue put vnto it certayne frag∣ment{is} of myne olde study in tymes passed.
Me thought it moste couenyent to dedy∣cate this edycion (suche as it is) vnto you that who soeuer shall take any preceptes to lyue well of Erasmus / shulde haue an example redy at hande of our father Uol∣zius. Our lorde preserue you good father / the honour and worshyp of all religyon. I pray you coūsayle Sapidus that he be wyse / that is / that he go forthe as he hath begonne: and to wynphelyngus ye shall speke also / that he prepare all his armure to fyght shortely with the turkes / for as moche as he hath kepte warre longe y∣noughe with kepers of concubynes. And I haue great hope and truste to se hym ones a bysshop / and to ryde vpon a mule / and to be set hygh in honour with a my∣tre & crosse. But in ernest I praye you cō∣maunde me hertyly bothe vnto them and vnto Ruserus & the rest of my frendes / and in your deuoute prayers made to god I praye you remembre Erasmus / and pray for his soules helth.

¶A compendyous treatyse of the sowdyour of Chryst / called En∣chiridion / whiche Erasmus of Roterdame wrote vnto a certayne courtyer / a frende of his. THou hast desyred me with fer∣uent study syngular beloued bro¦ther in Chryst / that I sholde de∣scrybe for the compendyously / a certeyn craft of vertuous lyuīg / by whose helpe thou myghtest attayne a vertuous mynde / accordyng to a true chrysten man. For thou sayest that thou are & hast ben a greate whyle wery of the pastyme of the courte. And doest cōpasse in thy mynde by what meanes thou myghtest escape egipt with all her bothe vyces & pleasures / and be prepared happyly with the captayne Moyses vnto the iourney of vertue.Egypt et of keneth syn∣full lyuyng. The more I loue the / the gladder I am of this thyne so holy a purpose / which I trust (ye without our helpe) he that hath vouched safe to styre it vp in the / shall make {pro}spe∣rous / & bryng to good effect.The lande of promyss syon signy∣fyeth pure lyfe. Notwithstā∣dyng yet haue I very gladly & wyllyngly accomplysshed thy desyre / partly bycause
thou art so great a frende of myne / partly also bycause thou requyrest so charytable thynges. Now enforce thyself & do thyne endeuoyre / that neyther thou mayst seme to haue desyred my seruyce & duty īvayne or els I to haue satisfyed thy mynde with out any fruyte. ye let vs bothe indifferētly beseche the benygne spiryte of Iesu / that he bothe put holsom thynges ī my mynde whyle I wryte and make the same to the of strengthe and effycacye. ¶we must watche & loke aboute vs euer more whyle we be in this lyfe. Caplo .j. THe first poynt is / we must nedes haue in mynde cōtynually / that the lyfe of mortal men is nothīg but a certayne {per}petuall exercyse of warre: as Iob wytnesseth.The lyfe of man is but a warfare / sayth Iob vi. A warry our {pro}ued to the vttermost & neuer ouercōme. And y• the moste {per}te of men be ouermoche deceyued / whose myndes this worlde as a iugler holdeth occupyed with delicyous &The cōpa∣raciō of the worlde to a iugler. flaterīg pleasures / whiche also as though they had conquered all theyr ennemyes / make holydaye out of season / none other¦wyse veryly than in a very assured peace.Peace pea∣ce / and yet is there no peace at all It is a meruaylous thing to behold how without care and circūspeccyon we lyue /
how ydelly we slepe / now vpon the one syde / & now vpon the other / whan with∣out ceasyng we are beseged with so great a nōbre of armed vices / sought & hūted for with so great craft / inuaded dayly with so greate lyenge awayte.Dyuerse en∣nemyes from aboue. Beholde ouer thy heed wycked deuyls that neuer slepe / but kepe watche for our destruccion / armed a∣gaynst vs with a thousand deceytes / with a thousande craftes of noysaūces / whiche enforce frō on hygh to woūde our myndes with wepons brēnyng & dipped in deedly poyson / than the whiche wepons neyther Hercules nor Cephalus had euer a surer darte / excepte they be receyued the sure & impenetrable shelde of faith.Ennemye at hande. Thā agayne on the ryght hāde & on the left hāde / afore and behynde this worlde stryueth agaynst vs / whiche after the saying of saynt Iohn is set all on vyce & myschefe. And therfore to Chryst bothe cōtrary & hated. Neyther is it one maner of fyght / for sōtyme with gōnes of aduersite ragyng / as with open warre he shaketh the walles of the soule Somtyme with great promesses(but yet most vayne) he {pro}uoketh to treason: & som¦tyme by vndermynynge he steleth on vs vnware to catche vs among the ydle and careles men. Last of all vndernethe / the ypper serpent the fyrst breker of peace /
ther of vnquietnes / otherwhiles hydde in the grene grasse / lurkynge in his caues / wrapped togyder in a hōdred roūde rolles ceaseth not to watche and lye in a wayte bynethe in the heleEnnemyes of hell of our womā / whome he ones poysoned. By the womā is vnder stande the carnall parte of a man / other∣wyse called Sensualite.Eue signy∣fyeth affec∣cyons. This is our Eue by whom the most crafty serpēt dothe en∣tyce & drawe our myndes to mortal & deed¦ly pleasures. And forthermore as though it were but a tryfle that so great a cōpany of ennemyes sholde assawte vs on euery syde. we beare aboute with vs where so euer we go in the very secrete partes of y• mynde an ennemye nerer than one of ac∣queyntaunce / or one of housholde. And as nothyng is more inwarde / so nothyng is more peryllous.Olde erth∣ly Adā be∣rokeneth appetytes or affeccy∣ons This is the olde & erthly Adam / whiche by acqueyntaunce & custo∣mable familiarite / is more nere to vs than a citezyn / and is in all maner studyes and pastymes to vs more contrary than ony mortall ennemy / whome thou canst kepe of with no bulwarke / neyther is it lawful to expell hym out of thy pauylyon. This felowe must be watched with an hondred eyes / lest {per}auenture he set open the castell or cite of god for deuils to entre in. Seyng therfore we be vexed with so ferefull and
cruel warre / & that we haue to do or stryue with so many ennemyes / whiche haue cō¦spyred and sworne our deth / whiche be so besy / so apoynted / so false & expert. Ought not we mad men on y• other syde to arme our selfe & take our wepons in our hādes to kepe watche & haue all thyng{is} suspect. But we as though al thyng{is} were at rest & peace slepe so fast that we rowte agayn & gyue our selfe to ydelnes / to pleasure / & as the cōmue {pro}uerbe is / gyue our myndes to reuelynge and makyng good chere / as though our lyfe were a festyng or backet∣tyng / suche as the grekes vsed / & not war∣fare. For in the stede of rentes & pauylyōs we tumble & walter in our beddes. And in in the stede of salletes & harde armure we be crowned with roses & fresshe floures. Bathed in damaske and rose waters / smo¦ked in pomaunders & with muske balles / chaungyng poyntes of warre with ryot & ydelnes. And in ye stede of wepōs belōgyng to ye warre / we handle & take vnto vs the vnhardy harpe / as this peace were not of all warres the moost shamefull. For who so euer is at one with vyces / hath broken truce made bytwene him & god in tyme of baptym. And thou oh madde man cryest peace peace / whā thou hast god thyne en∣nemy / whiche onely is peace & the author
of peace / & he hymselfe with open mouth cryeth the contrary by the mouthe of his prophete / saying there is no peace to syn∣ners or wicked persones whiche loue not god.There is no peace to wic¦ked {per}sones. And there is none other condicion of peace with hym except that we (as longe as we warre in the fortresse of this body) with deedly hate and with all our myght sholde fyght agaynst vyces. For yf we be at one with thē / we shall haue him twyse our ennemy / which onely beyng our frēde may make vs blissed. And yf he be our foo may destroye vs / bothe bycause that we stande on theyr syde whiche onely can ne∣uer agre with god / for how can lyght and darknes agree / & also that bycause we as men moost vnkynde abyde not by the pro∣messe that we made to hym / but vniustly haue brokē thappoyntmēt made bytwene hym & vs with {pro}testacion & holy ceremo∣nyes.In tyme of baptym we professe with protestacion o fight euer vnder the standarde of Chryst. Oh thou chrysten man remembrest thou not whan thou were professed & con¦secrate with the holy mysteryes of ye foun¦tayne of lyfe / how thou boundest thy selfe to be a faythfull sowdyour vnto thy cap∣tayne Chryst / to whome thou owest thy lyfe twyse / bothe bycause he gaue it the / & also bycause he restored it agayne to the / to whom thou owest more than thou art able to paye. Cōmeth it not to thy mynde
how whan thou were bounde with his sacramentes as with holy gyftes / thou were sworne with wordes for the nones to take the parte of so curteys an Empe∣roure / and that thou dydest curse & banne thyne owne heed / desyrynge vengeaunce to fall vpon thyne owne selfe / yf thou dydest not abyde by thy promesse.Badges & sygnes of baptym. For what entent was the sygne of the crosse prynted in thy foreheed / but that as long as thou lyuest thou sholdest fyght vnder his standarde. For what entēt were thou anoynted with his holy oyle / but that thou for euer sholdest wrastle and fyght agaynst vyces. what shame & how greate abomynacyon is it accoūted with al men yf a man forsake his kynge or chefe lorde. why settest thou so lyght than by thy ca∣pytayne Chryste / neyther kepte downe with the feare of hym / seynge he is god / nor refraynynge for loue / seynge for thy sake he was made man / ye & seynge thou vsurpest his name thou oughtest to re∣membre what thou hast promysed hym.The name of Chryst ought to put vs in remem∣braunce. why departest thou awaye from hym ly∣ke a false forsworne man / and goest vnto thyne ennemy / from whens he ones rede∣med the with the raūsom of his precyous blode. why doest thou so ofte a renegate warre & fyght vnder the standarde of his
aduersary. with what face sumest thou to set vp cōtrary baners against thy king whiche for thy sake bestowed his owne lyfe. who so euer is not on his part / as he sayth hymselfe Luce. xj. standeth agaynst hym. And he that gadereth not with hym scatereth abrode. Thou warrest not onely with fylthy tytle or quarell / but also for a myserable rewarde. wylt thou heare who so euer thou be y• art seruaūt or sowdyour to the worlde / what shall be thy mede / Paule the standarde bearer in the warre of Chryst answereth the. The rewarde (sayth he) of synne is deth.The guer∣don of . And who wolde take vpon hym to fyght in a iust & an ho∣nest cause: yf he were sure to dye but bodi∣ly onely / & thou fyghtest in a wrong & also a filthy quarel to obtayne for thy rewarde the deth of thy soule. In these mad war∣res that man maketh agaynst mā / eyther through beestly fury / or for myserable ne∣cessite. Seest thou not yf at any tyme the greatnes of y• praye {pro}mysed or hoped for / or cōforte of the captayne / or the cruelnes of the ennemyes / or shame of cowardnes cast in theyr tethes / or in cōclusyon yf de∣syre of prayse hath prycked & stered vp the sowdyours myndes: with what courage & with what lusty stomackes fynysshe they what so euer labour remayneth / how ly∣tell
they regarde theyr lyues / with how great fyersnes ronne they vpon theyr en∣nemyes / wel is hym that may go formest. And I beseche the now small is y• rewardeCompara∣cyon of re∣wardes. whiche those wretched men go aboure to gete with so great ieopardyes & diligence Ueryly but to haue prayse of a wretched man theyr captayn / & that they myght be praysed with a rude & homely song / suche as are vsed to be made in ye tyme of warre to haue happely theyr names wryten in a harpers bederoll / to gete a garlande of grasse or oken leues / or at y• most to bryng home a lytell more vaūtage or wynnyng with them. we on the other syde clene cō¦trary be kendled neyther with shame nor hope of reward / and yet he beholdeth vs whyle we fight that shal quyte our payne yf we wynne the felde. But what rewarde setteth forth the chefe ruler of our game for them that wynne the maystry / not mu¦les as Achylles dyd in Homere / not tripo¦das / that is to say / meate bordes with. iij. fete / as Eneas dyd in Uirgil: but suche as the eye neuer sawe / ne ye eare neuer herde / neyther coude synke in to the hert of man. And these rewardes he gyueth in y• meane seasō to his (whyles they be yet fyghting) as solaces and thynges to cōforte them in theyr labours & trauayles. And what here
after? certes blessed īmortalite. But in ga∣mes of sporte / as rennyng / wrastlyng / le∣pyng / in whiche ye chefest parte of rewarde is prayse. They which be ouercōme / haue lykewyse theyr rewardes assygned vnto them. But our mater is tryed with great and doutfull peryll / neyther we fyght for prayse / but for lyfe / & as rewarde of moost valure is {pro}fred to hym that quyteth hym selfe most manfully. So payne most terry¦ble is appoynted for hym y• gyueth backe. Heuen is promysed to hym that fyghteth lustely. And why is not the quick courage of a gentyll stomacke enflamed with the hope of so blessed a rewarde / namely whā he promyseth / whiche as he can not dye / euen so he can not deceyue. All thynges be done in the syght of god whiche al thyng{is} beholdeth.God behol∣deth vs. we haue al the company of he∣uen beholders of our cōflict. And how are we not moued at the lestway euen for ve∣ry shame? He shall prayse our vertue & di∣ligēce / of whome to be landed is very feli∣cite. why seke we not this prayse / ye with the losse of our lyues. It is a cowardfull mynde that wyl be quickened with no ma¦ner of reward. The veryest hertles cowar¦de in the worlde / for feare of peryls oft ty∣me taketh courage to hym. And in world∣ly bataylles though thyne aduersary be
neuer so cruell / yet rageth he but on thy goodes & body onely. what more thā that coude cruell Achylles do to Hector.Achilles slewe he∣ctor. But here the imortall parte of the is assawted and thy carkas is not drawen aboute the sepulcre as Hectors / but thy body & soule is cast downe in to hell: there the greatest calamite or hurt is / that a sworde shall se∣parate the soule frō the body. Here is ta∣ken from thy soule the lyfe / whiche is god hym self. It is natural for the body to dye whiche yf no man kyll / yet must it nedely dye. But thy soule to dye / is extreme my∣sery. with how greate cawtell voyde we the woūdes of the body / with how great diligence cure we them / & set we so lytell of the woūdes of the soule.The deth of the body se∣meth terry∣ble / the deth of the soule is not per∣ceyued. Our hertes a∣ryseth & grudgeth at the remembraūce of deth of the body as a terrible or outragy∣ous thyng / bycause it is seen with bodyly eyes. The soule to dye bycause no man seeth & sewe byleueth / therfore very fewe feare it. And is this dethe more cruell yet than the other. Euen as moche as the soule dothe passe the body / & god excelleth the soule. Wylt thou that I shewe the cer∣ceyn coniectures / exāples or tokens wher¦by thou mayst perceyue the sicknes & deth of the soule?The token of a sycke soule. Thy stomacke dygesteth yll / it kepeth no meate / thou {per}ceyuest by & by
thy body to be out of temper. And breade is not so naturall meate to thy body / as the worde of god is meate for thy soule. yf that seme bitter / yf thy mynde ryse against it / why dourest thou yet but yt the mouth of thy soule is out of taste / & infected with some disease. yf thy memory the stomacke of thy soule kepe not the lernynge of god. yf by cōtynual meditacyon thou digestest not. yf whan it is dygested / thou sendest it not to all partes by operacyon / thou hast an euydēt token that thy soule is acrased. whan thy knees for weyknes bow vnder the / & moche worke to drawe thy lymmes after the / thou {per}ceyuest playnly thy body to be euyll at ease. And doest thou not per¦ceyue the sycknes of thy soule whan he grudgeth and is weyke and faynte to all dedes of pite / whan he hath no strengthe to suffre pacyently the leest rebuke in the worlde / and is troubled & angry with the losse of a halfpeny. After that the syght is departed fro the eyes / & the eares cease to heare. After that all the body hath lost his felyng: no man douteth than but the soule is departed. whan the eyes of thy herte be waxen dym / in so moche that thou canst not se the most clerest lyght / which is ver∣tue or trouth. whā thou hearest not with thy inwarde eares the voyce of god. whan
thou lackest all thy inwarde felynge and {per}ceyuynge of the knowlege of god / thyn∣kest thou that thy soule is alyue. Thou seest thy brother vngoodly entreated / thy mynde is nothyng moued so thy mater be in good case. why feleth thy soule nothīg here? Certaynly bycause he is deed. why deed? bycause her lyf is away / that is god For veryly where godGod is lyfe of the soule. is / there is charite / loue & cōpassyō of thy neyghbour / for god is that charite. For yf thou were a quycke membre / how coude any part of thy body ake / thou not sorowynge / no not ones fe∣lyng or {per}ceyuyng it.Felyng is a token of lyfe. Take a more euydēt tokē. Thou hast deceyued thy frende / thou hast commytted adultery / thy soule hath aught a deedly wounde / & yet it greueth the not / in so moche that thou ioyest as it it were of great wynnyng / and bostest thy selfe of that thou shamefully hast cōmyt∣ted. beleue surely that thy soule lyeth deed Thy body is not alyue yf he fele not the pryckyng of a pyn. And is thy soule alyue whiche lacketh the felynge of so greate a woūde. Thou hearest some man vse lewde & presumptuous cōmuny cacyon / wordes of backbytyng / vnchaste & fylthy / ragyng furyously agaynst his neyghbour: thynke not the soule of yt man to be alyue. There lyeth a rotten carkas in ye sepulcre of that
stomacke fro whens suche stenche aryseth & infecteth euery man that cōmeth nygh. Chryst called the pharisees paynted sepul¦cres. why so? bycause they bare deed sou∣les aboute with them. And kynge Dauid the {pro}phete saith / theyr throte is a sepulcre wyde open / they spake deceytfully with theyr tonges. The bodyes of holy people be the tēples of the holy goost.The bodyes of good men be the tēples of the holy goost. And lewde mennes bodyes be the sepulcres of deed corses / that the interpretacions of the grā¦maryens to them myght well be applyed Soma quasi Sima.The body is the buryal or graue. it is called a body by¦cause it is the buryall / that is to saye / the graue of the soule. The brest is ye sepulcre / the mouth & the throte is the gapynge of the sepulcre / and the body destytute of the soule / is not so deed as is the soule whan she is forsaken of almyghty god / neyther any corse stynketh īthe nose of mā so sore as the stenche of a soule buryed. iiij. dayes offendeth the nose of god and all sayntes. Therfore cōclude whan so euer deed wor∣des procede out of thy hert / it must nedes be that a deed corse lyeth buryed within. For whan (accordyng to the gospell) the mouth speketh of the aboundaunce of the hert / no doubte he wolde speke the lyuely wordes of god / yf there were lyfe present / that is to wyte god. In an other place of
the gospell the dyscyples saye to Chryst. Mayster whether shall we go / thou hast the wordes of lyfe? why so I praye the the wordes of lyfe? Certeynly for bycause they spronge out of the soule from whome the godhede whiche restored vs agayn to lyfe immortal neuer departed not yet one mo∣mēt. The phisicyan easeth thy body som∣tyme whā thou art diseased. Good & holy men somtymes haue called the body deed to lyfe agayne. But a deed soule nothyng but god onely of his fre & syngular power restoreth to lyfe agayne / ye & he restoreth her not agayne yf she beynge deed haue ones forsaken the body. More ouer of the bodyly deth is the felyng lytell or none at all. But of the soule / is the felyng eternal And though also the soule in that case be more thā deed / yet as touching the felyng of eternall deth / she is euer īmortal. Ther¦fore seynge we must nedes fyght with so straunge & meruayllous ieopardye / what dulnes / what necligence / what folyshnes is that of our mynde / whome feare of so great myschef sharpeneth not.Many cau∣ses why a chrystē man ought to be of good con∣forte / and to haue confy∣dence. And agayn on the cōtrary {per}te there is no cause wher¦fore eyther the greatnes of peryll / or else the multitude / the violence / the subtilte of thyne aduersaryes sholde abate the cou∣rage of ye mynde. It cōmeth to thy mynde
how greuous an aduersary thou hast. Re¦membre also on the other syde how p̄sent how redy at hande thou hast helpe & so∣cour. Agaynst the be innumerable / ye but he that taketh thy parte / himself alone is more of power than all they. yf god be on our syde / what mater is it who be against vs. yf he stay the / who shall cast y• downe. But thou must be enflamed in al thy hert and brenne in feruēt desyre of victory. Let it cōme to thy remēbrance that thou stry∣uest not / nor hast not to do with a fresshe sowdyour & a newe aduersary / but with hym that was many yeres agoOur enne∣my was o∣uercom ma¦ny yeres agoe. discōfyted ouerthrowen / spoyled and ledde captyue in triumphe of vs / but than in Chryst our heed / by whose myght no doubte he shall be subdued agayne in vs also. Take hede therfore that thou be a mēbre of the body and thou shalt be able to do all thyng{is} in the power of ye heed.No man is stronge in his owne strengthe. In thy selfe thou art very weyke / in hym thou art valyaunt / & nothynge is there that thou art not able to do. wherfore the ende of our warre is not doutfull / bycause the victory depēdeth not of fortune / but is put holly in ye hādes of god / & by hym in our handes. No mā is here that hath not ouercōme / but he that wold not. The benignite of our {pro}tectour neuer fayled man. If thou take hede to
answere and to do thy parte agayn / thou art sure of the victory / for he shal fyght for the / and his liberalite shall be imputed to the for meryte. Thou must thāke hym all togyder for the victory / whiche fyrst of all hymselfe alone beyng immaculate / pure & clene from synne / oppressed the tyranny of synne. But this victori shal not com with out thyne owne diligence also / for he that sayd / haue confydence. I haue ouercōmen the worlde / wold haue the to be of a good cōfort / but not careles & necligēt. On this maner in conclusyon in his strength / & by hym we shall ouercōme. yf by his ensam∣ple we shall fyght as he fought / wherfore thou must so kepe a meane course / as it were bytwene ScillaScilla is a  pardons place in the see of ce cyle. and CharibdisCharibdis is a swalowe or whylepole i the same see. / y• neyther trustyng to moche & bearyng the ouer bolde vpon the grace of god thou be careles and recheles / neyther yet so mys∣trustyng in thy selfe / feared with the diffi∣cultis of the warre / do cast from the cou∣rage / boldnes / or cōfydence of mynde togy¦der with harneys and wepons also. ¶Of the wepons to be vsed in the warre of a chrysten man. Ca .ij. ANd I suppose that nothynge {per}tey∣neth so moche to the dyscyplyne of
this warre than that thou surely knowe and presently haue recorded & exercysed in thy mynde alway with what kynde of ar∣mure or wepōs thou oughtest to fyght / & agaynst what ennemyes thou must en∣coūter & iust. More ouer that thy wepōs be alway redy at hande / lest thyne so sub∣tyle an ennemy shold take the sleper & vn¦armed. In these worldly warres a man may be often tymes at rest / as in the depe of the wynter / or in tyme of truce: but we as longe as we kepe warre in this body / may departe from our harneys & wepons no season / no not as the saying is one fyn¦ger brede.A chrysten man sholde neuer cease frō warre. we must euer stande afore the tentes & make watche / for our aduersary is neuer ydle: but whā he is most calme & styll / whan he fayneth to flee or to make truce / euen than most of al he ymagineth gyle: & thou hast neuer more nede to kepe watche than whā he maketh coūtenaūce or semblaunce of peace. Thou hast neuer lesse nede to feare than whā he assaulteth the with opē warre. Therfore let thy fyrst care be that thy mynde be not vnarmed. we arme our body bicause we wold haue no nede to feare the dagger or preuy mur∣derer of the thefe. Shall we not arme our mynde lykewyse / that he might be in saue garde? Our ennemyes be armed to destroy
s / dothe it greue vs to take out wepons of defence yt we perysh not? They watche to kyll / shall not we watche to be out of daūger? But of the armure & wepons of a chrysten man we shall make specyal men∣cyon whan we cōme to the places conue∣nyēt. In the meane seasō to speke breuely who so euer wyl assayle with batayle the seuen nacyōsThe. . na∣cyons inha∣byted the lande of be∣hest or pro∣mission pro∣mysed to A∣braham and his ofspring. that be called / Cananei / Ce¦thei / Amorrei / Pherezei / Gergezei / Euei / & Iebuzei / that is to say / who so euer wyl take vpon hym to fyght agaynst the hole hoost of vices / of the which seuen be coun¦ted as chefe captaynes / must {pro}uyde hym of two specyall wepons. Prayer & know∣legePrayer and knowlege be the chefe ar∣mure of a chrysten man. / otherwyse called lernynge. Paule wolde we sholde be euer armed / whiche byddeth vs pray cōtinually without stop. Prayer pure and perfyte lyfteth vp thyne affeccyon to heuen / a toure beyonde thyne ennemyes reche. Lernynge or knowlege fenseth or armeth the mynde with holsom preceptes & honest opinyons / and putteth the euer in remēbraunce of vertue / so that neyther can be lackyng to ye other. These twayne cleueth so togyder lyke frendes / the one euer requyryng the others helpe. The one maketh intercessyon & prayeth. The other sheweth what is to be desyred & what thou oughtest to praye. To praye
eruētly / & (as Iames exhorteth vs) with∣out doutyng or mystrustyng fayth & hope bryngeth to passe. To pray in the name of Iesu / whiche is nothing else but to desyre thinges holsom for thy soule helth onely / lernyng or doctryne techeth the. Said not Chryst to the sones of zebedei.The sones of zebedei be Ia∣mes the more and Iohn̄ the euangelist. ye knowe not what ye aske? But prayer verily is the more excellēt / as she that cōmeth and tal∣keth familiarly with almyghty god. yet for all that is doctryne no lesse necessary. And I can not tell whether that thou fled from Egypt myghtest without great ieo∣pardy cōmyt thyselfe to so long a iourney so harde and full of diffyculte / without the capteyns Aarō & Moyses.Aaron signy∣fyeth prayer Moyses beto∣keneth know∣lege. Aaron whiche was charged with thyng{is} dedycate to the seruyce of gods tēple / betokeneth prayer. By Moyses is fygured the knowlege of the lawe of god. And as knowlege of god ought not to be vn{per}fyte / so prayer sholde not be faynt / slacke / without courage or quycknes. Moyses with the wepons of prayer fought agaynst his ennemyes / but had his hādes lyfted vp to heuen / whiche whan he let downe / the israelites had the worse. Thou happely whan thou prayest syderest onely how moche of thy psalmes thou hast mombled vp / & thynkest moche bablyng to be the strength and vertue of
prayer: whiche is chefely the vyce of them whiche (as infantes) cleue to the lytterall sence / & are not yet growen vp to the rype¦nes of the spiryte. But heare what Chryst techeth vs in Mathewe / saying. whan ye praye speke not moche / as the ethneys & gentyles do / for they thynke theyr prayers to be accepted bycause of moche bablyng. Counterfayte them not therfore / for your father knoweth wherof ye haue nede be∣fore ye desyre it of hym. And Paule to the Corynthes despyseth. x. thousande wordes babled with mouthe in cōparyson of fyue spoken in knowlege. Moyses opened not his lyppes / and yet god sayd to hym. why cryest thou so to me. It is not the noyse of thy lyppes / but the feruent desyre of thy mynde / whiche (as it were a very shyrle voyce) beateth the eares of god. Let this therfore be a customable thynge with the that as soone as thyne ennemye aryseth agaynst the / and the vyces whiche thou hast forsaken trouble the / thou than with out tarying with sure cōfydence and trust lyfte vp thy mynde to heuen / from whens helpe shall cōme to the / & thyder also lyfte vp thy handes. The surest thynge of all is to be occupyed in dedes of pitePite is not ta∣kē for cōpassyō but for the ho∣nouryng & wor¦shyppynge of god with cha∣rite or loue or∣dynate / as Chryst taught vs to loue. / that thy dedes may be referred and applyed / not to worldly busynes / but vnto Chryst. yet lest
thou sholdest despyse the helpe of know∣lege / consyder one thynge. Before tyme it was ynough for the israelytes to flee and escape frō theyr ennemyes / but they were neuer so bolde as to prouoke the Amala∣chytes / and to trye with them hande for hāde before they were refresshed with mā∣na frō heuen / and water rennynge out of the harde rocke.Manns is a hony dewe wherwith the chyldren of israel we∣re fed. xl. ye∣res / and it is sygnyfyed knowledge / & also by wa∣ter lykewyse The noble warryour Da¦uid refresshed and made strong with these cates / set nought by the hole hoost of his aduersaryes / saying. Oh good lorde thou hast set a table of meate before me to de∣fende me agaynst all men that trouble me Byleue me well brother syngularly belo∣ued in my hert / there is none so great vio¦lence of thy foes / that is to saye / none so great temptacion whiche feruent study or meditacyō of holy scripture is not able to put abacke / nor any so greuous aduersite which it maketh not easy. And lest I shol∣de seme to be somwhat to bolde an inter∣pretour (though I coude defende my selfe with great authorite) what thyng I pray the coude more {pro}perly haue signifyed the knowlege of the secrete lawe of god than dyd māna. For fyrst in that it sprange not out of ye erth / but rayned downe frō heuē. By this properte thou perceyuest the diffe¦rēce bytwene the doctryne of god and the
doctryne of mā. For al holy scripture came by dyuyne inspiracyon and from god the author. In that it is smal or lytel in quan¦tite / is signified the humilite / lowlynes or homelynes of the style vnder rude wordes includīg great mystery. That it is whyte by this properte is signyfyed the puryte & clennes of gods lawe. For there is no do∣ctryne of man whiche is not defyled with some blacke spot of errour / onely the do∣ctryne of Chryst euery where bryght / eue∣ry where pure and clene. That it is som∣what harde & some deale rough & sharpe / betokeneth secrete mysteryes hydde in the litteral sence. yf thou handle the vtter syde and yf I may so call it the codde / what is more harde or vnsauery. They tasted but the vtter rynde of manna / whiche sayd to Chryst / this is a harde saying / & who may abyde ye hearyng therof. But gete out the spirituall sence / & nothyng is more sweter nor more full of pleasure and swete iuce. More ouer manna is in the ebrewe tong as moche to saye as what is this? whiche questyon agreeth well to holy scripture / whiche hath nothyng ī it ydle or in vayne no not one tytle or pricke / vnworthy to be serched / vnworthy to be pondered / vnwor¦thy of this saying / what is this? It is a cō¦mune vse vnto the holy goost to signyfye
by water the knowlege of the lawe of god Thou redest of y• water of cōfort by whose bankes Dauid reioyseth to haue be nou∣rysshed vp: thou redest of y• waters whiche wysdom cōueyeth in to the toppes of eue∣ry waye: thou redest of the mystical ryuer in to the whiche Ezechiel entred / & coude not wade ouer: thou redest of the welles that Abraham digged / whiche whan they were stopped of the philistiens ysaac repa¦red agayne. Thou redest of .xij. foūtaynes at whiche ye israelytes after they had wal∣ked thrugh. xl. mansions / and began than to be wery and faynt / rested and refresshed themselfe & made them strong to the long iourney of desert. Thou also redest in the gospell of the well whervpon Chryst sate weryed in his iourney. Thou redest of the water of SiloeSiloe is a poole with in Ierusalē at the fote of the moūt Syon. / whether he sendeth the blynde to recouer his syght. Thou redest of y• water poured ī to the basen to wasshe the apostles fete. And bicause it nedeth not to reherse all places in this significacyon / ofte mēcion is made in scripture of welles fountaynes & ryuers / by whiche is signy∣fied nothyng else but that we ought to en¦quyre & serche diligently for the mysteryes hydde in scripture. what signyfyeth water hydde in y• vaynes of the erth but mystery couered or hyd in the litterall sence. what
meaneth the same conueyed abrode bu mystery opened & expouned. which beyng spred & dilated bothe wyde & brode / to the edyfying of y• hearers / what cause is there why it myght not be called a ryuer. wher¦fore yf thou dedycate thy selfe holly to the study of scripture & exercyse thy mynde day and nyght in y• lawe of god / no feare shall trouble the / neyther by day nor night: but thou shalte agaynst all assawtes of thyne ennemyes he armed & exercysed also. And I disalowe it not vtterly yf a mā for a sea son (to begyn withall) do exercyse & sporte hymselfe in werkes of poetes and philoso¦phers whiche were gētyles / as ī his A b c. or introductory to a more perfyte thynge / so that he taste of them measurably / and whyles youth shal gyue hym leue / & euen as though a man toke them in his waye / but not abyde and tary vpon them styll / & to wexe olde and dye in them / as he were bounde to the rockes of SyrenesSirenes were iij. ladies dwel¦ling in an ylād whiche with swetnes of son∣ge drewe vnto them who so e∣uer sailed by / & after killed thē But Ulixes re∣turning fro the siege of Troye hauynge that waye a necessa¦ri iourney stop¦ped his mary∣ners eres with wexe / & boside hymself to the mast / so herde he theyr songe auoydyng all ieoperdye /  / that is to put his hole delectacyon in them / & ne∣uer go farther. For holy Basilius to suche pastyme exhorteth yong men / whome he hymselfe had induced to the conuersacion of christen men. And our Augustyn calleth backe agayne his frende Licētius to passe the tyme with the muses / neyther Ierom repenteth hym selfe that he hath loued a
woman taken prisoner in warre. Cyprian is commended bycause he garnysshed the temple of god with the spoyles of the E∣gipciās. But in no case wolde I that thou with the gentyles lernynge sholdest also souke the gentyles vyces & conuersacyon. For yf thou do not / thou shalte fynde ma∣ny thyng{is} helpyng to honest lyuyng / ney∣ther is it to be refused what so euer an au∣thor (ye though he be a gentyle) techeth well. For Moyses veryly though he were neuer so famylyar with god / yet despysed he not the counseyle of his father in lawe Ietro. Those scyences fascyon & quycken a chyldes wytte / & maketh hym apte afore hande meruaylously to the vnderstādyng of holy scripture. whervnto sodeynly and irreuerētly to presume with handes & fete vnwasshed / is in maner a certayne kynde of sacrilege. And Ierom checketh ye shame¦les pertnes of them whiche streyghtwaye from secular or worldly seyence dare take in hande to medle or interprete holy scrip∣ture. But how moche shamefuller do they whiche neuer tasted other science / & yet at the fyrst dare do the same thynge. But as the scripture is not moche fruitful yf thou stande & stycke styll in the lettre. In lyke maner the poetry of Homere and Uirgyl shall not {pro}fyte a lytell / yf thou remembre
that it must be vnderstande in the sence al∣legory / whiche thyng no man wyll denye that hath assayed or tasted of the lernyng of olde antiquitees neuer so lytell / ye with the typ of his tonge / or vttermost parte of his lyppes. As for the poetes which wryte vnclenly / I wolde counseyle the not ones to touche them / or at the leest way not to loke farre in them: except thou can the bet¦ter abhorre vices whan they be descrybed to the / & in cōparacions of fylthy thynges the more feruently loue thyng{is} honest. Of the philosophers my mynde is that thou folowe them that were of Platoes secte / bycause bothe in very many sentences / & moche more in theyr style & maner of spe∣kynge / they cōme very nygh to the fygure and {pro}pertye of speche vsed of the {pro}phetes and ī the gospelles. And to make an ende shortly / it shall be profytable to taste of al maner of lernynge of the gentyles / yf it so be done as I shewed before / bothe ī yeres accordyng & measurably / more ouer with cautele & iudgemēt discretly / farthermore with spede & after the maner of a mā that entendeth but to passe ouer ye coūtre onely and not to dwell or inhabyte in cōclusyon (whiche thynge is chefest of all) yf euery thynge be applyed and referred to Chryst For so all shall be clene to them yt be clene
whan on the other syde to them that be vnclene nothynge is clene. And it shall be no rebuke to the / yf after the ensample of Salomon thou nourysshe vp at home in thy hous. lx. quenes. lxxx. souereyn ladyes & damoysels innumerable of secular wys∣dome.As Salomon had lx. quenes lxxx. cōcubines & damoyselles innumerable / yet one chefe quene / whome all the rest ho∣noured. so may we of all scien∣ces haue au∣thours inume¦rable / yf holy scripture be chefe of all o∣ther for the ho¦nesting of her. So that the wysdome of god be a∣boue al other / thy best beloued / thy doue / thy swete hert / which onely semeth beau∣tefull. And an israelyte loueth a straunger and a barbarous damsell / ouercōme with her beaute: but fyrst he shaueth of her hea¦re & pareth her nayles / & maketh her of an alyen an israelyte.The israelyte myght take to wife a straūger taken in warre so that her nay¦les were fyrste pared and her heare shaen: So may chry∣stē men honour god with gēty∣les lernyng / yf we cut of that is su{per}fluous. And the prophete Ozee maryed an harlot / and of her had children not for hymselfe / but for y• lorde of sabaoth and the holy fornycacyon of the prophete augmented the housholde of god. The e∣brewes after they had forsaken Egypt ly∣ued with lyght & pure whyte breadeThe light & pu¦re whyte breed betokeneth the gētiles lyuing. Māna betoke∣neth the wys∣dom of god. for a season / but it was not sufficyēt to so great a iourney. Therfore that breade lothed at ones / thou must make as good spede as can be vnto manna of celestiall wysdome the whiche shal nourysshe the haboūdaūt¦ly and strengthe the vntyll thou obtayne thy purpose / and wynne by victory the re∣ward that neuer shal cease: but thou must euer remembre in the meane season yt ho∣ly scripture may not be touched but with
clene & wasshen handes / that is to vnder∣stande / but with hygh purenes of mynde / lest that whiche of it selfe is a p̄seruatyue or tryacle / by thyne owne faute turne to y• in to poyson / and lest manna to the begyn to putryfye / except yt thou conuey or sende it in to the inwarde partes of thy mynde & affeccyon / & leest happyly it sholde fortune to the as it dyd to Oza / whiche feared not to set to his prophane & vnclene handes to the Arke of god enclynynge on ye one syde and with sodeyn deth was punysshed for his lewde seruyce.Dauid ent∣ded to trāslate the ark of god out of the hous of Amynadab whiche was in Gaboa / they put the ark vp∣on a carte / Oza with his bre∣therne wayted on it on eyther syde / a the ar¦ke enclyned & bowed Oza set his hande to stay it & was sytten with sodeyne dethe for his presum¦pcyon. The fyrst poynt is that thou haue good opinyon of the holy scrip¦tures / & that thou esteme them of no lesse valure & dignite than they are worthy to be estemed / and that they came out of the secrete closet of the mynde of god.Scriptur must be had in great reuerence. Thou shalt {per}ceyue that thou art inspired of god moued inwardly / rapt & in an vnspekable maner altered & chaunged to an other ma¦ner fygure or shappe / yf thou shalte cōme religiously / yf with reuerence and mekely thou shalte se the pleasures / delycates / or deynties of the blessed spouse. Thou shalt se the precyous iowels of ryche Salomō / thou shalt se ye secrete treasure of eternall wysdom: but beware that thou breke not malepertly in to the secrete closet / the dore is lowe / beware leest thou stryke the dore
with thy heed / & be fayne to lepe backe a∣gayn. Thynke on this wyse nothing that thou seest with thyne eyes / nothyng that thou hādlest with thy fyngers to be īdede the same thing which it appereth / so sure∣ly as these thyng{is} be true ī holy scripture:Fayth must be gyuen to holy scrip∣ture. so yt yf heuen & erth shold perysshe / yet of y• wordes of god not one iote or tytle shal pe¦rysh / but al shal be fulfilled. Though men lye / though men erre / yet the verite of god neyther deceyueth nor is deceyued. Of the īterp̄tours of scriptureThe chefe interp̄tours of holy scrip¦ture. / chose them aboue al other yt go farthest frō the lettre / which chefely next after Paule be Origene / Am∣brose / Ierom & Augustyne. For I se the di¦uines of later tyme slycke very moche in ye lettre / & with good wyll gyue more study to subtyle & deceytfull argumētes / than to serche out y• mysteryes / as though Paule hath not sayd truly our lawe to be spūall. I haue herd some men my self which stode so greatly in theyr owne cōceyte with the fantasticall tradicyōs / ymaginacyōs & in∣uencyons of man / y• they despysed y• inter∣pretaciō of olde doctours that were nygh to Chryst & his apostles bothe ī tyme & ly∣uyng also / & accompte them as dremes / ye & mayster dunceMayster do∣ctour dunce. gaue them suche cōfydēce that notwithstādīg they neuer ones redde the holy scripture / yet thought they them
selfe to be perfyte diuynes / whiche {per}sones though they speke thyng{is} neuer so crafty & subtile / yet whether they speke thynges worthy of y• holy goost & the meke spiryte of Chryst or not / let other men iudge. But yf thou haddest leuer to be somwhat lusty & quicke of spiryte / thā to be armed to con¦tenciō / that is to say / to brawlyng or scol∣ding. yf thou seke rather to haue thy soule made fatte / thā thy wyt to be vaynly dely¦ted: study & rede ouer chiefly y• old doctours & expositours / whose godlynes & holy lyfe is more proued & knowen / whose religion to god is more to be pōdered & loked vpon whose lernīg is more plēteous & sage also whose style is neyther bare ne rude & īter∣p̄taciō more agreable to y• holy mysteryes And I say not this bycause I despise these newe diuynes / but bycause I set more by thynges more {pro}fytable & more apt for the purpose.The sp∣kynge of scripture. And also the spiryt of god hath a certeyn tong or speche appropriate to him selfe / he hath his fygures similitudes / pa∣rables / cōparisōs / {pro}uerbes & redils which thou must obserue & marke dilygently / yf thou sholdest vndstāde thē. The wisdom of god stutteth & lyspeth as it were a diligēt mother fascioneth her wordes accordīg to our īfancye & feblenes. She giueth mylke to them that be infantes in Chryst / weyke
meate to feble stomackes. Thou therfore make spede thou were a man / make haste to perfyte & stronge meate / and prepare a mannes stomacke. She stoupeth downe & boweth her self to thy humilite & lownes. Aryse than vpon the other syde & ascēde to her heyght & excellencye. It is lyke a mon¦stre and vnnatural to be euer a chylde. He is to hertles that neuer seaseth to be feble & weyke.edynge without vnderstā∣dynge. The recording of one verse shall be more sauery in thy mouth / & shall nou∣rysshe the better yf thou breke the codde & taste of the swetnes which is within / thā y thou sholdest syng the hole psalter / vn∣derstande onely after the litterall sence / wherof veryly I gyue admonicyō a great deale the rather / bycause I knowe by ex∣peryence that this errour hath not īfected the lay people onely / but also the myndes of them whiche {pro}fesse & shewe outwarde in theyr habyte & name or rytle / {per}fyte reli∣gion / in so moche that they thynke the ve∣ry seruyce of god to be put chefely in this one thynge / yf they shall saye ouer euery daye as moche as they can of the psalmes scarse vnderstande ye in the litterall sence Neyther I thynke any other thyng to be the cause why we se the charitable lyuing of our monkes &The chari∣table ly∣uynge of monkes. cloysterers to fayle euery where / to be so colde / so slacked / so faynt &
so to vanysshe away / but that they conty¦nue all theyr lyfe & wexe olde in the lettre and neuer enforce to cōme to the spiritual knowlege of scripture / neyther heare they Chryst cryeng in ye gospel / the flesshe / that is to say / the lettre / or that ye se outwarde {pro}fyteth not at al.The flesshe is called in scrip∣ture what so euer is visible or perceyued outward with any sensyble power. It is the spiryte within that quickeneth or giueth lyf. They heare not Paule affermyng with his mayster / yt the lettre kylleth / and it is the spiryte gy∣ueth lyfe. And agayn we knowe (saith he) that the lawe is spiritual / and not carnal. Spiritual thynges must be cōpared with spirituall thynges.The spiryt is called what so euer is pcey∣ued inwardly with the eye of the soule. In tyme passed the fa∣ther of al spiritual gyftes wolde be honou¦red in the mounteyn / but now he wyll be honoured in the spiryte. How be it I des∣pyse not the feblenes of them / whiche for lacke of knowlege & vnderstandyng doth y• they onely be able to do / {pro}nouncing the mystical psalmes with pure faith without dissimulacyon or ypocrysye / but rather as in charmes and enchauntementes of ma∣gyke certeyn wordes not vnderstande / no not of them whiche pronoūce them yet be byleued to be of vertue & strengthe.A similitude of mekenes of them whiche lacke capacite. Euen so the wordes of god / though they be not {per}fytly vnderstande / neuerthelesse we must trust that they be profytable to them that eyther saye them or heare them with per∣fyte
fayth / with pure affection and mynde And that the aungels whiche are present and doth vnderstande be prouoked to hel∣pe them. And Paule despyseth not them whiche saye psalmes with theyr mouthe whiche speketh with tonges that thynge they vnderstande not: but he exhorteth them to leue theyr infancy / and to folowe more {per}fyte gyftes / vnto whiche yf a man can not attayne / not through the defaute of a corrupte mynde / but for lacke of ca∣pacite: let hym not barke agaynst them whiche enforce better thynges. And after the precept of Paule / let not hym whiche eateth / despise him which eateth not / ney∣ther he that eateth not / iudge hym that eateth. Neuerthelesse I wyl not haue the whiche art endewed with so happy a wyt to be slowe & to tary longe in the bareyn lettre / but to make spede vnto more secret mysteryes / and to helpe the cōtynuall en∣deuoyre & enforcement of thyne industrye & wyll with often prayers vntyll he open to the the booke clapsed with .vij. claspes whiche hath the key of Dauid / the which also shytteth and no man openeth the pre¦uytees of the father / whiche neuer man knewe but his sone / and he to whome his sone hath vouched saufe to disclose them. But whether gothe our style asyde / myne
entēt was to descrybe the forme of lyuyng not of lernynge: but I turned out of the way thus far whyle I laboured to shewe the a mete shop frō whens thou oughtest to fetche thy newe armure & wepons be∣longyng to the newe warre. Therfore to cōme to our purpose agayn / yf thou shalt pyke and chose out of the bookes of the gentyles of euery thynge the best. And al∣so yf thou by thexample of the bee / fleyng rounde aboute by the gardynes of olde authours shalte sucke out onely the hol∣some and swete iuce (the poyson refused & lefte behynde) thy mynde shall be better apparayled a greate deale / and armed vn¦to the commune lyfe or conuersacyon / in whiche we lyue one with an other in ho∣nest maner.

But that dy∣uyne armure & (to speke as the poetes do) that harneys of Uulcan{us}The Artyl∣lery of Uul∣canus. makyng / which with no wepōs can be persed / is fet onely out of the armory of holy scripture / where our noble capteyn Dauid layde vp all his ordynaunce of warre for his sowdyours with whiche they sholde fyght afarre and

Wylt thou heare the instrumētes or artillary of chry∣sten mens warre?

Now if thou list to go to,If zeale be in knowlege it is good & if not it is euyl / As the pharysees for zeale of theyr tradytiōs Per∣secuted Chryst & hapostelles. the storehouse of Paule that va∣lyaunt capteyn / certeynly thou shalt also fynde there the armure of warre / not car∣nal thyng{is} / but valyaūt in god to destroye fortresses & coūseyles / & euery hygh thyng that exalteth himself agaynst the doctryne of god. Thou shalte fynde there ye armure of god / by the whiche thou mayst resyst in

Thou shalt fynde the har∣neys of iustyce on the ryght hande / and on the lefte thou shalte fynde the defence of thy sydes verite / and the hawbergyon of iustyce the bukler of fayth / wherwith thou mayst quenche al the hote and fyery wepons of thy cruell aduersarye. Thou shalte fynde also the helmet of helthe and the sworde of the spiryte / whiche is the worde of god / with the whiche al yf a man shall be dilygently couered and fensed / he may boldly without feare brynge forthe the bolde sayinge of Paule. who shall se∣parate vs from the loue of god? shall tri∣bulacyon? shal straytnes or difficulty? shal hunger? shall nakednes? shall peryll? shall persecucyon? shall a sworde. Beholde how myghty ennemyes and how moche fea∣red of all men he setteth at nought. But heare also a certayne greater thynge / for it foloweth. But in all thynges we haue ouercōme by his helpe whiche loued vs. And I am assured (sayth he) that neyther deth nor lyfe / nor aungels / neyther princi∣pates / neyther virtutes / neyther present thynges / neyther thynges to cōme / ney∣ther strengthe / neyther hyghnes / neyther lownes / nor none other creature shall or may separate vs frō the loue of god whi∣che is in Chryst Iesu. O happy trust and
confydence whiche the wepons or armure of lyght gyueth to Paule / that is by in∣terpretacyon a lytell man / whiche calleth hymselfe the refuse or outcast of the worl∣de. Of suche armure therfore haboundaūt¦ly shall holy scripture mynyster to the / yf thou wylte occupye thy tyme in it with all thy myght: so that thou shalt not nede our counseyle or admonycyons. Neuer∣thelesse seyng it is thy mynde / leest I shol∣de seme not to haue obeyed thy request / I haue forged for the this lytell treatyse cal∣led Enchiridion / that is to saye / a certayn lytell dagger / whome neuer laye out of thy hande / no not whan thou art at mea∣te / or in thy chaumbre. In so moche that yf at ony tyme thou shalte be compelled to make a pylgrymage in these worldly occupacyons / and shalte be accombred to beare aboute with the the hole and com∣plete armure and harneys of holy scrip∣ture / yet cōmytte not that the suttellyer in wayte at ony season sholde cōme vpon the and fynde the vtterly vnarmed / but at the leest lette it not greue the to haue with the this lytell hanger / whiche shall not be heuy to beare / nor vnprofytable for thy defence / for it is very lytell / yet yf thou vse it wysely / and couple with it
the bukler of fayth / thou shalte be able to withstande the fyerse & ragyng assawte of thyne ennemy: so that thou shalt haue no deedly wounde. But now it is tyme that I begyn to gyue the a certeyn rule of the vse of these wepons / whiche yf thou shalt put in execucyō or practyse / I trust it wyll cōme to passe that our capytayne Iesus Chryst shal trāslate the a cōquerour out of this lytel castel or garryson in to his great cite Ierusalē with triumphe / where is no rage at al of any batayle / but eternal qui∣etnes / perfyte peace / assured tranquillite: but where as in the meane season al hope and confydence of saufgarde is put in ar∣mure and wepon. ¶That the fyrst poynt of wysdome is to knowe thy selfe / and of two ma∣ner wysdomes / the true wys∣dome / & the apparēt. Ca .iij. THat excellent good thynge desy¦red and sought for of all men / is peace or quietnes: vnto whiche ye louers of this worlde also referre all theyr study / but they seke a false peace / and shote at a wronge marke. The same peace the philosophers also {pro}mysed vnto the folowers of theyr conclusions / but yet
falsly / for Chryst onely gyueth it / the worl¦de gyueth it not.A man must fyght agynst hymselfe. To cōme to this quiet∣nes / the onely waye or meanes is (yf we make warre) agaynst our self / yf we fyght strongly against our owne vices / for with these ennemyes god whiche is our peaceGod is our peace & felicite is at varyaūce with deedly hate / seyng he is naturally vertue it selfe & father & lorde of al vertue.Stoici were phylosofers as Socrates & Plato / with theyr folowers which put feli∣cyte in trewe plesure in ver∣tue onely and within the cō∣sciēce without any outwarde pleasure or ry∣ches. And where as a filthy puddle or a synke gathered togider of al kynde of vices / is named of the stoikes whiche are the moost feruent deferders of vertue fo∣lyshnes / & in our scripture the same is cal∣led malyce / in lyke maner vertue or good∣nes lackyng in no poynt / of bothe partes is called wysdom. But after the saying of the wyse man doth not wysdom ouercōme malyce? The father and heed of malyce is the ruler of darknes belial: whose steppes who so euer foloweth walketh in ye night and shall cōme to eternall nyght.Folyshnes is myserye. wysdome is fe¦lycyte. Fooles also be wretches and vnhappy. wyse men also be happy and fortunate. Fylthynes is folyshnes vertu is wisdō. On the other syde ye grounde of wysdom & in dede wysdome it selfe is Chryst Iesus / whiche is very lyght & the bryghtnes of the glory of his father / putrynge away by hymselfe onely ye nyght of y• folyshnes of the world The whiche (wytnessynge Paule) as he was made redempcyon & iustificacyon to vs that be borne agayn in him. Euen lyke wise was made also our wisdom. we (saith
Paule) preche Chryst crucified / whiche to the iewes is an occasion of vnite / & to the gētyles folyshnes. But to ye elected bothe of the iewes & also of ye gentiles we preche Chryst the vertue or strength of god / & the wysdom of god / by whose wysdom thrugh his ensample we may beare away the vi∣ctory of our ennemy malyce / yf we shal be wyse in him in whom also we shal be con¦querours. Make moche of this wysdom & take her in thyne armes worldly wysdomworldly wyse∣dome is very folysshnes set at nought / which with false tytle & vn∣der a fayned colour of honeste bosteth and sheweth her selfe gay to fooles / whā after Paule there is no greater folyshnes with god than worldly wysdom / a thynge that must be forgete in dede agayn of hym that wyll be wyse in dede.e must be a foole in this worlde that wyll be wyse in god. If any man (saythe Paule) amonge you semeth to be wyse in this worlde / let hym be a foole yt he may be wyse / for the wysdome of this worlde is folyshnes with god. And a lytell afore Paule sayth it is wryten? I wyll destroy the wysdom of wyse men / & the prudence of prudent men I wyll reproue. where is the wyse man / where is ye subtile lawyer / where is the sercherThe serchers were the phy∣losofers which serched for worldly wysdō yet coude they attayn no wys∣dome to saue the soule of mā vntyll Chryste came. of this worlde. Hath not god made the wysdom of this worlde folyshnes. And I doute not but euen now with greate hate these folysshe wyse men

These be in na∣me onely chrysten men / but in very dede they are bothe mockers & also ennemyes of Chrystes doctryne.A true chrystē mā must despy¦se the folishnes of worldly mē. Take hede and be∣ware that theyr folysshe bablynge moue the not / whose miserable blyndnes ought rather to be wept / sorowed and mourned than to be counterfeyted or folowed.he is good for nothyng sayth hesiod{us} which neyther hathe wysdō / nor yet wyll lerne it. Oh what folysshe kynde of wysdom and clene out of ordre is this in tryfles and thynges of no value / ye to fylthynes onely to be clere wytted / ware and experte:To haue kno∣lege is best of all. To be wyl∣lynge to lerne & obedyente to the truth is al∣so a good thīge To lacke kno∣lege is a very euyll thynge. but in those thynges whiche onely make for our sauegarde or helthe:To disdayn to lerne is worse but to withstō∣de & repugne agaynste the truthe to them whiche teache the truthe is worst of al & far¦dest frō grace. not to haue moche more vnderstandynge than a brute beest. Paule wolde we sholde be wyse but in goodnes / & chyldren in euyll. These men be wyse to all iniquite: but they haue no lernynge to do good. And for as moche as that facoūdyous and greke poete He∣siodus counteth hym good for nothynge whiche neyther is wyse of hymselfe / ney∣ther yet wyll folowe and do after hym that gyueth hym good coūseyle. Of what degre than shall they be counted whiche
whan they themselfe be moost shameful∣ly deceyued / yet neuer seace to trouble / to laugh / to scorne and put in feare them whiche all redy be cōme to theyr wyttes agayn? But shall not the mocker be moc∣ked? He that dwelleth in heuē shal mocke them agayn / & our lorde shall laugh them to scorne. Thou redest in the boke of Sa∣pyence / they shall se veryly & shall despyse hym / but god shal mocke thē. To be moc∣ked of lewde men / is as it were a prayse. And no doubte it is a blessed thynge to fo∣low our heed Chryst & his apostles / and a fearfull thyng truly to be mocked of god. I also (saith the wysdom) wyl laugh whā ye perysshe / & mocke you whā that thyng hath hapned to you which ye feared / that is to say / whan they awaked out of theyr dreame & cōme agayn to themself whan it is to late / shall say.Eyl men say ye good mē as ye lyue now so lyued such & su∣che pope holy fooles / & this came of them & so we trust to se happen of you. These be they whome we haue had in derysyon and reprofe / we for lacke of vnderstandynge haue counted theyr lyues to be madnes / & theyr ende to be without honour. This wisdom is beest¦ly / and as Iames sayth diabolyke & of the deuyll / & is an ennemy to god / whose ende is destruction.Note how one vyce bryngeth in an other. For always after this wys∣dom foloweth as a waytyng seruaunt or handmayde myscheuous p̄sumpcion / after p̄sumpcyon foloweth blyndnes of mynde
after blyndnes of mynde foloweth feruent rage & tyrannye of affections & appetytes / after the tyrannye of affections foloweth the hole hepe of al vices and libertye to do what he lysteth Than foloweth custome / after foloweth moost wretched dulnes or insencibilitye of mynde / a dasynge of the wyttes for lacke of capacitye. By which it is caused that euyll men {per}ceyue not them self to synne. And whyles they be in suche insencibilitye without any fealyng or per∣ceyuyng of themselfe / bodyly deth cōmeth sodeynly on them / & after it foloweth the seconde deth / whiche is deth euerlastyng. Thou seest how the mother of thextreme myschefe is worldly wysdom / but of the wysdom of ChrystThe wysdome of Chryste. whiche ye worlde thyn∣keth folyshnes / this wyse thou redest. All good thyng{is} came to men by hepes with her / & ineymable honestye by the handes of her. And I reioysed ī al thyng{is} bycause this wysdom went before me / and I was not ware that she was mother of al good thyng{is}. This wysdom bryngeth with her as companyons sobrenes and mekenes. Mekenes disposeth & maketh vs apte to receyue the spiryte of god. For in the low∣ly / humble & meke persone he reioyseth to rest. And whan ye spiryt hath replenysshed our myndes with his seuēfolde grace / than
forthwithal spryngeth that plenteous er∣bage of al vertue with those blessed fruy∣tes of whiche y• chefe is the secrete ioye of a clere conscience / whiche ioye is knowen of none but onely of suche to whome it hath chaunced to taste of it. Ioye that ne∣uer vanyssheth away / nor fadeth with the ioyes of this worlde / but encreaseth and groweth to eternall gladnes and myrth. This wysdom my brother (after the coun¦seyle of Iames) must thou requyre of god with feruent & brennyng desyre. And after the counseyle of the wyse man dygge her out of the veynes of holy scripture / as it were treasure hyd in the erthe. The chefe parte of this wysdom is that thou sholdest knowe thy selfe / whiche worde to haue descended frō heuen the antiquite byleued & so moche hath that saying pleased great auctours / yt they iudged al plenty of wys∣dom to be shortly cōprehēded in this lyrel sentence / that is to wyte / yf a man knowe himselfe. But let the weyght or authorite of this conclusyon & doctryne be of no va∣lure with vs / excepte it agre with our ler∣nyng. The mystical louer in canticis thret¦neth his spouse / & byddeth her to gete her selfe out of ye dores / excepte she knowe her selfe / saying. O thou beautefull among al women / yf thou knowe not thy selfe / go
out of the dores & walke after the steppes of thy flocke & sorte. Therfore let no man p̄sumptuously take vpō him this so great a thyng / to thynke that he knoweth hym selfe wel ynough. I am not sure whether any man knoweth his body vnto ye vtter∣most / & thā how can a man knowe ye state of his mynde surely ynough? Paule who∣me god so loued that he sawe ye mysteryes of the thyrde heuen / yet durst he not iudge hymselfe whiche thyng doutles he wolde haue ben bolde to do / yf he had knowen hymselfe surely ynough. If so spirituall a man whiche discerneth al thing{is} & is hym self to be iudged of no mā / was not surely ynough knowen to hymselfe. How shold we carnall men presume? In cōclusion let him seme to be a very vnprofitable sowdy our / which surely ynough neyther knewe his owne cōpany / neyther his ennemyes hoost.Thou mayst rede of Iason & diuers other how they so∣wed serpentes tethe & how of them sprange Gyant{is} which fought amōge them selfe and slewe eche other. But so it is that one chrysten man hath not warre with an other but with hymselfe / & veryly a great hoost of aduer∣saryes spryng out of our owne flesshe / out of the very bowels & inwarde parte of vs Lykewyse as it is redde in certeyn poetes tales of the bretherne gendred of the erth. And there is so lytell dyfference bytwene our ennemy & our frende / and so harde to knowe the one fro the other / that there is
great ieopardy leest we somwhat recheles or neclygent defende our ennemy in stede of our frende / or hurte our frende in stede of our ennemy. The noble capteyn Iosue was in doute of an aūgell of lyght / saying Art thou on our parte / or of our enemyes parte. Therfore seyng that thou hast takē vpon the warre agaynst thy selfe / and the chefe hope and cōfort of victory is yf thou knowe thy selfe to the vttermost / I wyll paynte a certayne ymage of thy selfe / as it were in a table / & set it before thyne eyes that thou mayst {per}fytly knowe what thou art inwarde and within thy skynne. ¶Of the outward & inward man. Ca .iiij A ManA man is a cer¦teyn mōstrous beest. is than a certeyn monstrous beest cōparte togyder of partes two or thre of great dyuersite. Of a soule as of a certeyn goodly thynge / & of a body as it were a brute or dombe beest. For certeyn∣ly we so greatly excell not al other kyndes of brute beestes in perfytnes of body / but that we in al his natural gyftes are foūde to them inferyours. In our myndes very∣ly we be so celestial and of godly capacite that we may surmount aboue the nature of aungels / and be vnyt / knyt & made one with god. yf thy body had not ben added
to the / thou haddest ben a celestial or god∣ly thyng.God is thau∣tour of peace. yf this mynde had not ben graf∣fed in ye / playnly thou haddest ben a brute beest.The serpente is the maker of debate. These two natures bytwene them selfe so dyuerse / that excellēt werkmā had coupled togyder with blessed cōcorde: but the serpent the ennemy of peace put them asonder agayn with vnhappy discorde:He holdeth the wolfe by the eares / this pro¦uerbe we vse ō thē whiche be in such cōbrāce fro whēs they can in no wyse ryd them selfe The prouerbe this wise sprōg A certen man walked in a fo∣rest vpō whom came a wolfe  he coude make no other shyf but toke hī by the eares whi∣che were so shorte that it was harde to hold them: yet durst he not let thē go nor laye hande on his wepōs for fere of bytyng / but held fast & cry∣ed for helpe. so yt now they neyther can be se{per}ate without very great turment & payne / neyther lyue ioyned togyder without contynual warre And playnly after the cōmun saying eche n the other holdeth the wolfe by ye eares / & eyther may saye very well & accordingly to the other that proper & pleasaunt verse of Catullus. I neyther can lyue with the nor without the. Suche ruffeling wrang∣lynge & trouble they make bytwene them selfe with comberous debate as thynges dyuerse / whiche in dede are but one. The body veryly as he hymselfe is vysyble / so delyteth he in thynges vysyble. As he is mortall / so foloweth he thynges tēporall. As he is heuy / so synketh he downwarde. On the other party the soule myndeful of her celestyall nature enforceth vpwarde with great violence & with a terrible hest stryueth & wrastleth with the heuy burthē of ye erthly body. She despiseth these thin∣ges that are seen / for she knoweth them to
be trāsitory / she seketh true thyng{is} of sub∣staūce which be {per}manent & euer abydyng & bycause she is imortal & also celestial she loueth thyng{is} imortal & celestial / & reioy∣seth with thing{is} of lyke nature / except she be vtterly drowned in the fylth of ye body & by contagiousnes of hym hath gone out of kynde from her natyue gentylnes. And verily neyther Prometheus so moche spo¦ken of among poetes sowed this discorde in vs a porcyō of euery beest myxed to our mynde / neyther our prymatyue & fyrst ma¦kyng gaue it / that is to say / it spronge not in vs naturally / or nature gaue it not to vs ī our first creaciō or natiuite:Poetes fayne {pro}methens to haue made mē of claye and thugh helpe of  to put lyfe in thē & a porcyon of euery bee as the fyrsnes of the lyon the wylynes of the for the fereful∣nes of the hae and so of other beestes. but synne hath euyl corrupte & decayed that whiche was well created / sowynge the poyson of dissenciō bytwene thē that were honestly agreed / for before ye tyme bothe the mynde ruled ye body without besynes / & the body obeyed without grudgīg. Now is it clene cōtrary. The ordre bytwene thē is so trou¦bled / the affections or appetytes of the bo¦dy stryue to go before reason / & reason is in a maner compelled to enclyne & folowe the iudgement of the body.Man is cōpa∣red to a comen welthe or real∣me / where is a kynge / lordes / and the comen people. Thou mayst compare therfore a man properly to a cō∣munaltie / where is debate & parte takyng among them selfe. whiche cōmunaltie for as moche as it is made of sondry kyndes
of men gathered togyder / whiche be of dy¦uerse and contrary appetytes. It can not be auoyded but that moche stryfe shal ryse therin / and partes taken oftentymes / one les the chefe rule and authorite be in one. And he hym selfe be suche a felowe that wyll cōmaūde nothynge but that whiche shall be holsome and profytable for the cō¦mune welthe. And for that cause it must nedes be that he whiche is moost wyse sholde most beare rule. And he nedes must obey that leest perceyueth or vnderstan∣deth. Now there is nothing more folysshe than the rascall or vyle cōmunaltye. And therfore ought they to obey the offycers and rulers / and beare no rule nor offyce them self. The noble estates or suche men whiche be moost auncyent of age / ought to be herde: but so that it lye onely in the kynges arytremēt to make statutes and lawes / whome it is mete to be aduertised to be put in remembraunce or counseyled now and than. But it is not mete that he sholde be cōpelled / or that any man shol∣de maystrye or rule hym. And fynally the kyng obeyeth no man but the laweThe kynge obeyeth the lawe onely. onely The lawe must be correspondent to the orygynall decree of nature or the fyrst ex∣ample of honestye. wherfore yf this ordre subuerted the vnruly cōmunes / and that
ragynge dregges of the cite shall stryue to go before the senyours: or yf y• chefe lordes shall despyse the cōmaūdement of ye kyng / than aryseth perylous sedicyō or diuisyon in our cōmune welth / ye & except the {pro}ui∣syon / decree or auctorite of god socour / all the mater weyeth & enclyneth to extreme mischefe and to vtter destruction.Reasō is kyng in a man. In man reason beareth ye rowme of a kyng. Thou mayst accompt for the chefe lordes certeyn affections & them of the body:The lordes be certaine gentle affections. but yet not all thyng{is} so beestly. Of the whiche kynde is natural reuerence towarde the father & mother / loue to thy brethern / a benyuolēt mynde towarde thy frendes & louers. Cō∣passyō vpon them that be vexed with ad∣uersite or combred with sycknes. Feare of infamy / sclaūder or losse of thy good name Desyre of honest reputacyō / & suche other lyke.The comners be v le appe∣tytes. But suche affectiōs or passiōs which be very greatly disagreyng frō the decrees of reason / & whiche be cast downe & must bow euen to the vylenes of brute beestes. Thynke & reken those to be as it were the most raskal & vile sorte of ye cōmun people Of which kynde & sort be lechery / ryot / en∣uy / & such lyke diseases / which al without excepciō must be kept vnder ī pson / & with punyshmēt as vile & bonde seruaūtes that they rendre to theyr mayster theyr taske &
worke apoynted to them yf they can: but yf not at y• leest yt they do no harme. which thyng{is} Plato perceyuyng by inspiracyon of god / wrote in his booke called Timens how ye sones of goddes had forged in man to theyr owne lykenes two kyndes of sou¦les / the one kynde spirituall & īmortal / the other as it were mortall / in daunger to dy¦uerse {per}turbacions or mocyons of vnquiet¦nes.Foure affecti∣ons of the mynde Ioye sorowe hope and feare. Of whiche the fyrst is voluptuousnes (as he sayth) the bayte wherby men are allured and brought to vngracyousnes or mischefe. The next is sorowe or grefe whi¦che letteth men / & dryueth them from ver∣tue or goodnes. After that feare & presum∣ptuous boldnes / two madde coūseylours: whome accōpanyeth indurate wroth / the desyre of vengeaūce. More ouer flateryng hope with beestly ymaginacyon & know∣lege not gouerned of reason / and worldly loue that layeth handes violently on all thynges. These be almoost the wordes of Plato / and it was not vnknowen to hym the felicitie of this lyfe to be put in refray∣nyng of suche {per}turbacyōs / for he wryteth in the same worke them for to lyue iustly & blessedly / whiche sholde haue ouercōme these appetytes / & them for to lyue vniust∣ly & myserably that sholde be ouercōme of the same. And to that soule whiche is lyke
vnto the nature of god / that is to say / vn∣to reason / as vnto a kyng he appoynted a place in the brayne / as in the chefe toure of our cite:Reason dwel∣leth in the brayne as in the palays. & as thou mayst se the hyghest parte of our body / & nexte to heuen / & most farre fro the nature of a beest / as a thynge veryly whiche is bothe of a very thynne bone / & neyther lade with grosse synewes nor flesshe / but surely furnysshed & apoyn∣ted within & also without / with powers of knowlege / that thrugh the shewyng of them no debate sholde ryse in our cōmune welthe / whiche he sholde not immediatly {per}ceyue: but as touchyng the partes of the mortal soule / that is to wyte / the affectiōs or appetytes as euery one of them is / ey∣ther obedyent / or elles grudgeth agaynst reason. So he remoued them fro hym / for bytwene the necke and the mydriffe he set that parte of the soule / wherin is contey∣ned boldnes / wrath or anger / a sedicyous affection veryly and ful of debate / whiche nedes must be refrayned:The power wherin is con∣tayned wrath and ate. but he is not ve∣ry brutysshe or beestly / & therfore he sepa∣rate hym in a meane space frō the hyghest and lowest / leest yf he had ben to nygh to eyther of them / he wold eyther haue trou¦bled the kynges quietnes / or else corrupte with the contagyousnes of them of the lowest sortes sholde with them also con∣spyre

Thou seest than euydently how that this noble beest man / so goodly a thynge aboue playnly & without any excepcyon endeth in an vn∣reasonable or brute beest. But that noble coūseylour whiche sytteth lyke a kyng or a ruler in his hygh toure / hauynge alway in remembraunce his owne begynnynge thynketh no fylthy nor lowe thynge.The ornamen∣tes of a kynge. And he hath wherby he may be knowen from

In cōclusiō he is crowned with a crowne of golde / for golde in the mystycall lettres moost cōmunly betokeneth wysdom. And the circle betokeneth that the wysdom of the kyng sholde be perfyte & pure in euery parte. These be the very giftes or vertues properly belongyng to kynges. Fyrst that they be very wyse that they do not amysse by reason of errour & lacke of true know∣lege. And thā suche thyng{is} as they knowe to be good & ryght / those onely to wyll & purpose to do that they do nothīg agaynst the decree or iudgement of reason inordy∣natly / frowardly & corruptly. And who so euer lacketh any of these two poynt{is} / coū¦te hym to be not a kynge / that is to saye a ruler / but a robber. ¶Of the diuersite of affections. Ca .v. OUr kyng Reason may be oppressed veryly / yet bycause of y• eternal lawe which god hath grauen in him he can not

To whome yf the resydue of the cō¦munaltie wyll obey / he shall neuer cōmyt any thynge at all eyther to be repented or of any ieopardye: but all thynges shall be admynystred with great moderacyon dis∣cretly / with moche quietnes & tranquilite But as touching affections / veryly Stoi∣ci & PeripoteticiPerypoteticy wyll that affec¦ions shold be reframed only thynkyng th necessary to {pro}∣uoke & to styrre a mā to vertue varye somwhat / though bothe agree in this that we ought to lyue after reason / and not after affections. But StoiciStoici be the folowers of pla¦to which put fi¦licite & blessed∣nes ī the īward cōstācye of the mynde onely / yf a man were so armed with all vtues that he myght be wounded with no darte of ad∣uersite or fortu¦ne sayeng also no outwarde good{is} of fortsie nor outwarde gyft{is} of nature be reqred neces¦saryly vnto fe∣lycyte but the testimony of cō¦sciēce inwarde to be sufficiēt. wyll whan we haue vsed for a sea∣son (as it were a scholemaister to teche vs our fyrst principles) the affections whiche immedyatly are stered vp of the sensuall powers / & now be cōme to iudgemēt and true examinacion what is to be ensued or chosen / & what to be eschewed or forsaken that than we vtterly dampne and forsake them. For than are they (as they saye) not onely no {pro}fyte to veray wysdom / but also hurtfull & noyous. And therfore they wyll that a {per}fyte wyse mā shold lacke all suche mocyons / as diseases or sycknesses of the mynde / ye & scarsely they graūte to a wyse man these fyrst mocions / more gentyl pre∣uētyng reason whiche they call fantasyes or ymaginacyons. Peripotetici teche the affections not to be destroyed vtterly / but to be refrayned / & that the vse of them is
not vtterly to be refused / for bycause they thynke them to be gyuen of nature / as a prycke or a spurre to styre a man to vertue As wrath maketh a man bolde & hardy / & is a mater of fortytude.Perypotetici be Arystoteles folowers whi∣che saye a man apayled with all kīde of vtue & with a pure cōsciēce to be a good man / yet not happy or blessed / for thei wyll beatitude to rest in the acte & outward practise of ver¦tue in {pro}fyting the cōenwelth Therfore saye they / ryches / frēdes / strēgth of body / helth / eloquence and such like to be required neces¦sarily without whiche a man cannot {pro}fyte another / yet wolde they not suche thynges to be desyr for loue of the thing{is} thē selfe but to profyte the comēwelth & for the cōuer∣sacyon of man∣kynde. Enuy is a greate cause of polycy / & in lykewyse of the other Socrates in a certeyn booke that Plato made called Phedo / semeth to agree with Stoici / where he thynketh philosophy to be nothyng else but a meditaciō or practi∣syng of deth / that is to say / that the mynde withdrawe her selfe as moche as she can frō corporal & sensyble thyng{is} / & cōuey her selfe to those thyng{is} whiche be perceyued with reason onely / and not of the sensible powers. Fyrst of al therfore thou must be∣holde & cōsyder diligently all the mocions mouyng{is} or steryng of thy mynde / & haue them surely knowen. Farthermore thou must vnderstāde no mocyons to be so vio∣lent but they may be eyther refrayned of reason / or else turned to vertue. Notwith∣standing I heare euerywhere this conta∣grous opinyon / that some sholde say they be cōstrayned to vices: & on the other syde many for lacke of knowlege of them selfe folowe suche mocyons as the sayinges or decrees of reason: in so moch that what so euer wrath or enuy doth coūseyle or moue them to do / that they call the zele of god: &
as thou seest one cōmun welth to be more vnquiet than another:Some man is more prone to vtue then some so is one man more enclyned or prone to vertue than another whiche differēce cōmeth not of y• diuersite of myndes / but eyther of the īfluence of ce∣lestial bodyes / or els of our {pro}genitours / or els of the bryngyng vp in youth / or of ye cō¦plectiō of the body. The fable of Socrates of carters & horses good & bad is none olde wyues tale: for thou mayst se some to be borne of so moderate / softe / quiet & gentyl disposicyon / so easy to be hādled / to be tur¦ned & wynded / that without besynes they may be enduced to vertue / & renneth for∣ward by theyr own courage without any spurrynge.The rebellion of nature is to be imputed to no man. To some clene contrary thou mayst {per}ceyue to haue happened: a body re¦bellyous as a wylde & kyckyng horse: in so moche yt he whiche tameth him shal haue ynough to do & swete apace / and yet scarse with a very rough bytte / scarse with a wa¦ster & with sharpe spurres can subdue his fyersnes. If any suche one hath hapned to the / let neuer ye rather thy hert fayle ye / but so moche the more feruently set vpon it / thynkyng on this wyse: not that the way of vertue is stopped or shutte vp from the: but a larger mater of vertue to be offred vnto the. But and yf so be that nature hath endued the with a gentyll mynde /
thou art. not therfore streyghtway better than an other man / but happyer / and yet agayn on that maner wyse art thou more happy / so that thou art also more bounde. How be it what is he yt is endued with so happy gyftes of nature / whiche hath not haboūdaūtly thynges ynough to wrestle withal. Therfore in what parte shal be {per}∣ceyued most rage or rebellyō to be / in that parte reason our kynge must watche dili∣gētly.Some vyces folowe the countres. There be certeyn vices appropriate to euery coūtree / as to breake promesse is famylyar to some: to some ryot or {pro}diga∣lite: to some bodyly lust or pleasure of the flesshe / & this happeneth to them by ye dis∣posycyon of theyr countrees. Some vices accōpany the complexion of the bodySome vyces folowe the cō∣plexcion of the body / as appetite & lust for the company of women & the desyre of pleasures & wanton sportes accōpany the sanguyne men. wrath / fyers∣nes / cursed speking foloweth the coleryke men. Grosnes of mynde / lacke of actiuite / sluggishnes of body / & to be gyuē to moch slepe / foloweth the flumatike man.

Some vi∣ces abate & encreace after the age of man / as in youth lust of y• body / wastfull exspen¦ces and rashnes / or folysshe hardynes. In
olde age nyggyshnes or to moche sauyng / waywardnes & auarice.vyces ap∣propryed to kynde. Some vices ther be which shold seme appropriate to kynde as fyersnes to the man / vanite to the wo∣man & desyre of wreke / or to be reuenged. It fortuneth now & thā that nature as it were to make amēdes / recompenseth one disease or sycknes of the mynde / with an other certeyn cōtrary good gyfte or {pro}per∣tye.An euyll dy∣ease of the mynde is som∣tyme recōpen∣sed with an other good gyfte ī {pro}perte. One man is somwhat prone or encly∣ned to pleasure of worldly pastymes / but nothyng angry / nothyng enuyous at all. An other is chaste / but somwhat proude or hygh mynded / somwhat hasty / somwhat to gredy vpon the worlde. And there be whiche be vexed with certeyn wonderfull & fatall vices / with thefte / sacrylege & ho∣micyde: whiche truly thou must withstāde with al thy might / against whose assaulte must be cast a certeyn brasen wall of sure purpose. On the other syde some affectiōs be so nygh neyghbours to vertue / that it is ieopardous leest we sholde be deceyued the diuersitye is so daūgerous & doutfull.Let the vyces whche drawe nere vnto ver∣tue be correc∣ted. These affectiōs are to be corrected & amen¦ded / & may be turned very wel to that ver¦tue whiche they most nygh resēble. There is some man (bycause of example) whiche is soone set a fyre / is hote / at ones {pro}uoked to anger with the leest thyng in ye worlde /
let hym refrayne & sobre his mynde / & he shal be bolde & couragious / nothyng faynt herted or fearfull / he shall be free of speche without dissimulacion. There is another mā somwhat holdīg / or to moche sauyng let hym put to reason / & he shall be called thryfty & a good husband. He that is som¦what flateryng shal be with moderacyon curteys & pleasaunt. He that is obstynate may be constant. Solempnes may be tur¦ned to grauite. And that hath to moche of folysshe toys / may be a good companyon. And after ye same maner of other sōwhat easyer diseases of the mynde / we must be∣ware of this onely yt we cloke not y• vice of nature with the name of vertue / callynge heuynes of mynde grauite / crudelite iustice enuy zele / fylthy nyggyshnes thryfte / fla∣tering good felowshyp / knauery or rybal∣dry vrbanue or mery spekyng.Put not the name of  to ony maner of vyce. The onely waye therfore to felicite is fyrst that thou knowe thy selfe:knowe thy self. more ouer that thou do nothyng after affections / but in al thyng{is} after the iudgemēt of reason:Do all thyng{is} after the Iuge¦ment of reason let reason be soūde & pure & without corrupcion: let not his mouth be out of taste / that is to saye / let hym beholde honest thyng{is}. But thou wylie say: it is an harde thynge that thou cōmaundest: who sayth naye? And veryly the saying of Plato is true: what so euer
hynges be fayre and honest / the same be harde & trauaylfull to obteyne. Nothyng is more harde than that a man shold ouer cōme hymselfe.The sayeng of saynt Ierome. But than is there no grea¦ter rewarde than is felicite. Iheronymus spake that thynge excellently as he dothe al other thynges: nothyng is more happy than a chrysten man / to whom is {pro}mysed the kyngdom of heuē: nothyng is in grea∣ter peryll than he which euery houre is in ieopardye of his lyfe: nothynge is more stronge than he yt ouercōmeth the deuyll: nothynge is more weyke than he that is ouercōme of the flesshe. If thou ponder thyne owne strengthe onely / nothynge is harder than to subdue the flesshe vnto the spiryte. If thou shalte loke on god thy helper / nothynge is more easye. Than now therfore cōceyue with all thy myght and with a feruent mynde the purpose & professyon of the perfyte lyfe. And whan thou hast groūded thy self vpon a sure pur¦pose / set vpon it & go to it lustely: mannes mynde neuer purposed any thyng feruēt∣ly that he was not able to bryng to passe.To be willyng to be a chrystē man is a grete parte of chry∣stendome. It is a greate parte of a chrysten lyfe to desyre with full purpose and with all his herte to be a chrysten man / that thynge whiche at the fyrst syght or metynge / at the fyrst acqueyntaunce or commynge to
shall seme impossyble to be conquered or wonne / in proces of tyme shall be gentyll ynough & with vse easy: in cōclusion with custome it shall be very pleasaunt. It is a very {pro}per saying of Hesiodus.The waye of vertue in pro∣ces wereth easye The waye of vertue is harde at the begynnynge / but after thou hast crept vp to the toppe there remayneth for the very sure quietnes. No beest is so wylde whiche wexeth not tame by the crafte of man. And is there no craft to tame the mynde of hym that is ye tamer of all thynges. That thou myght be hole in thy body / thou canst stedfastly purpose and cōmaunde thy selfe for certeyn yeres to abstayne frō drynkyng of wyne / to for∣beare the flesshe and company of women: whiche thyng{is} the phisician beyng a man p̄scribed to the. And to lyue quietly al thy lyfe canst thou not rule thyne affectiōs / no not a fewe monethes? whiche thyng god that is thy creatour & maker cōmaundeth the to do? To saue thy body from sycknes there is nothyng which thou doest not: to delyuer thy body & thy soule also frō eter∣nall deth doest thou not these thyng{is} whi¦che infideles ethnici & gentyles haue done. ¶Of the inwarde & outwarde man and of the two partes of man / pro∣ued by holy scripture. Caplo .vj.
CErteynly I am ashamed in chrysten mens behalfe / of whome the moost parte folowe as they were brute beestes theyr affections & sensuall appetytes / & in this kynde of warre are so rude & vnexerci∣sed / that they do not as moche as knowe the diuersitie bytwene reason & affections or passyons.Cryst in math∣sayth he came to make not peace but dei¦syon to set the father agaynst the sone / the sone agaynste his father / the wyfe agaynste her husbonde the husbonde agaīst his wife and so forthe. The hystorye meaneth that at somtyme & in some places the husbonde sholde accepte the faythe of christ only & fo¦lowe his holsō doctryne & the wyfe sholde {per}∣secute hym / sō∣tyme the wyfe sholde folowe christe and the husbonde {per}se∣cute her / &in ly¦kewise the son his father and the father the sone. They suppose yt thyng onely to be y• man whiche they se & fele / ye & they thynke nothyng to be besyde the thynges which offre them self to ye sensyble wyttes whan it is nothyng lesse than so. what so euer they greatly coueyte / that they thyn∣ke to be ryght: they call peace / certeyn and assured bōdage / whyle reason oppressed & blynded foloweth whether so euer ye appe¦tyte or affection calleth without resistence This is yt myserable peace whiche Chryst the authour of very peace that knyt two in one came to breke / styryng vp a holsom warre bytwene the father & the sone / by∣twene the husbande & the wyfe / bytwene those thynges whiche fylthy concorde had euyll coupled togyther. Now than let the authoritie of the philosophers be of lytell weyght / excepte those same thyng{is} be all taught in holy scripture / though not with the same wordes. That the philosophers call reason / that calleth Paule somtyme ye spiryt / somtyme ye inner man / otherwhyle
the lawe of the mynde.Reason / the spyryte / the inner man / the lawe of the mynde / be one thīg with paul That they call af∣fectiō / he calleth somtyme the flesshe: som∣tyme ye body: an other tyme the vtter man and the lawe of the mres. walke (sayth Paule) in the spiryte / & ye shall not accom¦plysshe the desyres & lustes of the flesshe / for the flesshe desyreth contrary to the spi∣ryte / & the spiryte contrary to the flesshe / that ye can not do what so euer thyng{is} ye wolde.Affection / the flesh / the body the vtter man / the lawe of the membres / be one thynge with paule. And in an other place. yf ye shall lyue after the flesshe / ye shal dye. yf ye shal walkyng in the spiryte mortifye the dedes of the flesshe / ye shall lyue.Peace / lyfe / ly∣berte of soule / is the warre / deth / bondage of the body. Certeyn this is a newe chaūge of thyng{is} / that peace shold be sought in warre / and warre in peace: in deth lyfe / & in lyfe deth: in bondage liberty in liberty bondage. For Paule wryteth in an other place. I chastise my body & bryng hym in to seruitude. Heare also the liberty If ye be led with the spiryt / ye be not sub∣iect to ye lawe. And we haue not (sayth he) receyued agayn the spiryte of bondage in feare / but the spiryte whiche hath elected vs to be ye chyldren of god. He sayth in an other place. I se an other lawe in my mē∣bres repugnynge agaynst the lawe of my mynde / subduyng me to the lawe of synne whiche lawe is in my membres. Thou re∣dest with hym also of ye vtter man whiche is corrupte / and of the inner man whiche
is renewed daye by daye. Plato put two soules to be in one man. Paule in one mā maketh two men so coupled togyder / that neyther without other can be outher in heuen or hell:A double man. & agayn so separate that the deth of the one sholde be lyfe of the other. To the same (as I suppose) perteyn those thyng{is} whiche he wrote to the Chorintes The fyrst man was made in to a lyuynge soule. The laste Adam was made in to a spiryte quyckenynge:The last adm is Chryste. but that is not fyrst whiche is spirituall / but that whiche is ly¦uynge: than foloweth that whiche is spi∣rituall. The fyrst man came of the erthe hym selfe terrestryall. The seconde came from heuen and he hymselfe celestial. And bycause it sholde more euydently appere these thynges to pertayne not onely to Chryst and Adam / but to vs all / he added saying. As was the man of the erth / suche are terrestryall & erthly persons. As is the celestial man / suche are the celestial {per}sons Therfore as we haue borne the ymage of the erthly man: euen so now let vs beare the ymage of the celestyall man. For this I saye bretherne that flesshe & blode shall not possesse the kyngdom of heuē / nor cor∣rupcion shall possesse incorrupcion. Thou {per}ceyuest playnly how in this place he cal∣leth Adam made of erth that thyng which
in an other place he calleth the flesshe and the vtter mā whiche is corrupte.Iacob fygu∣reth the spiryt Esau the fleshe. And this same thynge certaynly is also the body of deth / wherwith Paule agreued cryed out Oh wretche that I am / who shall delyuer me from this body of deth.Iacob & Esau the sōes of Isac & Rebekca fou∣ghte in theyr mothers bly she  with god / & he answerd of thē shall sprynge two  peo¦ple which shol∣de euer be at ware but the  shold  the yonger Esau was fyrst borne & Iacob folowed hol∣dge Esau fast by the . Afterwarde  a  solde to Iacob his  for  of . when Isac was olde he hade Esau to ky some ve∣ that I mygnt  of it & ysse the or I dye. In conclusion Paule declaryng the moost dyuerse fruyte of the flesshe & of the spiryte wryteth in an other place / saying. He that soweth in his flesshe shal repe or mowe of his flesshe cor¦rupcyon: but he that soweth in the spiryte shall repe or mowe of the spiryte lyfe eter∣nal. This is ye olde debate of two twynnes Iacob & Esau / whiche before they were brought forth in to lyght wrastled within the cloysters of the mothers belly / & Esau veryly caught frō Iacob the preemynence of byrth / & was fyrst borne: but Iacob pre∣uented him agayn of his fathers blessing. That whiche is carnall cōmeth fyrst / but the spiritual thynge is euer best. The one was reed / hygh coloured and rough with heare the other smothe. The one vnquiet and a hunter: the other reioysed in domesti¦call quietnes. And the one also for hunger solde the right that {per}teyned to hym by in∣herytaunce / in yt he was the elder brother / whyle he enced with a vyle prest and re∣warde of voluptuousnes / fell from his na∣tyue libertye in to the bondage of synne.
The other procured by craft of grace that whiche belonged not to hym by ryght of law.But by the de∣uyce & meanes of the mother Iacob stale a∣waye his fa∣thers blessyng and was made lorde of his brother. Bitwene these two brethern though bothe were borne of one bely / & at one ty∣me / yet was there neuer ioyned {per}fyte con¦corde / for Esau hateth Iacob / Iacob for his parte though he quyteth not hate for hate / yet he fleeth & hath euer Esau suspe∣cted / neyther dare cōme within his daun∣ger.Then came Esau waylyng to haue a bles∣synge / then an¦swered the fa∣ther. I haue made hym thy lorde. To the lykewyse what so euer thyng affection counseyleth or {per}suadeth / let it be suspected. For the doutfull credence of the counseylour Iacob onely sawe the lorde.After that Ia∣cob sawe our lorde face to face. Esau as one delytyng in blode lyueth by the sworde. To cōclude whan the mother asked counseyle of the lorde he answered: the elder shall be seruaunt to y• yonger: but the father Isaac added:in good mē the spirite whiche is fygured by Iacob ruleth / & the body obey¦eth. In euyll men the flesshe whiche is syg∣nyfed by Esau ruleth of hym the emyre of down yn of the spyryte. thou Esau shalt do seruyce to thy brother: and the tyme shall cōme whan thou shalt shake of & loose his yoke from thy necke. The lord {pro}phecyeth of good & obedyent persones / the father of euyl & disobedyent {per}sones. The one decla¦reth what ought to be done of al men: the other tolde afore hande what y• most parte wolde do. Paule wylleth that the wyfe be obedyēt to her husbāde: for better is / sayth scripture) the iniquite of the man  thā the goodnes of y• woman. Our Eue is carnal affection / whose eyes y• subtyle & crafty ser¦pent
dayly troubleth & vexeth with tēpta∣cyon / & she is ones corrupte gothe forth & seaseth not to {pro}uoke & entyce the man al∣so thrugh consent to be parte taker of the iniquitye or myscheuous dede.The woman here signyfy∣eth a carnall person whiche chaunged by grace of fayth foloweth the bidding of the spyryte in eue¦ry thynge. But what redest thou of the newe woman / of her I meane that is obedyent to her husbande / I wyl put hatred bytwene the (meanyng the serpēt & the woman) and bytwene her generacion & thyne / she shall trede downe thy heed / & thou shalte laye awayte to her hele.The woman sy¦gureth affectiō The mā reson. The serpent was cast downe on his brest / the dethe of Chryst weyked his vio∣lence / he now onely lyeth awayte to her hele pryuely.Abraham had  son by his seruaūte Agar whose name was Ismaell & an other b his wyse Sara whōe he caled Isaac. Ismael was moche el∣der then Isac & in playeng to¦gyther mysen∣treated Isac wherwith sara displeased bad Abraham put away thy ser∣uaunt Agar with her son al¦so which Abra¦ham was loth to do / but god cōman̄ded him to obey his wyues request. But the womā thrugh grace of fayth chaunged as it were in to a man boldly tredeth down his venymous heed Grace is encreased and the tyranny of the flesshe is dymynysshed. whan Sara was mynysshed & decayed / than dyd Abraham (god beynge the authour) growe and en∣crease. And than she calleth hym not hus∣bande but lorde / neyther yet coude she op∣teyn to haue a chylde before she was dryed vp & bareyn. what I pray the brought she forth at the last to her lord Abraham now in her olde days / ye & past chylde bearyng. Ueryly Isaac yt is to say ioye / for as soone as affectiōs haue wexed olde & are weyked in a man / than at the last springeth vp the
blissed trāquilite of an īnocēt mynde / with sure quietnes of ye spiryt / as it were a cōti∣nual feest. And as y• father let not his wyfe haue her pleasure without aduisemēt: euē so hath the sportyng of y• chyldren togyder suspecte / I meane of Isaac with Ismaell. Sara wolde not ye chylde of a bondwomā & the chylde of a free womā sholde haue cō¦uersacyon togyder at yt age: but yt Ismael (whyle as yet youth is feruēt) shold be ba¦nisshed out of p̄sence / lest vnder a colour of pastyme he might entice & drawe vnto his owne maners Isaac yet yonge & tender of age.Let youth ee the occasyon of synne. Now was Sara an olde wyfe & now had brought forth Isaac / yet mystrusteth Abrahā except the answere of god had ap∣proued his wyues coūseyle / he is not sure of the woman vntyll he herde of god. In all thyng{is} yt Sara hath sayd to the / heare her voyce. O happy olde age of them in whome so mortyfyed is the carnall man made of the erth / that he in nothynge be∣syeth the spiryte / which agremēt whether in al thyng{is} {per}fyte may happē to any man in this lyfe or no / veryly I dare not affer∣me / {per}aduenture it were not expedient / for euen vnto Paule was gyuē vnquietnes & trouble of the flessh yt messenger of sathan to vex him withal.Trouble of the flesh is expe∣dyent to the exercyse of ver¦tue & custody of humylyte. And at ye thyrde tyme he despred to haue yt messenger taken frō him
Than had he none other answere of god but onely this. Paule my grace is sufficiēt for the. For strengthe is wrought & made {per}fyte in weyknes. In dede this is a newe kynde of remedy. Paule leest he sholde be proude is tempted with pryde / yt he myght be stronge in Chryst: he is compelled to be weyke in hymselfe: he bare the treasure of celestial reuelaciōs in a vessel of erth / that the excellencye sholde depende of ye myght of god / & not of hymself / whiche one exam¦ple of thapostle putteth vs in remēbraūce & warneth vs of many thyng{is}.when thou art tempted fall to prayer. Fyrst of all that whan we be assaulted of vyces / īme∣diatly. we must gyue our selfe to prayer a∣gayne / and desyre helpe of god.Hydra was a serpente with many heddes of whiche one was immortall with her fou∣ghte hercules & whē he smoe of one heed.  range for it / At the laste he fought with a bournīg sword and so sered he theyr neckes that they  no more rynge. More ouer that temptacions to {per}fyte men are not pe¦rylous: but also are very expedyent to the contynuaūce & preseruyng of vertue. Last of al whan al other thyng{is} are full tamed than the vice of vaynglory euen in ye chefe tyme of vertues layeth awaite: & this vice to be as it were Hidra / whome Hercules fought withall a quycke monstre longe of lyfe & fruytful / by reason of her own woū∣des / which at ye last ende whan all labours be ouercōme can scarse be destroyed. Ne∣uertheles contynuall & īportunate labour ouercōmeth al thyng. In the meane tyme whyle thy mynde rageth & is vexed with
vehemēt {per}turbacyons / by all maner mea∣nes thrust togyder / drawe downe / holde & bynde this ProtheusProtheus that is to say affecti¦on must be hol∣de downe. with tough bandes whyle he goth aboute to chaūge hymselfe in to all maner monstres and affections of thyng{is} / in to fyre / in to the shappe of some terrible wylde beest & in to a rnyng ryuer vntyll he cōme agayne in to his owne na¦tural lykenes and shappe. what is so lyke ProtheusProtheus is a god whiche chaūgeth hym to all maner fa¦cyons / he is a grete {pro}phesier but he wyl tell nothyng with∣out cōpulyon. as is the affections & appetites of fooles whiche drawe them somtyme in to beestly and bodyly lust / somtyme in to mad ire or wrath / otherwhyle ī to poyson enuy & straunge fascions of vices. Agreeth it not well that ye excellent connyng poete Uirgil sayd:Uyrgyll reher∣seth of arestew which had lost his beest{is} & cō∣selled with his mother rene a goddes how he myght resto¦re thē agayne she sent him to {pro}the & taught  craft to bind hym vntyll he had tolde the trouthe / then taught {pro}theus how of a deed & puerified oxe they myght be restored again there shal dyuerse similitudes and fascyons of wylde beestes delude and mocke / for sodeynly he wyll be a fearfull swyne & foule tygre / & a dragon full of sea¦les / & a lyonesse with a reed mane / or shall counterfeyte the quycke sounde of ye slame of fyre: but here haue in remēbraūce what foloweth. The more he chaungeth hym self in to al maner of similitudes / the more my sone (sayth Uirgil) strayne thy tough bādes. And also bycause we shall not nede to returne agayne to fables of poet{is} / thou shalt by thensample of the holy patriarke Iacob lerne to endure & to wrastle lustely all nyght vnto the mornynge of the helpe
of god begin to giue light.Iacob wrastled with an aūgell all nyght. whō in the morning he wolde not let go vntyll he had blyssed hym in the sa∣me place / the aungell smote his thygh and the synewes shranke so that Iacob halted on the one leg after that. And thou shalt say / I wyll not let the departe except thou shalt haue gyuē me thy blessyng fyrst. But what rewarde of his victory & greate ver∣tue that myghty & excellent stronge wrast¦ler obteyned / it is certaynly very {pro}fytable to heare. Fyrst of al god blessed hym ī that same place. For euermore after that the temptacyon is ouercōme / a certeyn syngu¦ler encrease of diuyne grace is added vnto a man / wherby he shold be an other tyme moche more surely armed thā he was be∣fore agaynst the assaulte of his ennemye. Farthermore thrugh touchyng of ye thigh the synewe of the cōquerour wexed wyd∣dred & shronke / & he began to halte on the one fote. God curseth them by the mouth of his {pro}phete whiche halt on bothe theyr fete / that is to say / them which wyl bothe lyue carnally / & please god also. But they be happy in whom carnal affections be so mortifyed / that they beare & leue moost of all to the ryght fote / that is / to the spiryte Fynally his name was chaunged: of Ia∣cob he was made Israel / & of a besy wrast¦ler a quiet {per}sone. After that thou hast cha¦stysed thy flesshe or thy body / & crucyfyed hym with vices and concupiscences / than shall trāquillite and quietnes without all trouble cōme vnto the / that thou mayst
be at leyer to beholde the lorde / that thou mayst taste & fele yt the lorde is pleasaūt & swete / for yt thynge is signified by Israell.God appere after a grete tempest. God is not seen ī fyre / neyther in the horle wynde & troublous rage of temptacyon / but after the tempest of the deuyl (yf so be that thou shalt endure perseueraūtly) fo∣loweth the hyssynge of a thynne ayre or wynde of spirituall cōsolacyon.He hath wal∣ked .xl. dayes & xl. nyghtes vn∣to the mounte of Orll where he prayed in a caue / A voyce had hym come forth & stande afore god / and then came a grete wynde then a quakīge then fyre / & god not in the fyre then folowed the hyssynge of a thynne ayre / and then appered god to Elyas. After that ayre hath brethed quietly vpon the / than applye thyne inwarde eyes / & thou shalte be Israel / and shalt say with hym. I haue seen my lorde / and my soule ys made hole. Thou shalte se hym that sayd: no flesshe shall se me / that is to say / no carnall man. Consyder thy selfe dylygently / yf thou be flesshe / thou shalte not se god: yf thou se hym not / thy soule shall not be made hole Take hede therfore that thou be a spirite. ¶Of thre partes of man / the spiryte / the soule / and the flesshe. Caplo .vij. THese thynges afore writen had ben and that a greate deale more than suffycyent:Origene in his fyrst boke vpō the epystle of paule to the ro¦mains maketh this diuysion. neuerthelesse that thou mayst be somwhat more sensybly knowen vnto thy selfe / I wyll reherse compendyously the dyuysyon of a man / after the descrip∣cyon of Orygene / for he foloweth Paule
maketh thre partes / the spiryte / the soule and the flesshe / whiche thre partes Paule ioyned togyder / wrytyng to the Thessalo¦icēces. That your spiryte (sayth he) your soule & your body may be kepte clene and vncorrupte / that ye be not blamed or accu¦sed at the cōmyng of our lord Iesu Chryst And Esaias (leuing out the lowest parte) maketh mencyon of two / saying my soule shall desyre & longe for the in the nyght / ye & in my spiryte & my hert strynges I wyll wake in the mornynges for to please the. Also Daniell sayth / let the spiryt{is} & soules of good men laude god. Out of the which places of scripture Origene gathereth not agaynst reason the thre peticions of man / that is to wite / the body / otherwise called the flessheThe fleshe. / the most vile parte of vs / wher in the malycyous serpent thrugh original trespace hath wryten the lawe of synne / wherwithall we be {pro}uoked to fylthynes. And also yf we be ouercom we be coupled and made one with the deuyll. Than the spirytThe spyryte. wherin we represent ye similitude of the nature of god / in which also our most blessed maker after the original paterne & example of his owne mynde hath grauen the eternal lawe of honestie with his fyn∣ger / that is with his spiryte ye holy goost. By this parte we be knyt to god / & made
one with him. In the thyrde place & in the myddes bytwene these two he putteth the soule / whiche is part taker of the sensyble wyttes & natural mocions.Thou must re∣mēbre the soul & the spirite to be one substaūce / but in the soule be many powers as wit wyll / memory: but the spyrite is the moost pure & fardest fro corruption the moost high & diuine portiō of our soule. She is in a se∣dicious & wranglyng cōmune welth must nedely ioyne her selfe to ye one parte or the other / she is troubled of bothe partes / she is at her libertie to whether parte she wyl enclyne. If she forsake the flesshe & conuey her selfe to the partes of the spiryt / she her selfe shal be spiritual also. But & yf she cast her selfe downe to ye appetites of the body she shall growe out of kynde in to the ma¦ner of ye body. This is it that Paule ment wrytyng to the Chorintes. Remembre ye not that he yt ioyneth hymselfe to an har∣lot is made one body with her:Capar of god imediatly whe¦rein god hath grauē the law of honesty that is to saye the lawe naturall after the simili¦tude of the eter¦nal lawe of his owne mynde. but he that cleueth to the lord / is one spiryt with him He calleth the harlot the frayle & weyke parte of the man. This is that pleasaūt & flateryng womā of whome thou redest in the seconde chapiter of prouerbes on this wyse. That thou mayst be delyuered from a straunge woman & from a woman of an other coūtree / whiche maketh her wordes swete & pleasaūt / & forsaketh her husbande to whome she was maryed in her youth / & hath forgete the {pro}messe she made to her lorde god: her house boweth downe to deth and her path is to hell. who so euer gothe
in to hell / shall neuer returne: nor shall at∣tayne the path of lyfe. And in the .vj. chap. That thou mayst kepe the frō an euyl wo¦man / & frō the flateryng tong of a straūge woman / let not thy hert melt on her beau¦ty / be not thou deceyued with her beckes / for the pryce of an harlot is scarse worth a pece of breed: but the womā taketh away the precious soule of the man. Dyd he not whan he made mencyon of the harlot / the herte & the soule expresse by name thre par¦tes of the man. Agayne in the .ix. chapiter. A folysshe woman euer bablynge & full of wordes / swīmyng in pleasures / & hath no lernynge at all / sytteth in the dores of her house vpon a stole in an hygh place of the cite to call them that passe by the waye & be goyng in theyr iourney / who so euer is a chylde / let hym turne in to me: & she sayd vnto a foole & an hertles {per}son: water that is stolen is pleasaūter / & breed that is hyd pryuely is sweter. And he was not ware that there be gyaūtes / & theyr gestes be in the bottom of hell. For who so euer shall be coupled to her / he shall descēde in to hell And who so euer shal departe frō her / shal be saued. I besech the with what colours coude more workmanly haue be paynted and set out eyther the venymous entyce∣mentes and wanton pleasures of the poy¦soned
flesshe / prouokyng & temptynge the soule to fylthynes of synne / or else the im∣portunytye of the same cryenge and stry∣uyng agaynst the spiryte / or the wretched ende that foloweth whan she dothe ouer∣cōme the spiryte. To conclude therfore / the spiryte maketh vs goddes / the flesshe maketh vs beestes: the soule maketh vs men: the spiryte maketh vs relygyous / obedyent to god / kynde and mercyfull. The flesshe maketh vs despysers of god / disobedyent to god / vnkynde and cruell. The soule maketh vs indifferent / that is to saye / neyther good nor badde. The spi∣ryte desyreth celestyal thynges: the flesshe desyreth delycate and pleasaunt thynges. The soule desyreth necessary thynges: the spiryte caryeth vs vp to heuen: the flesshe thrusteth vs downe to hell. To the soule nothynge is imputed / that is to saye / it dothe neyther good nor harme: what so euer is carnall or spryngeth of the flesshe that is fylthy: what so euer is spirytuall procedyng of the spiryte / that is pure / per¦fyte & godly: what so euer is naturall & {pro}∣cedeth of the soule / is a meane & indifferēt thynge / neyther good nor bad. wylt thou more playnly haue the diuersytye of these thre {per}tes shewed vnto the as it were with mannes fynger? certeynly I wyll assay.
Thou doest reuerence to thy father & mo∣ther:That which is naturall deserueth no rewarde. thou louest thy brother / thy chyldren & thy frende: it is not of so great vertue to do these thyng{is} / as it is abhomynable not to do them. For why sholdest thou not be∣yng a chrysten man do that thyng whiche the gentyles by the techyng of nature do / ye whiche brute beestes do? That thynge that is natural shall not be imputed vnto meryte. But thou art cōme in to suche a strayte case that eyther ye reuerēce toward thy father must be despised / ye inward loue toward thy children must be subdued / the benyuolēce to thy frende set at nought / or god must be offded. what wilt thou now do? The soule standeth in the myddes by∣twene two wayes: the flesshe cryeth vpon her on ye one syde / the spiryte on the other syde. The spiryte sayth / god is aboue thy father: thou ar boūde to thy father but for thy body onely. To god thou art bounde for all thynge that thou hast. The flesshe the in remembraunce / saying. Ex∣cepte thou obey thy father / he wyll dishe∣ryte the / thou shalt be called of euery man an vnkynde & vnnaturall chylde / loke to thy {pro}fyte haue respecte to thy good name and fame. d eyther dothe not se / or else dissimuleth & wyttyngly loketh besyde it / or at ye leest wyll be soone pacifyed agayn.
Now thy soule doubteth / now she waue∣reth hyther and thyther / to whether of ey¦ther parte she turne her selfe.The soule doubteth. That same shall she be / that that thynge is she went vnto. yf she obey the harlot / that is to say the flesshe (the spirite despised) she shall be one body with the flesshe. But & yf she lyft vp her selfe and ascende to the spiryte (the flesshe set at nought) she shal be trāsposed & chaūged to the nature of the spiryte. Af∣ter this maner accustome to examyne thy selfe prudētly. The errour of those men is exceding great whiche oftētymes weneth that thynge to be {per}fyte vertue & goodnes whiche is but of nature & no vertue at al.Some affecti∣ons be dysgy∣sed with visers of vertue. Certeyn affections somwhat honest in ap¦perance / & as they were disguised with vi∣sers of vertue / deceyueth neclygēt {per}sones. The iudge is hasty and cruell agaynst the felon:An example of the Iudge. or him that hath trespaced the lawe he semeth to hymselfe cōstant & of grauite vncorrupte and a man of good cōscyence / wylt thou haue this man discussed? If he fauour his owne mynde to moche and fo∣low a certeyn natural rygorousnes with∣out any grefe of mynde / {per}aduenture with some pleasure or delectacyon: yet not le∣nyng from the offyce & duty of a iudge / let hym not forthwith stande to moche in his owne conceyte: it is an indifferent thynge
that he dothe. But yf he abuse the lawe for pryuate hate or lucre / now it is carnall that he dothe / and he cōmytteth murder: but & yf he fele great sorowe in his mynde bycause he is compelled to destroye and kyll hym / whom he had leuer amended and saued. Also yf he enioyne punysshmēt accordynge to the trespace with suche a mynde / with suche sorowe of herte / as the father cōmaūdeth his syngulerly beloued sone to be cutte / launced or seared: of this maner shall it be spirituall that he dothe. The moost parte of men thrugh pronesse of nature and some specyall propertye / ey∣ther reioyse or abhorre certayne thynges.Some men re∣ioyce naturally with some cer∣teyne thynges. Some there be whom bodyly lust tikleth not at al: let not them by & by ascrybe that vnto vertue which is an indifferēt thyng / for not to lacke bodyly lust / but to ouer∣cōme bodyly lust is the office of vertue. An other man hath a pleasure to fast / a plea∣sure to be at masse / a pleasure to be moche at chyrche & to say a great deale of psalmo∣dye:The rule of rue pyte. examyne after this rule that thynge whiche he dothe: yf he regarde the cōmune fame or aduaūtage / it smelleth of ye flesshe and not of the spiryte: yf he do folowe but his owne inclynacyon (for he dothe that whiche pleaseth his owne mynde) than he hathe not wherof he so ought greatly
to reioyce / but rather wherof he ought to feare.Let a christen man marke this well. Beholde a ieopardous thynge vn∣to thy self. Thou prayest and iudgest hym that prayeth not. Thou fastest / and con∣dempnest hym that fasteth not. who so euer dothe not that thou doest / thou thyn∣kest thy selfe better than he: beware leest thy falle perteyne to thy flesshe. Thy bro∣ther hathe nede of thy helpe / thou in the meane space mumblest in thy prayers vn∣to god / & wylt not be knowen of thy bro∣thers necessite. God shall abhorre these prayers: for how shall god heare ye whyle thou prayest / whā thou whiche art a man caust not fynde in thy herte to heare an other man. Perceyue also an other thyng Thou louest thy wyse for this cause one∣ly that she is thy wyfe: Thou doest no greate thynge / for this thynge is cōmune as well to infydeles as to the: Or elles thou louest her for none other thynge but bycause she is to the pleasaunt and dele∣ctable. Thy loue nowe draweth to thy flesshwarde. But thou louest her for this thynge chefely / bycause thou hast percey∣ued in her the ymage of Chryst / whiche is godly reuerence / modestye / sobrenes / cha∣stite:The chaste loue towarde thy wyfe. and now louest not her in her selfe but in Chryste: yea rather Chryste in her. After this maner louest spirytually. Not∣withstandyng
we shall saye more of these thynges in theyr places. ¶Certayne generall rules of true chrysten lyuynge. Ca .viij. NOw for bicause we haue opened as me semeth ye waye (how so euer we haue done it) and haue p̄pared as it were certeyn stuffe and mater vnto the thynge whiche was purposed. we must haste to that whiche remayneth / leest it sholde not be an Enchiridionridion. / that is to saye / a lytell treatise hansom to be caryed in a mannes hāde / but rather a great volume / we wyll enforce to gyue certeyn rules / as they we∣re certeyn poyntes of wrastling / by whose guyding & conueyaunce / as it were by the guydyng of ye threde of Dedalus men may easely plunge vp out of the blynde errours of this worlde / as out of Labirinth{us} / whi∣che is a certeyn comberous maze / & cōme vnto the pure and clere lyght of spirituall lyuyng. None other scyence is there whi∣che hath not her rules. And shal the crafte of blessed lyuynge onely / be without the helpe of all maner p̄cept{is}? the crafte of vertue. There is with∣out fayle a certeyn crafte of vertuous ly∣uynge and a discyplyne / in whiche who so euer exercyse themselfe manfully / them
shall fauour that holy spiryte / whiche is the promoter and brynger forwarde of all holy enforcemēt and godly purposes. But who so euer sayth / departe frō vs we wyll not haue ye knowlege of thy wayes: these men the mercy of god refuseth / bycause they fyrst haue refused knowlege. These rulers shall be taken partly of the persone of god / of the persone of the deuyll / and of our persone / partly of thynges / that is to saye / of vertues and vices / and of thynges to them annexed / partely of the mater or stuffe wherof vertues or vices be wrought They shall profyte synglerly agaynst thre euyl thyng{is} remaynyng of original synne For though baptym haue wyped awaye the spotte / yet there cleueth styll in vs a certeyn thynge of the olde disease lefte be∣hynde / bothe partly for the custody of hu∣mylytye / and also for the mater & encrease of vertue. These be blyndnes / the flesshe and infyrmytye or weykenes. Blyndnes with the myst of ignoraūce dymmeth the iudgemēt of reason. For partly the synne of our fyrst progenytours hath not a lytel dusked that so pure a lyght of the counte∣naunce / resemblaūce or similitude of god / which our creatour hath shewed vpon vsNota. And moche more corrupte bryngynge vp lewde cōpany / frowarde affections / dark∣nes

Than as I began / blyndnes causeth that we in the election of thyng{is} be as good as halfe blynded & deceyued with errour / in the stede of the best / folowyng the worste / preferrynge thynges of lesse valure before thynges of greater pryce. The flesshe trou¦bleth ye affection so moche / yt euen though we knowe what is best / yet loue we ye con¦trary. Infirmytye & weyknes maketh vs that we beyng ouercōme eyther with te∣dyousnes or with temptacion / forsake the vertue whiche we had ones gotten & at∣tayned. Blyndnes hurteth the iudgemēt the flesshe corrupteth the wyll / infirmytie weyketh constancye.Euyll must be knowen & had . The fyrst poynt ther¦fore is that thou can discerne thyng{is} to be refused from thynges to be accepte: & ther¦fore blyndnes must be take away leest we stumble or stager in the election of thyng{is} The nexte is / that thou hate the euyll as soone as it is ones knowen / & loue that whiche is honest and good: and in this thynge the flesshe must be ouercōme / leest contrary to ye iudgement of the mynde we sholde loue swete and delectable thynges in the stede of holsom thyng{is}. The thyrde is / that we cōtynue in these thyng{is} which
we began well:Perseyuerāce must be had. and therfore the weyknes must be vnderset / leest we forsake the way of vertue with greater shame than yf we had ben neuer aboute to walke or entre therin. Ignoraūce must be remedied / that thou mayst se which way to go. The flesh must be tamed / leest she lede the asyde out of the hygh waye / ones knowen in to by∣pathes. weyknes must be conforted / leest whan thou hast entred in to the strayte way thou sholdest eyther faynte or stoppe or turne backe agayne / or leest after thou hast ones set thy hande to ye plowe sholdest loke backwarde / but sholdest reioyce as a strong gyaūt to haste the way / euer stret∣chyng forth thy self to those thing{is} which be afore the without remēbraūce of those thyng{is} which be behynde the / vntyll thou mayst lay hande on the reward apoynted & on ye crowne {pro}mysed to them yt cōtynue vnto these thre thing{is}: therfore we shal ap¦plye certeyn rules accordyng to our lytell power. ¶Agaynst the euyll of ignoraunce the fyrst rule. Caplo .ix. BUt in asmoche as fayth is the onely gate vnto Chryst / the fyrst rule must be that thou iudge very wel bothe of hym and also of scripturewe must Iudge wel of scripture gyuen by his spiryt / &
that thou byleue not with mouth onely / not fayntly / not neclygently / not doutful∣ly / as the cōmune raskall of chrysten men do: but let it be set fast & īmouable thrugh out all thy brest / not one iote to be contey¦ned in them that apperteyneth not great∣ly vnto thy helth. Let it moue y• nothyng at all that thou seest a great parte of men so lyue / as though heuen & hell were but some maner of tales of olde wyues / to fea¦re or flater yong chyldren withal: but by∣leue thou surely & make no haste / though the hole worlde sholde be madde at ones / though the elementes sholde be chaūged / though the aūgels sholde rebell: yet veri∣te can not lye / it can not but cōme whiche god told before shold cōme. yf thou bileue he is god / thou must byleue nedes that he is true also / & on this wyse thynke with∣out waueryng / nothyng to be so true / no∣thynge to be so sure / & without doubte of the thing{is} which thou hearest with thyne cares / which thou p̄sently beholdest with thyne eyes / which thou handlest with thy handes / as those thynges be true whiche thou redest in the scriptures / that god of heuen / that is to saye verite gaue by inspi¦racyon whiche the holy {pro}phetes brought forth / and the blode of so many martyrs hath approued: vnto whiche now so ma∣ny
hondreth yeres the consent of all good men hathe agreed and set theyr seales: whiche Chryst here beyng in flesshe bothe taught in his doctryne and expresly repre∣sented or coūterfeyted in his maners and lyuyng. Unto which also myracles beare wytnes / the deuylles confesse & so moche byleue / that they quake and tremble for feare. Last of al whiche be so agreable vn¦to the equite of nature / whiche so agree bytwene themselfe / & be euery where lyke themselfe / whiche so rauyssheth the myn∣des of them that attende / so moueth and chaungeth them. If these so great tokens agre vnto them alone / what the deuylles madnes is it to doubte in the fayth? ye of those thyng{is} passed thou mayst easely con¦iecte what shall folowe: how many and great thynges also / how incredyble to be spoken dyd the prophetes tell before of Chryst: whiche of these thynges came not to passe? shall he in other thynges deceyue whiche in them deceyued not? In conclu∣syon the {pro}phetes lyed not / & shall Chryst the lorde of prophetes lye? If with this & suche other lyke cogytacyons thou often stere vp the flame of fayth / and than fer∣uently desyre of god to encrease thy fayth I shall meruayle yf thou canst be any lon¦ge tyme an euyll man. For who is all to¦gyder
so vnhappy & full of myschefe that wolde not departe frō vices / yf so be he vt∣terly beleued that with these momentany pleasures / besyde the vnhappy vexariō of conseyence & mynde is purchased also eter¦nall punyshmentes. On the other syde / yf he surely byleued for this temporall & ly∣tell worldly vexacyon to be rewarded or recompensed to good men an hondreth folde ioye of pure cōscyence presently: and at the last lyfe immortall. ¶The seconde rule. Caplo .x. LEt the fyrste poynt be therfore that thou doubte in no wyse of ye {pro}myses of god. The nexte yt thou go vnto ye waye of lyfe / not slouthfully / not feerfully:we must entre in to the wave of helthe or sal¦acion boldly. and with a o∣cōde courage. but with sure purpose / with all thy hert / with a cōfident mynde / & (yf I may so say) with suche mynde as he hath that wolde rather fyght than drynke: so that thou be redy at all houres for Chrystes sake to lese bothe lyfe & goodes. A slouthfull man wyl & wyl not. The kyngdom of heuen is not goten of necligent & recheles {per}sones / but playn∣ly reioyseth to suffre violence: And violent {per}sones violētly obteyne it. Suffre not the affection of them whome thou louest syn∣gularly to holde the backe hastyng thyder
warde:Egypte sygny¦fyeth bōdage / afflyccion / vy∣ces & blyndnes let not the pleasures of this worlde call the backe agayne: let not the care of thy housholde be any hyndraunce to the. The cheyne of worldly besynesse must be cut asonder / for surely it can not otherwise be losed.The Israel yt being a hōg in desert wys∣shed to go back agayn to Egip¦te / sayenge to Moyes / howe happy were we when we sate there by the pottes of fleshe Egypt must be forsaken in suche a maner that thou turne not agayn in thy mynde at any tyme vnto the pottes of the flesshe. Sodoma must be forsaken vtterly hastely yea & at ones: it is not lawfull to loke backe. The woman loked backe she was turned in to yt ymage of a stone. The man had no leyser any where to abyde in any region / but was cōmaunded to haste in to the mountayne / oneles that he had leuer to haue perysshed.Lot was cōmā¦ded to departe hastely out of Sodoma & not to loke backe / his wyse loked back & was to∣ned in to a saston / so we may neyther with the Israelyte desyre to goo backe agayne to the pleasure of Egypt of vy¦ces & synne: ney¦ther with the wyfe of Lotte may loke bak again to our ol¦de cōuersaciō. The {pro}phete cry∣eth out yt we sholde flee out of the myddes of babylon. The departyng of the israely∣tes frō Egypt is called flyght or ronnyng away. we be cōmaunded to flee out of ba¦bylon hastely / & not to remoue a lytel and a lytell slowly. Thou mayst se the moost parte of men prolong the tyme / and with very slowe purpose go about to flee from vices. whan I haue ones ryd my selfe out of suche and suche maters / saye they / yea whan I haue brought that & that besy∣nes to passe. Oh foole what & yf god this same daye take agayne thy soule frō the? perceyuest thou not one besynes to ryse of

In this mater to do rashly to ronne heedlong & sodeynly is chefest of all and moost {pro}fytable. Regarde not nor ponder how moche thou forsakest / but be sure Chryst onely shall be sufficyent for all thyng{is}: onely be bolde to cōmyt thy selfe to hym with all thyne hert:Confydence in god. set thou mys∣truste in thyne owne selfe / aduenture to put vnto hym all the gouernaunce of thy selfe: trust to thy selfe no longer / but with full confydence cast thy selfe from thy selfe to hym / and he shall receyue the: cōmytte thy care & thought to the lorde / & he shall nourysshe the vp / that thou mayst synge the songe of the same prophete.Serue Chryst all togyder / & no man elles. The lorde is my gouernour / & I shall lacke nothyng. In a place of pasture he hath set me / by the water syde of cōforte he hath brought vp me: he hath conuerted my soule: be not mynded to parte thy selfe in to two / to the world & to chryst: thou canst not serue two maysters: there is no felawshyp bytwene god and belial. God can not awaye with them whiche halte on bothe theyr legges: his stomacke abhorreth them whiche be neyther hote nor colde / but luke warme.
God is a very ialouse louer of soules: he wyll possesse onely and all togyder that thyng whiche he redemed with his blode: he can not suffre the felawshyp of the de∣uyll whome he ones ouercame with deth. There be but two wayes onelyTwo wayes onely / the one of sainatiō / the other of {per}ditiō. / the one whiche by obedyence of the affections le∣deth to {per}dicyon: the other whiche thrugh mortyfyenge of the flesshe ledeth to lyfe. why doubtest thou in thy selfe / there is no thyrde waye / in to one of these two thou must nedes entre / wylt thou or wylt thou not / what so euer thou arte / or of what degree / thou must nedes entre in to this strayte waye / in whiche fewe mortal men walke.Adasta neme∣sis or Rhānu∣sa is a goddes whiche punys∣sheth insolency she forbiddeth that ony man loke to hyghe yf ony so do he escapeth not vnpunysshed though it be neuer so late: yf ony be to ful of insolency we say / take hede Rhamnusya seeth the well ynoughe. But this waye Chryst hym selfe hath trode / & haue troden synce the worlde began who so euer pleased god. This is doubtles the ineuitable necessite of ye god∣des Adrasta / otherwyse called Nemesis or Rhānusa / that is to say / it can not be cho¦sen but that thou be crucified with Chryst as touchyng the worlde / yf thou purpose to lyue with Chryst. why lyke fooles fla∣ter we our selfe / why in so weyghty a ma∣ter deceyue we our selfe. One sayth / I am not of the clergye or a spūal man / I am of the worlde / I can not but vse the worlde. An other thynketh / though I be a preest yet am I no monke / let hym loke vpon it.

Therfore my brother loke not so greatly what other men do / & in cōpa∣ryson of them flater or please thy self. To dye as touchynge synne: to dye as tou∣chyng carnall desyres: to dye as touchyng the worlde is a certayne harde thyng and knowen to very fewe / yea though they be mōkes / & yet is this the cōmun or general {per}fessyon of all chrysten men.Monkes.

BUt leest that thyng feare the frō the waye of vtue bycause it semeth shar¦pe and greuous / partly bicause thou must forsake worldly cōmoditees / partly bycau¦se thou must fyght cōtinually against thre very cruell enemyes / the flesshe / the deuyl & the worlde. Set this thyrde rule before the alway / beare thy selfe in hande that al the feerful thyng{is} & fantasies which apere forthwith vnto the as it were in ye first en∣tring of hel ought to be coūted for a thing of nought / by thexāple of Uirgili{is} EncasEeas ī the .vi. booke of virgil went downe in to hell accom¦panyed with the {pro}pheesse ybyll in the fyrst enrye appered many fantasyes and wonderful mō∣stres not so pe∣rylious in dede as they apered. For certeynly yf thou shalt consider ye very thynge somwhat groūdly & stedfastly (set∣tīg at nought these apparēt thing{is} which begiled thine eyes) thou shalt {per}ceyue that none other way is more cōmodious than the way of Chryst. Though thou account this thyng not at al that this waye onely ledeth to eternall lyfe / yea & though thou haue no respecte vnto the rewarde. For I beleche the what kynde of lyuynge after the cōmune course of the worlde is there
that thou canst chose in whiche thou shal not beare / and suffre thynges ynough ha∣boundantly bothe carefull and greuous. Who is he that knoweth not the lyfe of courtyers to be full of greuous laboure and wretched mysery / excepte it be eyther he that neuer proued it or certainly a very naturall foole. Oh immortall god what bondage / howe longe and how vngood∣ly muste there be suffred euen vnto the ly∣ues ende what a comberous besynesse is there in sekyng in purchasyng the princes loue and grace. A man must flatter to ob∣tayne the fauoure of all suche as may ey∣ther hynder or further one. The counte∣naunces must nowe & than be feyned and newe fassyoned. The iniuries of the gret∣ter men muste be whyspered or muttered with sylence secretly.The lyfe of warryours. Consequently what kynde of yuell lyfe can be ymagyned wher of ye lyfe of warryours is not full? Of ey∣ther lyfe than mayste thou be a very good witnesse / which hast lerned bothe at thyn owne peryll.The lyfe of marchautes. And as touchynge the mer∣chaunt man what is that he eyther dothe not or suffreth not fleyng pouertye by see / by lands / throughe fire & water? In ma∣trimony what a mountayne of housholde ares be there?The mesery of matrymony. what mysery fele not they there whiche proueth and hath experpēce

Laste of all in howe doubtfull hope. Adde to this that there is no rest or easement of myseries / in so moche that the more they haue la∣boured the greuouser is the payne. And whan all is paste what shall the ende be of so tedyous and laborous a lyfe / verily eternall punysshement. Go nowe and with this lyfe compare the waye of ver∣tue / whiche at the fyrste seaseth to be te∣dyous / in processe is made easyer / is made
plesaunt and delectable / by whiche waye also we go with very sure hope to eter∣nall felycite. were it not the vttermoste madnesse to haue leuer with equall la∣boure to purchace eternall dethe rather than lyfe immortall? yet are these world∣ly men moche madder than so / that they whiche chose with exreme laboure to go to laboure euerlastynge / rather than with meane labours to go to immortall quyetnesse.Tic{is} because he wolde haue ioyned with appollos mo∣ther was cast of apollo down to hell where vulters gnawe his herte eue encresynge agayne. More ouer if the way of pytie or obedyence to god were so moche more laborous than the way of the worlde / yet here ye greuousnesse of the labour is swa∣ged with hope of rewarde / and the com∣forte of god is not lackynge whiche tour∣neth the bytternesse of the gall in to the swetnesse of hony.The meanyng of the fable is this / he was a grete man a code not be cō¦tēted but wold haue more and aduaūced hym selfe to more honour & wold haue put apol∣lo out of his cō¦tree which sig∣nyfied by his mother / but apollo subdu∣ed hym and spoyled hym. There one care calleth in an other / of one sorowe springeth an∣other / no quyetnesse is there at all. The laboure and affllyctyon withoutforthe / the greuous cares and thoughtes with∣inforthe cause the very easementes to be sharpe and bytter. These thynges so to be was not vnknowen to the poetes of the gentyles whiche by the punysshment of Ticius / Ixion / Tantalus / Sisiphus / and of Pentheus / paynted and discry∣ued the myserable and greuous lyfe of leude and wretched persones: of whome

But what sayth Christ? take my yoke vpon your neckes and ye shall fynde rest vnto your soules: my yoke sayth he is plesaunt and my burthen lyght. To speake breuely / no pleasure is lackynge where is not lackyng a quyet conscience.Syfyphus rol∣leth a stone frō the hyll fote to the top / thā sly∣deth the stone & he discendeth to fetche hym vp agayne. No mysery is there lacking where an vn∣happy conscyence crucyfyeth the mynde. These thynges must be taken as of moste certaynty / but and if thou yet doubte go aske of them whiche in tyme passed haue ben cōuerted out of the myddle of Baby∣lon vnto the lorde:Ambytion is euer at the hyll fote he is e∣er so hyghe but that he ha∣the one hyl mo¦re to clymbe / he seeth one thynge more whiche he couereth. & by experyence of them at ye leest way byleue nothyng to be more troubelous and greuous than vyces / no∣thyng to be more easy or of quycker spede than not to be drowned in besynesse / no thyng more cherefull & more comfortable than is vertue. Neuer the lesse go to let it be that the wag{is} be lyke / and that the la∣bours be lyke also / yet for all that howe

More ouer ought not a man with wynde and wether with shyp sayle and swyftnesse of horses to flye from a lorde not very fylthy onely but very cruell and disceytfull / whiche re∣quyreth so cruell seruyce and so strayte a taske / whiche promyseth agayne thynges so vncertayne / so caduke / so transytorye / whiche so sone fade and vanysshe awaye / of the whiche very same thynges yet dis∣ceyueth he the wretches and that not sel∣dome.Couctous men dare not vse theyr gooddes but be hungry and thyrsty for more. Or thoughe he perfourme his pro∣messe ones / yet another tyme whā it plea¦seth hym he taketh them awaye agayne / so that the sorowe & thought for.Pentheus was torned in to an harte & eeten of his owne dog∣ges & he dyd non other thin¦ge all his lyfe but hunte & fo∣lowe dogges: so he consumed hymselfe & his substaunce lyke a foole wret∣chedly & bestly the losse of thynges ones possessed is moche more than was the greuous labour in purcha∣syng them. After that the merchaunt man hath myngled togyther bothe ryght and wronge for the entent of encreasynge his goodes / after he hath put his honest re∣putacyon of good reporte that is spronge of hym / his lyfe / his soule in a thousande ieopardyes / if it so be than that ye chaunce of fortune happe aryght at the later ende
with all his trauayle what other thynge hath he prepared for hym selfe more than the mater of myserable care if he kepe his goodes / if he lese them a perpetuall tour∣ment.The troublous care of a mar∣chauntes. If fortune chaūce a mysse what re∣mayneth but yt he shulde be made twyse a wretche wrapped in double mysery / part∣ly bycause he is disapoynted of the thyng wheron his hope hanged / besyde that by∣cause he can not remēbre so great labour spent in waste without moche bothe so∣rowe of hert and grefe of mynde. No man enforseth with sure purpose to come to good lyuyng or cōuersacyon whiche hath not attayned it. Christe as he is not moc∣ked / so neyther he mocketh any man. Remembre an other thynge / whan thou flyest out of the worlde vnto Christe / if the worlde haue any cōmodytyes or plea∣sures that thou forsakest them not / but chaūgest tryfles with thyng{is} of more va∣lue. who wyll not be very glad to chaūge syluer for golde / flynte for precyous stone?

Thou ceasest to be of pryce in the worlde / but thou for all that arte well beloued of Christe: Thou pleasest the fewer / but yet the better. Thy body waxeth leane / but thy mynde waxeth fatte. The beautye of thy skynne vanyssheth away / but the beautye of thy mynde apereth bright. And in lyke ma∣ner if thou shalte reken all other thyn∣ges thou shalte perceyue nothynge not of all these apparant good thynges to be forsaken in this worlde / that is not re∣compensed largely with greater aduaun∣tage and more excellent a great waye.Many thyng may be resey∣ued & possessed but not desired.

He directeth his iourney to Christ whiche is caryed to vertue onely. And he beco∣meth bonde to the dyuell whiche gyueth hym selfe to vyces. Let thyne eye therfore be pure / and all thy body shall be bryght and full of lyght. Let thyne eye loke vnto Christ alonely as vnto onely and very fe∣lycyte / so that thou loue nothynge / mer∣uayle at nothyng / desyre nothyng but ey∣ther Christe or els for Christe.

Thou hast set vp thy money and made it equall vnto Christ / if it can make ye happy or vn∣happy. That I haue spoken of money vn¦derstande the same lykewyse of honours / voluptuousnesse / helth / ye & of ye very lyfe of the body.Prometheus taught rude mē ciuyle & ho∣nest maner / yet wolde he bee no rule amon∣gest them but fledde to solia¦rynce / thynkig all kynd{is} of my¦sery to be in be¦rynge rule / but his brother Epymetheus toke the misery vpon hym. we muste enforce to come to our onely marke whiche is Christ / so fe∣uently y• we shulde haue no layser to care for any of these thyng{is} / eyther whan they be gyuē vs / or eis whā they be takē from vs / for the tyme is shorte as sayth Paule: Hēce forwarde sayth he they that vse the worlde / muste be as they vsed it not. This mynde I know well ye worlde laugheth to scorne as folysshe & madde: neuer ye lesse it pleaseth god by this folysshnesse to saue them yt byleue. And ye folisshnesse of god is wyser thā man. After this rule thou shalt
examyn / ye what soeuer thou doest. Thou exercysest a crafte?whan labor is profytable. it is very well done if thou do it without fraude: but whervnto lokest thou to fynde thy houshold? but for what entēt to fynde thy housholde / to wyn thy housholde to Christ? thou rōnest well. Thou fastest / verily a good werke as it a∣pereth outwarde:whan fastyng is su{per}stycious. but vnto what ende re∣ferrest thou thy selfe / to spare thy vitayles or that thou mayste be counted the more holy? Thyne eye is wanton / corrupt / and not pure. Peraduenture thou fastest leest thou shulde fall in to some disease or syck∣nesse. why fearest thou sycknesse? leest it wolde take the from y• vse of voluptuous pleasures: thyne eye is corrupt. But thou desyrest helth bycause thou mayst be able to study. To what purpose I beseche the referrest thou thy study to get the a bene∣fyce withall? with what mynde desyrest thou a benefyce? verily to lyue at thyne owne pleasure / not at Christ{is}. Thou hast missed y• marke which a christen mā ought to haue euerywher p̄fixed before his eyes. Thou takest meate that thou myghtest be stronge in thy body / & thou wylt haue thy body stronge that thou myghtest be suffycient vnto holy exercyses & watche. thou hast hyt ye marke. But thou {pro}uydest for helth & good lyuing leest thou shuldest
be more yuell fauoured or deformed / leest thou shuldest not be stronge ynough vnto bodily luste / thou hast fallen from Christe makyng vnto the another god.The superstici∣ous honouring of sayntes. There be whiche honour certayne sayntes with cer¦tayne cyremonyes. One saluteth Christo∣ferChristofer. euery day / but not excepte he beholde his ymage. whyther loketh he? verily to this poynte / he hath borne hym selfe in hande that he shall be all yt day sure from yuel dethe. Another worshypeth one Ro∣chusRochus. / but why? bycause he byleueth that he wyll kepe away ye pestylence from his body. Another mōbleth certayne prayers to Barbara or GeorgeBarbara  George. / leest he shulde fall in to his enemyes handes. This man fa∣steth to saint ApolyneAppolyne leest his tethe shuld ae. That man visyteth ye ymage of holy IobIob. / bycause he shulde be without scab∣bes. Some assygne & name certayne por∣cin of their wynnyng to poore men / leest their merchaūdyse shulde perysshe by shyp wrake. A taper is lyght before saynt Hie∣romIherom. to thentent that thing whiche is lost may be had agayne. In conclusyon after this same maner loke howe many thyng{is} be whiche we eyther fauour or els loue / so many sayntes haue we made gouernours of the same thinges / whiche same sayntes be dyuers in dyuers natures: so yt Paule
dothe the same thing amonge the frenche men that Hieron dothe with our coūtrey men ye almayns / and neyther Iames nor Iohan can do that thyng in euery where whiche they do in this or yt place: whiche honouryng of sayntes trewly / except it be referred from ye respect of corporall cōmo∣dytes or incōmodytes vnto Christ / is not for a christen man / in so moche yt it is not farre from ye superstyciousnesse of thē whi∣che in tyme passed vowed ye tenth parte of their goodes to Hercules / to thentēt they might waxe riche / or a cocke to Esculapi∣usA cocke to Esculapius. that they myght be recouered of their diseases: or which sacrifyced a bull to Nep¦tunusA bull to Neptunus. that they might haue good passage by see and prosperous saylynge. The na∣mes be chaunged / but veryly they haue bothe one ende and entent. Thou prayestThou prayest for longe lyfe. god that thou mayste not dye to soone / or whyle thou arte yonge / and prayest not rather that he wolde gyue to the a good mynde that in what so euer place dethe shulde come vpon the he shulde not fynde the vnprepared. Thou thynkest not of chaungyng thy lyfe / and prayest god thou myghtest not dye. what prayest thou for than? certaynly that thou mightest synne as longe as is possyble. Thou desyrest ry∣chesse and can not vse rychesse / doest not
thou than desyre thyne owne confusyon. Thou desyrest helthe and canste not vse helth / is not nowe thy honouryng of god dishonouryng of god. In this place I am sure some of our holy men wyll crye out agaynst me with open mouthes / whiche thynke lucre to be to ye honouring of god / and as ye same Paule sayth with certayne swete benedictyons disceyue the myndes of innocent persons whyle they obey and serue their bely / & not Iesu Christe. Than wyll they saye / forbyddest thou worshyp∣of sayntes in whom god is honoured?They accōpte the honouryng of sayntes for absolute pyte. I verely disprayse not thē so greatly whiche do those thing{is} with certayne symple and childysshe superstycion for lacke of instru∣ctyon or capacite of wyt / as I do thē whi∣che sekyng their own aduaūtage prayseth and magnifieth those thing{is} for most gret and perfyte holynesse / whiche thyng{is} per∣aduenture be tollerable & may be suffred & for their owne profyte & aduaūtage che∣risshe & maintayne ye ignorance of the peo∣ple whiche neyther I my selfe do dispyse / but I can not suffre yt they shulde accōpte thing{is} to be highest & most chefe / which of thē selfe be neyther good nor bad / & those thynged to be greatest and of most value whiche be smallest & of leest value. I wyll prayse it & be contēt that they desyre helth
of Rochus whom they so gretly honour / if they cōsecrate it vnto Christ. But I wyl prayse it more if they wolde praye for no∣thing els but yt with the hate of vyces the loue of vertues myght be encreased: and as touching to lyue or to dye let thē put it into the hand{is} of god / & let them say with Paule / whether we lyue wheder we dye / to god & at godd{is} pleasure we lyue or dye. It shalbe a perfyte thyng if they desyre to be dissolued from ye body and to be with Christ: if they put their glory & ioy in dis∣eases or sycknesse / in losse or other doma∣ges of fortune / yt they might be accompted worthy whiche euen in this worlde shulde be lyke or confyrmable vnto their heed. To do therfore suche maner of thynges is not so moche to be rebuked as it is pe∣ryllous to abyde styll and cleane to them. I suffre infyrmyte and weaknesse / but with Paule I shew a more excellēt way. If thou shalte examyne thy studyes and all thy actes by this rule / and shalte not stande any where in meane thynges tyll thou come euen vnto Christe / thou shalte neyther go out of thy waye at any tyme / neyther shalte do or suffre any thynge in all thy lyfe whiche shall not tourne and be vnto the a mater of seruynge and ho∣nourynge god.
¶The fyfth rule. capi .xiij. LEt vs adde also the fyfth rule as an ayder vnto this forsayd fourth ruleyte. / that thou put perfyte pity / that is to saye the honouryng of god in this thyng only / if thou shalt enforce alway from thynges visyble whiche almoste euery one be im∣perfyte or els indifferēt to ascende to thyn∣ges inuysible after the diuysyon of a man aboue rehersed. This precept is apertay∣nyng to y• mater so necessarily / that whe∣ther it be through neglygence or for lacke of knowlege of it / the moste parte of chri∣sten men in stede of trewe honourers of god are but playne superstycious / and in al other thynges saue in the name of chri∣sten men onely vary not greatly from the superstycion of the gentyles.. Let vs yma∣gyne therfore two worldes / the one intel∣ligyble ye other visyble. The intellygible whiche also we maye call the angelycall worlde / wherin god is with blessed myn∣des. The visyble worlde / ye cyrcle of heuen / the planettes / & sterres / with all that in∣cluded is in them as the foure elementes. Than let vs ymagyne man as a certayne thirde worlde / parte taker of bothe ye other: of ye visyble worlde if thou beholde his bo∣dy / of the inuysible worlde if thou cōsyder
his soule. In y• visyble worlde bycause we be but straūgers we ought neuer rest / but what thynge so euer offreth it selfe to the sencyble powers / that is to say to the fyue wyttes / yt must we vnder a certayne apte comparyson or simylitude aply to the an∣gelycall worlde / or els (whiche is most pro¦fytable) vnto maners and to that parte of man whiche is corespōdent to ye angelyke worlde / that is to say to the soule of man. what this visyble sonne is in the visyble worlde yt is the diuyne myndeThe so the di mynde / that is to say god in y• intelligyble worlde / & in that parte of the which is of that same nature / that is to say in the spyrit. Loke what the moone is in the visyble worlde / that in the inuysible worlde is ye congregacion of an∣gels & of blessed soules called the tryum∣phant churche / and that in the is the spy∣ryte. what so euer heuens aboue worketh in the erthe vnder them / that same dothe god in the soule. The sonne gothe downe aryseth / rageth in heate / is temperate / quyckneth / bringeth forthe / maketh rype / draweth to hym / maketh subtyle and thynne / purgeth / hardeneth / mollyfyeth / illumyneth / clereth / cheryssheth and com∣forteth. Therfore what so euer thou be∣holdest in hym / ye what so euer thou seest in the grosse parte of this worlde of the
elementes whiche many haue seperated from the heuens aboue and cyrcles of the fyrmament. In conclusyon what so euer thou consydrest in the grosser parte of thy selfe / accustome to applye it to god and to the inuysible porcyon of thy selfe. So shal it come to passe that what so euer thynge shall any where offer it selfe to any of the sensyble wyttes / that same thyng shall be to the an occasyon of pityThe occasion of pyte. / to honour god. whan it delyteth thy corporall eyes as oft as this visyble sōne spredeth hym selfe on the erthe with newe lyght / by and by call to remembraunce howe great the plea∣sure is of the inhabytauntes of heuen / vn¦to whome the eternall sonne euer sprin∣geth and aryseth / but neuer goth downe. Howe great are the ioyes of that pure mynde whervpon ye light of god alwayes shyneth and casteth his beames. Thus by occasion of the visyble creature pray with the wordes of Paule / that he whiche cō∣maunded lyght to shyne out of darknesse may shyne in thy herte / to gyue lyght and knowlege of the glorye of god in the face of Iesu Christ.The glory of god appered in the face of moyses / but we beholde the glo¦ry of god ī the face of Iesus Chryste. Repete such lyke places of holy scripture in whiche here & there the grace of the spyrite of god is compared to lyght.The grace of god is called lyght / & nyght is compared to synne. The night semeth tedyous to the & darke / thynke on a soule destytute of the
light of god & darke with vyces: ye and i thou canst {per}ceyue any derknesse of nyght in the / pray that the sonne of iustyce maye aryse vnto the. This wyse thinke & surely byleue that thing{is} inuysible whiche thou seest not are so excellēt / so pure / so perfyt / that thinges whiche be sene in cōparyson of them are scarse very shadowes represē∣tyng to the eyes a small & a thynne simy∣lytude of thē. Therfore in this outwarde corporall thing{is} what so euer thy sensyble wyttes eyther desyre or abhorre / it shalbe a gret deale meter yt the spyrit loue or hate thesame thynge in inwarde & incorporall thyng{is}. The goodly beautye of thy body pleaseth thyne eyes / thinke than how ho∣nest a thing is the beauty of ye soule.what soeuer is perceyued in the body that same is to be vnderstode in the ynde. A de∣formed vysage semeth an vnplesaūt thīg. remēbre howe odyous a thing is a mynde defyled with vyces: and of all other thyn∣do likewyse. For as ye soule hath certayne beauty wherwith one whyle she pleaseth god / & a defourmyte wherwith an other whyle she pleaseth ye dyuell / as lyke vnto lyke: so hath she also her youthe / her age / sicknes / helth / dethe / lyfe / pouerty / riches / ioye / sorowe / werre / peace / colde / heate / thurst / drinke / hunger / meate. To cōclude shortly what soeuer is fylthy in the body / that same is to be vnderstāde in the soule.
Therfore in this thynge esteth the iour∣ney to the spyrituall and pure lyfe / if by a lytle and lytle we shal accustome to with∣drawe our selfe from these thyng{is} whiche be not trewly in very dede / but partely a∣pere to be that they be not: as fylthy & vo∣luptuous pleasure / honour of this worlde partely vanysshe awaye and haste to re∣tourne to naught / and shall be rauysshed and caryed to these thyng{is} whiche indede are eternall immutable and pure: whiche thynge Socrates sawe full well / a philo∣sopher not so moche in tonge and wordes as in lyuing and dedes / for he saythe that so onely shall the soule departe happely from her body at the last ende / if aforehad she haue dyligently through true know∣lege recorded & practysed dethe / and also haue longe tyme before by the dispysynge of thynges corporall / and by the contem∣placyon and louyng of thynges spyrituall vsed her selfe to be as it were in a maner absent from the body. to the  of chryst. Neyther the crosse vnto whiche Christ calleth and exhorteth vs / neyther that dethe in whiche Paule wylleth vs to dye with our heed / as also the prophete saythe: for thy sake we be slayne all the daye longe / we be accomp∣ted as shepe appoynted to be kylled / ney∣ther that whiche the apostle wryteth in
other termes ayeng / seke those thynges that be aboue / not which be on the erthe. Taste and haue perceyuaunce of thynges aboue / meaneth it any other thynge than that we vnto thynges corporall shulde be dull and made as thoughe we were in∣sensyble and vtterly without capacyte. So that the lesse felyng we haue in thyn∣ges of the body / so moche the more swet∣nesse we myght fynde in thynges pertay∣nynge to the spyrite / and myght begynne to lyue so moche the trewlyer inwardely in the spyrite / the lesse we lyued outward∣ly in the body. In conclusyon to speake more playnly / so moche the lesse shulde moue vs thynges caduke and trausytory / the more acquaynted we were with thin∣ges eternall. So moche the lesse shulde we regarde the shadowes of thyng{is} the more we haue begonne to loke vp vpon the the very trewe thynges. This rule therfore muste be had euer redy at hande / that we in no wyse stande styll any where in tem∣perall thynges / but that we ryse thence makyng as it were a steppe vnto the loue of spyrituall thyng{is} by matchyng the one with the other / or els in comparyson of thynges whiche are inuysible that we be∣gynne to dispyse that whiche is visyble. The disease of thy body wyll be the easier
if thou woldest thynke it to be a remedye for thy soule. Thou shuldest care the lesse for the helthe of thy body if thou woldest tourne all thy care to defende and mayn∣tayne the helthe of the mynde. The dethe of the body putteth the in feare / the dethe of the soule is moche more to be feared. Thou abhorrest the poyson whiche thou seest with thyne eyes / bycause it bringeth myschefe to the body / moche more is the poyson to be abhorred whiche seeth the soule. Cicuta is poysonCycuta is a poyson ebe. of ye body / but vo∣luptuousnesse is moche more & redy poy∣son to the soule. Thou quakest and trem∣blest for feare / thy heere standeth vpright / thou arte spechelesse / thy spyrites forsa∣ken the and thou waxest pale / fearynge leest the lyghtnynge whiche apereth out of the cloudes shulde smyte the / but howe moche more is it to be feared leest there shulde come on the / the inuysybe lyght∣nyng of the wrathe of god / whiche sayth: Go ye cursed persones in to eternall fyre. The beautie of the bodye rauyssheth the / why rather louest thou not feruētly that fayrnesse yt is not sene? Trāslate thy loue in to that beautye that is perpetuall / that is celestyall / that is without corrupcyon / and the discretelyer shalte thou loue the aduke and trāsytory shappe of the body.
Thou prayest that thy felde maye be wa∣tred with rayne leest it drie vp / praye ra∣ther that god wyll vouchesaffe to water thy mynde leest it waxe barayne from the ute of vertues.The mystery in all thynges must be loked vpon. Thou restorest and en∣creasest agayne with great care the waste of thy money:Holy scrypture is sylenus of Alcybyades. Sylenus be ymages made with oyntes so that they may be opened contaynyge outwarde the symylitude of a  or an ape or che lyke tryels: & whan they  opened sodenly appe∣reth some excel¦lent or mruay¦lous thynge / vnto such thyn¦ges biades a noble man of At ees com∣pared the phy∣losopher So∣erates for so∣crates was so symple outwar¦de / and so excel¦lente inwarde. the greatest care of al ough∣test thou haue to restore agayne the losse of the mynde. Thou hast a respecte longe afore hande to age / leest any thyng shulde be lackyng to thy body: and shuldest thou not prouyde that nothynge be lackynge to the mynde. And this veryly ought to be done in those thynges whiche dayly me∣teth our sensyble wyttes / and as euery thynge is of a dyuers kynde / euen so dy∣uersly dothe moue vs with hope / feare / loue / hate / sorowe & ioy. The same thyng muste be obserued and kepte in all maner of lernyng whiche include in them selfe a playne sence and a mystery / euen as they were made of a body and a soule / that the lyterall sence lytle regarded thou shuldest loke chefly to y• mistery: Of whiche maner are the letters of al poetes & philosophers chefly the folowers of Plato. But most of al holy scripture / which beyng in a maner lyke to Slen{us} of Alcibiades / vnder a rude and folysshe couering include pure diuyne and godly thing{is}: for els if thou shalt rede
without the allegory the ymage of Adam formed of moyst cley and the soule brethed into hym / & Eue plucked out of the rybbe / howe they were forbyd the tree of know∣lege of good and yuell / the serpent enty∣synge to eate / god walkynge at the ayre: whan they knewe they had synned / howe they hydde them selfe / the aungell set at the doores with a turnynge sworde leest after they were eiecte / the waye to them shulde be open to come agayne shortly. If thou shuldest rede the hole hystorie of the makynge of the worlde / if thou rede (I say) superfycially these thinges / seking no further than apereth outwardly / I can not perceyue what other gret thyng thou shalt do than if thou shuldest synge of the ymage of cley made by Prometheus / or of fyre stolen from heuen by subtyltie and put in to the ymage to gyue lyfe to ye cley.The fable of the gyauntes / A greate nōbre of gyauntes buylded moū¦tayne vpō moū¦tayne to pluck Iupyter out of heuen / but Iu∣piter vnder my¦ned theyr moū¦taynes & slewe them with lyghtnynge. ye peraduenture a poetes fable in the al∣legory shall be redde with somwhat more frute than a narracyon of holy bookes / if thou rest in y• rynde or vtter parte. If whā thou redest the fable of the gyauntes / it warneth and putteth the in remembraūce that thou stryue not with god and thyn∣ges more mighty than thou / or that thou oughtest to abstayne from suche studyes as nature abhorreth / and that thou shul∣dest
set thy mynde vnto these thynges (if so be they be honest) whervnto thou arte moste apte naturally: That thou tangle not thy selfe with matrymony / if chastyte be more agreable to thy maners. Agayne that thou bynde not thy selfe to chastyte if thou seme more apte to maryage. For moste comenly those thynges come yuell to passe whiche thou prouest agaynst na∣ture. If the cuppe of CyrcesCirces was a woman which by enchantmēt turned men to dyuers fasciōs of beestes with poysons or drē¦ches. teache yt men with voluptuousnesse as with wytche∣craft fall out of their mynde and be chaū∣ged vtterly fro mē vnto beestes.

The stone of SiciphusSysyphus. that ambycion is laborous and myserable. If the labours of HerculesThe labours of hercules. putteth the in re¦membraūce that heuen must be obtayned with honest labours and enforcementes infatygable / lernest thou not that thynge in the fable whiche ye philosophers eache and also diuynes / maisters of good lyuīg? But if (without allegorywithout allego¦ry srypture is baren.) thou shalte ede the infauntes wrestlyng in their mothers bely / thenherytaunce of the elder brother solde for a messe of potage / the blyssyng of the father preuented and taken away by fraude. Goly smytten with the slynge of
Dauyd / and the heere of Sampson sha∣uen: it is not of so great valure as if thou shuldest rede the feynynge of some poete.Many vngood¦ly thynges in scrypture as they appere outwarde. what differēce is there whether thou rede the boke of kynges or of the iudges in the olde testament / or els the history of Titus Liuyus / so thou haue respecte to the alle∣gorye in nere nother? For in the one / that is to say Titus Liuyus / be many thyng{is} whiche wolde amende the comen maners: in the other be some thinges / ye vngoodly as they seme at ye fyrst lokyng on / whiche also if they be vnderstande superstycially shulde hurte good maners: As the thefte of DauydDauyd com∣mytted adul∣tery with Bar¦sabe / and cau∣sed Urye her husbande to be slayne. / and adultery bought with ho∣mycide / howe the doughters of Lot laye with their father by stelthe / and concey∣ued / and a thousande other lyke maters. Therfore the flesshe of the scripture dispy∣ed chefely of the olde testament / it shall be mete and cōuenient to serche out the my∣stery of the spyrite. anna to the shall haue suche taste as thou bringest with the in thy mouthe. But in openyng of myste∣ries thou mayst not folow the cōiectures of thyne own myndeThe mysteries must be hande∣led with crafte / but the rule must be knowen and a certayne craft / whiche one Dionsius reacheth in a boke entytled De diuinis nominibus / that is to say / of the names of god: and saynte Augustyne in a
certayne warke called Doctrina christia∣na / that is to say / the doctryne of a christen man. The apostle Paule after Christe o∣pened certayne fountaynes of allegoryeAllegory. / whome Origene folowed / & in that parte of diuynite obtayned doutlesse the chefe roume and maystry. But our diuynesOur diuynes. ey∣ther set naught by the allegory / or handle it very dremyngly and vnfrutefully: yet are they in subtylty of disputacyon equall or rather superyours to olde diuynes. But in treatynge of this crafte that is to saye in pure / apte / and frutefull handlyng the allegorye not ones to be compared with them / and that specyally as I gesse for two caused. The one that the myste∣rye canne be but weake and barayne that is not fortyfyed with strengthe of clo∣quence / and tempred with certayne swet∣nesse of speakynge / in whiche our elders were passyng excellent / and we not ones taste of it. An other cause is / for they con∣tent with Arystotle onlyArystotle only is redde nowe adayes. / expell from scho¦les the secte of Plato & Picagoras / and yet saynt Augustyn preferreth these later / not only bycause they haue many senten∣ces moche agreable to our relygyon / but also bycause the very maner of open and clere speche / whiche they vse (as I haue sayde before) full of allegoryes / draweth
very nygh to y• style of holy scripture. No eruale therfore though they haue more cōmodyously hādled the allegores of the worde of god / whiche with plētuous ora∣cyon were able to encrease &Olde diye with helpe of eloquence han¦deled the Alle∣goryes wel fa∣uourdly delate to co∣lour & garnysshe any maner thyng neuer so baren / symple / or homely / whiche men also beyng most expert & cōnyng of all an∣tiquite had practysed & exercysed longe be∣fore in poetes & bokes of Plato / y• thynge whiche they shulde do after in diuyne my∣steryes. I had leuer that thou shuldest rede the cōmentaries of those men / for I wolde instructe and induce the not vnto cōtenci∣on of argumentes / but rather vnto a pure mynde. But & if thou can not attayne the mistery / remēbre yet that some thīg lyeth hyd whiche though it be not knowen / yet verely to haue trust to obtayne it shall be better than to rest in the letter which kyl∣leth. And that se thou do not onely in the olde testament / but also in the newe. The gospell hath her flessheThe gospell hath her fleshe and spyryte. / she hath also her spyrite: for thoughe the vayle be pulled from y• face of Moyses / neuerthelesse yet vnto this daye Paule saythe per specu∣lum in enigmate / not the thynge selfe and clerely / but the ymage or symylitude of the very thynge as it were in a glasse vnper∣ytely & obscurely: and as Christ hym selfe
sayth in his gospell of Iohan. The flesshe profyteth nothynge at all / it is the spiryte that gyueth lyfe. I veryly wolde haue ben afrayde to haue sayd it {pro}fyteth not at all / it shold haue ben ynough to saye the flesh profyteth somwhat / but moche more the spiryte: but now verite hymself hath sayd it {pro}fyteth not at all. And so greatly it pro∣fyteth not / that after the mynde of Paule it is but deth / excepte it be referred to the spiryte: yet at the leest way in this thynge is the flesshe profytable for that she ledeth our infirmyty as it were with certeyn gre¦ces or steppes vnto the spiryte. The body without the spiryte can haue no beynge: the spiryt of the body hath no nede. wher∣fore yf after the doctryne of Chryst the spi¦ryte be so great & excellent a thynge / that he onely gyueth lyfe: hyther to this poynt must our iourney be / that in al maner let∣res / in al our actes we haue respect to the spiryte / & not to the flesshe.

For they are now & than partly sygnes of pite and partly helpers thervnto. And bycause they are somwhat necessary to yonge in∣fantes in Chryst / tyll they waxe elder and growe vp vnto a {per}fyt man.The vse of ce∣remonyes. Therfore it is not mete they sholde be disdeyned of them whiche are perfyte / leest by theyr example the weyke {per}sone sholde take harme. That thou doest I approue / so the ende be not amysse. More ouer yf thou stop not there whense thou oughtest to ascēde to thyng{is} more nere to helth. But to worship Christ with visible thynges in stede of inuysible & in them to put the hyghest poynt of reli∣gyon / & for them to stande in thyne owne
conceyte / to condempne other men / to set thy hole mynde vpon them / & also to dye in them / and to speke shortly that thou be withdrawen from Chryste with the very same thynges whiche be ordeyned for the entent onely that they sholde helpe vnto Chryst: this is veryly to departe from the lawe of the gospell whiche is spirituall / & fall in to certeyn su{per}sticion of ceremonyes lyke vnto the iewes: whiche thynge {per}ad∣uēture is of no lesse ieopardy thā yf with∣out suche su{per}sticion thou sholdest be infect with great & manyfest vices of the mynde: this is forsothe the more deedly disease Be it / but ye other is worse to be cured. How moche euery where sweteth the chefe de∣fender of the spiryte Paule to call awaye the iewes frō the confidence of dedes & ce∣remonyes / & to promote them vnto those thynges whiche are spirituall; & now I se the cōmunalteThe cōmunal∣tie is turned to the cōfidence of ceremonyes. of chrysten men to be retur¦ned hyther agayne.

How diously they requyre them of other men: what cōfidence with∣out mystrust they haue in them how in∣discretly they iudge other  how ernest∣ly they defende them. To these theyr dedes they thynke heuen to be due / in whiche yf they be ones roted at ones they thynke thēselfe Paules & Antonyes.Paule & Anto∣ny were hermy¦tes of passyng holy conuersa∣cyon.

with these cōmune vertues / whi∣che the  or hethen men ha∣ue lerned / eyther by reason gyuen  them of nature /  by vse of  / or by the pre¦ceptes of philosophers. Thou shalt also se them in spirytuall thynges clene without capacite / fyerse that no man shall knowe how to eate or handell them / full of stryfe and contencyon / gredy vpon volup∣ous pleasure / at the worde of god redy to sewe / kynde to no man / mysdemynge other men / flaterynge theyr owne selues. It is cōme to this poynt now at last with the labours of so many yeres / that thou sholdest be of all men the worste / and yet thynke thy selfe the best: that in stede of a chrystē man thou sholdest be but a playne ewe / obseruyng onely vnfruytfull tradi∣cyons and ceremonyes of the inuencyons of man / that thou sholdest haue thy glory & ioye / no in secrete before god / but open∣ly afore the worlde? But and yf thou hast walked in the spiryte & no in the flesshe: where be the fruytes of the spiryte? where is charite? where is that cherefulnesse or ioyous myrthe of a pure mynde? where is tranquillite and peace towardes all men? where is pacyence? where is perseueraūce of softe mynde / wherwith thou lokest day by daye contynually for the amendement
euen of thyne ennemyes: where is curtesy or gentylnesse / where is frenesse of herte / where is mekenes / fidelite / discreciō / mea∣sure or sobrenesse / temperaunce & chastite / where is the ymage of Chryste in thy ma∣ners? I am sayst thou no keper of hores / no these / no violatour of holy thynges / I kepe my {pro}fessyon.

Here Paule spekyng to ye Romayns. No ampnacion is to them that are graffed in Chryst Iesu / which walke not carnally or after the flesshe: for the lawe of the spiryte of lyfe in Chryste Iesu hath delyuered me from the lawe of synne & deth: for yt which the lawe weyked by reason of the flesshe coude not performe or make good / yt same

They yt be ī the flesshe they can not please god: what coude be spo¦ken more largely? what more playnly: ne∣uerthelesse many men subtyle & crafty to flater or fauour theyr owne vices: but {pro}ne and redy without aduysement to checke other mensThe exposyciō and mynde of some clerkes. / thynke these thynges to per∣teyne to themselfe nothynge at all: & that Paule spake of walkyng carnally or after the flesshe / they referre to adulters onely & kepers of quenes: that he spake of wisdom of the flesshe which is enemy to god / they turned it to them whiche haue lerned hu∣manite / or that they call secular scyences: in eyther other they set vp theyr creestes / & clap theyr handes for ioye / bothe that they neyther be adulters / & in al sciences stark

Let no man mysleade you for ye nones in the humilite and religyon of aungelles whiche thynges he neuer sawe walkyng in vayne / inflate with the ymaginacion of the flesshe / & not holdyng the heed / that is to saye Chryste / of whome all the body by couples & ioyntes mynystred vp & cōpacte groweth in to the encrease of god / & leest thou sholdest doute any thynge y• he spake of them which hauyng cōfidēce in certeyn
corporal ceremonies arke agaynst y• spū∣al purposes of other men take hede what foloweth: yf ye be deed with Chryst / ab ee mes hui{us} mūdi / frō tradicyons / ceremo∣nyes & inuēcions of men: why haue ye yet suche decrees among you / as though ye ly¦ued vnto the worlde. And anone after cal∣lyng vs frō the same thyng{is} saith: yf ye be rysen vp agayne with Chryste / seke those thyng{is} yt are aboue where Chryste sytteth on ye ryght hande of god. Be expert & wyse in those thing{is} that be aboue / & not on the erth. More ouer gyuyng p̄ceptes of ye spū∣all lyfe / what exhorteth he vs to do at the last / whether yt we shold vse suche or suche ceremonies: whether yt we shold be this or that wise arayed / that we shold lyue with this or yt meates / that we sholde say custo∣mably any certeyn nombre of psalmes: he made mencion of no suche thynges: what than?Mortyfy the membres on the erthe. Mortifye (said he) your mēbres whi¦che be on ye erth / fornicacyon / vnclēnes / bo¦dyly lust / euyl cōcupiscence / & auaryce whi¦che is y• seruyce of ydols: & a lytel after that now put frō you al suche thyng{is} / wrathe / indignacyon / malyce: & agayne / spoylyng your selfe of the olde mā with al his actes puttyng on you the newe man whiche is renewed ī knowlege of god after ye ymage of hym which made hym. But who is the
olde man?The olde man veryly Adam / he that was made of the erth / whose cōuersacyon is in erth / not in heuen. By the erth vnderstād what so euer is vysyble / and therfore temporall & transytory. who is that newe man? ve∣ryly the celestyall man that descended frō heuen Chryste. And by heuen vnderstande what so euer is inuysyble / & therfore eter∣nall and euerlastynge. At the last leest we sholde be mynded to purchace the fauour of god after the maner of the iewes with certeyn obseruaunces / as ceremonyes ma¦gicall / he techeth that our dedes are plea∣saunt and alowed of god / so long as they are referred vnto charite / and also sprynge therof / sayinge. Aboue all these thynges kepe charite the bonde of perfection / & let the peas of god reioyse as a victor in your hertes / in whiche also ye be called in one body. I wyll gyue the a more playne to∣ken & euydent probacyon that this worde flesshe signyfyeth not the lust of the body onely. Paule nameth often the flesshe / of∣ten the spiryte / wrytyng to a certeyn peo∣ple named Galatas / whiche he called not onely frō lust of the body to chaste lyuyng but enforceth to withdrawe them frō the secte of of the iewes & confydence of worke in to whiche they were enduced by false apostles. In this place therfore nōbrynge
the dedes of the flesshe / marke what vices he reherseth. The dedes of ye flesshe (sayth he) be manyfest / whiche are fornycacyon / vnclenlynes / to be shameles / lechery / wor¦shyppynge of ydolles / wytchcrafte / preuy hate / discorde / otherwyse called cōtencion or stryfe / emulacyon that may be called in dignacyon or disdayne / ire otherwyse cal∣led wrathe / scoldynge discencyon / that is to say / dyuersite in maynteynynge of opi∣nyons / sectes / or maynteynynge of qua∣relles / enuy / homycyde / dronkennesse / ex∣cesse in eatynge / and suche lyke. And not longe after he sayth:Uayne glorye is a pestylence cōtrary to the spyryte. yf we lyue in the spi∣ryte / let vs walke in the spirite. After that as declarynge and vtterynge a pestylence contrary to the spyryte / he addeth: let vs not be made desyrous of vayne glory / pro∣uokyng one the other / & enuyenge one an other. The tree is knowen by the fruyte. That thou omyttest not watche / fastyng / sylence / orysons / and suche other lyke ob∣seruaūces / I passe not theron / I wyll not byleue that thou art in the spiryte excepte I may se the fruytes of the spiryte. why may I not affyrme the to be in the flesshe whan after almoost a hondreth yeres ex∣ercyse of these thynges / yet in the I fynde the dedes of the flesshe / enuyousnes more than is in any woman / contynuall wrath

I speke not now of those monkesMonkes. or rely∣gious {per}sons whose maners euen the hole
worlde abhorteth / but of thē whom the cō¦mun people honoureth not as mē / but as aūgels / whiche self same notwithstādyng ought not to be displeased with these wor¦des / whiche rebuketh ye vices & noteth not the {per}sones: but & yf they be good men / let them also be glad to be warned of what so euer man it be / in those thyng{is} whiche {per}teyneth to helth: neyther it is vnknowē to me that amonges them are very many which holpen with lernyng & wytte haue tasted the mysteryes of the spiryte (but as Liuius sayth) it fortuneth almoost euery where: that the greater parte ouercōmeth the better. Notwithstandyng (yf it be law full to cōfesse the trouth) se we not all the moste strayte kynde of monkes to put the chefe poynte of relygyon eyther in cere∣monyes or in a certayne maner or forme of saying / that they call theyr dyuyne ser∣uyce / or in a labour of the body / whiche monkes yf a man sholde examyne and ap∣pose of spirituall thynges / he sholde scarse fynde any at all that walked not in the flesshe. And here of cōmeth this so greate infyrmytye of myndes / tremblynge for feare where is no feare / and therin suer∣tye and careles where is moost peryll of all: here of commeth the perpetuall in∣fancye in Chryst (to speke no greuouslyer)
that we preposterousPreposterous is settynge be∣hynd that that shold be before estemers of thinges make moost of suche thynges whiche by them selfe are of no value: those sette at nought whiche onely are suffycyent / euer lyuynge vnder tuters or scholemaysters / euer in bondage / neuer aduaunsynge our selfe vp to the lyberty of the spiryte / neuer growynge vp to the large stature of cha∣rite: whan Paule cryeth to a certeyn peo∣ple called Galathas / stande fast / be not ye locked agayn vnder the yoke of bondage. And in an other place the lawe was our tutor or scholemayster in Chryste / that of fayth we sholde be iustyfyed. But seynge that faith is cōme / now we be no more vn¦der a tutor or scholemayster: for euery one of you (sayth he) is the veray sone of god through fayth whiche he hath in Chryste Iesu. And not moche after he sayth / & we also whan we were lytel ones were in ser¦uice and bondage vnder the ceremonyes & lawe of this worlde. But whan the tyme was fully expyred / god sent his sone made of a woman / made vnder the lawe to re∣deme them whiche were vnder the lawe / that we by adopcyon sholde be his sones. And for bycause ye be the sones of god / god hath sent the spiryte of his sone in to your hertes / cryeng Abba pater (as a man wolde saye dade father) And so is he not
now a seruaunt / but a sone to god. And agayne in an other place. Bretherne ye be called in to lybertye / let not your lybertye be an occasyon vnto you to lyue in the flesshe / but in charite of the spiryte serue one an other: for all the lawe is fulfylled in one sayinge. Loue thy neyghboure as thy selfe / but and yf ye byte and eate one the other / take hede leest ye be consumed one of an other. And agayne to the Ro∣maynes. ye haue not receyued the spiryte of bondage agayne in feare / but the spi∣ryte that maketh you the sones of god by adopcion / in whome we crye dade father. Unto the same also {per}teyneth that he wry¦teth to Timothe / sayenge. Exercyse thy selfe vnder the dedes of pite: for bodyly exercyse is good but for a small thynge / pite is good vnto all maner thynges. And to the Corynthes. God is a spiryte / and where the spiryte is / there is lyberty. But why reherse I one or two places / whan Paule is all togyder at this poynte / that the flesshe whiche is full of contencyon sholde be despysed / & that he myght settle vs in the spiryte whiche is the authour of charite & lybertye. For these companyons be euer inseparable on the one syde / the flesshe / bondage / vnquietnes / contencyon or stryfe. And on the other syde the spy∣ryte /
peace / loue / lybertye. These thynges euery where Paule mengleth with other sayinges. And seke we a better mayster of our relygyon / namely whan all dyuyne scripture agreeth to hym? This was the greatest cōmaūdemēt in the lawe of Moy¦ses. This Chryst iterateth and fynyssheth in the gospell: & for this cause chefely was he borne:To loue is the gretest cōmaū∣dement. for this cause dyed he to teche vs not to coūterfayte the iewes / but to loue. After the last souper made the euen before his passyon / how diligently / how tender∣ly / & how affectuously gaue he charge to his discyples / not of meate / not of drynke / but of charite to be kepte one towardes an other:Chryste last of all warneth vs of charyte. what other thynge techeth he / what other thynge desyreth his discyple. Iohan than that we loue one an other. Paule euery where (as I haue sayd) com¦mendeth charite / but specyally wrytynge vnto the Corynthes he preferreth charite bothe before myracles & prophecyes / and also before the tonges of aūgels. And say not thou by and by that charite is / to be oft at the churche / to croche downe before the ymages of sayntes / to lyght tapers or wax candels / to say many lady psalters or saynt Katherynes knottes. God hath no nede of these thynges.what is true charyte. Paule calleth cha∣rite to edyfye thy neyghbour / to compte
that we all be membres of one body / to thynke that we al are but one in Cryst / to reioyse in god of thy neyghbours welthe euen as thou doest of thyne owne. To re∣medy his incōmoditees or losses as hyne owne. yf any brother erre or go out of the ryght waye / to warne hym / to monysshe hym / to tell him his faute mekely / sobrely & curteysly / to teche the ignoraūt: to lyfte vp hym that is fallen: to cōforte & courage hym that is in heuynes: to helpe him that laboureth / to socour ye nedy. In cōclusyon to referre all ryches & substaūce / al thy stu∣dy / all thy cares to this poynte / that thou in Chryste sholdest helpe as moche as thy power extendeth to. That as he neyther was borne for hymselfe / nor lyued to his owne pleasure / neyther dyed for hymselfe but dedycate hym selfe hoolly to our pro∣fytes. Euen so sholde we apply our selfe / and awayte vpon the cōmodytees of our bretherne / & not our owne: whiche thyng yf it were vsed / nothyng sholde be eyther more pleasaunt or elles easy than the lyfe of religyous persones / whiche we se now clene contraryeThe lyfe of relygyous mē is greuous and tedyous. / greuous almoost euery where and laboryous / and also full of su∣perstycyon / lyke vnto the iewes / neyther pure from any vyces of the laye people / and in many sondry thynges moche more
defyled / whiche kynde of men saynt Au∣gustyneSaynt Augu∣styne wolde  knowe monkes &  of his owne relygyon yf he were now lyue. (of whome many glorye & reioyce as of the authour and founder of theyr ly∣uynge yf he now myght lyue agayn / cer∣taynly wolde not ones knowe / and wolde crye out / sayinge that he wolde approue nothyng lesse than this kynde of lyfe / and that he had instytuted an ordre and ma∣ner of lyuynge / not after the supersticyon of the iewes / but after the rule of the a∣postles. But I heare euen now what cer∣teyne men (whiche are somwhat well ad∣uised) wyll answere vnto me. A man must take hede in lytel and small thynges / leest a lytell & a lytell he sholde fall in to grea∣ter vyces / I heare it ryght well / and I alowe the saying / neuertheles thou ough¦test to take hede a greate deale more that thou so cleue not to these lytell and small thynges that thou sholdest fall clene from the moost chefe & greatest thynges.How farforth we ought to cle¦ne to the small thynges. There is the ieopardye more euydent / but here more greuouse. So flee Scilla that thou fall not into Charibdis.Scilla & charib¦dys loke what they meane at the ende of the fyrst chapytre. To obserue these lytell thynges is holsome veryly: but to cleue vtterly vnto them is veray ieopar∣dous. Paule forbiddeth not the to vse the lawe and ceremonyes / but he wyll not hym to be bounde to the lawe and cere∣monyes whiche is free in Chryste: he con∣dempneth
not the lawe of dedes / yf a man vse it lawfully / without these thynges {per}∣aduenture thou shalte not be a chryste man / but they make the not a chrystē mā / they wyll helpe vnto pite and godlynes / euen so yet yf thou vse them for that pur∣pose. But and yf thou shalte begyn to en∣ioye them / to put thy trust and confidence in them / at ones they vtterly destroye all the lyuyng of a christen man.Uyctym was the sacryfyce of a beest wher of he that offe∣red dydcate parte / & parte wente to thuse of the preestes the cal the kyd¦neis & the fatte aboute them was burned to god / that same sacryfyce for certeyn cōsyde racyons is also called hostia. The apostle setteth nought by the dedes of Abraham / whiche to haue ben veray perfyte no man doubteth: & hast thou confidence in thyne. God disdeyneth certayne sacrifices called victime / the sabbottes and certayne holy dayes called Neomenye of his people the iewes / of whiche thyng{is} he hymselfe was authour and cōmauder / and darest thou cōpare thyne owne obseruaūces with the preceptes of the lawe of god? yet here god redy to spue at them & agreued with them For what entent (sayth he) offre ye to me the multytude of victimes / I am full. As for holocaustes of wethersHolocaustes that is the ho∣le beest sacryfy¦sed to god no man hauynge parte therof / talowe or in∣warde suet and fatte of beestes / blode of calues / of lambes and gotes I wolde not haue / whan ye cōme before my presence who hath requyred these thynges of your hādes that ye myght walke in my houses Offre ye no more sacryfyce in vayne / your
ensence is abhomynacyon to meSabbot day was euery se∣uenth day as our sondaye. / I wyll not suffre any more the feest of the Neo∣menye and sabbot daye / with other feest dayes.Neomenye were holidays at the new of the mone. The companies of you are infected with iniquite / my soule hathe hated your kalendas & your solempne feestes.Kalendas that same that neo∣menyes be. These thyng{is} be greuous vnto me / I was euen sycke to abyde them. And whan ye put forth your hādes / I wyl turne myne eyes from you: whan he reherseth the obser∣uaunces and maners of holy feestes and sacrifyce: more ouer the multyplyenge of prayers / noteth he not them as though he poynted them with his fynger / whiche measure theyr relygyon with a certayne nombre of psalmes and prayers / whiche they call dayly seruyce. Marke also an o∣ther thynge how meruaylously the facun¦dyous {pro}phete expresseth hepyng togyder the disdayne or īdignacion of god:Esayas. so that he now coude suffre neyther with eares neyther eyes. what thynges (I beseche the)? veryly tho thyng{is} which he himselfe had ordeyned to be kepte so religyously / whiche also were obserued so reuerētly so many yeres of holy kyng{is} & {pro}phetes. And these thyng{is} abhorreth he as yet in ye car∣nall lawe. And trustest thou ī ceremonyes made at home in thyne owne house / now in the lawe of the spiryt? God in an other
place byddeth the same {pro}phete to crye in∣cessantly and to put out his brest after the maner of a trumpe / as in an ernest mater & worthy to be rebuked sharply / & suche a ma as vnneth coude be opteyned of these men but with moche ado. Me (sayth he) they seke from day to daye / & knowe they wyl my ways / as a people that hath done iustyce / & hath not forsaken ye iudgemēt of theyr god. They aske me for ye iudgemētes of iustyce / & desyre to drawe nygh to god: why haue we fasted (say they) & thou hast not loked vpon vs & meked our soules / & thou woldest not knowe it: lo in ye daye of your faste (answereth the prophete) your owne wyll is founde in you / and ye seke out all your detters / loo vnto stryfe and contencyon ye faste / & ye smyte with your fyst cruelly / faste ye not as ye haue fasted vnto this daye / that your crye myght be herde on hygh. Is this the faste that I haue chosen / that a man sholde vexe and trouble hymselfe for one daye / eyther that a man sholde bowe downe his heed as a hoke or cyrcle / and to strawe vndernethe hym sacke cloth & asshes: wylte thou call this a faste or a daye acceptable vnto god? But what shall we saye this to be: dothe god condempne that thynge / whiche he hym selfe commaunded? Naye forsothe.
what than? But to cleue and stycke fast in the flesshe of the lawe / & to haue cōfidence of a thynge of nothynge that is it veryly whiche he hateth deedly. Therfore he she∣weth that he wolde haue added in eyther place. Be ye wasshed (sayd he) and made clene / take away your euyl cogitacyons & thoughtes out of my syght: whan thou hearest the euyl thoughtes rehersed / tou∣cheth he not euydētly the spiryte & the in∣warde mā. The eyes of god seeth not out∣warde / but in secrete / neyther he iudgeth after the syght of the eyes / neyther rebu∣keth after the hearyng of the eares. God knoweth not y• folysshe virgyns smothe & gay outwarde / empty of good workes in∣warde: he knoweth not them whiche saye with lyppes Maister maister. More ouer he putteth vs in remēbraūce yt the vse of y• spūall lyfe standeth not so greatly in cere∣monyes as in ye charite of thy neyghbour.The vse of spi∣rytuall lyfe. Seke (saith he) iudgemēt or iustice / socour him that is oppressed / gyue true iudgemēt and ryght to hym that is fatherles & mo∣therles or frendles / defende the wydowe / suche lyke thing{is} dyd he knyt to the other place / where he speketh of fastyng. Is not this rather (saythe he) that faste I haue chosenEsayas. / loose or cancell cruell oblygacy∣ons / vnbynde the burthens whiche make
them stowpe to the grounde that be them: let them that be brused go free breake a sondre all burthen: Breake breed to hūgry. The nedy & them whi hath no place of habytacion / lede in to house. whan thou seest a naked mā clo hym / and dispyse not thyne owne fles what shall a christen man do than? he dyspyse the cōmaundementes of churche? Shall he set at naught y• ho tradycions of fore fathers? Shall he dempne godly and holy customes? Na he be weake and as a begynner he sh obserue them as thing{is} necessary / but and if he be stronge and perfyte so moche the rather shall he obserue them / leest with his knowlege he shulde hurte his brother whiche is yet weake / leest he also shulde kyll hym for whome Christ dyed: we may not omytte these thynges / but of necessyte we must do other thynges. Corporall de∣des be not condempned / but spyrituall are preferred. This visyble honouryng of god is not condempned / but god is not plea∣sed sauyng with inuysible pytie & seruyce. God is a spyrit & is moued & styrred with inuysible sacryfyce. It is a great shame for christen men not to knowe that thyng whiche a certayne poete beyng a gentyle knewe ryght well / whiche gyuyng a pre∣pt
of dewe seruynge god saythe: If god a mynde as scrypture sheweth vs / se at thou honour him chefely with a pure ynde. Let vs not dispyse the auctour be∣g eyther an hethen man or without de∣e of schole / the sentence becometh ye a ght great diuyne: and (as I very well ue perceyued) is lykewyse vnderstande fewe / as it is redde of many. The intel∣ctyon of the sentence veryly is this / lyke ioysen with lyke. Thou thynkest god to moued greatly with an oxe kylled and cryfyced / or with the vapoure or smoke of frankensence / as though he were a bo∣dy. God is a mynde / and veryly mynde most pure / most subtyle and perfyte / ther∣fore ought he to be honoured most chefe∣ly with a pure mynde. Thou thynkest that a are lyghted is sacrifyce / but a sacryfyce to god (saythe Dauid) is a wofull or a so∣rowfull spyrite. And though he hath dis∣pysed the bloode of gotes and calues / yet wyll not he dispyse a herte contryte and humble. If thou do that thyng whiche is gyuen to the eyen of men / moche rather take hede y• thyng not to be away whiche the eyen of god requyre. Thy body is co∣uered with a coule or habyte / what is that to the purpose if thy mynde beare a secu∣ler If thy vtter man be cloked in
a cloke whyte as snowe / let the este mē∣tes of thy inner maner be white as snowe also agreable to the same. Thou kepest sy¦lence outwarde / moche more procue that thy mynde be quyet within. In ye visyble temple thou bowest downe the knees of thy body: that is nothynge worthy if in the temple of thy brest thou stande vpright agaynst god. Thou honourest the tree of the crosse / moche more folowe the mistery of the crosse. Thou kepest the fastyng day and abseynest from those thyng{is} whiche defyle not a man: & why absteynest thou not from fytthy talkyng / which polluteth thyne own conseyence & other mens also. Meate is withdrawen from ye body / but why glutteth thy soule her selfe with cod∣des of beenes / peson / & suche lyke whiche are meate mete for swyne. Thou makest the church of stone gay with goodly orna∣mētes / thou honourest holy places: what is yt to the purpose if the tēple of thy hert / whose walles ye prophete. Ezechyell bored through be {pro}phaat or polluted with the abhomynaciōs of Egipt. Thou kepest the sabbot day outwarde / & within all thing{is} be vnquier thrugh ye rage & tōbling of vic{is} togider.The sabot day the day of rest. Thy body cōmytteth no adultry / but thou art couerous: now is thy mynde a fornycatour. Thou syngest or prayest
with thy bodily tonge / but take hede with in what thy mynde sayth. with thy mouth thou blyssest / and with thy hert thou cur∣sest. In thy body thou arte closed within a strayte celle / and in thy cogytacion thou wādrest throughout all the worlde. Thou herest the worde of god with thy corporall eares / rather here it within. what saythe the prophete? Except ye here within / your soule shall mourne and wepe. ye & what redest thou in the gospell: that whan they se they shulde not se / and whan they here they shulde not here. And agayne the pro∣phete saythe / with your eare ye shall here and ye shall not perceyue: blyssed be they therfore whiche here the worde of god within. Happy are they to whome god speaketh within / and their soules shall be saued. This eare to enclyne is cōmaūded / that noble doughter of the kynge whose beaurye and goodlynesse is all togyther within in golden hemmes. Fynally what auayleth it if thou do not those yuell thin∣ges outwarde / whiche with affection thou desyrest & coueytest inwarde. what auay∣leth it to do good dedes outwarde / vnto whiche within are cōmytted thyng{is} clene contrary. Is it so great a thyng if thou go to Hierusalem in thy body / whan within thyne own selfe is both Sodome / Egipt /
and Babylon. It is no great thynge to haue troden ye steppes of Christ with thy bodyly helesPylgrymages vnto holy plac / but it is a great thynge to folowe the steppes of Christ in affectyon. If it be a very great thyng to haue tou∣ched the sepulcre of Christe / shall it not be also a very great thyng to haue expressed the mistery of his buryeng. Thou accusest & vtterest thy synnes to a preestConfessyon. / whiche is a man: take hede howe thou accusest & vt∣terest them before god / for to accuse them afore hym is to hate thē inwardly. Thou byleuest perchaūce all thy synnes and of∣fences to be wasshed awaye at ones with a lytell paper or parchement sealed with wexe / with a lytle money or ymages of wexe offred / with a lytle pylgrymage go∣yng. Thou arte vtterly disceyued & cleane out of the way. The wounde is receyued inwardly / the medycyne therfore must ne∣des be layde to within: thyne affectyon is corrupt / thou hast loued that whiche was worthy of hate / and hated yt which ought to haue ben beloued. Swete was to the sower / and bytter was swete. I regarde not what thou shewe outwarde: but and if cleane contrary thou shalte begynne to hate / to flye / to abhorre that whiche thou lately louedest / if y• waxe swete to thyne appetyte whiche lately had the taste of
all: of this wyse at y• last I perceyue and take a token of helth. Magdalayne loued moche / & many synn{is} were forgyuen her. The more thou louest Christ / y• more thou shalte hate vyces: for y• hate of fynne folo∣weth the loue of pytie as y• shadowe folo∣weth the body. I had leuer haue the hate ones thy vycious maners within and in dede / than to defye thē before a preest ten tymes ī worde. Therfore (as I haue reher¦sed certayne thyng{is} for loue of ensāple) in the hole spectacle & syght of this vysyble worldeIn all besynes the spyryte is within. / in the olde lawe / in y• newe lawe / in all the cōmaundemētes of the churche / fynally in thy selfe & in all besynesse aper∣tayning to man without forthe / is there a certayn flessh / & within a spyrit. In which thyng{is} if we shall not make a p̄posterous ordre / neyther in thynges whiche are sene shal put very great cōfydencewhat thynges folow cheryte. / but euen as they do helpe to better thynges / and shall alwayes haue respect to ye spyrit to thing{is} of charyte: than shal we waxe not heuy as men in sorowe & payne (as those men be) not feble / euer chyldren (as it is a {pro}uerbe) not beestly and drye bones (as saythe the prophete) without lyfe / drousye and for∣getfull as men diseased of ye lethargy / not dull hauyng no quycknesse / not brawlers and scolders / not enuyous & whysperas
or dackbyters / but excellent in Chryste / large in charyte / stronge and stable bothe in prosperyte and aduersyteProsperyte  aduersyte / loking besyde small thynges and enforsyng vp to thyn∣ges of most profyte / full of myrthe / full al∣so of knowlege: whiche knowlege who so euer refuseth them dothe that noble lorde of all knowlege refuse. For veryly igno∣raunce or lacke of experyence / whome for the moste parte accompanyeth dulnesse of lernyng / & that gentle woman whom the grekes call Philancia / yt is to saye loue of thy selfe / only brīgeth to passe (as Esayas sayth) that we put confydēce in thyng{is} of nothing / & speake vanytes / yt we conceyue labour & bring forth iniquyte / and that we always be fearfull & vyle bonde seruaūtes vnto the cyremones of ye iewes. Of which maner persons Paule spekyng saythe / I beare thē recorde that the zele of god they haue / but not after knowlege.Chryste is the ende of the law But what knew they not? verily y• thende of the lawe is Christ / and Christ veryly is a spyrite / he is also charyte. But Esayas more playnly discrybeth the myserable and vnprofyta∣ble bondage of these men in the flesshe: Therfore saythe he my people be ledde in captiuyte bycause they had no knowlege / and the nobles of them perisshed for hun∣ger / and the moultytude of them dryed
away for thurste. It is no meruayle that the comen people be seruant{is} to the lawe and princyples of this worlde / as they whiche are vnlerned / neyther haue wys∣dome more than they borow of other mē∣nes heed{is}: it is more to be meruayled that they whiche are as chefe of Christes rely∣gyon / in the same captyuyte perysshe for hunger / and wydder away for thurst. why perysshe they for hunger? Bycause they haue not lerned of Christ to breake barly loues / they only lycke rounde aboute the rough & sharpe codde or huske / they sucke out no mary or swete lycoure. And whye wydder they so awaye for thurst? for by∣cause they haue not lerned of Moyses to ette water out of the spyrituall rocke of stone / neyther haue drunke of the ryuers of the water of lyfe whiche floweth / issu∣eth / or springeth out of the bely of Christ: and that was spoken verely of the spyrit / not of the flesshe. Thou therfore my bro∣ther / leest with sorowfull laboures thou shuldest not moche p̄uayle / but that with meane exercyse myghtest shortely waxe bygge in Christe and lusty / dyligently en∣brace this rule / & crepe not alwaye on the groūde with the vncleane beestes / but al∣ways sustayned with those wyng{is} which Plato beleueth to springe euer a fresshe /
through the heate of loue in the mynde of men.By the wynges of loue we must flye vp to the spyryte Lyfte vp thy selfe as it were with certayne steppes of the ladder of Iacob / from the body to the spyrit / from ye visyble worlde vnto the inuysible / from the let∣ter to the mystery / from thynges sencyble to thynges intellygible / frō thyng{is} grosse and compounde vnto thynges syngle and pure. who so euer after this maner shall approche and drawe nere to the lorde / the lorde of his parte shall agayne approche and drawe nyghe to hym. And if thou for thy parte shalte endeuoyre to aryse out of the darknesse and troubles of the sensuall powers / he wyll come agaynste the ple∣sauntly & for thy profyte / out of his lyght inaccessyble / and out of that noble scylēce incogytable:Incessable / is to vnderstonde that no man can attayne. Incogytable that can not be comprehended with mannes reason. In whiche not only all rage of sensuall powers / but also simylytudes or ymagynacions of all the intellygyble powers dothe cease and kepe scylence. ¶The syxth rule. capi .xiiij. ANd for as moche as in sodayn wri∣tyng / one thyng calleth another to remēbraunce / I wyll now adde the syxth rule / whiche is in a maner of kynrede to them that go before: a rule for all men as necessary vnto helthe as it is of fewe re∣garded.
That rule is thus / that the mynde of hym whiche enforseth and laboureth to Christ wardeThou must va¦ry from the cōmen people / vary as moche as is pos∣syble bothe from the dedes and also opy∣nyons of the comen ley people / and that thensample of pyte be not fet of any other saue of Christe onely:The ensample of pyte. for he is the onely chefe patron / the only and chefe ensample or fourme of lyuyng / from whom who so euer wrieth one ynche or nayle brede / goth besydes the ryght pathe and rometh out of the way. wherfore Plato with grauyte veryly as he dothe many thynges in his bokes of the gouernaunce of a cyte or co∣men welthe / denyeth any man to be able to defende vertue constantly whiche hath not instructed his mynde with sure & vn∣douted opinyons of filthynesse and of ho∣nesty. But howe moche more peryllous is it if false opinyons of the thynges whiche pertayne to helthe shulde synke in to the depe botome of thy mynde. For that con∣syderacion therfore he thynketh that this thyng shulde be cared for and loked vpon chefely / that the gouernours them selfe whome it behoueth to lacke all maner of vnclenlynesse / graue in their owne myn∣des very good opinyons of thynges to be ensued & eschewed / that is to say of good and yuell / of vyces and of vertues / and
that they haue thē very assured / all doute layde aparte as certayne lawes very holy and goodly: for what so euer thynge clea∣eth in the mynde surely roted with sted∣faste byleue / that euery man declareth in his maners and conuersacyon. Therfore the chefe care of christen men ought to be applyed to this poynteThe bringyng vp of chrysten mens chyldren / that their children streyght waye from the cradle / amongest the very flatterynges of the norises / why∣les the father and mother kysse thē / maye receyue and sucke vnder the handes of them whiche are lerned / opynyons and perswasyons mete and worthy of Christ: bycause that nothynge eyther synketh de∣per or cleaueth faster in the mynde than that whiche (as Fabyus saythe) in the yonge and tendre yeres is poured in. Let be a farre of from y• eares of lytle bodyes wanton songes of loue / whiche christen men synge at whom & where soeuer they ryde or go / moche more fylthy than euer the comen people of y• hethen men wolde suffre to be had in vse. Let them not here their mother wayle & wring her hand{is} for a lytle losse of worldly goodes / nor for the losse of her suster let thē here her crye out alas that euer she was borne / seyng that she is but a wretche a woman loste or cast awaye / lefte alone desolate and destytute.
Let not them here their father rebukynge and vpbraydyng hym of cowarnesse whi∣che hath not recōpensed iniury or wronge with double: neyther yet laudynge them whiche haue gathered togyder great ha∣bundaūce of worldly substaunce / by what soeuer maner it were. The disposycion of man is frayle and prone to vyces / he cat∣cheth mischeuous ensample at ones: none otherwyse than thou catchest fyre if it be put to. Howe be it this selfe same thynge is to be done in euery age / that all the er∣rours of the ley people myght be plucked out agayne from the mynde by the harde rootes / and in their places myght be plan¦ted holsome opinyons / and so myght be roborate yt with no vyolence they coulde be shakē or plucked a sondre / which thing who soeuer hath done shall easely & with∣out besynesse by his owne accorde folowe vertueUertue is the knowlege of thynges to be auoyded and of thinges to be desyred and loued. / and shall accompte them that do otherwyse worthy to be lamented and pi∣tyed / & not to be counterfayte or folowed. Unto this thyng pertayneth that not vn∣discrete sayeng of Socrates (thoughe it were rebuked of Arystotle) that vertue was nothynge els but the knowlege of thinges to be ensued and folowed / and of thynges to be eschewed or fledde: not but that Socrates sawe y• difference bytwene
knowlege of honesty and the loue of the same. But as Demosthenes answered pro¦nuncy aion to be the first / the seconde / and also the thyrde poynte of eloquēce / signy∣fyeng that to be y• chefe parte / in so moche that he thought eloquence to rest al togy∣ther in that thynge onely. In lykewyse Socrates disputyng with Prothagoras / proueth by argumentes knowlege in all vertue to beare suche roume / that vyces can no other whence procede than of false opinyons.Synne spryn∣geth of false opynyons. For certaynly brother bothe he that loueth Christe / & he also that loueth voluptuousnesse / many false honour doth folowe that thyng whiche is to eyther of them swere / good / and beautyfull / but the one slydeth through ignoraunce / in stede of a swete thyng enbrasyng a thynge out of measure sowre / flyeng as a sowre thing that which is swetest of all: also folowing that thyng for good and for lucre whiche is naught els but domage and losse / and fearynge that thynge for losse / whiche is chefe gaynes or aduaūtage: and iudgyng that thynge to be fayre whiche is foule / and wenyng or trowyng that to be sham∣full whiche onely is glorious and prayse∣full. In conclusyon if a man were surely and inwardly brought in byleue / and if also it were dygested in to the substaunce
of his mynde as meate in to the substaūce of the body / that onely vertue were best / most swete / most fayre / moste honest / most profytable. And on the other syde fylthy∣nesse only to be an yuell thyng / a paynfull tourment or punysshment / a foule thyng / shamfull / full of domage or losse: and dyd measure these thyng{is} not by the opinyon of the comen people / but by the very na∣ture of the thynges / it coulde not be (suche perswasyon or byleue endurynge) that he shulde stycke faste and cleaue longe tyme in yuell thynges. For nowe longe ago the comen people is founde to be the moste myscheuous auctoure or capitayne bothe of lyuyng and also of iudgement:The comē peo∣ple is the worst ctor or insti∣utor of lyuyng neyther was the worlde euer in so good state and condycion / but that the worste hath plea∣sed the moste parte. Beware leest thou this wyse thynke / no man is there that dothe not this / myne elders before me haue walked in these steppes / of this op∣pynyon is suche a man / so great a phylo∣sopher / so great a diuyne. This is the cu∣stome and maner of lyuynge of kynges / this wyse lyue great men / this done bothe bysshoppes and popes / these veryly ben no comen people. Let not these great na∣mes moue the one ynche. I measure or iudge not the comen or rascall sorte by the
roume / estate / or degree / but by the mynde and stomacke.Plato wylleth that we sholde ymagen a cer∣ten nombre of mē to be boūde with theyr hee¦des vpryght so that they coud not ones stirre / before them a wall / a caue at theyr backes hygher than theyr heedes / without that a fyre and that all thynges sholde come to & fro bytwene the fyre & the caues mouthe / that the shado¦wes of all thīg{is} myght appere vpon the wall before them / so shold they se no this but shado¦wes / so be the ignorāt & vnler¦ned peple boūd with the bond{is} of affections that thei neuer se the trouthe with eyes of reason. who so euer in the famous caue of Plato bounde with the bondes of their owne affectyons / wonder at the vayne ymages and shadowes of thynges in stede of very true thynges / they be the comen people. Shulde he not do prepo∣sterously or out of ordre if a man wolde go aboute to trye not the stone by the ru∣ler or squyre / but the ruler by the stone? And were it not moche more vnreasona∣ble if a man wolde go about to bowe and tourne / not the maners of men to Christ / but Christ to the lyuyng of men. Thynke it not therfore well or aright bycause that great men or bycause that the moste men do it / but this wyse onely shall it be well and ryght what so euer is done / if it agre to the rule of Christ: ye and therfore ought a thynge to be suspected bycause it plea∣seth the moste parte. It is a small flocke and euer shalbe to whom is plesaunt the symplycite or playnesse / the pouertye / the veryte of Christe. It is a small flocke ve∣ryly but a blyssed / as vnto whome dout∣lesie is due onely the kyngdome of heuen. Strayte is the way of vertue and of very iewe troden on / but none other leadeth to lyfe. To cōcludeThe flocke of goodmen is but small. / wheder doth a wise buyl¦der fetche his ensample of the most comen
and vsed or of the best werke. Paynters set afore them none but the best tables or patrons of ymagerye. Our ensample is Christ / in whom onely be all rules of blys∣sed lyuing / him may we coūterfayte with¦out excepcion. But in good and vertuous men it shall be mete that thou call to en∣sample euery thynge / so farre forthe as it shall agre with y• fyrst ensample of Christ. As touchynge the comen sorte of christen men thynke thus yt they were neuer more corrupte / The comē peo¦ple of chrysten men be moost corrpe. no not amongest the gentyles / as appertaynyng to the opynions of their maners.

And also in comedyes / tragydes / & other comē playes of the gentyles a great clappynge of han∣des and a showte was made for ioy of the ley people / whan vyces were craftyly and properly rebuked & checked: at the whiche same vyc{is} now a dayes beyng yuell pray∣sed there is made a showte & clappyng of

Howe many ensam∣ples be there in the hystories of gentyles of them whiche of the comen welthe well gouerned & mynistred / brought nothynge in to their poore housholde but an honest opinyon or reputacion: whiche set more by fidelyte than mony / by chastyte thā by lyfe / whom neyther {pro}speryte coulde make proude / wilde & wanton / neyther aduersite coulde ouercome and make heuy herted / whiche regarded honest ieoperdies & daū∣gers before voluptuousnesse & pleasures / whiche cōtented only with ye consciens of pure life / desyred neyther honours neither rychesse / nor any other cōmodytes of for∣tune. And to ouerhyp & make no rehersall
of the holynesse of Phocion / of pouerty of Fabricius more excellēt than riches:Fabrici{us} was a noble man of Rome whome no man coude make to posses rychesse or ry∣ceyue gyftes or to vse crafte or fraude against his enemies in tyme of mor∣tall warre. of the stronge & coragyous mynde of Camyllus / of ye strayte & indifferēt iustyce of Brutus / of the chastyte of Pithagoras / of the tēpe¦raūce of Socrates / of the soūde & constant vertue of Cato: & a thousāde most goodly beames of al sortes of vertues whiche are red euery where in thy stories of ye lacede∣mones / of y• perces / of the athenesCamyll{us} was so constaunt of mynde that no tortune coude moue hym nor no iniury coud make hym vn∣kynde to the co¦men welthe. / & of the romaynes to our great shame verily. Ho∣ly Aureius Augustyne as he of hym selfe wytnesseth in ye cōmentaryes of his owne cōfessions / longe tyme before he put christ on hym dispysed money / coūted honours for naught / was not moued with glory / prayseBrute slew his own sonnes by cause they con¦spyred agaynst the cōen welth / or fame / & to voluptuousnesse kept the bridell so strayte that he than a yonge man was content with one lytle wenche / to whom he kept also promesse & fayth of maryage. Suche ensamples amonge cour¦tyers / amonge men of the churche:Pyctagoras was the auctor of chast lyuing I wyll also saye amongest relygyous persones shal not a man lyghtly fynde:Socrates sayd that he knewe well hym selfe to be vnlerned and he neuer laughed & yet was he mery, or els if any suche shall be / by and by he shall be poyn∣ted / wondred / or mocked at as it were an asse amonge apes / he shall be called with one voyce of al mē a dotyng foole / a grosse heed / an ypocrite in nothing expert / malē∣coly mad / & shal not be iuged to be a man.
So we christen men honour the doctryne of Christ:The contynēce of saynte Au∣gustyne. so coūtrefayte we it that euery where now adayes nothing is accompted more folysshe / more vyle / more to be asha∣med of thā to be a christē mā in dede / with all the mynde & herte: as though yt eyther Christe in vayne had ben conuersaunt in erthe / or that christēdom were some other thyng nowe than in tyme past / or as it in∣dyfferently {per}tayned not to al men. I wyll therfore that thou frome these men vary with al thy mynde / and esteme the valure of euery thing by the cōmunyon or felow∣shyp of Christ onely.To be a very christen man is accompted eue¦ry where a ve∣ry vyse thynge who thynketh it not euery where to be an excellent thyng / and to be nombred amonge y• chefe of all good thynges / if a man discende of a worshyp∣full stocke and of honourable ancestours / whiche thyng they call noblenesse.The vayte of noble men. Let it not moue the one whyt whan thou herest the wyse men of this worlde / men of sad∣nesse endued with great authorite / so er∣nestly disputyng of the degrees of their ge¦nelogyes or lynage / hauyng their forheed and vpper browes drawen togyder with very gret grauyte / as it were a mater of a meruaylous diffyculte / ye & with great en¦forcement bringyng forthe playne tryfles. Nor let it moue the whan thou seest other so hygh mynded for ye noble actes of their
grantfathers or great grantfathers / that thynke other in comparyson of them selfe scarse to be men: but thou laughyng at the errour of these men after ye maner of De∣mocrytusDemocrytus laughed at what soeuer thynge was do¦ne in the lyfe of mortall men: it semyd to hi so folishe a thyng shalte compte (as trewe it is in dede) that the onely & moste perfyte noble∣nesse is to be regenerate in Christ / & to be graffed and planted in the body of him / to be one body and one spyrit with god. Let other men be kyng{is} sonnes: to the let it be greatest honour that can be that thou art called / and arte so in dede / ye sonne of god.The cheefest noblenesse is to be the sonne of god. Let them stande in their owne conceytes / bycause they are daily conuersaūt in great princes courtes: chose thou rather to be with Dauid vyle abiect in ye house of god. Take hede what maner felowes Christe choseth / feble persons / fooles / vile as tou∣chynge this worlde. In Adam we all are borne of lowe degre. In Christ we are all one thyng neyther hygh ne lowe of degre one more thā another. Uery noblenesse is to dispyse this vayne noblenesse: very no∣blenesse is to be seruāt to Christ. Thynke thē to be thyne ancestours whose vertues thou bothe louest and coūtrefaytest. Also harke what the true estymer of noblenesse said in the gospell agaynst the iewes whi∣che bosted themselfe to be of the generaci∣on of Abraham: a man verily not excellent
only / not ryche only / not the conquerour of kyng{is} onely / but also for his diuyne ver¦tues lauded of god hym selfe. who wolde not thynke this to be a noble thyng & wor¦thy wherof a man might reioyce? Herke yet what they herde: ye are (said Christ) of your father the dyuell / & the dedes of your father ye do.You ay se he∣re how Paule estemeth noble blodde. And here also Paule how he estymeth gentle bloode / acordynge to his maisters rule: Not al they (sayth he) whi∣che be of cyrcūcisyon of Israell be israeli∣tes / neyther all they that be of the sede of Abraham be the sonnes of Abraham. It is a low degre and shamfull to serue fylthy∣nesse / and to haue no kynred with Christ / whiche knowlegeth kynred with no man but with suche as fulfylleth y• wyll of his father in heuen. He is with moche shame a bastarde whiche hath the dyuell to his father / and veryly who so euer dothe the dedes of the dyuell hath the dyuell to his father / except Christe lyed: but the truthe can not lye. The hyghest degree that can be is to be the sonne and heyre of god / the brother and coheyre with Christe: what their badges and cognisaunces meane let them take hede.The badges of true noblenes. The badges of Christ be comen to all men / & the most honourable whiche be y• crosse / the crowne of thorne / the nayles / the spere / the signes or tokens
whiche Paule reioyseth to beare in his bodye. Of noblenesse therfore thou seest howe moche otherwyse I wolde haue the to iudge and thynke than the ley people ymagyne. who calleth not hym blyssed / ryche / & happy amonge the comen people whiche hath heaped togyther at home a great deale of golde? But iudge thou hym to be blyssed ynougheRyche men be not blessed. / ye that he onely is blyssed whiche possesseth Christ / very fely¦cyte / & of all thynges the best. Iudge him happy whiche hath bought y• noble and precyous margaryte of pure mynde with the losse eyther of al his goodes or his bo∣dy also / whiche hath founde the treasour of wysdome precyouser than all rychesse / whiche to be made ryche hath bought of Christ yt is moste ryche golde purifyed and {pro}ued with fyre. what thyng{is} thā be these whiche the comen people wondreth at / as golde / p̄cious stones / lyuelode: in a wrōge name they be rycheswhat is ryches. / in ye true name they be very thornes / which choke ye sede of the worde of god / acording to ye parable of the gospell. They be packes or fardels with whiche who soeuer be ladē neyther can fo¦low poore Christ by strayte waye neyther enter by ye lowe dore into the kingdom of heuen. Thynke not thyselfe better by one heere if thou shuldest passe ī riches eyther
Mydas or Cresus / but thynke thy selfe more boūde / more tangled / more ladē.Mydas & Cre∣sus were two ryche kynges. He hath habūdantly ynough that can vtter∣ly dispyse suche thynges. He is prouyded for suffyciently to whom Christ promysed nothing shulde be lackyng. He shal not be an hungred to whose mouthe manna of the worde of god semeth plesaūt. He shall not be naked which hath put Christ vpon hym.There is no dmage in the losse of ryches. Thinke this only to be a losse as oft as any thyng of godlynesse is mynisshed / & any thing of vyces is encreased. Thinke it a great lucre or aduauntage whan thy mynde through encrease of vertue is waxē better. Thynke thou lackest nothyng as longe as thou possessest hym in whom is al thyng{is}. But what is this whiche wret∣ches call plesure? surely it is nothing lesse than y• it is called. what is it than? Pure madnesse it is / and playnly (as grekes be wont to say) the laughter of Ayax / swete poyson / plesaunt mischefe.Ayax in his madnee han∣ged vp two gre¦te swyne suppo¦synge the one o haue bene Agamenō the other vlyxes his two mor∣all nemyes chā with moch laughter he ra¦ged against thē castynge many iniuryes in theyr teth / but whan he was com to his wyt¦tes agayne he kylled hym self for shame and sorow / so bicau¦se of voluptu∣ous pleasure foloweth mys∣chefe / it maye be well called the laughter of Aya. Trewe & onely pleasure is the inwarde ioy of a pure con∣science. The moste noble & deyntest dysshe that can be is the study of holy scrypture. The most delectable songes be ye psalmes endyted of the holy ghost. The most plea∣saūt felowshyp is ye cōmunyon of al sayn∣tes. The hyest deyntes of all is ye fruycion and enioyeng of the very truthe. Pourge
nowe thy eyen / pourge thy eares / pourge thy mouthe / & Christ shall begyn to waxe swete & plesant to the whiche tasted ones sauerly: ye if / milesij sibarite / if all inconty¦nent ryottours & epicuryens / shortly if the vniuersyte of ymagyners and deuysers of plesures shulde heape togyder al their fla∣teryng subtyltes & deynty disshes / in com∣paryson of him only they shal seme to pro¦uoke ye to spue. That is not by & by swete whiche is sauery / but that which is saue∣ry to a hole man: if water haue the taste of wyne to hym whiche burneth in a hote fe¦uer no / man wyll call that a plesure but a disease.Melosij Siber to were people whiche lyued dylycately Epycure put felycyte in vo∣luptuousnes. Thou art disceyued if thou byleue not yt the very teeres be moche more plea∣saunt to deuout and holy men than be to wicked men laughyng{is} / mockynges / ge∣stynges or scoffynges: if thou also byleue not fasting to be sweterThat is swete whiche sauou∣reth to a hole man. to ye one thā to the other plouers / quayles / fesantes / {per}triches pyke / troute / porpas / or the fresshe strugē. And the moderate bordes of thone apoyn¦ted with herbes & frutes to be moch more delycate than the costly & disdaynful feest{is} of thother. Fynally the true plesure is / for the loue of Christe not to be ones moued with false apparaunt pleasures. Beholde nowe howe moche the worlde abuseth the names of loue and hate. whan a folysshe
yonge man is clere out of his wytte and madde for a wenches sake / that the comen people calleth loue / and yet is there no ve¦ryer hate in the worlde.Folysshe loue. Trewe loue euen with his owne losse desyreth to se vnto a∣nother mans profite. whervnto loketh he saue vnto his owne pleasure / therfore he loueth not her but hymselfe: yet loueth he not hym selfe verily / for no man can loue another except he loue hym selfe fyrst / ye & except he loue hym selfe aryght. No man can hate any man atall except he first hate hym selfe. Neuerthelesse somtyme to loue well is to hate well / and to hate well is to loue well. who soeuer therfore for his lytle pleasure (as he supposeth it) layeth a wayte & gothe aboute to begyle a mayden with flateryng and gyftes / with fayre pro¦messes / to plucke from her the best thynge she hath / that is to wete her perfytnesse / her chastyte / her symplycite / her innocēcy / her good mynde / & her good name / whe∣ther semeth this man to hate or to loue? Certaynely there is no hate more cruell than is this hate / whan the folyssh father and mother fauour the vyces of their chyl¦dren:Tendernes to∣wardes theyr chylderne. the comen sayeng is / howe tenderly loue they their chyldren. But I praye the howe crewelly hate they their chyldren whiche (whyle they folowe their owne
affectyons) regarde not at all the welthe of their chyldren. what other wyssheth to vs our moste hatefull enemye the dyuell / than that we here synnynge vnpunysshed shulde fall in to eternall punysshment. They cal him an easy mayster and a mer∣cyfull prince / whiche at certayne greuous offenses eyther wynke or fauoure them / that the more vnpunisshed men sinne / the more boldely & at large they might synne. But what other thynge thretneth god by his prophete to them whome he iudgeth vnworthy of his mercy: I wyll not (sayth he) vysyte their doughters whan they cō∣myt fornycacyon / nor their doughters in∣lawe whan they cōmytte adultery. Unto Dauyd what promysed he. I wyll (saythe he) with a rodde loke vpō their inyquites / and with whyppes their synnes / but I wyl not take my mercy from them. Thou seest howe all thynges are renewed in Christe / and howe the names of thynges are chaunged. who soeuer loue hym selfe otherwise thā well / hateth himselfe deed∣ly. who soeuer be yuell mercyfull towarde hym selfe is a tyrant moste cruell. To care well is not to regarde. To hurte well is to do good. To distroye well is to saue. Thou shalte care well for thy selfe if thou shalte dispyse the desyres of the flesshe /
if in good maner thou shalt rage agaynst vyces / thou shalte do to the man a good tourne. If thou shalt kyll the synner thou shalte saue the man. If thou shalt distroy that man hath made / thou shalte restore that god hath made. Come of nowe and let vs go further: what thynketh the er∣roure of the people power / wyckednesse / manhode / & cowardnesse to be? Call they not hym mighty whiche can lyghtly hurt whom hym lyst: though it be a very ody∣ous power to be able to hurte / for in that are they resembled to noysome wormes and scorpyons / and to to the dyuell hym selfe / yt is to wete in doyng harme. Onely god is myghty in dede / whiche neyther can hurte if he wolde / neyther yet wolde if he coulde / for his nature is to do good. But this myghty felowe howe dothe he I beseche the hurte a man? He shall take away thy money? he shal beate thy body? he shall robbe the of thy lyfe? If he do it to hym that serueth god well / he hath done a good dede in stede of an yuell: but and if he haue done it to an yuell man / the one hath mynystred an occasyon veryly / but the other hath hurte hym selfe: for no man is hurte but of hym selfe. No man gothe aboute to hurte another except the same man hathe moche more greuously
hurte hym selfe aforehande. Thou enfor∣sest to hurte me in my money or goodes. Nowe hast thou through the losse of cha∣ryte hurte thy selfe most greuously. Thou canste nat fasten a wounde in me / but if thou haue receyued a woūde moche more greuous. Thou canste not take from me the lyfe of my body / onelesse thou haue slayn thyne own soule before. But Paule whiche to doo wronge was a man very weake and feble / to suffre wronge moste valyaunt and stronge / reioyseth that he coulde do all thynge in Christe. They call hym euery wher manly and bolde whiche beyng fyerse and of impotent mynde / for the leest displeasure that can be rageth se∣theth / or boyleth in wrathe / and acquiteth a shrewde worde with a shrewde worde / a checke with a checke / one yuel turne with another. On the other syde who so euer whan he hath receyued wronge maketh nothing a do / but dissymuleth as no suche thing were done / him thy call a cowarde / a dastarde hertlesse mete for nothynge: ye but what is more cōtrary to ye greatnesse of the mynde than with a lytell worde to be put asyde from the quyet and constācy of the spyrite / and to be so vnable to set at naught another mans folysshnesse / that thou shuldest thinke thyselfe to be no man
except thou shuldest ouercome one shreude tourne with another. But howe moche more manfull is it with / an excellent and large mynde to be able to dispyse al maner iniuryes / and more ouer for an yuell dede to recompence a good? I wolde not call hym a bolde man whiche durste ieoparde on his enemy / whiche scale castell or town walles / whiche (his lyfe not regarded) put teth hym selfe in all maner ieoperdyes / a thing comen almost to al warryours / but who so euer coulde ouercome his owne mynde / who soeuer coulde wyll thē good whiche dothe hym harme / praye for them whiche curse him. To this man is due the propre name of a bolde and stronge man and of excellent mynde.A bolde man and a stronge in dede. Lette vs also discusse another thyng / what the worlde cal∣leth prayse / rebuke / and shame. Thou art praysed / for what cause and of whome?nie prayse. for fylthy thynges and of fylthy persons / this veryly is a false prayse and a trewe re¦buke. Thou art dispraysed / thou art moc∣ked or laughed at / for what cause and of whom? for godlynesse & innocency / & that of yuell men: this is not a rebuke / no ther is no trewer prayse. Be it y• all the worlde repreue / refuse / & disalowe it / yet can it not be but glorious & of great prayse y• Christ approueth. And though what soeuer is in
the worlde agre / consent / & alowe / cryeng with a shoute y• is a noble dede / yet can it not be but shamfull that displeaseth god. They call wysdomewysdome of the worlde. euery where to gette good stoutly / whan it is goten to mayn∣tayne it lustely / & to prouyde longe before for ye tyme to come: for so we here thē saye euerywher & in good ernest of thē whiche in shorte tyme gate substaunce somwhat habundantly / he is a thrifty man / ware and wise / cyrcumspect & prouydent. Thus saythe the worlde whiche is bothe a lyer hym selfe and also his father. But what saythe veryte: Foole saythe he / I wyll fet agayne this nyght thy soule from the. He had fylled his barnes with corne / he siufed his store houses with prouy∣syon of all vytayles / and had layde vp at home haoundauntly of money ynough: he thought nothynge was to be doone more. Thus had he doone / not bycause he entended as a nedy keper to sytte a∣brode on his rychesse heaped togyther / as the poetes fayne the dragon to haue kept the golden flece (whiche thing men do al∣most euerywhere) but he enteded to haue spente ioyously / & yet dothe y• gospell call this mā a foole. For what is more folissh / what is more grosse ymaginacion or more fondnesse than to gape at the snadowes
and lose the very thinges / a thing whiche we be wonte to laughe at in the famous dogge of ysope:whyle we gape at snadowes we lose the ve∣ry thynges / as the dogge of ysope whiche whil he gaped at the shadow lost his bone in the water. and in the maners of chri∣sten men is it not more to be laughed at / or rather to be wept at. He may be comp∣ted a rude and vnexperte merchaunt that knewe not this sayeng of Therence: To refuse money at a seasone is somtyme a great aduauntage / or who so euer wolde receyue a lytle aduaūtage in hande whan he knewe great losse shulde folowe. How moche more folysshnesse and vnaduysed∣nesse is it to make {pro}uysion with so great care for this presente lyfe whiche is but a shadow / euery hour redy to fayle: namely whā god (if we byleue y• gospel) wyll mi∣nyster althing necessary for this lyfe / if we haue confydence in hym / & for the lyfe to come to make no prouysion atall whiche we must lede away full of mysery & wret∣chydnesse / if {pro}uisyon be not made nowe a forhāde with great dyligēce. Here another errour / they cal him perelesse polityke & in all thyng{is} expert / whiche herknyng for all maner tydyngesTo herken for tydynges out of all contryes is rebuked. knoweth what is done throughout all the worlde / what is the chaunce of merchaundyse / what the kyng of Englande entendeth / what newe thyng is doone at Rome / what is chaunsed in Fraūce / howe the danes & the sytes lyue /
what maters great prynces haue in coun¦seyle: to make an ende shortly / who euer can babble with all kyndes of men of all maner busynes / hym they say to be wyse. But what can be farder from the thought of a wise mā / or nere to y• nature of a foole than to serche for those thynges which be done aferre of & {per}teyne to the nothyng at al / & not so moch as ones veryly to thinke on those thyng{is} whiche are done in thyne owne brest & perteyne to the onely. Thou tellest me of the trouble & busynes of eng∣land / tell me rather what trouble maketh in thy brest / wrath / enuy / bodyly lust / am∣bycyon / how nygh these be brought in to subiection / what hope is of victory / how moche of this hoost is put to flyght / how reason is decked or appoynted. In these thyng{is} yf thou shalt be watchyng & haue a quycke eare & also an eye / yf thou shalte smell / yf thou shalt be circūspecte / I wyll call the polytyke & peerles: & that thynge whiche the world is wont to cast agaynst vs / I wyll horle agayne at hym: he is not wise at al / which is not wise for his owne {pro}fyte. After this maner yf thou shalt exa∣myne all the cares of mortall men / theyr ioyes hopes feares studyes / theyr myndes or iudgemētes / thou shalt fynde all thyng full of errour whyle they call good euyl / &
euyll good / whyle they make swete soure and soure swete: make light darknes / and darknes lyght. And this sort of men is the more parte by a great deale. Notwithstā∣dyng thou must euen at ones bothe defye them and set no store of them / leest thou sholdest be mynded to be lyke them: and also pite them so that thou woldest fayne haue them lyke vnto the. And to vse the wordes of saynt Augustyn: than is it mete bothe to wepe for them whiche are wor∣thy to be laughed at / & to laugh at them which are worthy to be wepte for. Be not in euyll thyng{is} cōfirmable to this worlde but be reformed in the newe wytte / that thou mayst approue not tho thyng{is} whi∣che men wonder at / but what is the wyll of god / whiche is good / well pleasynge & {per}fyte. Thou art very nygh ieopardy & no doute fallest sodeynly from the true waye yf thou shalte begyn to loke aboute the what y• moste parte of men do / & to herken what they thynke or ymagyn: but suffre thou whiche art the chylde of lyfe and of lyght also that deed men bury theyr deed bodies: & let the blynde capteyns of blynde men go away togyder in to the dyche: se thou ones moue not the eyes of thy herte any whether from the fyrst patron & chefe ensample of Chryste.

LEt this excellent lernyng and para∣doxes of the true chrysten fayth be sure and stedfast with the / that no christen man may thynke that he is borne for him selfe: neyther ought to haue the mynde to lyue to himselfe: but what so euer he hath what so euer he is / that all togyther lette hym ascribe not to hym self / but vnto god the authour therof / & of whome it came / all his goodes let hym thynke to be com∣mune to all men.A chrysten mā is not borne for hym selfe eyther to fo∣lowe his owne pleasure. The charite of a christen man knoweth no properte: let hym loue good men in Chryst / euyll men for Chry∣stes sake / whiche so loued vs fyrst whan we were yet his ennemyes / that he besto∣wed hymselfe on vs all togyder for our re¦dempcyon: let hym enbrace the one by∣cause they be good: the other neuertheles to make them good: he shall hate no man at all / no more veryly than a faithful phi∣sicyan hateth a sycke man: let hym be an ennemy onely vnto vices: the greater the disease is / the greater cure wyll pure cha∣rite put therto: he is an adulter / he hath cōmytted sacrilege / he is a turke: let a chri¦sten man desye the adulter / not the man: let hym despyse the cōmytter of sacrilege / not the man:we must desye  abhorre the vices / but not the man. let hym kyll the turlie / not the man: let hym fynde the meanes that the euyll man perysshe suche as he hathe
made hym selfe to be / but let the man be saued whom god made: let hym wyll well wysshe well / and do well to all men vn∣faynedly: neyther hurte them whiche ha∣ue deserued it / but do good to them whi∣che haue not deserued it: let hym be glad of all mens cōmodytees as well as of his owne / & also be sory for all mens harmes none otherwyse than for his owne. For veryly this is that whiche thapostle com∣maūdeth: to wepe with them that wepe / to ioye with them that ioyen / yea let hym rather take an other mans harme greuou¦ser thā his owne: & of his brothers welthe be gladder than of his owne. It is not a christe mans parte to thynke on this wise what haue I to do with this felowe / I knowe not whether he be blacke or white he is vnknowen to me / he is a straūger to me / he neuer dyd ought for me / he hathe hurt me somtyme / but dyd me neuer good Thynke none of these thinges: remembre onely for what beseruyng can those thyn∣ges whiche Chryst hath done / for y• which wolde his kyndnes done to the / sholde be recompensed / not in hym selfe / but in thy neyghbour. Onely se of what thynges he hath nede / & what thou art able to do for hym. Thynke this thynge onely / he is my brother in our lorde coheyre in Chryste / a
membre of the same body / redemed with one blode / a felowe in y• cōmune fayth / cal¦led vnto y• very same grace & felicite of the lyfe to cōme / euen as the apostle sayd one body and one spiryt as ye be called in one hope of your callyng one lorde & one faith one baptisme / one god / & father of al whi∣che is aboue all & euerywhere / & in all vs / how can he be a straūger to whome thou art coupled with so many folde bondes of vnite? Among the gentyles let those circū¦staunces of rethoricyens be of no lytel va∣lure & weyght / eyther vnto beniuolence or vnto maliuolēce / he is a citezī of y• same ci∣te / he is of aliaūce / he is my cosin / he is my familiar frende / he is my fathers frende / he hath wel deserued / he is kynde / borne of an honest stock / riche or otherwise. In Christ all these thynges eyther be nothyng / or af¦ter the mynde of Paule be al one / & the ve¦ry selfe same thynge: let this be euer p̄sent before thyne eyes / & let this suffyse the / he is my flesshe / he is my brother in Chryste. what soeuer is bestowed vpon any mēbre reboūdeth it not to all y• body / & frō thens in to the heed? we al be membres eche one of an other / mēbres cleuyng togyder make a body. The heed of y• body is Iesu Christ the heed of Christ is god. It is done to the it is done to euery one / it is done to Christ
it is done to god: what so euer is done to any one membre which so euer it be / whe∣ther it be well done or euyll: Alle these thynges are one / God / Chryst / the body / and the membres / that sayinge hathe no place iōuenyently amonge chrysten men / lyke with lyke. And the other sayinge dy∣uersite is mother of hate: for vnto what purpose perteynen wordes of discencyon wher so great vnite is / it sauoureth not of chrysten fayth that cōmunly a courtyer to at owne dweller: one of the countree to ar inhabyter of the cite: a man of hygh degree / to an other of lowe degree: an of∣fycer / to hym that is offycelesse: the ryche to the poore: a man of honour / to a vyle {per}soe: the myghty to the weyke: the ita∣lyen to the germayne: the frensshe man to the englysshman: the englysshe to ye scotte: the gramaryen to the dyuyne: the logycy∣ne to the gramaryen: the phisician to the man of lawe: the lerned to the vnlerned: the eloquent to hym that is not facounde and lacketh vtteraunce: the syngle to the maryed: the yonge to the olde: the clarke to the laye man: the preest to the monke: the Carmelytes to the Iacobytes: & that (leest I reherse all dyuersytees) in a very tryfle vnlyke to vnlyke / is somwhat par∣cial & vnkynde: where is charite which lo∣ueth
euen his ennemy: whā the surname chaunged / whan the colour of the vesture a lytel altered / whā the gyrdle or the shoo and lyke fantasies of men make me hated vnto the?Charyte is not in them which hate another man bycause his vesture or garmente is a lytell altered and chaunged. why rather leaue we not these childysshe tryfles / & accustome to haue be∣fore our eyes that whiche {per}teyneth to the very thyng: wherof Paule warneth vs in many plac{is} / that al we in Chryst our heed be membres of one body / endued with life by one spiryte (yf so be we lyue in hym) so that we sholde neyther enuy the hapyer mēbres / & sholde gladly socour & ayde the weyke membres: that we myght {per}ceiue y• we our selfe haue receyued a good tune / whan we haue done any benefyte to our neyghbour: & that we our selfe be hurte / whan hurte is done to our brother / & that we myght vnderstande how no mā ouht to study pryuately for hymselfe / but eury man for his owne parte sholde bestowe in cōmune that thing whiche he hath recy∣ued of god / that all thyng{is} myght redoūde & reboūde thyder agayne / frō whens they spronge / that is to wyte / frō ye heed.Let euery mā bestowe in co∣men what so∣euer he recey∣ued of god. This veryly is the thynge whiche Paule wry∣teth to the Corynthes / saying. As y• body is one & hath many mēbres / & all the mem¦bres of the body though they be many / yet be they but one body. Euen so lykewise is
Chryst / for in one spiryt we be all baptised to make one body / whether we be iewes or gentyles / whether we be bonde or free / and all we haue dronke of one spiryte (for the body sayth Paule) is not one membre but many: yf the fote shall say / I am not y• hand / I am not of the body: is he therfore not of the body? yf the eare shall say / I am not the eye / I am not of ye body: is he ther¦fore not of the body? yf all the body sholde be the eye / where is than the hearynge: yf all the body were y• hearyng / where than shold be the smellyng. But now god hath put the membres euery one of them in the body / as it pleased hym: for yf all were but one mēbre / where were y• body: but now veryly ben there many membres / yet but one body. The eye can not say to the hand I haue no nede of thy helpe / or agayn the heed to the fete / ye be not to me necessary: but those mēbres of the body whiche seme to be y• weyker are moche more necessary: & to those whiche we thynke to be the vi∣ler membres of the body we gyue more ha¦boundaunt honour: & those whiche be our vnhonest mēbres haue more haboūdaunt honesty / for our honest mēbres haue nede of nothyng. But god hath tempered & or∣dred the body / gyuyng plenteous honour to that parte whiche lacked / bicause there
shold be no diuision / debate or stryfe in the body / but that the mēbres sholde care one for an other indifferently. But it is ye whi¦che are the body of Chryst & membres one dependynge of an other. He wryteth lyke thyng{is} to the Romayns / saying in one bo¦dy we haue many membres / & all mēbres haue not one offyce. Euen so we beynge many are but one body in Chryst:Euery membre hath his ∣pacyon necessa¦rye to the pro∣fite of the soule but syn gularly we be mēbres eche one of another hauing gyftes dyuers after the grace whi¦che is giuen to vs. And agayn to ye Ephe. workyng verite (saith he) in charite / let vs in al maner thyng{is} growe in hym whiche is the heed / y• is to wyte Chryst in whome all the body cōpacte & knyt by euery ioynt wherby one parte mynystreth to another accordyng to the operacion & vertue whi∣che spryngeth of the heed & capacite of eue¦ry membre / in receyuynge maketh the en∣crease of the body for the edifyeng of hym self in charite. And in another place he bid¦deth euery mā to beare one anothers bur∣den / bicause we be mēbres one of another. Loke than whether they {per}teyn vnto this body whome thou hearest spekyng euery where after this maner / it is my good / it came to me by inheritaūce / I possesse it by ryght & not by fraude / why shall not I vse it and abuse it after myne owne mynde /
why sholde I gyue them of it any deale at all to whome I owe nothyng / I spyll / I waste / I destroye / that whiche peryssheth is myne owne / it maketh no mater to o∣ther men. Thy membre complayneth and grenneth for hunger / and thou spewest vp partryges. Thy naked brogher shyuereth for colde / & with the so great plenty of ray mēt is corrupte with mothes & long lyeng One nyghtes dicing hath lost the a thou∣sande peces of golde / whyle in the meane season some wretched wenche (nede com∣pellynge her) hath set forth her chastite to sell / & is becōme a cōmune harlot / & thus peryssheth ye soule for whome Christ hath bestowed his lyf. Thou sayst agayn: what is that to me / I entreate y• which is myne owne after myne owne fascion: & after all this with this so corrupte mynde thynkest thou thy selfe to be a chrystē man / whiche art not ones a man veryly? Thou hearest in the presence of a greate multytude the good name or fame of this or y• man to be hurt / thou holdest thy peace / or {per}aduēture reioysest & art well cōtent with y• backby∣ter. Thou sayst I wolde haue reproued hī yf those thinges whiche were spoken had {per}teyned to me / but I haue nothynge ado with hym whiche was there sclaundered. Than to conclude / thou hast nothynge
ado with the body / yf thou haue nothyng ado with the membre / neyther hast thou ought ado with the heed / veryly yf y• body nothynge a{per}teyne to the. A man (say they now a dayes) with violence may defende & put abacke violēce? what the Emperours lawes {per}niyt I passe not theron. This I meruaile how these boyces came in to the maners of chrysten men / I hurt hym / but I was {pro}uoked / I had leuer hurt than be hurt. Be it mans lawes punisshe not that which they haue {per}mytted. But what wyl the Emperour Chryste do / yf thou begyle his lawe whiche is wryten in Mathewe. I cōmaunde you (sayth Chryst there) not ones to withstāde harme:Desyre not vengeasice. but yf a mā shall gyue the a blowe on the ryght cheke / offre to him also ye other. And who so euer wyll stryue with the in the lawe / & take frō the thy cote / yelde vp to hym also thy cloke or mātell. And who so euer shall compell the to go with hī one myle / go with hī two mo other. Loue your enemyes / & do good to them whiche hate you / & pray for them which {per}secute you & pyke maters agaynst you / that ye may be ye sones of your father which is in heuen / which maketh ye sonne to ryse vpon good & euyll / & sendeth rayne vpon iust and iniust. Thou answerest / he spake not this to me / he spake it to his a∣postles /
he spake it to {per}fyte {per}sons. Herdest thou not how he sayd that ye may be the sones of your father: yf thou care not to be the sone of god / that lawe {per}teineth not to the.This is spokē to all chrysten men. Neuerthelesse he is not good veryly whiche wolde not be {per}fyte. Harke also an other thynge: yf thou desyre no rewarde / the cōmaūdemēt belongeth not to the: for it foloweth. If ye loue them whiche loue you / what rewarde shall ye haue: as who shold say none: for veryly / to do these thin∣ges (yt is to saye / to loue them that loueth the) is not vertue: but not to do it / is an euyll thynge: there is dette of neyther syde where is iust recōpence made of bothe sy∣des. Here Paule bothe a great wyse man & conuynge & an interpretour also of Chri¦stes lawe. Blesse (sayth he) them yt {per}secute you / blesse them / & curse them in no wyse / rendrynge to no man euyll for euyll / yf it may be almoche as in you is / hauyng rest & peace with all men / not defendyng your selfe my best beloued bretherne / but gyue place & withstande ye not wrathe: for it is writen. Uengeaūce shal be reserued to me & I wyll quyte them sayth our lorde. But yf thyne ennemy shall be hungry / gyue to hym meate: yf he be athurst / gyue to hym drynke: for yf thou do this / thou shalt hepe coles of fyre vpon his heed / that is to say /
thou shalt make hym to loue feruētly. Be not ouercōme of euyll / but ouer cōme euyl in goodnes. what shall than folowe sayst thou / yf I shal with my softnes nourysshe vp the knappyshnes or malyce & frowarde audacite of an other man / & in suffyng an olde iniury prouoke a newe? If thou can without thyne owne euyll eyther auoyde or put by euyll / no man forbyddeth the to do it: but yf not / loke thou say not it is bet∣ter to do thā to suffre.To a chrysten man / it is bet to suffre than to doo. Amende thyne enne my yf thou can / eyther ladynge hym with benefites / or ouercōmyng him with meke∣nes: yf that helpe not / it is better that the one perysshe thā bothe: it is better yt thou waxe ryche with the lucre & aduaūtage of pacyence than that whyle eyther to other rendreth euyll / bothe be made euyll. Let this therfore be a decree amonge chrysten menThe decree of chrysten men. / to compare with all men in loue / in mekenes & in benefytes / or doynge good: but in siryuyng hate or backbytyng / in re∣bukes & iniury / to gyue place euē to them that be of lowest degre / & that with good wyll. But he is vnworthy to whome a good turne sholde be done / or an euyl for∣gyuen / yet is it mete for the to do it / and Chryst is worthy for whose sake it is done I wyll neyther (saye they) hurte any man neyther suffre my self to be hurt: yet whan
thou art hurt / se thou forgyue the trespace with all thy herte / prouydynge alwayes that nothynge be whiche any man sholde remytte or forgyue vnto the. Be as ware & diligent in auoydynge that none offence or trespace procede from the / as thou art easy and redy to remytte an other mans.Offences must be forgyuen. The greater man thou art / so moche the more submytte thy selfe / that thou in cha∣rite aplly thy self to al men. If thou cōme of a noble stock / maners worthy of Chryst shall not dishonour / but honour ye noble∣nes of thy byrth.A gentylman. If thou be cōnyng & wel lerned / so moche the more soberly suffre & amende the ignoraūce of ye vnlerned.A cōnyng man. The more is cōmytted & lent to ye / the more art thou bounde to thy brother.A ryche man. Thou art ry∣che / remēbre thou art the dispēser / not the lorde: take hede circūspectly how thou en∣treatest the cōmune good. Byleuest thou that {pro}prete or īpropriacyon was {pro}hybyte & voluntary pouerte emoyned to monkes onely?Pouerte is not emoyned to monstes onely. Thou art deceyued / bothe {per}teyne indifferētly to all chrysten men. The lawe punissheth y• yf thou take away any thing of an other mans: it punissheth not if thou withdrawe thyne owne frō thy nedy bro∣ther: but Chryst wyl punysh both. yf thou be an offycer / let not the honour make the more fyerse / but let the charge make the
more diligent & fuller of care. I beare not (sayst thou) no offyce of the chyrche / I am not a shepherd or a bysshop. Let vs graūt you that / but also art thou not a chrysten man / consyder thou of whens thou art / yf thou be not of y• chyrche. So gretly Chryst is cōmen in to contempte to the worlde / that they thynke it a goodly and excellēt thynge to haue nothyng to do with hym: & that so moche the more euery mā sholde be despysed the more coupled he were to hym. Hearest thou not dayly of the lay {per}∣sones in theyr fury the names of a clarke / of a preest / of a monke / to be cast in our te∣thes / in stede of a sharpe and cruell rebuke saying thou clarke / thou preest / thou mon¦ke / that thou art: & y• is done / vtterly with none other mynde / with none other voyce or {pro}nouncynge / than yf they sholde cast in our tethes incest or sacrilege.Incest is to me dell with theyr owne kynne I verily mer¦nayle why they also cast not in our tethes baptym / why also obiect they not agaynst vs with the sarazyns the name of Chryst as an obprobrious thyng.Sacrylege is to violate per∣sones sacred to god / or to rob churches. If they sayd an euyl clarke / an vnworthy preest / or an vn∣religyous monke / in y• they myght be suf∣fred as men which note the maners of the {per}sones / & not despyse the {pro}fessyon of ver∣tue.

This worlde hath not knowen Christ the very and trewe lyght. This worlde is altogy∣ther set on myschefe / loueth hym selfe / ly∣ueth to hym selfe / studyeth for hym selfe and for his owne pleasure / & all for lacke he hath not put vpon hym Christ whiche is very & true charyte. From this worlde separated Christe not his apostels onely / but all men who soeuer and as many as he iudged worthy of him. After what ma∣ner than and fassyon I praye you do we
myngle with christēdom this worlde eue∣ry where in holy scrypture condempned? and with the vayne name of the worlde fauour / flatter / and mayntayne our owne vyces. Many doctours and teachers aug∣ment this pestylence / whiche corruptyng the worde of god (as Paule saythe) wre∣sten and fassyonen his holy scrypture ac∣cording to ye maners of euery tyme / whan it were more cōuenyent that the maners shulde be adressed & amended by the rule of his scrypture. And no myscheuouser kynde of flatterynge veryly is there / than whan with the wordes of the gospell and of the {pro}phtes we flatter y• diseases of the mynde and cure thē not. A prince hereth al power is of god:All power is of god. forthwith (as ye prouerbe sayth) his combe ryseth. why hath the scrypture made the hygh or swellyng in mynde ra∣ther than circumspecte & carefull. Thyn∣kest thou that god hath cōmytted to the an empyre to be gouerned / and thynkest thou not that the same wyl requyre of the a strayte rekenyng of the ordringe therof? The couetous man hereth it to be forbyd vnto christen men to haue two cotesThou shalt not haue two cotes. at ones. The diuyne interpreteth the seconde cote to be what soeuer shulde be superflu∣ous & more than ynough for the necessyre of nature / & shulde apertayne to the disease

Incestes whiche pollute their owne kynswomen / cloke & couer their fylthynes with thēsample of Loth / whiche lay with his owne doughters. why tourne we our eyen from Christ to these men? I dare be bolde to say that it ought not to be coun∣trefayted and folowed / no not so moche as in ye prophetes or Christes apostels ve∣ryly / if any thyng swarue or wrie from the docttryne of Christe.Nothynge oughte to be counterfeyted whiche varye from chryste. But if it delyte men so greatly to countrefayte holy synners / I do not agaynst saye them / so that they countrefayte them hole and altogyther. Thou hast folowed Dauyd in adulterye / moche more folowe hym in repentaunce.

Thou hast {per}secuted ye churche of god as Paule dyd / thou hast forsworne thy selfe as Peter dyd: Se lykewyse that thou stretche forthe thy necke for ye faythe and relygyon of Christe after the ensam∣ple of Paule / and that thou feare not the crosse no more than Peter. For this cause god suffreth euen great and ryght excel∣lent men also to falle in to certayne vy∣ces / that we whan we haue fallen shulde
not dispayre / but with this condycion / that we as we haue ben their felowes in synnyng & doyng amysse / euen so wyll be their companyons and parteners in the a¦mendynge of our synnes and mysdedes.

Nay I wolde not doute to counte thy matrymony not so good as their inceste commytted with their father / if in matrymonye thou doest not studye for issue / but to satysfye thyne owne voluptuous apetyte or lust.The wedlocke of some men is worse then the incest of lothes doughters. Dauyd after so many excellent and noble ensam∣ples of vertue and good lyuynge shewed / The mysdedes or ynnes of ho¦ly mē we passe farre nowe a dayes /  that many wayes. fell ones in to adulterye by occasyon and oportunyte gyuen him: and shal it be lau∣full therfore to the streyght way at thy ly∣bertye / to roll / walter / and tomble from house to house in other mens beddes all thy lyfe lōge? Peter ones for feare of deth denyed his mayster Christ / for whose sake afterwarde he dyed with good wyll: Shal it be laufull thynkest thou than to the for that cause / to forsweare thy selfe for euery tryfle? Paule synned not purposely and for the nones / but fell through ignoraūce: whan he was warned and taught / he re∣pented forthwith and came into the right waye. Thou bothe ware and wyse / and seynge what thou doest / wetyngly and wyllyngly cōtynuest from youthe to age in vyces and synnes / and yet by the en∣sample of Paule strokest thou thyne own

And certeyn¦ly the riche man is in this poynt of al men moste vnfortunate & wretched / bycause he can not so moche as discerne or knowe his true frendes & louers from other.

Thou woldest be counted a man of great stomacke / & ther∣fore thou sufferest not iniurye to be vna∣uenged: but in conclusyon by this meanes thou vtterest thy chyldysshnesse / seynge thou cannest not rule thyne owne mynde whiche is the very property and offyce of a man. Howe moche mālyer / how moche excellenter is it to set another mans foly at naught than to coūtrefayte it?Regarde lytll another mans foly. But he hath hurte the / he is proude and fierse / he scorneth the. The fylthyer he is so moche the more beware leest thou be made lyke hym. what the dyuelles madnesse is it that thou to auenge an other mans leud∣nesse woldest be made the leuder thy selfe. If thou dispyse the rebuke / all men shall perceyue y• it was done to one vnworthy therof: but & if thou be moued thou shalte make his quarell whiche dyd the wronge moche ye better. Furdermore take the thīg as it is / if any wronge be receyued / that is not eased one whyt with vengeaunce but augmented. For in conclusyon what ende shall there be of iniuryes on bothe sydes if euery man go forthe & procede to reuenge
his own grefe? Enemyes encreace on both partes / the sorowe waxeth fresshe & rawe agayne / and the longer it endureth ye more vncurable it is: but with softnesse & with sufferaunce is healed nowe and than / ye euen he whiche dyd the wronge / and after he is comen to hymselfe agayne / of an ene¦mye is made a very trusty and faythfull frende. But the very same hurt whiche by vengeaūce thou coueytest to put frō the / reboundeth backe agayne vpon the / and not without encreace of harme. And that also shall be a souerayne remedy agaynst wrathe (if accordynge to the diuysyon of thinges aboue rehersed) thou shuldest cō∣syder y• one man can not hurt another on∣lesse he wyll hym selfe / saue in those thyn∣ges onely whiche be outwarde goodes / whiche so greatly prayne not vnto man: for the very good thynges of the mynde god onely is able to take awaye / whiche he is not wonte to do but vnto vnkynde persons / & only he can gyue them / whiche he hath not vsed to do vnto cruell & fury∣ous persons. No christen man therfore is hurte but of hym selfe: Iniury hurteth no man but the worker therof. These thyng{is} also helpe (though they be not weyghty) that thou shalt not folowe the sorowe of thy mynde. If the cyrcumstaūces of retho∣iens

And on the other syde he hath hurt me gre¦uously. Certayne but he is my father / my brother / my mayster / my frende / my wyfe / it is accordynge that this grefe sholde be forgyuen / eyther for the loue / or els for the authorite of the {per}sone. Or els thou shalte set one thynge agaynst an other / & recom∣pence y• iniury with other good benefytes done of hym vnto the. Or with thyne offen¦ces done to hym afore season shalt accoūte it euen / & so make quyte. This man hathe hurte me veryly / but other tymes how oft hath he done me good. It cōmeth of an vn¦liberal mynde to forgete y• good benefytes and onely to remembre a lytell wronge or displeasure. Now he hath offēded me / but how ofte offended of me. I wyll forgyue hym / that he in lykewyse by myne ensam∣ple may pardon me / yf I an other tyme trespace agaynst hym. Fynally it shal be a
remedy of moche greater tue & of stronge operacyon / yf in the mysdoyng of an other man agaynst the thou dydest thinke in thy selfe / what thynges / how greuous / & how ofte thou hast synned agaynst god / how many maner of wayes thou art in dette to hym:Forgyue thy ettour. as moche as thou shalt remyt vnto thy brother which is in thy dette / so moche shall god forgyue vnto the. This waye of forgyuynge other mennes dettes hath he taught vs whiche is hym self a creditour / he wyll not refuse the lawe which he hym selfe made. To be absolued or losed from thy synnes thou rennest to Rome / saylest to saynt Iames / byest {per}dons moste large.

Euen so were not thou vnworthy whom god shold forgyue? In thyne owne selfe thou wylt haue mercy exercised / & a∣gaynst thy brother wylt thou vse extreme and cruell iustyce? is it so great a thyng yf thou beyng a synner thy selfe sholdest for∣gyue a synner / whan Chryst prayed his fa¦ther for them whiche crucifyed hym? is it an harde thynge not to stryke thy brother whom thou art also cōmaūded to loue? is it an hard thing not to pay agayn an euyl dede / for whiche excepte thou woldest recō¦pence a good: thou shalt not be yt towarde thy felowe y• Chryst was towarde his ser∣uaūt? Fynally yf this mā be vnworthy to whome for an euyll turne a good shold be recōpenced / yet art thou worthy to do it / Chryst is worthy for whose sake it is done But in suffryng an olde displeasure I call

But it shalbe a very good thing for y• thus instructed to harden thy mynde with reason / with cōtynuaunce & custome that thou couldest not be moued at all: it shall be a perfyte thynge / if thou hauynge indignacyon only at y• vyce / for a displea∣sure or rebuke done to the / shalt rendre a∣gayne

To holde wrathe vnder and kepe hym backe with a brydell / is the pro∣pertie of a wyse man.
