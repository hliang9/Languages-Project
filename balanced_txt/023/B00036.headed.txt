nto all Goodwillinge which oue God & his Righteousnes, Saluation and Peace. FOrasmuch as wee are bruted & defamed with ma∣ny-maner of false Reportes and Eyes / by certen maliti∣ and slaunderous Persons; that  as-yet communed with vs of  such Thing as they criminate & rge vs with-all; to the great De∣nge and Hindering of vs / and our od-name and Fame / amonge such  whom wee rest as-yet vnknowen / that they mought therby bring vs o a Contempt and Obloquie / and make vs detestable and monsterous re the Eyes of ye Common-people: also haue mooued; with such their underous Reportes; the spirituall ulers or Maiestrates / to cast some is into Prison / and driuē vs ther∣through
to great Trouble and Char∣ges / wher-as men haue not iustlie to blame, accuse, detect, or burden vs / as Transgressours of the Lawe (be-it against any of the Queene-her Ma∣iestis Proceedinges in Causes Eccle∣siasticall / or-els in her politike Lawes of Gouernement in Causes Tem∣porall) but haue alwayes shewe ourselues (life as it becometh leig Subiectes to doo) to liue and wall in all dutifull Obedience; loyallie towardes thesame / and applyed o endeuoured vs; to the vtterest of ou Power; to the Fulfillinge of the R¦quiring therof / if wee mought be rig¦lie tryed therin / by the Voyce of th Countrie wheare wee dwell / and I such as knowe vs / or with whom w haue had to deale / and not by ye M¦litious / which enuie vs in our W¦dooinge and Reasonable-dealinge So are wee therfore; out of speci
occasion; mooued and vrged [to the tter answering and satisfying of all aiestrates both spirituall and tem∣all / and of such as are resonablie∣inded / and that rest-doutfull of our ight Cause (more for that they ue not any iust Intelligence of the e Case and State of thesame / then  that they rest whollie stayed vpon ch friuolous, vnseemlie, and vntrue rutes as go-fourth against vs) hat they mought thinke therof elie; as heere insueth; to set-downe  extract or short Note / both of the rticles of our christen Beleef / as al∣ the Grounde of our synceere Re∣gion and sounde Profession. Deus Charitas est. GEeing then that it is meet & requisite / that euery vpright eleeuer in Iesu Christ / render an
Answere of his Faith / when hee is required therto (being falslie accused▪ contrarie to his right Beleef) / so can wee not therfore omit / to confesse and acknowledge our vpright and true Faith / against all those that vniustlie accuse vs / in our right Beleef. First-of-all / wee acknowledg and confesse / that wee knowe nor hold not of anye other Beleef / then tha which is required by the Propheates of God / out of the Lawe of the Lord / and wheron the holie Apostles and Euangelistes of Iesu Christ, haue buylded and stood-grounded / and lik as thesame is also taught & confessed by the Communialtie of the Saincte of Iesu Christ. For wee beleeue in the liuing God of Heauen, the Father almightie / and the true Maker of Heauē and Earth. And wee beleeue in Iesus Christ▪ his onlie Sonne, our Lorde: which was
conceaued by the Holie-gost and borne of the Virgin Marie: Hee suf∣d passion vnder Pontius Pilate:  crucified, dead, and buryed / and ended into Hell: and the thirde y / Hee rose-againe from ye Death:  ascended to the Heauens / and are Hee sitteth at the Right-hand  God / his Father almightie: From ence wee beleeue Hee is to com / to ge both the Quicke and the Dead. And wee beleeue in the Holie-gost: e holie Catholike-church / the Com¦nion of Sainctes: the Remission Sinnes: the Resurrection of the odye: and the Life euerlastinge. men. WEE acknowledg likewise / the Father / to be God / vncrea∣d and eternall / a stronge or mightie pirit / a perfect cleere Light / and a ue Beeinge or Substaunce: and at thesame true Beeinge, is hys
Name / and the Loue itself. Mee acknowledge also, ye Sonn to be God, out of God / of the very-lik Beeinge; or very-same Substaunce of his Father / the very true and onlie begotten Sonne of God / begotte frō Euerlastingnes / and; in the Ful¦nes of the tyme; borne of a Virgin out of the Seede of Dauid according to the Fleash: the Sonne of Man: the Sauiour of the Worlde: the tru Messias: a Mediatour alone / be∣twixt God and Man: In whos Name onlie (and in none-other) we obtaine Saluation / and the Remis∣sion of our Sinnes. Wee acknowledge likewise, th holie-gost to be God (as proceeding from God the Father and his Sonne Iesus Christ) and the true Spirit of God: the Comforter: and the Dyle or Annoyntinge, wherwithall God annoynteth his elected People ether
Hoe-church. For They are, out of  Grace of God the Father; vnde∣ed; redeemed, iustified, and made- through the Crosse / Death / Pas∣ / and Bloud-sheaddinge of Iesu rist: Which Holie-gost / doth di∣ and leade all his Annoynted, in∣ ll Trueth. For They onlie / are  true circumcised Israelites out of  Faith of Abraham, or the right ristians, through the Satisfacti∣ of Christ, in the Holie of the true abernacle / wherin they daylie take∣ their Crosse on them, with Him / d followe-after Christ, in all God∣nes and Trueth / to the Purginge  their Sinnes, til-into his Loue: In hom also ye Spirit of Christ, dwel∣eth, liueth, and woorketh / and not rtenlie; in Any-other. FArdermore / wee beleeue and acknowledge, concerninge this e-onelie liuinge God (the Father /
Sonne / and Holie-gost / with ye Com∣munialtie of his Sainctes) all and e∣uerye Part that is writen & confessed (by the holie Fathers) in the olde and new Testament, of or concerning the same Godhead / to be a Thinge most. true / & very-needfull that euery Chri∣stian beleeue, acknowledg, and confesse thesame / and also liue therin. So do wee in like-maner acknowledg, all the rest of holie Scripture aforesaide / as likewise all what-euer accordeth with the Minde of ye same (being set-fourth and instituted by holie Fathers, out of the true Light) to be an vpright, godlie, and healthsom Doctrine / and so ought to be takē and acknowledged of all Christians: But All whatsoe∣uer accordeth not therwith, that hold wee not for any-thing necessarie vnto Saluation / but rather for that which proceedeth out of ye Mans Imagina∣tiō / & not out of the Spirit of Christ.
Now follovveth the Confession of our Religion. CONsideringe the great Loue of God towardes vs and Mankinde / in that Hee hath cre∣ the Man like-vnto his owne I∣ge / as also sett him in the Fulnes  ife: and how that Hee hath more  (when wee were becom his Ene∣s; through the Transgressing of  Woord; and Children of Death) e farder extended his Loue tow∣es vs / and sent his onlie Sonne us Christ into this World / which th; to our Attonement; suffered the eath of the Crosse, which wee our∣es were giltie in: When wee w consider all this great Loue ex∣ded on vs / so are wee mooued to  Him againe / standing euenso Re∣ati or bound-againe [& so Religi∣] to loue ye same God of Life, with
all our Heart / Soule / and Migh and also our Neighbour as ourselue And for-that-cause, to thend that w mought vprightlie shewe-fourth th same, both in the Deede and Truet wee reade the holie Scripture of t Propheates and Apostles of Chris and all other Bookes which exhor vs vnto such an vpright Life / & Lo of God and our Neighbour: not ¦singe any other Ceremonies / Lawe Statutes nor Sacramentes of Ba¦tisme and Supper-of-ye-lord / then su as are ministred in ye Church of En¦lande. And to that ende obey wee a¦ so our soueraigne Ladie, the Quee and ye Maiestrates; our Fore-goer both spirituall and temporall:  that of God-his behalf / and euen  our Conscience and the Peaces can  payinge all Tribute vnto these-s Maiestrates: liuinge obedientlie a subiectlie; euen as it is meete & rig
their Lawes: and also dealing  all Men vprightlie, faithfullie,  charitablie (euen-like as wee our∣ wolde gladlie be dealt-withall  eir Handes) keepinge likewise  with Al-men / so farre as is pos¦ for vs. And this wee holde to be  fulfillinge both of the Lawe and heates / as likewise the Doctrine word hrist and his Apostles (as is ) contayned in the Olde & New tament. And our Conscience bea∣ s recorde / that all such Single∣dones ought to be defended by  Gouernours, from all Iniustice and Tirannical oppression. THissame is; finallie; the Con∣tentes of our Beleef / and the nde of our Religion, brieflie de∣ / and what wee acknowledge  onfesse concerning thesame, euen  the Bottom of our Heartes: and  also required of eueryone; tho∣rough
the gratious Woorde of Lif in the Seruice of the Loue of Ies Christ: and not els-what. And w thinke this our Confessinge; heere∣witnessed; to be sufficient before  christian Maiestrates, both spiritu and temporall / and for all Reson¦ble-men. Hoping also therfore (ina¦much as wee endeuour vs to liue su¦iectlike and peaceablie vnder our Pr¦ces Lawes) that our Cause shall  with Iustice; considered, to a R¦leassinge of vs from this our Subie¦tiued-bondage of Straightnes / P¦turbation / and great Charges, wh¦in wee now are bewrapped and se without iust cause of our part des¦ued. &c. Let eueryone consider and waye our Cause vp∣rightlie.
