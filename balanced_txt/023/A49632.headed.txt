THE Last Dying Speeches, CONFESSION, AND EXECUTION OF John Stokes, Isaac Davis, and Mary Williamson, who were Executed at TYBURN, the 5th. of March, 1684. For FELLONIES and BURGLARIES, toge∣ther with the manner of their Behaviour in New-Gate, after their Condemnation; As also the Last Dying Speech and Confession of Alice Paddison, who was Burnt at Tyburn for High-Treason, on the 5th. of the same Instant. Enter'd according to Order. TIS too apparent that the many Severe Examples of Justice, cannot deter Depraved and Infatuated People from rushing without any further consideration, upon their own Ruin; no, not the earnest Desires and Intreaty of those that have justly Suffered, and ought to stand as a Sea-Mark, to pre∣vent the Ship-wrack, and Inevitable Ruin of their Associates; but to be brief: The last Sessions, there being Twelve Persons Sentanced to Dye at the Sessions-House in the Old-Baily, on the 28th. of February last, viz. Thomas Rolph, Robert Barbados, Gerard Middleton, Jane Conyers, Alice Cranfield, Joan Nicols, Mary Desoe, Edward Conyers, John Stokes, Isaac Davis, Mary Williamson, and Alice Paddison; of which Number, the former Eight found the Mercy of a Reprieve, and the latter Four Ex∣ecuted, their Crimes for which they suffered their department in New-Gate, after Sentance, and their last Dying Speeches and Confessions, be∣ing as followeth. Edward Conyers, Being Tryed upon an Indictment of High-Treason, Pleading thereto not Guilty, the Evidence against him, was that his Daugh∣ter coming to a Bake-House for Bread, with two newly Clipped Shillings, and being there Questioned where she had them, after much stamering, Consternation and Amazement, declared she had them of her Mother, and Related that her Father was a Cliper, &c. whereupon a Warrant to Search being obtained, Shares, Files, Melting-Pots, Melted Silver, and many other Implements appertaining to that illegal Practice were found in the Prisoners Lodging; upon which, both he and his Wife, were found Guilty: but
she being Reprieved as aforesaid, when he being conveyed back to Newgate after Sentance of Death Received as in Case of High Treason, he became exceeding Penitent, Expressing abundance of Sorrow, at his failing and often conversed with such Pious and Charitable Ministers as came to af∣foard Spiritual Consolation to him and his Condemned Fellows, that so they might not droop under the Terrors of Death, and give further, way to the Enemy of Mankind, (who always at such times is most busy) to bring in dispair, he likewise was observed to Pray often most fervently for Life and Imortality in the World to come, especially when he was acquaint∣ed that his Offence had barred firm of all hopes of Pardon, and so he con∣tinued to bewail his Deplorable Condition, and the near approach of his untimely Fate, till at last he, through the Intercession of his Friends and his Majesties great Clemency, received a Reprieve. John Stokes, a Notorious Pick-Pocket, being at his Trade near Py-Corner, was apprehended for Picking the Pocket of one Elizabeth Ross on the 11th. of February last, for which at the ensuing Sessions being Indicted and Tryed, upon his Tryal, it appeared that he had Picked the Prosecutors Pocket of a Purss, and in it 38 s. with which upon his being discovered, he Run away, but was quickly overtaken with the Money about him, and that being in Newgate, he sent some of his Accomplices to Compound the Fellony and Robbery, upon which proof he was found Guilty, and after Judgment of Death Received with his Fellow Offenders, reconvey'd to New∣gate, to expect the Execution of the Sentance, where for a while (having as 'tis supposed some hopes of a Pardon or Reprieve with which Vanity those miserable Wretches too often flatter themselves: even on the Brink of Eternity) he remained much unconcerned, seeming rather resolutely ob∣stenate, then sensible of his Condition, but having certain notice some days since that he must dye; for that his reitterated Offences, would not admit of Mercy, he became more serious; Deaths dismal aspect being to terrible to be outbraved, and often apply'd himself to good and sober advice, being the Precedent Sabbath very attentive to the Sermon, which was for that purpose Preached, and so continued till he was brought to the Place of Execution. Where being in the Cart, and the Rope put about his Neck, he seemed, as it were, in an Obstinate Mood, yet shewed some Remors for his Crimes, declaring to the Minister, That he had been a great Of∣fender, and desired him to tell the People as much; and that he desired Heartily, that they would put up their Prayers to Almighty God for the Salvation of his Soul, and take warning by his Fall, owning the Fact for which he Suffered. But being desired by the Minister to join in singing the Psalm which his Fellow-Sufferers desired might be Sung, viz. the 25th, begining at the Fifth Verse, he refused it, and did not seem much con∣cerned, yet attentively listned to the Prayers of the Two Ministers, who supplied the place of Mr. Ordinary, and with a Christian Zeal discharged that Charitable Duty to the utmost of their power, by Praying with, and Exhorting the Wretched Miscreants to a Candid Confession, and Hearty Repentance. Mary Williamson, Alias Jones, Alias Smith; Being Tryed upon an In∣dictment the last Sessions, for Robbing Henry Powny, and it appear∣ing upon Evidence that she had Stolen a Silver-Salt, value 20 l. A Silver Plate of the same value, a Caudle-Cup of 45 l. value, a Tankard value 10 l. Silver Hamper, value 5 l. a Silver Chain, and divers other Pieces
of Plate of considerable value, besides 44 l. in Mony; which she did un∣der the Colour of Hiring her self in the Nature of a Servant to the Pro∣secutor, with whom she Lived, at his House in St. Laurance Pountny, Lon∣don; from Michaelmas last till the 26 of October, and effected the Rob∣bery in the absence of her Master and Mistress, upon proof of which, she received Judgment, and was reconveyed to New-Gate; having rit Pleaded her Belly, but not proving with Child, when being in Retirement, she much bewailed her miserable condition, and said she was temp∣ted to it, being very desirous to Live, and earnestly praying for Pardon, more temporal then otherwise, and so continued till the day of Execution; when with the rest she was conveyed to Tyburn, the common Place of Suffering. Where the Ministers prayed with her, and intreated her for Christs sake to Repent from the bottom of her heart of all her Sins, and confess her Crimes both to God and Man, that thereby (like the Thief upon the Cross) she might obtain Pardon and Remission, to which she gave great attention, with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, desiring the great and Righteous Judg of all the Earth to have mercy upon her poor departing Soul, which she commended into his Hands, then being asked by a Party that stood by the Cart, what was become of the Plate and Mony, she said what Plate, she knew of no Plate, then it was told her her Mistress would speak to her, to which she reply'd, if she had any thing to say to her she-must come to her, for she well knew she could not come to her, and then desired God to forgive the Man that swore against her, saying, she desired to Die in Charity with all Men, and so continued to Pray, without making any publick Speech to the People, as also to Joyn in singing the Psalm to the last, not own∣ing that she had either Plate or Mony. Isaac Davis, formerly Living at Knights-Bridg, with one Mr. Marshfield, being Tryed, for that he and two others his Accomplices, not taken, on the 30th. of December last, Broke into the House of the said Marshfield, and thereby made such a Noise that Marshfield coming down to know what occasioned it, was set upon, shot at, and wounded by the Burglars, and had been undoubtedly Murthered, had not his Son come to his Rescue, upon which they fled, yet there was left a Hat behind, which was Sworn to be his, and it being farther proved by the Person assassinated, that he knew him by several Tokens, he was found Guilty of the Burglary, and putting the People in Corporal Fear of their Lives, and receiving Judg∣ment with the rest, was remanded to New-Gate, where he continued to be deeply sensible of his Prosleygate Life, and to be very attentive to those that gave him Directions about his Eternal Welfare; saying bad Company had been the cause of his shame and Ruin, and if he might Live, he would amend; being often seen to Pray and Weep alowd, when this Morning he was conveyed to the Place of Execution, where being come, and desired to unburthen his Conscience, he declared in the Presence of Almighty God, and before the People, that he was Innocent of what he dyed for, desiring that God would show some Imediate Judgment on him if he was Guilty, yet desired of God to forgive his Prosecutors, and prayed one Harris (that spoke to him and asked him about Stealing of Poultry, and breaking open a Shop, which he likewise deneyed to have any hand in) that he would remember him to all his Friends in Knightsbridg, and tell them that he took it upon his Salvation, and wished that he might never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, nor Receive Mercy at the Hands of God if he had any Hand in the Fact for which he Suffered, protesting with the
like Asseveration that he was in his own House, at the time the House was said to be broken open, and that for the Hat, Charged to be his, he never saw it till he saw it in the Hands of his Prosecutor, & that he never did any Crime in the like Nature, but geting Mony, he had spent it as freely, & had been a great Drinker, been guilty of Sabath breaking, and many such heinous Sins, for which he believed God suffered him to come to such an untimely end, desiring that his Innocence as to the Robbery might be made known, nor did he waver in his Asseveration, though often intro∣gated by the Ministers, and desired not to dally with his Soul upon the Brink of Eternity, whereupon one of the Ministers declared to the People what he said, as also he himself did twice or thrice, and so with much Pe∣nitence and Divotion, and again Prayed God to forgive his Prosecutors, saying he desired to dye in Charity with all Men, and so Singing his part of the Psalm, and Praying to God to recieve his Soul, he passed into Eternity. Alice Pattison, Alias Kirk, Being Apprehended for High-Treason, in Clipping the Lawful Currant Coin of this Kingdom, &c. was the last Sessions brought upon her Tryal, where it appeared against her upon Evi∣dence, that she had Clipped divers half Crowns of King Charles the First, and divers other Pieces, and that she had purchased several Gunies, at 1 l. 1 s. 8 d. with Clipped Money, and changed it for broad Mony, at 1 l. 1 s. 6 d. and that she cut the value of 4 d. off each Half-Crown, and that she had been seen Clipping, Filing, and Diminishing at divers times, the Principal Evidence against her, being one Mary Hern, in whose House she Lodged, and one that had been assisting to her in the unlawful Trade: but what made it out more plain, was a Melting-Pot, Melted-Silver, and Clip∣ped-Mony, that upon Search was found in her Possession; upon which Evidence she was found Guilty of High-Treason, and reconveyed to New-Gate, where during the Intervene, she continued exceeding Penitent, be∣wailing her sad Misfortune, and the dismal and untimely End she had brought her self to, by her unlawful Practice, being extraordinary Peni∣tent, and much attentive to those that gave her Ghostly Consolation, con∣tinuing in that manner with abundance of Tears flowing from her, till this Morning, at what time being drawn upon a Sledg to Tyburn, where a Stake being driven in with two holes in it, she was brought thither before the other Prisoners, but upon further Order, her Burning was respited for a while, and she put into the Cart amongst the other Prisoners, where the Ministers gave her Spiritual Comfort; desiring her in this her great Extre∣mity to lay hold on the Passion Death, and Merits of her Merciful Rede∣mer, and that she would unburthen her thoughts, to which she answered, she hoped for Salvation and Eternal Life, but that she must needs own she was unworthy of it, for that she had been a great Sinner, and was, espe∣cially Guilty of the Treason for which she was to suffer; having used that wicked Profession for the space of a Year past, then she desired all good Christians to Pray for her, and Sung her Part of the Psalm divoutly, after which, the Cart drawing away, the three former were Hang'd, and she reconveyed to the Stake, where she again desired the Prayers of all good People, confessing her Crime, and intreating the Executioner, who took a Crown out of her Pocket, to strangle her before the Fire came at her, he set her upon a Block, and fastened the Rope through the holes about her Neck; when after she had Prayed a while, he struck it away, and let her Hang whilst he placed the Wood about her, which being Kindled, Consu∣med her to Ashes.
