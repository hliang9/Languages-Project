Christian Reader: Having fore-written about the extent of the death, and sacrifice of Christ; That it might be more usefully understood, I have here presented to thy view, this fol∣lowing Tract, desiring, that is good, may be received; And, what swarveth from Truth, that I may be lovingly informed thereof, which I spall heartily accept at the hands of any; or, if evident truth be faulted, shall with meeknesse give answer if I may be permitted; And that God may graciously discover to us, and leade us into all truth; Is the desire of the least of his mercies, and servants. Tho: Moore.
A DISCOVRSE ABOUT THE PRETIOVS BLOOD AND SACRIFICE OF IESVS CHRIST. CHAP. I. The Preface. COnsidering how our Saviour, when he was about to leave his Disciples, whom he so dearly loved; left with them by his institution, His Supper, in which they might spiritually enjoy his presence; And then said to them: Do this in remem∣brance of mee, Luk. 22.19. And that the Apostle saith, That in so doing we shew forth the Lords death till he come, 1 Cor. 11.25.26. And likewise; That the Apostle affirmeth, that as many as are baptized into Christ, were baptized into his death, Rom. 6.3. so that to be taught, and subdued to the acknowledge∣ment, and brought into the faith of Christ, and unto confor∣mity with him; Is to be taught, and subdued to the acknow∣ledgement, and brought into the faith of the death of Christ,
and conformed to him in fellowship of his death, as that wherein the vertue of his Resurrection is met with, Rom. 6.4.8. Gal. 2.20. Phil. 3.2.7.8.9. 2 Cor. 4.10.11.12. 2 Tim. 2.11. And the Scripture affirmeth of all the Priesthood, Sacrifices, Atonement, and Purifications under the Law; That they were but figures, types, and shadowes of that to be found in Christ; He being the body, Col. 2.17. And the truth of all typed in the shadowes found in him, Heb. 9.9.23. Chap. 10.1. And so that, there was more vertue, Power, and Prevalen∣cy with God in Christ, his offering himselfe, and presenting the vertue of his blood before his Father, than in all the offerings of the other Priests, Heb. Chap. 10.14. And that there is more Power, vertue, and prevalency, with, and in men for purge∣ing the conscience, in the spirituall sprinkling of the vertue of the blood, and sacrifice of Christ therein; than was in all those shadowing purifications, and sprinklings to purifie the flesh, Heb 9.12.13.14. Yea those who in being taught of God, have experimented the truth hereof, call the blood of Christ pretious, 1 Pet. 1.19. And have professed in their Preachings, not to determine to know any thing among their hearers, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified, 1 Cor. 2.2. And not to glory, and rejoyce, save in the Crosse of our Lord Jesus Christ, Gal. 6.14. It gives me to conceive, that a sober reader will be perswaded; that there is somthing in the blood, death, and sacrifice of Christ, of infinite vallue, and worthy our hartiest, and deepest consi∣deration, most wiste view, best remembrance, and choyse ac∣ceptation: and so I am encouraged to present the same to consideration, and for more orderly proceeding to consider. 1. What is comprehended in these termes, the sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ? 2. The manifold ends of his suffering, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice, as the Scripture distinctly sets them forth. 3. The necessity of the sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacri∣fice of Christ. 4. The Excellency, Dignity, and worth of this blood, and sacrifice.
5. The vertue, operation, and prevalency thereof, presented, and applyed. 6. The usefulnesse of the same, knowne, and believingly remembred. CHAP. II. What is comprehended in these tearmes? The Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ. IN these together, and every of these tearmes, in Scripture is ment; Somtime fully, and almost onely, and alwayes inclusively. The very suffering of Christ it selfe; The shedding of his blood, and his death, Esa. 53.4.5. Surely he hath borne our griefes, and carryed our sorrowes, — He was wounded for our trans∣gressions, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, Rom. 4.25. He was delivered for our offences, 1 Cor. 15.3. Christ dyed for our sins according to the Scripture, Gal. 3.13. Being made a curse for us, 1 Pet. 3.18. Christ hath once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, 2 Cor. 5.14.15. He dyed for All, Heb. 2.9. By the grace of God he tasted death for every man. 2. Somtimes together with this former sence of the suffer∣ings, the Blood-shed, and Death of Christ it selfe; is ment, Also in the same tearmes of suffering, Blood, and Death of Christ, the vertue, and efficacy of this suffering, Blood-shed, and death of Christ as he is risen from the Dead, free, and just from all our sins imputed to him, and a victor over all our curse, and death imposed on him; As namely: 1. The fulfilling the truth of God in the death of the sin∣ner; for so we judge, if one dyed for all; then are all dead, and he dyed for all, that they which live, should live to him, &c. 2 Cor. 5.14.15. Gen. 2.17. 2. The satisfying Divine Justice, in that all have suffered the curse in one publike man being made a curse, and having
overcome it for them, Gal. 3.10-13. with Esa. 53.5. and 2 Cor. 5.19.21. 3. The satisfying, and fulfilling the Law, accomplishing a righteousnesse for us, that Way may be made for the righte∣ousnesse of the law to be fulfilled in us, Gal. 1.4. Rom. 8.3.4. 4. The overcoming death, and him that had the power of death, And so takeing out of the way, that which was in the way between God, and us; contrary to us, 2 Tim. 1.10. Heb. 2.14. Col. 2.14. So as in him, mercy and truth are met, righteousnesse and peace have kissed, Psal. 85.10. such the vertue of the sufferings, blood, and death of Jesus Christ, being risen from the dead. And thus he is said to be risen for our Justification, Rom. 4.25. And so is he justified in the roome of all mankind, that they are all in him as in the publike person, justified, Rom. 3.23.24. All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Rom. 5.18. As by the offence of one unto all men, to Codemnation, even so by the righteousnesse of one to all men to justification of life; And he by himselfe, purged, (or made purgation for) our sinns, and then sate downe, &c. Heb. 1.3. And so hath taken away our sins by the sacrifice of himselfe, Heb. 9.26. Iohn 1.29. 1 Iohn 3.5. And through death destroyed him that had the power of death, Heb. 2.14. And all this, the vertue and efficacy of the death, and resur∣rection of him that is risen from the dead, 1 Cor. 15. tot 3. Somtimes; together with both the former sences; by the suffering, blood, death, and sacrifice of Christ, is ment, His offering, and presenting himselfe in heaven before his Fa∣ther, by and with the vertue of this his suffering, blood, and death, as the price, the Ransome, the propitiatory-sacrifice for atonement and purchase to God for men: So Heb 8.3. It is of necessity that he have somwhat also to offer, Heb. 9 26. now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of himselfe, vers. 12. By his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, verse 14. who through the eternall Spirit offered himselfe without spot to God: see Heb. 10.1.—12. Tit. 2.14. Who gave himselfe for us,
that he might redeem us, 1 Tim. 2.6. who gave himselfe a ransome for all. 4. Somtime, together with all these former sences; by the suf∣fering, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, is ment; The pre∣valency, and effectuallnesse thereof, as presented to God with God for mankind, so as he hath made peace, slaine enmity, obtained e∣ternall Redemption, and received fulnesse of spirit to make it knowne, and dispense it, Ephes. 2.15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, so making peace; verse 16. Having slaine the en∣mity, Heb. 9.12. having obtained eternall redemption, and Psal. 68.18. Received gifts in the man, (and for men, Ephes. 4.8.) even the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell amongst them. And this prevalency, and effectualnesse of his pretious Blood, and Sacrifice offered to his Father for men; appeares in many things; especially. 1. In that the Father hath accepted of him, and his Sacrifice, for the ends, for which he offered the same to him, and hath re∣ceived, and exalted him with, and at his right hand, Mat. 17.5. My beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleased, Iohn 16.8.10. The Spirit shall convince the world of righteousnesse, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; That is, He is received, and his Sa∣crifice accepted, and so sent forth no more to suffer, and offer Sacrifice for sinns, as he should have been, if he had not satisfied for all (Heb. 9.7.8.) And wrought a perfect righteousnesse, and so it is said, Heb. 1.3. After he had by himselfe purged; (or made purgation of) our sins, he sat downe on the right hand of the Majesty on high Heb. 10.12. After he had offered one sacrifice for sinns for ever, he sat downe on the right hand of God; yea the Lord in Testimony of his well-pleasednesse with him, hath said to him, Psal. 110.1. Sit thou on my right hand till I, &c. Heb. 1.13. 2. In that the Father hath released, and given over all to his Sonne, and given all power, and authority into his hands, and made him Lord of all, so as he shall judge all men; And he hath filled him with Immeasurable fulnesse of the Holy-Ghost in the humane nature; to dispense to men, to make known his grace, and that he may according to the Gospel absolve all that believe, and condemn all that will not believe, Psal. 2.8. I shall give thee, the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for
thy possession, Mat. 11.27. All things are delivered to me of my Father, Iohn 16.15. All things that the Father hath are mine, Mat. 28.18. All power is given to me in Heaven, and in Earth, 1 Pet. 3.22. Angels, Authorities, and powers being made subject to him, Act. 2.36. God hath made Jesus both Lord and Christ, Act. 10.36. He  Lord of all, and this by vertue of his death, resurrecti∣on, and ascention, Rom. 14.8.9. And he is the Judge, Iohn. 5.27. Act. 17.31. And is filled with spirit to send forth in the meanes, Act. 2.32.33. Ephes. 4.7.-12. That so he may absolve and judge according to the Gospel, Rom. 2.16. Iohn 12.48. 3. In that the Holy-Ghost in the Scripture avoucheth such full sufficiency, compleatnesse and vertue in this pretious Blood, Ran∣some, and sacrifice, as it is by Christ, in presenting, and offering himselfe, presented, and offered to the Father, and by him accept∣ed, and received, that Jesus Christ is hereby become, appointed, and accepted of God, even Gods salvation to the ends of the earth,Esa. 49. Ioh. 4.42. Act. 13.47. The Saviour of the world, 1 Iohn 4.14. The Mediatour between God and men, 1 Tim. 2.5. The great High-Priest, Prophet, and Advocate for his Church, Heb. 3.1.-6. and 7. 1 Iohn 2.2. 4. In the appearing and forth-coming of love, and grace through the effectualnesse, and fruitfulnesse of his pretious Blood, Ransome, and Sacrifice, as it hath been, and is presented to God; from whom it procureth such Kindnesse, and grace to be extended to manward, that hereby, even by Christ, and for his sake, and through the vertue of his Sacrifice; 1 The earth with the Inhabitants are upheld for men, and mens lives reprived, and space afforded, even to Rebels, that they might repent, Psalm. 75.3. The Earth and all the Inhabi∣tants thereof are dissolved, I bear up the pillars of is. Heb. 1.3. upholding all things by the Word of his Power, when he had by himself purged our sins, &c. Col. 1.17. By him all things consist. Joh. 1.4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men, Rev. 2.21. I gave her space to repent, 2 Pet. 3.9. He is long-suffering to us∣ward, not willing that any should perish, but that All should come to repentance. 2. Patience, and forbearance is extended to men that are yet found sinning: and bounty, and many mercies vouchsa∣fed,
which carry forth in them the testimony of his goodnesse, and that to this end, To lead men to repentance, Act. 14.16, 17. He in times past suffered All Nations to walke in their owne wayes: Neverthelesse, he left not himself without witnesse, in that he did good, and gave us rain from Heaven, and fruitfull Seasons, filling our hearts with food, and gladnesse, Rom. 2.4. The goodnesse of God leadeth thee to repentance: And this riches of the goodnesse of God, and forbearance, long-suffering, and fruits of mercy, being extended through the sacrifice offered, and redemption obtained by Christ, and carrying in it the te∣stimony of his goodnesse, and leading to repentance, and that to this end, that men might seek after the Lord, Act. 17, 26. It is grace, and free grace, and universally extended, and that to a gratious end: And as the giving of Christ to be the Saviour of the world, 1 Joh. 4.14. was a fruit of Gods rich mercy, pitty, and love to man-kind, John 3.16, 17. So this is a fruit of the preva∣lency of the sacrifice of Christ with God, And his kindnesse to manward for Christ his sake, Tin. 3.4 And so far as it is to all men, it is generall, and universall sure; Matth. 5.44, 45. Psalm. 17.14. 3 The giving of his Word, and oracles, with his ordinances to many men; wherein the Saviour with his peace, righteous∣nesse, and salvation is set forth, That men might through him be∣lieve, and in believing have life. Joh. 1.4, 5, 7. And so it is he that hath made peace, That comes in the Word preaching peace, Ephes. 2.17. This was peculiar to Israel from Abrahams time, till Christ his Ascension, Psalm. 147.19, 20. And since extended to the Gentiles, Ephes. 3.5, 6. 4 The affording some light, and motion of his Spirit, in, and according to the meanes vouch safed, whether in the Book of Creatures onely, or the Book of Scriptures also: For calling All men, Prov. 8.4 5. Isa 45.22. And willing them, and striving with them at one time or other, 1 Pet. 2.12. Gen. 6.3. And so Christ is the true Light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, John 1.9. And so in the workes of Creation, It is said, Rom. 1.19. That which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it to them; And of the preaching of the Go∣spel it is said, 2 Cor. 2.14. God maketh manifest the savour of
his knowledge, &c. And such as resist the light, and motion in either of these meanes, resist the holy Spirit, Prov. 1.23, 24. Act. 7.51. The liberty of giving life to all that believe on him, 17. Iohn 2. And all these come through the efficacy and prevalencie of the Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ presented unto God, and ac∣cepted of him; In which respect, The Gospel, where it comes, sets him forth, as indeed he is; The propitiation for our sins, and the Sinnes of the whole world, Rom. 3.25 1 Iohn 2.2. The upholder of the world made by him, Heb. 1 2, 3. The laver of regeneration, or new birth, Iohn 3.5.15. Tit. 3.4, 5. I he Fountain of leansing, and purificatioons for defilements, 1 Iob 1.7 Zach. 13.1. The Fountain of life, Psal. 36.9. He in whom God hath given us eternall life, so as he that hath him, hath life, 1 Iohn 5.10, 10, 11, 12. and as page 5. under this figure 3. 5 Sometimes together with all these four former sences, by the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ so pre∣sented to, and prevailing with God, is also farther meant the spirituall Discovery and Application of it to, and prevailing efficacy in the hearts and consciences of such, as through the appearance of grace are brought to believe, Heb. 12.24 To the bloud of sprinkling, 1 Pet. 1.2. Unto obedience, and sprinkling of the bloud of Jesus Christ, vers. 19. The pretious blood of Christ, which indeed prevaileth with, and and in those who in spirituall Discoveries are sprinkled, and washed therewith, in, and with whom it is so powerful, and effectuall, That it verily pierceth and melteth the heart for all its sinfulnesse, and follies against him, and all its hard thoughts, and oppositions wherewith it hath pierced him, Zach. 12.10, Acts 2.37. Reconcileth the heart, and powers in their inclination to God, 2 Cor. 5.18, 20. Giveth an escape from the intangling pollutions that are in the world, and holding from God through lusts, 2 Peter 1.4. and 2.20, Rev. 5.9. Speaketh peace to the Conscience, so as the Believer re∣ceiveth justification, and peace with God thereby, Heb. 12.24. Rom. 4 25. and 5.1.2. Purgeth the Conscience, Heb. 9.13.14. from the accusations of sinne, and charges of the Law, putting in feare, Rom. 7.4.6. and 8.2.3, 34. from its former
corrupt way of dictating to seek peace, and righteousnesse with God, by frames, and performances of its own accor∣ding to Law. "And also from speaking peace from such at∣tainments, Gal. 2.21. Phil. 3 3 7, 8, 9. Iob. 9.15.32. Purifieth the heart to a child-like love of God, and Christ, and his Government, Heb. 9.14. Gal. 2.20, 21. And so renew∣eth it with spring: of ove ce brethren, 1 Pet. 1.19, 21, 22. And omen, 2 Cor. 5.14. And inclinations to serve the living God Tit 3 4.5. Conforming to Christ, 2 Cor. 3.3, 18. Washeth, and cleanseth from such pollutions, as befall Be∣lievers, 1 John 2.7. Sealeth to the Day of redemption, Exod. 12.13, with Ephes. 1.13. and 4 30. And giveth boldnesse and courage in accesse to God, Rom: 5.2. Ephes. 2.16 18 Heb. 4 16. All which are the efficacies of the pretious bloud of Christ, spiritually applied to, and sprinkled on the heart; And meant when the Bloud is spoken of, as Believers are said to be sprink∣led (redeemed from the world, or vain conversation) and wa∣shed with it, Heb. 12.24. 1 Pec. 1.19. Acts 20.28. Rev. 5.9. and 1.5. 6 Sometimes, by these tearms, the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, is signified, encluded, and meant; The immense, rich, and free mercy, love, or grace of God, in finding out a ransome, and giving his Son, That he might shew forth love, Job. 33.24. John 3.15, 16, 17. Ephes. 2 4 5, 6, 7. And so this love made known in the gift of his Sonne, and testified in the application of the vertue of his blood, Rev. 1.5. and 5, 9. In forgivenesse of sinnes, Ephes. 1.6.7. And there-through shedding abroad his love in the heart by the holy Ghost, begetting love and confidence Rom: 5 5, 10. Vniting to, comforting in, and conforming to Christ, writing his mind in the heart 1 Pet. 8.21, 22. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. And herein is love, That he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins, 1 John 4.10. and 3 16 And herein is love communicated, That he hath washed us from our sins in his blood, Rev. 1.5. And so when we speak, or in the Scripture read, of the Suf∣ferings, Bloud, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, and the love of
God to manward, and the hope, and benefit set forth to all men thereby; wee are to understand it as of the bloud of Christ: 1 That shed it, and dyed for our sins, 2 That overcame Death, and rose for our Justification. 3 That by, and with the vertue of this bloud, did through the eternall Spirit effer up himself without spot to God, and hath thereby obtained eternall re∣demption; And 4 that thereby procureth favour, and meanes for the Sons of men, That they might believe, and in belie∣ving be saved: And when the Scripture speaketh of so much, and no more in any Proposition for Faith, it speaketh of it, as for the world, John 1.29. Mer, 1 Tim: 2.6. Sinners, 1 Tim. 1.15. And such like generall tearms it useth, 2 Cor. 5.19. But when we speake, or in the Scripture reade of the Sufferings, Bloud, Death, and sacrifice of Christ, as the vertue and efficacy thereof is found in any, And the peculiar love, and choice pri∣viledges thereof affirmed of; Then wee are to understand it farther. 5 Of the vertue of that pretious Bloud applyed to, and working in the heart; And 6 of the rich and free love of God testified to, and shed abroad in the heart thereby; And then, and so we are to understand it, not only in the foure former sences, but both in them, and these two latter also; And so it is never spoke of in generall for all men, but for the Church, Act, 20.28. Ephes. 5.25.26, 27, Believers, 1 John 1.7. His called, and chosen ones, Heb. 9.14 Revel. 1.5. and 5.9. And so the same vertue, and grace of Christ by Spirit given and made effectuall. 1 In respect of Christ his dying for our sinnes, and in re∣spect of his entring into Heaven by his own bloud, And in re∣spect of his Application of it to the conscience And in respect of the first effects of it speaking Peace, and answering Law∣charges; it is expressed by Bloud, or Death, Rom. 8 34. 2 And in respect of the free, and rich love of God appear∣ing there-through, and entring the heart; with its cleansing, re∣freshing, and renewing operations; It is expressed by water, clean water, living water, or water of life, Isa: 43.3. Ephes. 3.23. Heb. 10.23. Iohn 4 10. and 7.38. And so the same washing is affirmed, as a fruit of his love, by his Bloud, Rev. 1.5. with clean water, Ezek. 36.25. and Christ is
called, The Fountain of living Waters, Jer. 17.13. And as these tearms of Bloud and Water, are used to set forth the same grace distinctly, in divers and distinct respects; so one of these tearmes, sometimes comprehends both; As Bloud, in Rev. 1.5. and Waters, in John 3.5. Tit. 3.4, 5. And so as Jesus Christ in respect of his sacrifice with the effi∣cacy of it, as offered to God; And by the efficacy of it, as apply∣ed to men, was shadowed, figured, and typed out by Water, and Bloud, Heb. 9.8, 12, 13, 14, 19. Even so his first coming, and fi∣nishing the work, his Father gave him to do on Earth: 1 Because of the great, rich, and free love of God, in which he sent his Son into the World; John 3.16. To be the Saviour of the world, 1 John 14.14. By which he tasted death for every man, Heb. 2 9. And in love laid down his life for us; He is said to have come by water. 2 Because of the satisfaction he made for us by suffering, and dying for our sins, 1 Cor: 15.3.4. 2 Cor: 5.21. Gal: 3.13. He is said, to have come by Bloud. 3 Because, by the eternall Spirit he rose from the dead, as∣cended, and offered himself without spot to God, and so was ju∣stified in the Spirit, Ro: 6.4. 1 Pet: 3.18. Ro: 1.4. 1 Tim: 13.16. And by that Spirit testifieth of himself, Iohn 14.26. and 15.26, 27. It is said, The Spirit beareth witnesse, 1 Iohn 5.6. This is he that came by water and bloud; not by water only, but by water and bloud, and it is the Spirit that beareth witnesse, because the Spirit is Truth. And so as there is one God, and three Persons in one God: The Father who hath loved us, and given his Son for us, 1 Iohn 4.10. The Son who was made flesh, and so dyed for our sins, and rose for our justification, Iohn 1.14 Rom: 5.25. The Holy Ghost, who proceedeth from, and maketh known the Fa∣ther and the Son, Matth. 16.16. Ioh. 14.26. and 16.13. So it is said, 1 Iohn 5.7. There are three that bear record in Heaven; the Fa∣ther, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; And these three are one, and so the Record is the record of one God. 1 Iohn 5.10. And answerably, there are three that bear record on Earth to men, and in the hearts of Believers. The Spirit that discovers in, and through the Gospell this
grace, and enlightens the heart to see, and believe, and so begets a spirituall disposition, bringing out of darknesse into his light, Matth. 16.16. Iohn 16.7-15. 1 Cor. 2.9.—15. The Water, even that rich, free, and immense love of God in the Spirits exaltation of Christs appearing, Isa 55.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The Bloud, even the propitiation made, satisfaction given, re∣demption obtained, righteousnesse wrought, and presented to God, and accepted of him, and now applyed for satisfaction to the Believer, Rom: 3.25, 26. and 4.5.24.25. and 5.1.—11. And all these agreeing in one; And so it is said, 1 Iohn 5.8. There are three that bear witnesse in Earth; The Spirit, and the Water, and the Bloud, and these three agree in one: All these witnesses agree in one, and bear forth one record, and the Spirit is he that beareth forth the witnesse, and he doth it with Water & Bloud, in discovery and application of the free grace of God, and the vertue of the precious bloud of Christ, Tit. 3.4, 5. And so the whole record is the record of God, 1 Iohn 5.10, 11, 12. And this is the record that God hath given of his Sonne, Tha God hath given us eternall life, and this life is in his Son; He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life: And so by this whole Discourse, wee may understand: That 1 When the Scripture speakes of grace, or free-love; though for the clearnesse, purity, refreshing, and cleansing effects, it ex∣presses it by that metaphor of water; yet it means of that grace, & love, in which Christ was given to be a ransome, and which is testified through Christ; who by his bloud shedding, and with the vertue thereof presenting, and offering himself a spotlesse sacrifice to his Father, hath obtained eternall redemption, and procured favour to be dispensed, and the way of dispensation, 1 Iohn 4.10. Rom: 5.5, 6. 2 And when the Scripture speakes of the Bloud, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, or the redemption effected thereby: It means the Bloud of Christ, which through love or grace was shed, and presented to God for us, and is discovered to us; and so the re∣demption through grace wrought, and in, and through which, grace, or free-love appeareth, Rom: 5.8.-11. Gal: 2.20.
3 And so when the Scripture speaketh of the teaching, wit∣nessing, and operation of the holy Ghost; It meaneth, that teach∣ing, witnessing, & operation of the Spirit of Christ, which by ver∣tue of his Sacrifice, Christ sendeth forth from the Father, and in which he discovereth, and witnesseth the things of Christ; and so with water and bloud discovering free-grace, through the vertue of that pretious Bloud, Iohn 15.26. and 16.7.—15. And these things are well to be heeded, and digested in our hearts, as they are comprehended, and meant; alwayes the most of them, and often all of them, in using these tearms and ex∣pressions: The Sufferings, Bloud, Death, Ransome, and Sacrifice of Christ Jesus. CHHP. III. The manifold ends of the Sufferings, Bloud, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, as the Scripture distinctly sets them forth. FOr the right understanding the distinct ends of the Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, according to Scripture sence, and ex∣pression: There are some things the Scripture mentions to be fore-understood, and heeded of us. 1 Of Jesus Christ, according to his double mission from the Father into the world; and also, according to his double busi∣nesse in leaving the World, and offering himselfe to the Fa∣ther. 2 Of Mankind: In respect of the double misery, and enmity a∣gainst God, they are through the first Adem fallen into. 3 Of the Church: In respect of the double need they stand in, of the contiouall helpfulnesse of Christ Jesus. In the understanding, and distinct consideration of all these, the divers and distinct ends of the Death, and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ will appear clearly. 1 Concerning Jesus Christ, his coming into the world, and leaving the world. First, in respect of his mission from the Father into the world, it was two-fold:
1 He came, and was sent into the world to be the Saviour of the world, 1 Iohn 4.14. To save finners, 1 Tim: 1.15. That is, In the nature of man, subjected to humane infirmities, Heb. 10.5. To be made under the Law, to redeeme such as were under the Law, Gal. 4.4. And so to bear their sins, Psasm: 40.12. And suffer their Curse, Gal: 3.13. And dye the death of, and for All, 2 Cor: 5.14. Heb: 2.9. And so dying for their sins, to rise for their justifiea∣tion, Rom: 5.25. And so he said, Iohn 10.14. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again: This Commande∣ment have I received of my Father: And so he dyed, and rose to the ends fore-shown, page 2 and 3. And in respect of this mis∣sion, his death and sacrifice was to take away, and be the propi∣ation for, the sins of the whole world, Heb. 9.26. Iohn 1.29. 1 Iohn 2.2. He came, and was sent into the world to bear witnesse to the truth, Iohn 18 37. And so to be a Preacher of the Gospell, in the Declara∣tion of this great Grace, and Salvation, Heb: 1.2. and 2.3. And by his good workes and miracles to winne men to the beliefe and receipt thereof, Iohn 5.36. and 14.11. And to give the promises of the New Testament, and of eternall life, to those that were prevailed with, to believe on him, Iohn 17.6, 7, 8. and 14.26. and 16.7. And of his mission to this Ministration, it is said, Rom: 15.8. That Jesus Christ was a Minister of the Circumcision (that is, of the Jewes) for the truth of God, &c. And of this mission, (when some came to him for some fruits of the ministration thereof) it is, that he said, Matth. 15.24. I am not sent, but unto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. And larger Commission he gave not to his Disciples, till he had finished his own course, Matth. 10.5, 6. But then he enlarged this mission for all Nations, All the World, Matth. 28.19. Mark. 16.15. And sent them into the world, even as the Father had sent him into the world. Iohn 17.18. which can be understood but of this his mission for ministration (for onely himself is the propitiation,) Ioh. 20.21. And of this ministration also he saith, John 12 49, 50. I have not spoken of my self, but the Father which sent me; he gave me a commandement what I should say, and what I should speake, And I know that his commandement is life everlasting; whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Fa∣ther said unto me, so I speake, John 14.10. And thus he dyed in
testimony of obedience, love, and faithfulnesse to his Father, Phil. 2.8.—10. And of love and faithfulnesse to his sheep, that had been taught by him, John 10.15. And so to confirme the truth of his Doctrine, 1 Tim. 6.13. And to give us an example to follow his steps, in teftifying love, and faithfulnesse to God, and Bre∣thren, John 15.12, 13. 1 Pet: 2.21. 1 John 3.16. Not to make propitiation for hem, for be it; but to confirme the truth, & te∣stifi love, and faithfulnesse, and give good example, Ephes. 5.2. But now, if wee consider of Jesus Christ, according to both his Missions together, as to make Propitiation; And in preach∣ing the Gospell, to give the Promises of the New Testament to his Disciples; Then we shall find also, that he so dyed, to confirm, ratifie, and seale the New Testament of precious Promises, and so it was for his called and chosen ones, Luke 22.20. Heb. 9.15, 16. Gal. 3.15. And thus of his mission into the world. 2 In respect of his businesse, in leaving the world, and offe∣ring himself to the Father; it was also two-fold, as Scripture sheweth. 1 It was to present himself as the ransome, and sacrifice, with the vertue of his bloud to God for Mankind; and thereby to obtain, and receive to himself (or into his owne hands to dis∣pose) as the publike person in the roome of Mankind, remission of sins, justification, fulnesse of spirit, and authority, and to bee the Mediator between God & Mn, Heb: 9.12, 14.24 1 Tim: 2.5. And so to be our Peace, Ephes: 2.14, 16. The propitiation for our sins, and the sins of the whole world, 1 John 2.2. And Wisdome, Righ∣teonsnesse, Sanctification, and Reslemption for men, and to all that believe in him, John 1.4. 1 Cor: 1.30. 2 It was to take on him, and execute his office of Lord and Mediator, and high Priests, &c. To send forth, tender, and dis∣pense of the grace and Spirit, which he, as the publike person hath received in the humane nature glorified, to enlighten, con∣vince, and draw even the rebellious, that they might believe, &c. Psalm. 68.18. John 1.7.9. and 16.8, 9, 10. And to sprinkle and wash the consciences of Believers, with the spiritnall applica∣tion of his precious bloud, and shedding abroad in the heart of Believers, the free, and rich grace appearing there-through, re∣newing,
comforting, and leading them into all truth, Heb. 12.24 and 9.14. Rev. 1.5. Tit. 3.4 5. Himself remaining a husband, and Advocate for them, Ephes. 5.25, 26, 27. 1 Iohn 2.1. In both which appeares a two-fold end of his blood, & sacrifice offered: The one, the obtaining redemption, &c. to make known, & ten∣der to men, that they might believe, Iohn 3.17. Ephes. 2.5, 6, 7. The other, The communication thereof too, and effectuall operation in Believers, Iohn 17.3. Ephes 5, 26, 27. 2 Concerning Mankind, in respect of the double misery, and enmity against God, which by falling into sinne, they fell into. 1 The first is, the misery and enmity in the very state and condition, into which mankind by sinne were fallen, which was such as stood crosse to the merciful God, to keep him back from shewing any favour, or grace at all to mankind; for the Truth of God requites the Death of man sinne being entred, Gen. 2.17. And the Iustice of God requires the execution of the Curse on man, that hath fayled of his duty, Gal. 3.10. And so, though God did not upon the fall of man, turne enemy to mankind; But in his beart did pitty him, Tit. 3.4. And his bowels of compassion moved for mankind: so as hee would not for that fall, make him as the Divell and his Angels, (something like that said of Israel, Hos. 11.6-9.) Yet Truth, and Iustice stood against the shewing forth of this mercy, and extending of peace to man-kind: yea, had not the nature of man-kind been polluted and filled with aversnesse and eumity against God upon the fall (as indeed it was;) yet by reason of sinne committed, though it had been but once, and passed, lea∣ving only guiltinesse behind it, even that put such enmity in the state and condition of mankind, and made such a pertition between God and mankind, that Truth and Iustice would not (without a satisfaction) that any mercy should be shewed, or peace given him, who had by that offence sold himself from God to Sathan, and thrown himself under guilt of sinne, and desert of Curse, and Death; so as it brought a necessity of infli∣cting curse and death upon him; which if men suffer in their own particular persons, they can never over-come; and with∣out suffering, they can have no remission, Heb. 9 22. Now to remedy this misery, and take away this enmity in
the state and condition of mankind, Jesus Christ, by the will of God, even the will of his Father, and his own free-will, it being one, and the same, with the will of his Father, hath taken the nature of mankind, subjected to infirmities, and the cause of mankind upon him; and in their stead, being made under the Law, under which they were fallen, hath borne all their sins, and suffered all their curse and so dyed for All, That all were dead, and hath risen again just, and free from all their sins imputed to him; And a victrer over all their curse, and death imposed on him, and so ascended, and offered up himself to God a spotlesse sacrifice, and a ransome to God for all men, and God hath acce∣pted it; so that for mankind in him, mercy, and truth are met, righteousnesse and peace have kified, Psul. 85 10. And he is be∣come the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, 1 Iohn 2.2. ha∣ving slaine the enmity, Ephes. 2.10. Having taken out of the way All that (was onely between God, and us, and so) was contrary to us, Col: 2.14. And so hath given himself aransome for All to God, and bought all men of God, 1 Tim  6. 2 Pet. 2.1. And here is the infinite wisedome, and great love of God, in finding out this re∣medy for mankind; which from the beginning, was in himself hidden in his own Bosome; And this he brought to passe, so put∣ting all to death, in the death of his Son, and setting them in heavenly places in him, That he might shew forth the riches of his grace, Ephes. 2.5, 6, 7. And so war God in Christ, reconciling the World to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, 2 Cor. 5.14, 19. And so hath made a way for himself, to shew mercy to whom hee will, And opened the doore to life, and immortality for mankind, 2 Tim. 1.10. And thus hath Iesus Christ, by shedding his blood, and pre∣senting it to his Father, redeemed all men of God, and taken the enmity out of their stateand condition, and is become their Lord, Having wrought redemption, and salvation in his own body for them, even for all men, 1 Tim. 2. 5. Sinners, 1 Tim. 1.15. Vngod∣ly, and his enemies, And that while they were such, Roan. 5.6. That he might bring them to God, 1 Pet. 2.24. and 3.18. And yet unlesse he proceed to do more for men, then all this, none of them will come into God, Iohn 6.44, 45. For, 2 There is a misery, and enmity in the nature of mankind
through which he is so averse to God; That though the enmi∣ty in the state and condition be slain: And all that which was (between God and Mankind) contrary to them taken out of the way, Ephes. 2.16. Col. 2.14. yet will not mankind come into God, but remain sinners, and ungodly still, foolish, disobedient, and deceived, living to themselves, and after their own lusts, and so in enmity against God. Rom. 3.10.—19. Ephes. 2.1, 2, 3. Tit. 3, 2, 3. And such (however ransomed by Christ:) neither can, nor shall enter his Kingdom, nor have any inheritance with Christ, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Gal. 15.19, 20, 21. But if not brought out of this enmity (which is as impossible to them to do of themselves, as to have ransomed themselves) their condemnation will bee more fearfull, 2 Thes. 1.8. Now to remedy this misery, and take this enmity out of the nature of man, Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven, and with the vertue of that bloud he shed for mankind, having offered up himself a spotlesse Sacrifice to God, and obtained eternall re∣demption, and received all fulnesse of Power, Authority, and Spirit, as the publike person in the humane nature glorified. Act. 2.31.32. Psalm. 68.18. Doth send forth of that Spirit (in the meanes he useth) at one time or other, to enlighten, and move at the hearts of men, Iohn 1.9. To reprove, and convince them of the sinfulnesse in themselves, & the vanity of all their Idols, and all righteousnesse of their own working, and of the fulnesse of that righteousnesse, and life in him, Iohn 16.8, 9, 10. And so cal∣leth them, Prov. 8.4.5, 6. Isa 45.22. and 55.1, 2. That in their tur∣ning at his reproofe, he may power out his Spirit, and make known his words to them, Prov. 1.23. That so through him they might believe, and be saved, Iohn 1.5, 7. and 3.7. And though all resist, and go out of the way, Rom. 3.10.—19. And that this is the great condemnation, when light comes, to love, or chuse darknesse rather, Iohn 3.19. And he might justly give them all up, and be righteous, Rom: 3.5, 6. yet for a time, he useth pati∣ence, and striveth with them, Gen. 6.3. That they might repent, Rom: 2.4. And to some he giveth more abundance of his grace, and overcomes them, as Bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke; Ier. 31.18, 20. Isa 30.18. And brings them in to believe, Ephes. 2.7, 8, 9, 10. Phil: 1.29. And these he redeemeth with his preci∣ous
blood, by presenting, and applying it close to their heart, sprinkling it thereon, and discovering such free, and infinite riches of grace therethrough, that all things else, though never so fore∣thought of as gainfull; appeares to them as losse in comparison of this grace, allureing to win Christ, and be found in him: And soe (as we by of our Children from their vanities to their bookes,Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. &c. with gifts) he buyeth, and purchaseth us with his blood from our vaine lusts, hopes, and conversations, and from among men unto God, 1 Pet. 1.18.19. Reu. 5.9. And then by the spirituall application of the vertue of his blood purgeth the conscience from dead workes to serve the living God, Heb. 9.14. And so in his love, washeth us from our sins in his own blood, Reu. 1.5. And those whom he hath not onely bought of God, (as he hath done all men, 1 Tim. 2.6.) but also purchased them unto God from among men, and washed them in his love from their sinns, 2 Pet. 2.1. Reu. 5.9. and 1.5. Iohn 13.8. These, and these onely are his Church, and pecular people, Act. 20.28. Ephes. 5.27. In whose soule and body he worketh salvation, through the appli∣cation of that salvation which the hath wrought in his own body. And in this consideration of the double enmity to God into which man fell, and the recy in Christ appeares three ends of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ: namely two ends of the presentation, and offering it to God; one to take away the enmity that was in the State, and condition of man∣kinde, Ephes. 2.16. The other, to receive spirit to send forth in the declaration of this grace, to reconcile men to God, that the enmity in there nature might be removed, Ephes. 2.7. 2 Cor. 5.20. and one end of the spirituall presentation, and applycation of it to the heart, and conscience of men, namely, to purge the conscience, and wash them from their sins, and renew them to God, Heb. 9.14. Concerning the Church of God on earth, in respect of the double need they stand in of the continuall helpfull∣nesse of Christ. 1. The believers, though made free in Christ, and their consci∣ence purged, their heart renewed, and spirit made alive for righ∣teousnesse sake, Iohn 8.36. Gal. 5.1. Heb. 9.14. Ezek. 36.25. Rom. 8.10. yet for the time of their warfare, there is a re∣maining of the old Disposition, although unthroned from the
heart, and weakned yet working in all the powers, and facul∣ties of the soule, and parts and members of the body, lusting a∣gainst the spirit, and to satisfie the affections, and lusts of the flesh, and attempting to leade Captive to the law of sin, and death, Gal. 5.17. Rom. 7.14.—24. Besides the manifold temptations from the world, by Customs, Promises, Threats, Asurements, Terrors, 1 Iohn 2 16. And also from Satan takeing advantage from the flesh, and the world, and adding strength to the lusts, and temp∣tations thereof, adding his own fiery and he lish suggestions, &c. 1 Pet. 5.8. whereby it falleth out, that in many things, we (e∣ven Believers) offend all, Iames 3 1. 1 Iohn 1.8 10. Which remaining evill, and off nees overtaken, which doe de∣file and make unmeete to appeare before God; and if they be not pardoned and purged away, they will exclude from his pre∣sence, and bring to death againe, Psal 5.4, 5, 6. Now the Blood of Jesus, and the grace therethrough extend∣ed, is the onely thing that can purifie, and cleanse from these de∣filements, Heb. 9.14. Reu. 1.5. 1 Iohn 1.9. So that here is still need of coming to Christ for his cleansing herewith, Zach. 13.1. 1 Iohn 1.9. 2 The believers having so many, & great enemies fighting against them Ephes. 6.12. so many and great sufferings to undergoe, Act. 14.22. 2 Tim. 3.12. And so many, and great servises of love to goe forth in, till they be wholly conformed to Christ, Col. 2.6. and 3.12.-16. Phil. 2.1.-6. And they having no good thing dwelling in their flesh. Rom. 7.18. nor ability in themselves for a good thought, as of themselves, 2 Cor. 5.5. so as unlesse he work all for, and in them, there will be no abiding peace, Esa. 26.12. Great need have they therefore of his continuall presence, and sending forth supplyes of spirit to overcome their enemyes, Mat. 10.19 20. Rom. 16.20. to support in sufferings, Esa. 43.1. 1 Cor. 10.13. to sanctifie them throughout, 1 Thes. 5.23.24. And to comfort, teach, and lead into all truth, and to the inheri∣tance, Esa. 54 13.14. Iohn 15.26 and 16.13.14.15. And so to perfect all that concerneth them, Psal 138.8. And for this cause is he by vertue of his precious Blood, and Sacrifice, an Ad∣vocate, and great High-Priest, and Mediatour of the new Testa∣ment,
at his Fathers right hand for believers that are his called and chosen ones, 1 John 2.2. Heb. 3.1.-6. & 8. & 9.15. And in this consideration of the Churches need of Christ, and his way of supply, we may see one end of his continual presenting the vertue of his Blood and Sacrifice before his Father, and apply∣ing it to the hearts and consciences of his people both together, to keep them cleane before his Father, and to cleanse, purifie, and conform them to himselfe, Rev. 1.5. And so in respect of both his presentation of his Sacrifice to his Father, and his gracious and spirituall application of the same to believers. It is said, Ephes. 5-25, 26.27. Christ also loved the Church, and gave himselfe for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of wa∣ter. by the word; that (as he presents it in himselfe spotlesse be∣fore the Father, Coloss. 1.22. so) he might present it to himselfe a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish, And in the right un∣derstanding of these things, we may understand the ends of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ. First, the ends of the sheeding his blood, and so of his suffe∣ring and dying, was 1. To satisfie for the sinne of the world, and so to fulfill the truth of God, and satisfie Diuine Justice, and answer the Law, and abolish death, as is foreshewn, page 2. 2. To confirm and ratifle the new Testament of pretious Pro∣mises, for all that through the heavenly call beleeve on him, as is shewn page 14. 3. To testifie obedience, love, and faithfulnesse in his Ministra∣tion, and so to confirme his doctrine, and give all his Disciples an example, as is shewn, p. 13. Secondly, the ends of the vertue of this his pretious blood and death in offering himeelfe a spotlesse sacrifice to his Father, Scrip∣ture sheweth to be 1. That he might be the Propitiation for the sins of the world, as page 3.4.6.7. 2. That he might obtain eternall redemption for mankind, and procure some mercy, means, and patience to be used towards them, as pages, 5, 6, & 13.
3. That he might be the Mediator between God and men, as page 4.12. 4. That he might be the great high Priest, Prophet, King, and so the Advocate for, and of his Church, p. 15.16.12. 5. That through him by his Spirit there might be a shewing, declaration, and tender of the grace of God to men, to call them, lesse clearly in his workes of creation, and providence, and more fully and clearly in the Gospel of salvation preached to men, as p. 6.12.14. Thirdly, the ends of his spirituall discovery, tender, and appli∣cation of his pretious blood, and sacrifice to men, Scripture shews to be, 1. To convince men of sinne, and the vilenesse of sin in them∣selves, and the vanity of all thier own wisdome, and righteousnesse to help them, and of the compleat righteousnesse that is in him; thereby to empty them, and pierce their hearts, and submit them to himselfe, Zach. 12.10. Gal. 2.21. Phil. 3.7, 8. Joh. 16.8-10. Luke 2.34. 2. To purchase and redeem these convinced from among men, and from their Idols, and vain conversation, unto God, Rev. 5.9. 1 Pet. 1.18.19. Act. 20.28. & 26.18. 3. To wash, and cleanse these his so purchased, in the discove∣ry of the freenesse and abundance of his grace, through his pretious blood, enlightning, enlivening, comforting, sanctifying and preser∣ving them to the inheritance, Eoh. 5.25, 26.27. And these things considered distinctly, as the Scripture sets them forth, lead to the right understanding of the ends of Christs death and sacrifice, when it is spoke of in respect of his dying, and blood-shedding. And when it is spoke of in respect of that, and also his presenting himselfe with the vertue of that, to his Fa∣ther; and when it is spoke of in both these former respects, and also together therewith, in respect of his spirituall discovery, ten∣der, and application thereof to men; in which is variety of the ex∣tent of the sense and signification.
CHAP. IV. A Digression, shewing how these things were shadowed in the Sacri∣fices and Ordinances of the first Testament, or the Law. A Perfect image made by a curing limmer may clearly present the visage & complexion of him whose Image it is, though it have no life, and so neither see nor breathe, &c. But a shadow, or the first rude draught will not doe so much; onely may discover, that it is to be of a man, or a woman, and not of a beast: but whe∣ther man or woman, or whom it sheweth not as the Image finisht (in which the shadow passeth) doth. Now the law had the sha∣dow of good things to come, but not the very image of the things: they were paterns and figures of heavenly things for the time present, but not a full demonstration of them, Heb. 10.1. & 9.9.23. Now, then, if we call to mind, 1. The offering for sin, to make Atonement, was first slain, and after that the blood sprinkled at the Altar, and on the Atonement-day, before the Mercy-seat; and the people afflicted in themselves, and blessed by the Priest, Lev. 9.—15.22. & 16. per totum, shadow∣ed; Jesus delivered to death for our sinnes, and presenting himselfe with the vertue of his blood to the Father, to make the Atonement, & obtain redemption for us; and his blessing us, in sprinkling his blood on our hearts, melting and purging the con∣science, Heb. 1.3. & 9.12.14.24. & 10.1.—19. The Passover, a Lamb without blemish, & slain, and then the blood wth a bunch of hyssop dipt therin, sprinkled on the two side-Posts, and the upper doore Posts, that the striking Angel might pass∣over, Exod. 12. And then the flesh roasted with fire, eaten; Sha∣dowed Jesus Christ the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world, John 1.29. Heb. 9.26. His dying for our sins, 1 Cor. 15.3.4. And by his Spirit sprinkling the vertue of his blood on the be∣leeving heart, without which no safety, Heb, 12.24. and our feed∣ing on him by faith, without which no eternall life, John 6.35.36. so that bloodshed presented to the Lord, and applied to such as come to the Sacrifices, are all held forth distinctly, as distinct and divers works. 3. For the people that came to these Sacrifices, for whom
blood was not onely shed, but presented to God, and who had the atonement, and such reconciliation as was thereby affoorded, there was yet provided a water of Purification to cleanse them from defilements, when they befell them, and the defiled person not cleansed with it, might not approach to the holy things with∣out danger of death: now it was not enough, There was for them a water of purification, and it was right, nor that it was put in a vessell, and running water put thereto; unlesse a clean person dip with a branch of Hissop, and sprinkle him that is uncleane, hee remains unclean, and must die: by Sprinkling, is Cleansing. And doth not this shadow out Jesus Christ, the fountain of cleansing, and Laver of regeneration, and purification right with with God, yet cleasing none in their own hearts, &c. with∣out application and spirituall sprinkling, Heb 9.13, 14. & 12, 24. Zach. 13.1. Tit. 3.4, 5. Ezek. 36.25. Consider and compare the Scriptures, and say, 1, Did not the red Hyfer slain without the Camp, and her flesh burnt,Numb. 19.2.3.5. Numb. 19.2, 3, 5. shadow out Jesus that knew no sin, made sin for us, and suffering without the gate: and after in the power of the Spirit, and fire of his love, offering up his whole selfe a Sa∣crifice to God for us? 2 Cor. 5.21, Heb, 9.14. & 10.12. & 13.12. 2.Vers. 9. Did not the remainders, or ashes of the Heyfer, shadow forth the remaining Records, Testimonies, and vertues of the death and sacrifice of Jesus, who died for our sinnes, and rose for our justification,Vers. 4. and presented his sacrifice to God, and applieth it to us, (as was shadowed by the blood sprinkled before the Ta∣bernacle, 1 Corinth. 15.1-4. Heb, 9.12.13.14. And is not this the water of Separation, or Purification from uncleannesse, Ezek. 36.25. Rev. 1.5 3.Vers 9. Did not the clean Place without the Camp, where these ashes were kept for a purification for sin, shadow forth the Gos∣pel of Christ, or word of grace, which J. Christ by his Spirit hath breathed, and caused to be written, and therein declared and testi∣fied, and kept as in record, the truth and vertue of the blood-shed, death and sacrifice of Christ, and the offering it to the Father, and its prevalency with him, and for whom; and his tender and appli∣cation of it, and the vertue thereof, and in whom; Are not all the sayings hereabout plain,1 Cor. 15.1.—4. 2 Cor. 3.12.13. & 1.2. Faithfull, 1 Tim.
1.15. True, 2 Pet. 1.16.—19. And in righteousnesse nothing fro∣ward, perverse, equivocall, or wreathed in them, Prov. 8.6, 7, 8, 9. & 22.20, 21. Eccles. 12.10. That we may rather take those say∣ings as they expresse the matter, then any other sayings, or glos∣ses, they are very righteous and faithfull; his word is very pute, Psal. 119.138. The inspiration of the Spirit of truth, 2 Tim. 3.16. 4. Did not the ashes of the burnt Heyfer of Purification for sinne, and running water put thereto in a vessell, shadow forth the Word of Grace, setting forth the vertue of the death and sacrifice of Christ inspired, and put in the hearts of the servants of God, 2 Cor. 5.18.19. and his free and rich grace, and love appearing therein, shed abroad thereby by the holy Ghost in the heart of those, whom he hath brought to beleeve in Christ, and so united them to him, 1 Cor. 1.30. and so filled them with his love, that it springs up like love in them, that constrains them to declare this grace, and beseech others to accept it, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.19. 1 Pet. 1.21, 22. for which cause they are called Stewards and Ministers of this grace, 1 Cor. 3.1. 2 Cor. 3.3. and said to have this trea∣sure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may ap∣peare to be of God, and not of them, 2 Cor. 4.7. and so are called chosen vessels unto God, to beare his name, Act. 9.15. 5 Did not the clean person, taking Hissop, dipping it in the water, & sprinkling the unclean; shadow forth Iesus Christ the just, who by his own Spirit stirreth this grace in the hearts of his servants, and giveth them what to speak, 2 Cor. 4.6. & 5.14. 1 Cor, 2.12.13. and giveth proof of his own speaking in their ministration, 2 Cor. 13.3. Making manifest the savour of his knowledge by them, 2 Cor. 2.14. and himselfe by his Spirit turning the heart of men to God, Acts 11, 21. and weighing his mind in the heart of these so turned to beleeve in him, 2 Cor. 3.3. further minding and tea∣ching them that they have heard, John 14.26. and taking off the things of Christ, and shewing to them, John 16.14 and so sprink∣ling and washing them with this water of purification (the vertue of the pretious blood of Christ, and his infinite love streaming there-through) melting, cleansing, comforting, renewing, &c, Heb. 9.13.14. & 12.24. Rev. 1.5. Ezek. 36.25. without which a man, (notwithstanding all the former) remains unclean still.
In all this also is shadowed the severall distinct ends of the death and sacrifice of Christ, as presented to God, and as applied to men. Fourthly, the Israelites needing, and having in their travels the Cloud, as the testimony of Gods presence to guide them, and his mighty arm to lead them, uphold and defend them, and Manna from heaven, and water out of the Rock to sustain and refresh them, Exod. 13.21, 22. & 15.2.12. & 16.17. shadowed forth our need of, and Christ his gracious vouchsafing to be our Advocate, (by vertue of his sacrifice) at his Fathers right hand, from thence sending forth his holy Spirit to continue his presence with us, and give in his promises, and so to teach, guide, comfort and strengthen us against temptations, and to goe through all sufferings in alll ser∣vices of love, &c. 1 Iohn 2.1, 2. Heb. 9.14.15, Iohn 14.14.26. & 15.26. & 16.14. And so in this digressiu to see how things were shadowed, we may view the ends of Christs sacrifice fore-mentioned, as also that which followes to be said. CHAP. V. The necessity of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ. It is shewn in that already said. FIrst, for Christ his shedding of his bloud, and dying for us, it was altogether necessary: for (Heb. 9.22.) without shedding of blood is no remission of sinnes. The truth of God makes a ne∣cessity for the sinner to die, and without the death of the sinner cannot be fulfilled, Gen. 2.17. Ezek. 18.20. The justice of God makes a necessity for the sinner to suffer the curse, and without the sinner doe suffer, the curse cannot be satisfied, Deut. 27.15-26. Gal. 3.10. And as nothing without shedding of blood & death, can fulfill truth, and satisfie justice: so no blood and death, but the blood and death of Man, the very nature that sinned, can sa∣tisfie, Heb. 9.9. & 10.4. And if particular men should suffer this curse and death in their own persons, they could never overcome, but must perish in that suffering for ever, and so can neither suffer for themselves nor for another, to procure a way for remission of
sinns, Psal. 49.7 8. neither indeed to make satisfaction for o∣thers, will the Blood, and Death of any man serve, unlesse the same be a just, and an innocent man that hath no sin of his own to satisfie for, Heb. 9.26.27. Yea even the blood of a just man, unlesse he be, as the first Adam before his fall, a publike man, Rom. 5.12. And made (as all men by the fall became under the law, Gal. 4.4. yea unlesse this man be also the Sonne of God, even God-man,) it will not be sufficient Heb. 10.5-10. Mat. 1.21.23. And this man, God-man, even Iesus Christ being come, and as the publike person made under the law, when he had lived thirty-three yeares, and upward an innocent life, so as noman could accuse him of sinne, Iohn . 46. yea in all righteousnesse, and holynesse, and fulnesse of good workes, and spent about three yeares in ministration of the Gospel; yet would not all this his righteous working, though accompanied with many miracles, and with frequent fasting, prayers, and teares make satisfaction for the sin of mankind, without his Death, and Blood; to in∣struct us wherein (and not in any unwillingnesse to suffer ac∣cording to the will of the Father, Phil. 2.8. Heb. 10.5.-10.) He uttered this prayer, Mat 26.39. If it be possible; let this Cupp passe from me, &c. And so that which the High-Priest spake not of himselfe, but by prophesie concerning the nation of the Jewes, Iohn 11.50. It is true; for all mankind; It was altogether, necessary for mankind, that Jesus Christ should dye, Gal. 3.10.13. 2 For Jesus Christ once dead to rise againe, and ascend to the right hand of God, and to present the vertue of this his own blood, in offering himselfe a spotlesse sacrifice to his Father for mankind; This also was altogether necessarie: for, however truth had fulfilling, and justice had satisfying in his blood-shed, and death; 2 Cor. 5.14. Gal. 3.13. Yet if he had not risen from the Dead, and ascended with the vertue of his own blood into the Heavens, and there offered himselfe a spotlesse Sacri∣fice to God for mankind; There could have been no Justifica∣tion, no redemption, no eternall life, and inheritance obtained, and received by Christ into his own hands to dispense to men, nor any dore opened to shew forth, and dispense this grace to
men, that by repentance, and faith they might come into Christ, and receive the same, nor could there have been a∣ny resurrection of their bodyes after Death, nor exercise of Christs Lordship over them, in absolving, or condemning ac∣cording to the Gospel, Rom. 4.25. He was raised againe for our justification, 1 Cor. 15.17. If Christ be not raised; ye are yet in your sinns, verse 20. But now Christ is risen from the Dead: Heb. 9.12. By his own blood he entred in once into the most hly place: having obtained eternall redemption, verse 24. He entred into Heaven it selfe, Reu. 1.18. I am he that liveth, and was Dead, and beholde I am alive for evermore, 1 Iohn 5.11. God hath given us eternall life, and this life is in his Sonne, 2 Tim. 1.10. who hath abolished Death, and brought life, and mortality to light by the Gospel, Iohn 16.7. &c. It is expedient for you that I goe away; for if I goe not away the Comforter will not come unto you: But if I depart, I will send him to you; he shall reprove the world, &c. verse 18.11. He will guide you into all truth, &c. verse 13.14.15. Psal. 68. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led Captivity Captive, thou hast received gifts in the man (for men, Act. 2.33. Ephes. 4.8.) yea even for the Rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them, Act. 5.30.31. Him hath God exalted at his right hand, to be a Prince, and a Saviour to give repentance unto Israel and forgivnesse of sinns, Act. 13.30. God raised him from the dead &c. to verse 39. verse 47. I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the ends of the Earth, Mat. 12.18. And he shall shew Judgement to the Gentiles; If there be no resurrection from the Dead, then Christ is not Risen, and if Christ be not Risen; then our preaching is vaine, and your faith is also vaine, 1 Cor. 15.13.-20. But now Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that sleep. verse 21. for since by man came Death, By man also the resurrection from the dead, and verse 22. &c. and Rom. 14.9 to this end, Christ both dyed, and rose, and revived that he might be the Lord, both of dead, and living, Act. 10.36. He is Lord of all, 2 Cor. 5.10. For we must all appeare before the judgement-Seat of Christ, &c. And of this he hath given assurance to all men in that he hath
raised him from the Dead. Acts 17.31. All which shewes the necessity of Christs resurrection, and ascension, and with the verrue of his own bloud, presenting and offering himselfe to God in the Heavens for men: to the ends fore-shown. 3 For Jesus Christ that hath dyed, and risen, and with the vertue of his own bloud entred the Heaven, and by the eternall Spirit offered himself a spotlesse sacrifice to God for men, Also by the same Spirit to discover this grace, thereby to call, and draw in men to him, and then to sprinkle and wash them with the presentation, and application of the vertue of his pretious bloud; And by his grace there-through discovered to renew them, unite, and conforme them to Christ. This also is altoge∣ther necessary in respect of men eceit, and enjoyment of ju∣stification, eternall life, and inheritance; for however, this salva∣tion which Jesus Christ hath wrought, the redemption, justifi∣cation, and eternall life he by himself in his own body, as the Publike man obtained for men with God, be such, and so recei∣ved by him for mankind, That it may be truly said of him, and in respect of what he hath, as the Publike person done, obtained received, and hath in his own hands to dispense, that he is the Saviout of the world, Ioh. 4.42. And hath by himself made pur∣gation of our sins, Heb. 1.3. and 9.26. and obtained eternall re∣demption, Heb. 9.12.50. That as Rom. 3.23, 24. All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, and Rom. 5.18. As by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousnesse of one, unto all men to justificati∣on of life; yea, 1 Joh. 5.11. God hath given us eternall life, and this life is in his Son: yet notwithstanding all this, Unlesse this grace be so discovered by the Spirit to men, that they be drawn in to Christ, and hee by his Spirit sprinkle his bloud on their heart, and shed abroad his love therein, and so wash, and renew them, they cannot in their own particular persons be justified, and partake of eternall life, and receive the inheritance with him, Rom. 3.25, 26. Tit. 3.4.5. And this necessity of his sprink∣ling, and washing the Conscience with his pretious bloud, may be seen true, in many respects.
1 In respect of sinne, It sufficeth not for bringing mens par∣ticular persons into the Kingdome of Heaven, That sinne is sa∣tisfied, for by the sacrifice of Christ, and so purged away by him as the publike person, that he in the room: of all mankind ap∣peart spotlesse at the Throne of God; But its requisite also, that it be purged out of the Conscience, and out of the nature, and conversation of such particular persons as enter that King∣dome; yea, and though this work be not as the former, done at once in the very act of his presentation, and offering himself to God, Heb. 1.3. and 9.12. and 10.10, 12. But by degrees; yet those Degrees are according to the entrance, 2 Cor. 3.18. 2 Pet. 1.11. Rom. 8.23. And so its said, Rev. 21.21. There shall in no wise en∣ter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or a lye, 1 Cor. 6.9. The unrighteous shall not in∣herit the Kingdome of God. Be not deceived, neither Fornica∣tors, nor Idolater, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor Theeves, nor covetous, nor Drun∣kards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God, Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. The work of the flesh are manifest, which are Adultery, Fornication, uncleannesse, lasciviousnesse, I∣dolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murthers, drunkennesse, revilings, and such like, They which doe such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, Ephes. 5.5. no Whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor co∣vetous man who is an Idolator, hath any inheritance in the King∣dome of Christ, and of God; so that such, unlesse they be washed, justified, purged, and sanctified, they cannot enter; nor can any sorrowes, tears, sacrifices, works of righteousnesse of their owne wash of the guilt, and take away the venome of these sinnes, nor make their hearts and natures new, It is only the pretious bloud and sacrifice of Christ, which by the eternall Spirit he offered to God: by the same Spirit discovered to, and sprinkled on the heart, enabling to believe, in which Peace is spoken to the heart remission of sins received, and liberty by faith to reckon them∣selves according to Christ, and as they are in him, who by his Spirit worketh his mind in them, and conformeth them to him self, 1 Pet. 1.2. Rev. 1.5. and 5.9. Rom. 3.25, 26. and 5.1.—5.1 C o 6.11. 2 Cor. 3.18. Tit. 3.4.
2 By reason of the blindnesse, darknesse, and enmity, that by reason of sinne is the nature of man: For it sufficeth not for mens personall entrance into the Kingdome, that in, and through Christ, God is light, and in him is no darknesse at all, unlesse men be brought into this light, and this light be in them that they may walke in it, 1 Iohn 1.5.7. and 2.8.9. 1 Thes. 5.4.5. nor yet is it enough for mens personall entrance into the King∣dome, that the enmity in their State, and condition be removed, unlesse also the enmity in their nature be removed, Psal. 68.21. neither is there any study, or labour of man in any wisdome or workes of righteousnesse of his own, that can bring him into this light of God, and take this enmity against God out of his nature; but onely the spirit of Jesus Christ (which when he offered up himselfe a Sacrifice to God for men, he received in the man, Psal. 68.18.) Discovering and testifying of Christ, and the vertue of his Blood, and the rich grace appearing therethrough, that brings out of darkenesse into his marvelous light, and reconcileth the heart, and powers to God, Iohn 14.26. and 15.26. and 16.14.15. Col. 1.4.5.12.13. 1 Pet. 2.7.9. 2 Cor. 5.14 18, 19, 20. Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 3 In respect of the first, and naturall Birth, and that which men are by propagation, and nature from the first Adam, whose Image they therein, and thereby partake of, and beare, and so are by nature dead in sins, and trespasses, Children of wrath, &c. Rom. 5.19. 1 Cor. 15.46.48.49. Psal. 51.5. Iob. 14.4. and 15.14. Ephes. 2.1, 2, 3 So that however Christ as the publike person hath wrought salvation in himselfe for men with God, and is justified, and glorified at Gods right hand; yet unlesse a man be borne againe, borne from above, even of water, and the Spirit, the free and rich grace of God manifest∣ed in the Application of the precious Blood of Christ to the heart, And that by the holy Spirit of Christ in that Knowledge, and Application of the precious Blood, giving him an escape from the Pollutions that are in the world through lust, and makeing him partaker of the Divine nature; That so as he per∣partooke of misery by having his being from Adam, and partaking of his nature, he may partake of justification and lyfe, by having his being in Christ, and partaking of his Divine nature; without
this new Birth; he cannot enter the Kingdome of God, Iohn 3.3.5.6. 2 Cor. 5.17.20. 2 Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And indeed, till so borne from above, men are Aliens from God, and Christ, and the lyfe of God in Christ, Ephes. 2.12. and 4.18. And however it be true, that in Christ, and that he hath done, ob∣tained, and received, God hath given us eternall lyfe, and this life is in his Sonne: yet this is also true, that whoever of us hath not the Sonne, the same hath not lyfe, lyfe is received, and enjoy∣ed onely in the receite, and enjoyment of the Sonne, 1 Iohn 5.11.12. And that is, when through his spirituall Discovery and sprinkling of his Pretious Blood, and Dispensation of his grace there-through to the heart, a man is brought to believe on him; And so quickoned, borne, and renewed, Ephes. 2.5.10. Esa. 55.1.—9. And so such he gives the priviledges of the Sonnes of God; who to receive him, and are so borne, Iohn 1.12.13. 2 Thes. 2.13.14. So that the truth is, the necessity in respect of mens per∣sonall entrance into the Kingdome, and being eternally saved, to be spiritually sprinkled, and washed with the Blood of Christ; is so great, as there can be no greater, there being no other way to the enjoyment of remission of sins, Humiliation for sinn, Justifica∣tion before God, wisdome, righteousnesse, Sanctification, and re∣demption, nor any fruitfulnesse that God will accept; But by this pretious Blood of Christ which he shed, and with the vertue thereof offered himselfe to God by his spirit sprinkled on the con∣science: And his rich, and abundant grace, manifested through the same, by the same spirit shed abroad in the heart, and so lead∣ing to God, in which respect Christ onely is the way for all ac∣cesse to the Father, and without whom there is no coming to God, nor doing any thing he will accept: Iohn 14.6. Rom. 3, 25. Ephes. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.30. Iohn 15.4. 1 Pet. 1.18.19. Ephes. 2.17.18. Heb. 10.10.—19. This necessity of Christ his sprinkling his Blood on the Consci∣ence, the whole Gospel, and all the writings thereof, and Testimonies and examples therein do shew, and so doth the Law also rightly understand.
CHAPTER 6. A digression, to shew how the Law shewes the necessity of this Blood-shedding, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ: BEfore, in Chapter 4. was shewn, how the ends of the suffer∣ing, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ was shaddowed in the leviticall law, and types of old, and the necessity of the acting, presenting, and applying the same, now if we view the morall law, even the law of workes, the holy, and righteous law of God; It also will shew, and urge the necessity of the Death, and Sacri∣fice of Christ, in all the respects aforesaid, and that every way: If we consider this holy law, 1. In respect of it selfe, 2 In respect of the ends of giving it, and 3. In respect of the power it hath in this lyfe in the consciences of men till set free by Christ. 1 The Law it selfe is holy, spirituall, and righteous:Rom. 7.12. Mat. 22.38.39. 1 Iohn 3.4. Rom. 7.7. Iam. 2.10. Mail. 1.6. It is a holy Law, pointing us all to live to God the holy one, and accor∣ding to his Will, and Commands, enjoyning to love God with all our heart, soule, and strength, and our neighbour as our selves, and to walke in that love of God, and our neighbour, and so it forbiddeth every sinn, and commandeth every Duty: And it is a spirituall Law, requiring the Inmost heart, and Spirit; And the utmost and perfect obedience of the whole man; so as the least rising motion to any evill it forbiddeth and concludeth it sinn: yea and the least want of the through, spirituall, and perfect per∣formance of all, or any one point it condemneth for sinn, and for that sinn putteth under the guilt of the breach of the whole Law: And it is a righteous law requiring of man noe more then is due from man to God, and which shall be the righteousnesse of a man before God, if he fulfill it, so as the law find no fault in him,Rom. 2.13. and 10.5. Gal. 3.10.12. Rom. 6. Deut. 27.15-26. and it promiseth life to the observers, and will performe it, that be∣ing the righteousnesse of the Law, and it sentenceth to death, and curse every one that sinneth against any point, or cometh short of the least title it requireth; so that this Law is holy, spirituall, and righteous in its Commandements of Duty, In its Justifying the doers of it, in its convincing the Transgressors, and in its leav∣ing
Transgressors to the curse; And indeed so holy, spirituall, and righteous is this law, that in their own persons, and performan∣ces, noe one man since Adam fell, but onely Jesus Christ our Lord hath fulfilled it to every Jota, or can be Justified, and have lyfe by it: For. 1 Though a man had such knowledge of the Law, that he could see all his Duty therein required, And had also such a heart to keepe this Law that he had respect to every Commande∣ment in it, and did his utmost to avoid every sinn, and to perform every duty, and that constantly in all his conversation: yet if he attaine not to the utmost the Law requireth, but fayle of that, if it were but once, and but in one point; the Law puts him un∣der the guilt of sinn, and danger of Curse, and Death, Rom. 6.23. the wages of sinn is Death, and James 2.10. whosoever shall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one poynt, he is guilty of all, and Gal. 3.10. Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of this Law to do them, and Rom. 5.12. all have sinned, Iames 3.2. In many things we offend all; so that by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified, Rom. 3.20. 2 A man having once sinned, and fallen under the guilt of sinne, and so into the desert of death, and curse, as all men have, there is no after-righteousnesse of his performance that can take away that sinne; which unlesse it be taken away, he cannot be justified before God, though in his after righteousnesse he could answer the whole Law, but onely for that one offence: whence those sayings, Job. 9.15.20.21.22. nor can any teares, confessions, or washing themselves with snow water, take off this sinne that they may appeare righteous before God, Job. 9.30.31.32. Nor can any gifts or sacrifices of Bulls and Goats, Heb. 10.4. nor of thou∣sands of Rams, or ten thousand Rivers of Oyle, or the first borne of Beasts, or of a mans body, satisfie for, and take away sin, Mich. 6.6.7. 3. Neither can there be any mangling, impairing, or abating, much lesse abolishing of this holy and spirituall law that the Al∣mighty will tolerate, nor did Jesus Christ come to destroy this Law, but to fulfill it, Mat. 5.17.18. Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets, I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfill: For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven and Earth passe, one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise passe from the Law, till all be fulfilled, neither did Jesus Christ come to be an Arbitrator or Dayes-man, to plead with God, and lay his hand upon him, that he might abate to men some part of their duty required in the Law, and to lay his hand upon men to enjoyn and cause them to perform some part of their due to the Law, to give some satisfying to God, & so make God & men friends that way, 1 Sam. 2.25. Iob. 9.33. No such matter; but Jesus Christ himselfe in his own per∣son while he was here on earth, did perfectly fulfill this Law, so as no sin could be found in him; but he was in respect of his own particular person, righteous and just, even by that Law. And had he not been a publick person in our stead, and so had our sins; that Law could never have charged him, for he kept it fully, Heb. 7.29. Ioh. 8.46. 1 Pet. 2.22.Rom. 3.19 Gal. 4.4. Esa. 53.2.6. 2 Cor. 5.19-21. Gal. 3.13. Rom. 4.25 2 Cor. 5.14. Rom. 7.4. and 4.25. But as the publick person in the roome of mankind. He was made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law; and so being under the Law for us, he had all our sins that Law could charge us with, imputed to, and laid upon him; and all the curse and death which Law could and did sentence us to, imposed upon him. And so he suffered the curse, & died the death for our sins; yea for us all, so as all are dead: And so he hath satisfied the Law, that we are dead to the Law by the bo∣dy of Christ. And this Jesus Christ as the publick person is risen again for our justification, and hath ascended to heaven, and with the vertue of his own blood offered himselfe a ransome and sacri∣fice to God, having obtained eternall redemption and life for men,Heb 9.12. Esa. 55.5. Iohn 16. Heb. 9.14. and 12.24. Reu. 1.5. to dispense to such as beleeve on him. And now sendeth forth of that Spirit he hath received, discovering this grace, to draw men to believe on him: and in the hearts of such as through grace be∣leeve in Christ, he by his Spirit applieth, sprinkleth and washeth with that pretious blood, so as he enableth them to receive the sa∣tisfaction of the Law, which himselfe hath made, and to answer Law-charges therewith, Rom. 4.24.25. & 5.2.—11. & 8 34. And to receive and own to themselves as theirs by faith the righteous∣nesse that he is become, and to rest on him, and approach in that to God, 1 Cor. 1.30. Phil. 3.3.7.8.9. and by the same Spirit in, and with the rich grace herethrough streaming, he reneweth them, Tit. 3.4.5. and worketh love in them, 1 Pet. 1.18.21.22. yea, a
more excellent love then Law discovered, in that it is a love of God in and for Christ, 1 Iohn 4.10.—19. and love of our brother as Christ hath loved us, Ioh. 15.1.2. And this love fulfils all righte∣ousnesse, yea from a better principle then law could have affoor∣ded, Rom. 13.10. the Spirit in working this love, writing the law in the inward parts, 2 Cor. 3.3. and leading to deny all evill, and live godly, &c. Tit. 2.11.12. and yeelding to and walking after the Spirit, a man shall neither fullfill the lusts of the flesh, nor be under Law, Gal. 5.16.18. but have the righteousnesse of the Law, (the life it promiseth, and cannot give yea a better life) fulfilled in him, and have an abundant entrance into the Kingdom, Gal. 6.8. 2. Pet. 11. And thus by Christ himselfe in his body, in all his conversation was the Law fulfilled; and by him in his own body, as the publick person, was the Law satisfied for all it had a∣gainst us: and by him through his Spirit applpying that satisfa∣ction to our hearts, he enables to beleeve and receive it; and in that beleeving sheads abroad his grace in the heart, that leads to all righteousnesse the Law requireth, though from a better principle that will in due season perfect the same, and hee also will fill us with eternall life. And without this coming, death, resurrection and sacrifice of Christ, the Law could never have been fulfilled and satisfied: and without his spirituall application to the heart, it will never be answered by us, or fulfilled in us; whence that thanksgiving, or profession, Rom. 7.25. & 8.1.2.3.4. 4. The ends of the making known, and giving this holy, spiri∣tuall, and righteous law, was neither to justifie those to whom it was given, nor to give them lyfe, nor to kill, and destroy from God for ever; for if it had been given to give lyfe, and justifie, and bring to the inheritance; it had been against the covenant and promises of God, and saith therein; which to conceive, God for∣bid, far bee it from us, Gal. 3.18, 21. Rom. 4.14. And if it had been given to get righteousnesse by it, or to destroy from God for ever; t had been against the grace of God testified in the Death, and resurrection of Christ, and faith therein; which God forbid, and far be it from us to conceive, Gal. 20.21. and 3.11.12.13. Rom. 4.13.—7.24.25. Heb. 2.9. Besides, the
giving the law in the hand of Moses a Mediator of the first Te∣stament; sheweth, that it was not given to justifie; for then no need of a Mediator, nor was it given to destroy from God for e∣ver; for then he would not have given a Mediatour, Gal. 3.17. And yet the law was given for good, holy, and mercifull ends; For God in his mercy having found a ransome, and given us life in him, and confirmed a Covenant in him, John 1.4. 1 Iohn. 1.1.2. which grace should have led men to repentance, and faith in God, and living to him; But through blindnesse,Esa. 44.20. and 55.2. Gal. 3.19. and hardnesse of heart; men slighted this great Salvation, and put confidence in I∣dolls, and superstitions, and lived in, and to themselves; And because of Transgressions, the law was added till the seed should come, and this law to discover that righteousnesse which is due from men to God: 1 To kill men in respect of themselves, of all that lyfe which they have in, and from themselves by any excellencyes, parts, en∣deavours, or workings of theirs, in, and by themselves; By dis∣covering their sinfulnesse, and the Immeasurablenesse of it, and the curse, and wrath due to them, that so they may charge them∣selves with it, which without the law, they would not doe, Rom. 3.19. and 4.15. and 5.13.20. By spoyling them of all hope of lyfe by their own workings, that they may say Amen to the curse,1 Cor. 1.6. and yeeld themselves as dead, and lost, and so receive the sentence of death in themselves, Gal. 2.19. Rom. 7.9. Deut. 27.26. 2 To occasion their submission to Christ, and so their high prizeing of the grace, and righteousnesse, and lyfe in him, that they may fall downe before him, and be quickned, and made alive by him, Rom. 5.20. Gal. 2.19. who by sprinkling his blood, and giving in his grace by his spirit, enliveneth them, Heb. 9.14. Tit. 3.4.5. And so Rom. 10.3. Christ is the end of the law for righteousnesse to every one that believeth, Gal. 2.20. & 3.22.24. which also sheweth the necessity of the pretious Blood of Christ, which he shead, and presented to his Father for men to be by his spirit applyed to men, without which they can have no true peace, and freedome with God, Iohn 13.8. and 8.32-36. 3 The power this law hath in the consciences of men in this lyfe, till they know, and believe in Christ, and be set free by him,
Iohn 8.34-36. this holy, spirituall, and righteous law, in respect of the spirituall affections, and services therein required, was once in the heart of mankind; when God made man in his own I∣mage; And made him, and all men in him, as in the first pub∣like person, righteous; then was it the naturall bent of man to love God, and his neighbour, and to walke in that love uprightly, Gen. 1.26, 27, 28. and 2.7. Ecles. 7.29. And then while these righteous affections, and services were naturally springing, and streaming in men; man was not under the power of the Com∣mandements thereof; with the promises and threats; But when man sinned, and fell, He lost these righteous affections, and ser∣vices out of his heart, and inward, and naturall bent; And became corrupt, averse, and full of enmity against God, Gen. 3.10-13. Eccles. 7.29. Rom. 5.12.18.19. And then fell under the power of this law with its Commands, Threats, and Promises; And the effect of this law as a spirit of Bondage entred into him: for such the power of the work of God in his grace, both shewn in the creation, and procured for men by the Redemption, and ex∣tended to men for the redeemers sake, that it still proclaimeth to men, and testifieth, that it is mans duty and that he is hereby bound to love God with all his heart, soule, and strength, and his neighbour as himselfe, and to walke in that love, And the least short coming hereof is sinn, Ioh. 35.10.11. and 37.24. Deut. 5.6.7. 1 Iohn 3.4. For though man by sinn lost his inte∣rest in God; yet God lost not his right and Authority over man, But when man by sinn, lost the inward and living principle of the law out of his heart; Then through the Authority of God o∣ver man, and the power of God in his works; man fell under the power of the law; And the effect of the law as a spirit of bon∣dage entred into his heart, and that with such force; that accor∣ding to the knowledge given him, whether by the works of God in creation, and providence, or the law declared, and written, that it bindeth downe, and embondageth a man, that he can no otherwise have hope, or looke to God for acceptance and life, then as he conceives himselfe to keepe this law, nor avoyd the feares of wrath, and Death, as he discernes himselfe a transgressor of it, and as their conscience witnesse; so doe their thoughts ac∣cuse, or excuse one another, Rom. 2.15. And so from the law,
sin takes occasion to become oft more violent in its motions to sin, Rom. 7.5.8. And from the law sinn hath its strength to accuse, and terifie, Rom. 7.11. 1 Cor. 15.56. And in desires of avoid∣ing danger, this spirit of bondage so laden with sinn pollutes the conscience to be dictating to seeke peace in workes of the law and to be speaking peace there from, Rom. 9.32. and 10.3. which still genders to bondage, and leaves under the curse, Gal. 4.21.30. and 5.4. and 3.10. And this power hath law with its effect in the consciences of men in this lyfe, till they be set free by Christ; for the law can justifie none that have at all sinned, nor gives any hope for any repentance after sinning, nor any power or freedome for coming in to God againe, this is the work of Jesus Christ, the Sonne of God, to justifie from sinn, and give repentance, and freedome to come in to God, Iohn 8 34-36. Act. 5.31. So that onely by Christ, by his spirit applying his preious blood to the heart, and streaming in his rich grace there through, the conscience is purged from the accusation of sinn, and from speaking, or seeking peace by dead works; And gives in an inward living prin∣ciple to serve the living God, Heb. 9.14. And so washeth from sinn, Reu. 1.5. Reneweth, Tit. 3.4. And setteth them at Liber∣ty for the things of the Kingdom, Gal. 5.1. enduing them with the Spirit of adoption of love, power and a sound minde, Rom. 8.15. 2 Tim. 1.7. And thus the law rightly understood in it selfe, and the ends of giving it; And the power it hath in the naturall conscience shews the necessity of the Pretious Blood of Christ to be by his spirit applyed to, and sprinkled on the conscience. CHAPTER VII. Of the Excellency, and dignity of this Precious Blood of Christ that is presented to the Father, and his Sacrifice being also presented to the heart. FOR the Excellency, Dignity, and worth of the Blood, Death and Sacrifice of Christ, presented, and offered to God for men, and presented, tendered, and applyed to men; It is be∣yond
comparison or expression; yet we may understand a little thereof, if we view, and consider it in fowre respects, 1. In respect of the Sacrifice it selfe, 2. In respect of the appearance, and De∣claration thereof, 3. In respect of the glorious, and abundance of love herethrough appearing, 4. In respect of the unvaluable, and inexpressible hope it giveth to all that receive it, besides the ope∣ration to be after spoke of. 1 In respect of the Presentation, and Sacrifice it selfe, it ap∣peareth to be of most excellent Dignitye, and worth in many no∣table respects, as to say. 1 In respect of the Priest that offered this Sacrifice, who was immediately called of God, as Aron was, Heb. 5.4.5. And in∣finitely above and greater then Aron, and all the Priests of his Or∣der: for they had sinns of their own also, first to offer for, be∣fore they offered for the sins of the people, But this our high Priest had no sinn of his own to satisfie for, but his offering was wholly, and altogether for us, Heb. 7.26.27. And their High-Priests were men that had infirmities, and so dyed; But this High-Priest, though the very man that dyed for us, yet risen from the Dead, and alive for ever-more to interceide for us, Heb. 7.23-25. and 5.5.6. Yea they were made Priests according to the law of a carnall Commandement, But this High-Priest after the power of an endlesse life, Heb. 7.16.17. They without an Oath, this with an Oath, Heb. 7.21. They the Sonnes of men, But this High-Priest is the Sonne of God; even God-man, Heb. 7.28. and 1 4-8. They went, and presented the Blood in an earthly holy place, but this High-Priest entred into Heaven it selfe, to offer, and appeare before God for us, Heb. 9.7.8.12.24. They though they offered to God; yet they tooke no plea∣sure in their offerings, but this High-Priest offered to God, and he hath accepted him, and set all his wellpleasednesse in him, and set him at his right hand, and given all Authority to him, Heb. 10.1-12. and 1.4.8. Oh consider how great an High-Priest we have; And how excellent then the Sacrifice that he hath offered, and by vertue whereof he interceideth, Heb. 1. & 3, & 5, & 7, & 8. 2 In respect of the Sacrifice it selfe which he offered; for eve∣ry High-Priest is ordained to offer gifts, and Sacrifices; And it is of necessity that he have somwhat also to offer, and that in the
Heavens, Heb. 8.3.4. And so he hath offered a gift, a Sacrifice for satisfaction, for ransome, for propitiation, and for a memori∣all, to intercede with for us; And this was not Gold, or Silver, nor Bullocks, and Lambs, &c. nor the Blood of others, as the o∣ther Priests offered, but his own most Pretious Blood, his own most holy Body, even that very Body in which he had borne our sinns to the Tree, 1 Pet. 2.24. In which he dyed for our sinns, and rose for our Justification, Rom. 4.25. Yea the Body, which is the Body of the Sonne of God, Iohn 1.14. In whom the ful∣nesse of the God-head dwelleth bodily, Col. 2.9. This is the gift, the ransome, the Sacrifice; he offered himselfe, his own Bo∣dy without spot to God for us, Heb. 9.12.14. and 10.5-10. Oh how fit, how satisfying, and of what infinite value is this Blood, and Sacrifice of his! 3 In respect of the Altar on which this Sacrifice was offered, and by which it was borne and carried up to God; The Altar of Gods appointment, whatever it be, is greater then the gift, or Sa∣crifice, and Sanctifieth the gift, Mat. 23-19. Now those other Priests offered upon an Altar of earth, or earthly substance, Exod. 20.24 But what is the Altar on which this High-Priest offereth this excellent gift, that is greater then it, and sanctifieth it? surely this can be no other, but the Divine nature which is greater then the Humane; In respect of which Humane, clad with our Infir∣mities he said; The Father is greater then I, Iohn 14.28. And by the power of this Divine nature he was supported in, and through his sufferings Esa. 50.1-9. Raysed from the dead—Rom. 4.24. and 6.4. Ascended to heaven, Act 5.30.31. And offered himselfe to God: And so it is expresly said, Heb. 9.14. he through the eternall spirit offered himselfe without spot to God. And thus also was God manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit &c. 1 Tim. 3.16. And so by ransome of the union of the humane nature, with the Divine in the person of the Sonne of God, one Christ, God-man; This Blood, and Sacrifice, if it be rightly understood, may be truly called the Blood, and Sacrifice of God, Act. 20.28. found by God, Iob. 33.24. And offered by God unto God, according to the will of God, though it was the Body, or humane nature offere: for men: And this doth sanctifie,
and dignifie the offering, that it is of Infinite value and prevalen∣cy, Heb. 10.5-10-19. &c. 2 In respect of the Declaration, and appearance of this preti∣ous Blood, and Sacrifice; And so of Christ, that by the eternall Spirit hath offered it to God for men, and received the same spi∣rit to apply to men, and his gratious ends in both the faithfull, and playne declaration of this by such as by spirit have received it, and as the Spirit hath taught them, 2 Cor. 4.4.6. 1 Cor. 2.12. Rom. 12.3. Mat. 28.20. Declares this Pretious Blood, and Sa∣crifice to be of great excellency, worth, and Dignity: In that in such declaration (as he promised.) 1 The holy Spirit cometh along, and sheweth, and testifieth of these things of Christ, Iohn 15.26. and 16.14. and manifested the savour of his Knowledge, 2 Cor. 2.14.15. And goeth to the heart of men that they might believe, Iohn 1.7. Rom. 10.7, 8, 9, 10. And writeth the minde of Christ in the Believer, 2 Cor. 3.3. and 13.3 5. So that in the hearing of this Doctrine, and Object of Faith, and in no Doctrine, or observation of any law of workes, the Spirit of Christ cometh, and testifieth, and is received, Gal. 3.1-5. 2 The free grace, and abundant love of God to mankind in the gift of his Sonn. To be a ransome for all men, 1 Tim. 3, 4, 5, 6. And the Saviour of the world, And the propitiation for their sins, 1 Iohn 4.10.14. That whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life, Iohn 3.17. And his acceptation of his Sonne for men, and taking his wellpleasednesse in him, Mat. 3.17 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 10.1-12. His filling him for men, Psal. 68.18. Esa. 41.1. His readinesse to receive in, and through his Sonn, and that his Sonn shall give eternali life to all that in his Discovery, see, and believe on him John 6.40. and 1.12. yea, even his peculiar, and delightfull love, and well pleasednesse in his Sonn, and all that by grace are made one in his Sonn, Iohn 15.9. and 16.27. All this appeareth (and as living water stream∣eth) In the Declaration, and appearance of this Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice, as it was offered to God, And is applyed to the heart, Rom. 3.24 25. 1 Iohn 5.6-12.13. 3 The great, and compleate salvation, redemption, reconcilia∣tion, Propitiation, and righteousnesse that is in him, and which he
is become, which by himselfe,1 Pet. 2.24. 1 Cor. 15.3.4. Rom. 4.25. 1 Iohn 2.2. and in his own Body he hath wrought in dying and shedding his Blood for our sinns, and rise∣ing for our Justification; And through the eternall Spirit offering himselfe a spotlesse and unvaluable Sacrifice to God, in which he hath made Purgation of our sinns, slaine enmity, obtained eternall redemption, and made such satisfaction in heaven, that he hath thereupon received life to dispense to men, Heb. 1.3. and 9.12.14. and 10.1-12. And the power, and fitnesse of the same Pre∣tious Blood, and Sacrifice by the Holy Spirit applyed to the heart, to purchase, redeeme, and reconcile to God from among men, and to wash, purge, and renew the heart, &c. Act. 20.28. Ren. 1.5. and 5.9. Heb. 9.14. Tit. 3.4.5. And so worke Sal∣vation in men. All this appeareth in this Doctrine, or playne faith-and spirituall Declaration of this Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice, so as therethrough from the threefold witnesse in heaven that are one, there come these three on earth to men, the Spirit, and the water, and the Blood, 1 Iohn 5, 6, 7, 8-12. By all which this Blood, and Sacrifice appeareth of infinite Excellency, and Dig∣nity. 4 In respect of the rich, free, bright, and abundant love appear∣ing in this Sacrifice of the Sonn of God, for as it was the love of God to give his Sonn, &c. as aforesaid; even so in all that he doth to us, in mercy for his Sonns sake, his love and goodnesse appear∣eth therein, Psal. 136. And his goodnesse is his glory, Exod. 33.18.19. and so: 1 His love, mercy, and goodnesse appeareth in this, that by Christ, and for his sake, the earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are upheld, the Sunn to shine, &c. continued, mercy shewn, &c. All witnessing his goodnesse, and leading to repentance, as is fore∣shewn, and so it is said, Psal. 19. The heavens declare the glory of God, &c. And thus, all his workes prayse him, Psal. 145.8.9.10. And thus for Christ his sake, his love, and glorious good∣nesse appeares to all in his workes. 2 Yet his love, mercy, and goodnesse, did more specially ap∣peare to Israel, in giving them his Oracles, his Covenant, and Ordinances, and though but in Promises, Prophesies, and Tipes of Christ, as then yet to come; yet his glory appeared therein, and
such speciall love, as it might then be truly said, he had not dealt so with any Nation, Rom. 3.2. and 9.4. Psal. 147.18. 3 But now in this giving, and setting forth his Sonn, who hath come, and dyed for our sins, and with the vertue of his own Blood entred the heavens, and offered himselfe a Sacrifice to God, and received Spirit, and sending him forth in the word of Salvation which himselfe wrought, and first began to preach, and so God speaking to him by his Sonn, who is the brightnesse of his glory, and the expresse Image of his Person, Heb. 1.2.3. and 2.3. The wisdome of God, and the power of God; yea, wisdome, righ∣teousnesse, sanctification, and redemption to them that believe, 1 Cor. 1-24.30. In which face of Christ, the light of the Know∣ledge of the glory of God, yea, his face shineth, and is beheld, 2 Cor. 4 6. and 3.18. Oh the Infinitnesse of the Breadth, Depth, length, and height of this love of God, appearing herein! Ephes. 3.18.19. In which still the Excellency, and Dignity of this Sa∣crifice appeareth. 4 In respect of the great hope this Pretious Blood, and Sacri∣fice giveth, and engendereth in all that in believing receive the same: as. 1 Remission of sinns, and acceptance into favour, and peace, Act. 10.43. Rom. 5.1.2. 2 Purgation of Conscience, and Sanctification of the whole man, Heb. 9.14. 3 Seasonable victorie over all enemies, and Temptations, 1 Iohn 5.4.6. Rom. 16.20. 1 Thes. 5.24. 4 The Holy Spirit to teach, guide, and conforme to Christ, and so bring to the Kingd ome, and inheritance, Iohn 14.26. and 16.13.14. 1 Pet. 1.5. 5 And to say all in one word, eternall life, 2 Pet. 1, 23. 1 Iohn 2.25. All which shew forth the Excellency, and Dignity of this Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, besides the vertue, and power now to be spoke of.
CHAP. 8. Of the vertue, operation, and prevalency of this Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ: And first. As offered to God. THE vertue, operation, and prevalency of the Blood, and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ is very great; so as that which was prophesied concerning him, is and shall certainly be fulfilled; Esa. 53. When thou shalt make his Soule an offering for sinn, He shall see his seed (so great a Generation, as none of us can de∣clare) He shall prolong his dayes (live ever, and cause his seede to live for ever with him) And the pleasure of the Lord shall pros∣per in his hands (his workes, and Judgements acceptable, and prosperous.) He shall see the Travell of his Soule (even be the Lord of all, and be acknowledged Lord by all.) By his knowledge shall my righteous Servant justifie many (even all that believe on him through his teaching.) And this is the ground; for he shall beare their iniquity, therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoyle with the strong (he shall have the Kingdome, and be the judge, and give to each, their portion, and Doome.) Because he hath powred out his Soule un∣to Death, &c. All which is true in Christ, who is the truth; And in a measure true too, and in all that believe on him, and shall one day appeare true to all men, 1 Iohn 2.8. Phil. 2.7-11. And that the Truth of the vertue, Power, and Prevalency of this Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, may be rightly and profi¦tably understood, and believed by us; let us consider what is said thereof by the Spirit of truth, in the Scripture or word of Truth, concerning the vertue, power, and Prevalency of this Pretious and Sacrifice of Christ. 1. As it was presented and offered to God: 2. As grace is therethrough shewn and tendered to men. 3. As it is spiritually applied to, and worketh in, the hearts of those that through grace believe. 4. And as he testifieth, and exerciseth the power of it up∣on them that have persisted in obstinacy, and refusing to believe.
In all which its power and prevalency doth appeare, and shall by all men be one day confessed. 1. As this pretious Blood and Sacrifice was presented & offered to God; it hath so verily and mightily prevailed with him, that he hath obtained and received of the Father the first, next, and im∣mediat end of his suffering and Sacrifice; and also the Father hath filled and fitted him for the second ultimate and utmost end of his suffering and sacrifice. In both which, the prevalency and effe∣ctualnesse thereof with God for men, is evident and manifest: let be considered, The first, next and immediat end of the suffering and Sacrifice of Christ, was to work a salvation for mankind with God. And that himselfe might be the Lord, the Saviour, and the Judge, John 3.17. Rom. 14.9. 1 John. 4.14. Psal. 2 9. And this first end con∣taineth, and may be comprehended in these particulars: 1. To put, or take away sin, even the sinne of the world (that was in the way between God and mankind, out of the way) by the sacrifice of himselfe, Heb. 9.26. Joh. 1.19. 1 Joh. 3.5, as is fore-shewne, That so he that was made sinne, and a curse for all, might himselfe in the room of all, be justified as the publick man, with such a full and fruitfull justification, that all may be so farie justified in him, that whosoever of them are by his grace and Spi∣rit, brought in believing to be one in, and with him, shall also in their own particular persons be justified in, with, and through him, Ephes. 2.4.—10. Joh. 3.15.16. Acts 10.43. And hath not his Blood and Sacrifice offered to God, prevailed with God for, and effected all this? doth not the Spirit in the Scripture affirm plain∣ly and expresly, 1 Joh. 3.5. In him is no sin, Heb. 1.3? And that when he had by himselfe purged our sin, he sat down on the right hand of, &c. with Heb 11.12? And doth not God affirm him to be the just, 1 John 2.1? and the holy one, vers. 20? and his righteous servant, that by his knowledge shall justifie many, Isa. 53.11. And saith not the Scripture expresly, Rom. 3.23.24.25? All have sinned, and come short of the glorie of God? being justified freely through his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, which God nath set forth to be the propitiation, through faith in his blood for the remission of sinnes? And Rom. 5.18. As by the of∣fence of one unto all men to condemnation, even so by the righte∣ousnesse
of one unto all to justification of life. And then it fol∣lowes as the fruit of this, vers. 19. For as by the disobedience of one, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous; so is he justified, so hath he by sacrifice prevailed. 2. To remove, stay, and take away the enmity that (by reason of sin & death entred & the dominion of the law) was between God and man in the very way, and in the state and condition of man∣kind, standing as a partition, & Iron Bar, to keep God from shew∣ing mercy to men, and men from any passage of coming in to God. The removing of this was one end of the suffering and sacrifice of Christ, as also the enmity occasioned between Jewes and Gen∣tiles, by the Law of Ordinances, in rites and sacrifices, and so to make peace. And so it is expresly said of his sufferings and sacri∣fice, Isai. 53.5. The chastisement of our peace was upon him; and 2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. And of his prevalency for this with God for men, doth not the Spirit in the Scripture affirm, Psal. 85.10. Mercy and truth are met, righteousnesse and peace have kissed; and that he, Col. 1.20. hath made peace through the blood of his crosse, and Eph. 2.13-16? Now in Christ Jesus yee who sometimes were farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ; for hee is our peace, who hath made both (those mentioned verse 1, 2, 3) one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the Law of Commandements in ordinances, for to make in himselfe of twain one new man, so making peace. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the crosse, having slain the enmity thereby or in himself. And this preceding peace-preaching; and yee are become dead to the Law by the bo∣dy of Christ, Rom. 7.4. who hath abolished death, 2 Tim. 1.10. and taken out of the way all that was contrary to us, Col. 2.14. and so is affirmed to be (1 John 2.2.) the Propitiation for our sinnes, and not for ours onely, but also for the sinnes of the whole world; such his prevalency with God. 3. To redeem and buy all of God, that they might not perish its that necessity of perishing into which they had sold themselves, nor be judged to eternall death by and according to that Law, un∣der which they were fallen, nor carried away by the Divell as their
rightfull Lord, by vertue of his first conquest over mankind. But that they all might be released, and given over to his own dispose, and so he be the Lord of all, as it is said, Rom. 14.9. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living. And so effectuall was his sacrifice, and such the prevalency of it with God for men in this respect, that he is affirmed to have bought even those that deny him, 2 Pet. 2.1. And on this ground it is said, whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lords, Rom. 14.8. And he is Lord of all, Acts 10.36. Yea God hath made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ, Acts 2.36. And in this particular end, many particular ends, as branches thereof are included, for which also he hath prevailed. As to in∣stance some. 1. That he might uphold and preserve the earth, and the inha∣bitants thereof, and the heavens for them till the end come: In which he hath prevailed, and so it is said, Psal. 75.3. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved; I beare up the pillars of it, Col. 1.17. And by him all things consist. And Heb. 1.3. He up∣holdeth all things by the word of his power, when he had by him∣selfe purrged our sinnes, &c. 2. That he might for the time of this naturall and dying life, remove and take off from men so much of that sorrow, weaknesse, pains, and cursed terrors, which the falling into sinne did necessi∣tate to be on men, as in his love and wisdome hee sees fit. And in this also he hath prevailed, and so it is said, Acts 17.28. In him wee live, and move and have our being, Psal. 145.8. The Lord is gra∣cious and full of compassion, slow to anger, great in mercie, The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works, vers. 9. 3, That he might exercise patience, shew mercy, and use such means as he pleaseth to move and lead men to repentance, and see∣king after him, and submission to him, and in this also hee hath prevailed, and so it is said, John 1.4.5. In him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light shineth in darknesse, 2 Pet. 3.9. The Lord is patient and longsuffering to us-ward, not wil∣ling that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, Rom. 2.4. The goodnesse of God leadeth thee to repentance, Acts
14.17. & 17.26.27. that they should seek the Lord, and live to him, Rom. 14.7.8. 2 Cor. 5.14.15. 4. That he may rule over all, and dispose of their wayes, conditi∣ons, and trials, &c. And in this also he hath prevailed; and so the Father in approbation of his Sacrifice, said, Ask of me and I shall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession, &c. Psal. 2.8.9. And himself saith, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, &c. Matth. 28.18. And the Spirit in the Scripture saith, Psal. 66.7. He ru∣leth by his power for ever, Psal. 103.19. And his Kingdome ru∣leth over all. 5. That after the end of this life he may raise all men from the first death, and make them alive, and set them before him, that they may bow to him, and acknowledge him Lord, to the glory of God. And in this also he hath prevailed; and so the Spirit in the Scripture saith, 1 Cor. 15.21.22. since by man death, by man also the resurrection from the dead: For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive. And himselfe saith, Joh. 12.32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. And even because of his obedience in suffering, it is said, Phil. 2.9.10.11. wherefore God also hath highly exalted, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, &c. And that every tongue shall confesse, that Jesus is the Lord, to the glory of God. And so David confessed and pro∣phesied, Psal. 86.9. All nations whom thou hast made, shal come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorifie thy name. Thus must all come before him one day, and then he shall separate and dispose of them, Matth. 25.32, 33. 4. Another particular end in this first, next, & immediate end of the suffering and sacrifice of Christ offered to God, was, That hee might shew forth to men this rich and abundant grace. Eph. 2.4.7. And so it was, 1. That this full Gospel, and therethrough repentance and re∣mission of sinnes, might be preached in his name among all Na∣tions, Luke 24.46.47, And for this he hath prevailed, so as him∣self came and preached peace, Eph. 2.17. And first began to preach the Gospel of this salvation himselfe, Heb. 2.3. and then left the commission for preaching the same unto his Apostles and faithfull
Disciples that by grace come to be united to him, and endued with spirituall gifts, John 17.18-21. 2 Corinth. 5.18.19.20. 1 Pet. 2.3.—9. And left his charge to preach it to all Nations, Mat. 28.19, 20. Mark 16.13. 2. And also that by his laying down his life in witnessing to the truth of the Gospel he taught, and the Fathers acceptance of his sacrifice, the truth of the Gospel might bee confirmed for all that heare it, that they might beleeve, John 18.37. 1 Tim. 6.13. And in this also he hath prevailed; and so it is said, he spake the truth which he heard of God, John 8.45. And the Apostles have said. They spake the words of truth, Acts 26.25. and that with great plainnesse of speech, 2 Cor. 3.12. by manifestation of the truth, 2 Cor. 4.2.5. for saith Peter, 2 Pet. 1.16. We have not fol∣lowed cunningly devised Fables, when we made knowne to you the power and comming of the Lord Jesus Christ; but were eye∣witnesses of his majesty: for he received from the Father honour and glory, when, &c. 3. And also that himself might be the prime motive, and ex∣ample to us for faith, and love, and walking in both conversation, and ministration in patience and meeknesse through sufferings in hope to the death, 1 Pet. 2.21. John 13.1-15. And in this also he hath prevailed, so as himself points to himselfe for the prime motive and example, Joh. 15.12—.20. And the Spirit in the Scrip∣ture sets him forth to us for motive and example, Col. 3.12.—14. and bids us looke to him, and consider him, Heb. 12.2-7. and fol∣low him, Eph. 5.1.2. 4. Yea and that he might ratifie the New Testament of preti∣ous promises for all that in the heavenly call are brought in to believe in him, that they through the Spirit may wayt for the same, through faith, Heb. 9.14.15.16. Matth. 26.28. In which also he hath prevailed, as Heb. 9.15. sheweth, with Gal. 3.15.—26. and 5.5. And so the whole Gospel is by the blood and sacrifice of Christ confirmed and sealed for truth. 5. That he might also having life in himselfe, quicken whom he will, and so give eternall life to all that beleeve on him, and leave, and give up such as will none of his counsell and so persist in refusing to beleeve on him. In which also he hath prevailed, John 1.17. & 3.18.19 & 5.20.28. & 6.37.40.
6. That he may at the last judge all men according to the Gos∣pel which himself first began to preach, and then gave his servants to preach. And in this also hee prevailed, as is evident in that himselfe said, John 12.48. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken the same shal judge him at the last day. And his servant by the spi∣rit said, Rom. 2.16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel. And so it is said of God, Acts 17.31. He hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousnesse by that man whom hee hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance (or offered faith) unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. And so as Rom. 14.9. to this end he both died and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord of both dead and living. So it is affirmed on that very ground, vers. 11, 12. & 2. Cor. 5.10. We must all appear abefore the judgment seat of Christ, &c. yea and such as come then to be con∣demned by him that so died for them, and offered himselfe a Sacri∣fice and ransome for them; and used mercy and extended meanes to call them to repentance, are charged with sinne for that they have not believed, John 16.8.9. and that they have troden under foot the Soone of God, counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith they were sanctified, an unholy thing, and offered despite to the Spirit of grace, at least that he called and they refu∣sed. Heb. 10.29. Prov. 1 24. And this shall be their condemnation, light came, and they loved darknesse rather, Iohn 3.19. They by following lying vanities, have forsaken their own mercies, Iona 2.8. And lost their own souls, Matth. 16.26. And by denying the Lord that bought them, brought upon themselves swift destru∣ction, 2 Pet 1. and so are rightly called,Jude 12 Frees twice dead. And the destuction and torment into which they shall be cast, is called the second death, Rev. 20 6.14. And thus mightily and verily hath the pretious Blood and Sa∣crifice of Christ offered to his Father, prevailed with God, so as indeed Jesus Christ hath thereby put away sin, abolished death, removed enmity out of the condition of mankind, bought all men of God, and obtained eternall redemption; so as he is become the Lord of all, and hath remission of sinnes, and life to dispense. And through him the earth is upheld for men, mercy shewed to, and
means used towards them to draw them to repentance, and faith, and they all given of God into his dispose, and he hath power and shall raise them all from the dead, and judge them all according to the Gospel, such as have in beleeving been brought to him, and a∣bidden in him in the day of grace, hee will sentence to eternall life; and such as have through the day of grace persisted in refu∣sing him, or departing from him, he wil sentence to a second death. And that men might have knowledge hereof, and faith herein, to bring them in to him, and confidence to abide in him, and bee left excuselesse in their refusall; he hath also sealed and confirmed the Gospel for a certain truth, in the report of the Propitiation, and life on beleeving for all men, and the New Testament for beleevers. And all this true, whether men believe it, or no. And so far hath the sacrifice, as offered to God, prevailed: and yet further in his having a fitnesse for that to be after said. And in respect of all hi∣therto said, the light shineth in the darknesse, but the darknesse comprehendeth it not, Iohn 1.5. 7. And now to remedy this also, that the light may be seen and known through the means used, there is yet another end of his Sacrifice offered; namely, that hee might fit at his Fathers right hand, and receive and bee filled with the holy Gost in our nature glorified to send forth to the sonnes of men, and to fill and lead his people: and so to be as in his own place, a reprover of the world, and an advocate and comforter of his people. Himselfe when he was in the world, did testifie of it, That the works there∣of were evill, Iohn 7.7. And hee declared himselfe the Bread of life, Iohn 6. the Son of God, and Doore of the sheep, Iohn 10. yea the Way, the Truth, and the life, Iohn 14.6. and did teach his Disciples and keep them, and manifest his Fathers Name and Words to them, Iohn 17.6, 7, 8. and hee being in that estate, and manner of ministration not long to abide in the world, did pro∣mise to send them another Advocate and Comforter to bee in his stead with them for ever, Ioh. 14.16. and that this holy spirit should beare witnesse of him. Iohn 15.26. and convince for reprove the world, Iohn 16.8, 9, 10, 11. and guide his Disciples into all truth, Iohn 16.13. mind them of his sayings, teach them all things, Iohn 14.26. &c. yet even when while Christ in his own personall body was in the world, he told this for truth unto his Disciples,
Iohn 16.7. It is expedient for you that I goe away, for if I goe not a∣way, the Comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart I will send him unto you. And when he promiseth such portion of Spirit, it was at that time said, The H. Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus Christ was not yet glorified. Iohn 7.39. Now in his ascen∣ding and offering himselfe in Sacrifice to God for men, hee hath prevailed for this also, as appears in that is said, Psal. 68.18. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast re∣ceived gifts in the man (that is in the humane nature, and for men, to give gifts to men, Eph. 4.8.) yea the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them. And so where there was a performance-evident and eminent, in visible descent, & divine ope∣ration through some to the convincement of many, and drawing in many, Acts 2. totum. It is said, This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we are all witnesses; therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father, the promise of the H. Ghost, he hath shed forth this which yee now see and hear: and so the Spirit of the Lord doth rest on him, Isai. 42.1. and he is annointed with it, to preach good tidings, &c. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3, 4. So that as himselfe hath made peace. so he hath received Spi∣rit to preach, and give peace, Eph. 2.14.16.17. As he hath procu∣red meanes to be used to call men; so hee hath received Spirit to send forth according to the means to breath and operate secretly therein towards, and with men, Gen. 6.3. to enlighten every man, Iohn 1.9. to manifest the being and goodnesse. of God to them, Rom. 1.19. to reprove their evils, Pro. 1.23. to lead to repentance, Rom. 2.4. that they might seek and find God, Acts 7.26. and hee opens his words and gives his Spirit to to them, Pro. 1.23. And as he hath himself preached the Gospel, and confirmed the truth of it with his blood, & left it with his servants to minister; so he hath received, and is filled with Spirit immeasurably, Ioh. 3.34. to send forth in the ministration thereof, to cenvince the world, Ioh. 16.8, 9. to bring down every high thought, 2 Cor. 10.4.5. to discover grace to men that they might believe, Ioh. 1.7. and come to Christ, Isai. 55.5. to purge the consciences of beleevers, Heb. 9.14. and witnesse their sonship, Rom. 8.16. And as hee hath shed his blood, and presented himselfe with the vertue of it, in offering himselfe a sacrifice to God for men, and so made a purgation of sinnes, and
wrought salvation, and righteousnesse, and obtained eternall re∣demption for men; so hee hath received an office, and spirit at his Fathers right hand to offer and call men to to the receite of the same, Pro. 8.4.7. Esa. 45.22. And by the same spirit to apply the same grace, sprinkle the vertue of the same Blood, and Sacrifice on such as believe, to wash, cleanse, sanctifie, and con∣forme them to himselfe therewith, Esa. 61.1-5. Ephes. 5.25.26. whence they that come to Jesus are said to come to the Blood of sprinkling Heb. 12 24. And to say in a word: As himselfe is the gift of God, Iohn 4.10. and full of grace, and truth, Iohn 1.14. and eternall life is in him, and given us in him, that whosoever hath him hath it, 1 Iohn 5.10.11.12. So is he filled with the a∣bundance of spirit, to discover, and dispence this gift, grace, truth and eternall life, Esa. 42.1-8. and 61.1-4. whence also, grace, mercy, and peace, are mentioned for the Holy Ghost, com∣ing downe from the Father, and the Sonne discovering, giving to, and effecting in believers, grace, mercy, and peace, as is seene by comparing, Rom. 5.1 5. and 1. Iohn 5.6.7. with Rom. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.3. 2 Cor, 1.2. Gal. 1.3. Ephes. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. Col. 1.2. And so in all the Apostle Pauls salutations to the Churches, 2 Pet. 1.2. Rom, 4.5. And so, and in every respect as a foresaid hath the Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, pre∣vailed with God for men, and this set forth in the Gospel for men, as a very truth, yea to, and for such as do not yet believe, but are yet impenitent, and disobedient; that they might believe, and repent, it being the foundation of, and Door to repentance, and faith. And so of the first consideration of the vertue, efficacy, and prevalency, of the pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, even as it was offered to God, and hath prevailed with God for men. Now let us consider the efficacie in the three following considera∣tions.
CHAP. IX. 2. Of the vertue, operation, and effectualnesse of this Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, As through its prevalency with God, grace, and mercy is shown, and extended to men and how fit, and forceable to prevaile with them. IT is before shewn; that through the prevalency of this Pre∣tious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ with God for men, mercy is shewn, and meanes is used towards men; And that though men are so dead in sinne, that they have no power, spirit, or will to discerne God, or come into him by these meanes, yet Jesus Christ by his Sacrifice hath prevailed with God, and received of him in the humane nature the spirit to send forth in, and according to the meanes, to discover the grace procured by his Blood, and Sacrifice, and so to call, and draw in men to God as is shewn; And of the Prevalency of the Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ with men towards God, in this Discovery of grace by his spirit, is that here to be noted; not what humane studdies, artificiall know∣ledge, and forced motives effect, But what by vertue of the Sa∣crifice of Christ; the secret, spirituall, and supernaturall breath∣ing, and motion of the spirit of Christ effecteth in, and according to the meanes procured by his Sacrifice; And so. 1 In his manifestation, and Discovery of grace, and mercy in those mercies of God vouchsafed in his workes of creation, and providence continued for Christs sake to the sonnes of men, is effected for, and to men. 1 Some Testimony that God is, Rom. 1.19.20. And that notwithstanding men have sinned, yet he is God, and mercifull to them, Act. 14.17. And that he is a rewarder (that is ready to shew favour, and extend mercy) to them that seeke him, Heb. 11.6. And so the heavens declare the glory of God, Psal. 19. And his spirit striveth with men, Gen. 6.3. And he calleth all, Pro. 8.4. 2 It giveth secret reproofes of evills found, Pro. 1.23. And secret moveings to repentance of the evills reproved; And faith
in his goodnesse discovered, and motions to seeke his favour, Rom. 2.4. Act. 17.29.30.31. Esa. 45.22. 3 It effecteth a certaine light, and disposition in men, that is some what more then naturall, even an inspiration from the Al∣mighty, giving understanding to discerne somthing of God, and that with some inclination towards his goodnesse, which because it hath not got dominion in men, they are yet but naturall, though somthing be vouchsafed them that is more then naturall, by which a capabillity to heare some of the teachings according to God is for the time given them, and so it is said, he enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, Iohn 1.9. And there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding, Iob. 32.8. And the spirit of man is the Candle, (or Lamp) of the Lord (which he hath set up and lighted) search∣ing all the inward parts of the Belly, Pro. 20.27. and this is the great fault of men that they take not notice of this mercy, Iob. 35.10.11. none saith, where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night, who teacheth us more then the Beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser then the fowles of heaven? And thence come corrections olso, to hide pride from man, to seale his Instruction, &c. Iob. 33.16-19. to 29-30. 4 To such as do not willingly harden themselves against the re∣proofs and speakings of this grace thus farr extended, but turne thereby, he maketh knowne his words, by dreames, visions, or a rumour of the Gospel some way, so as he worketh in them, some sutable repentance, and faith, and feare of him, and mercifull af∣fections, &c. leading to himselfe, as is evident in his own Te∣stimony, Pro. 1.23. And the examples set before us, Iob. 33.13-31. Act. 10.1, 2, 3. All which is the fruite of his free grace through the Sacrifice of Christ, Rom. 11.36. And such as harden themselves against his goodnesse, are hereby left without excuse, Rom. 2.4.5. And justly given over to wrath, as is shewn, Rom. 1.18.24. And so farr of the universall efficacy with all men. 2 In, and through the Gospel; when the spirit goeth out in discovery of the Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ: And the grace therethrough procured for, and tendred to men; the effects and prevalency with men is greater.
1 It begins to effect in all where the spirit doth so come in the Gospel, some reproofe, or convincement of the vilenesse of sinne, the emptinesse in worldly things, and the vanity of fleshly righ∣teousnesse, and also of a fulnesse, and sufficiency in Christ, and of sinne for not believing on him, and also it allureth to a love, and likement of the Doctrine of Christ, with some motions to repen∣tance, faith, and seeking the Lord, Iohn 16.7, 8, 9.10, 11. and 2.23.24. and 6.34. Act. 13.42. and 26.28. And such, con∣tinuing in his words are his Disciples, and shall know the truth, and the truth will make them free, Iohn 8.31-36. And if here they take occasion to stumble, and oppose, they may be justly de∣prived, and given up, Act. 13.39-46. and 28.23-28. 2 It sinketh to the heart, effecteth farther in many, an inward, and piercing sorrow for their former vilenesse, emptinesse, and re∣bellion with wearinesse of their old disposition, hopes, and wayes, prizings, and longings after union with Christ, and these desires accompanied with some tasts of his goodnesse, and love to his people, Zach. 12.10. Act. 2.37. Nor will he faile or be wan∣ting to these abideing, to stablish them in due season, Hosea. 6.1.2.3. Esa. 61.1, 2, 3, 4. And when thus farr brought; to de∣part from him cannot be lesse then wilfull sinning Heb. 9.26-29. And yet is this a common salvation where the Gospel is be∣lieved. 3 This discovery of grace, and operation thereof abidden in, doth yet proceed farther, enabling the heart to part with its for∣mer hopes, and purposes, and to believe in Christ: So as it re∣ceives remission of sinns; And hath the beginnings of Confidence with love of the Brethren effected; And these are believers, par∣takers of the heavenly Call, Rom. 3.24.25. and 5.1. Heb. 3.1.6. To whom that hope is now given, Heb. 14. and 9.15. And now in such a believer so excellent is the force of this ap∣pearing grace, that it worketh an effect like that mentioned, Phil. 3.7.8.9. And so in this second consideration, we see a little of the vertue, and efficacy of the Pretious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, and its prevalency with men, as the knowledge of grace therethrough is given to men; In which is discovered in the Gospel a heavenly motive, and cord of love to call, and draw to Christ.
CHAP. 10. 3. Of the vertue, operation, effectualnes, & prevalency of the pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, as it is spiritually applied to, sprink∣led on, and working in the heart of those, who through grace, are brought in to beleeve in Christ. VVHen Jesus Christ by his Spirit discovering his grace, hath brought on the heart to beleeve on him, then doth he by the same Spirit, mind them of, instruct them in, and apply to them the vertue of his pretious Blood and Sacrifice, and the rich and free grace appearing therethrough: and so with the spiritual shines of grace, and application of his Blood, and streaming in his love, doth he sprinkle and wash, and cleanse them, &c. So it was pro∣phesied, Ezek. 36.24.25. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and yee shall be clean from all your filthinesse, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you, &c. And so it is affirmed of his love to the Church, that he gave himselfe for it, that hee might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the Word, Ephes. 5.26. And it is testified of beleevers, of whom some had been notoriously evill, But ye are washed, but yee are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor. 6.11. and so they have confessed of Christ, Rev. 1.5. He hath loved us, and washed us from our sinnes in his own blood. Whence all that by faith come to him, are said to come to the blood and sprinkling, Heb. 24. And of the vertue, power, efficacy and prevalency of this pretious hlood and Sacrifice of Christ, in and with beleevers, when in their believing it is thus spiritually applied, it is that in this consideration wee have to take notice of, and it is already in some measure shewn: which may be here recalled. And so 1. It verily and indeed crucifieth the flesh, with the affections and lasts. Whence they that beleeve are said to have done it, Gal. 5.24. It breeds inward sorrow for, and loathing of ones sinfulnesse, Zach. 12.10. and takes down pride, breeding a low estimate of ones self, as the sinner and cursed one for whom Christ was made sin, and a curse, 2 Cor. 5.21. 1 Tim. 1.13.14 and it makes all world∣ly and Pharisaicall excellencies appeare contemptible, Phil. 3.
7, 8. and maketh dead to sinne, Rom. 6.4.11. and saveth from the pollutions that are in the world through Lust, 2 Pet. 1.4. & 2.20. 2. It also verily speaketh, and giveth peace, yea even the peace of God, which passeth understanding, and that will keep and guard the heart and mind in Christ, Heb. 12.24. Rom. 5.1, 2, 11. Phil. 4.7. And so freeth from the Law of sinne and death, Rom. 7.24.25. & 8.2. 3. It verily redeemeth and purchaseth from among men to God, so as i prevailes with the beleever to be the Lords; and for the Lord, and so makes him of one mind with God and Christ, Acts 20.28. Rev. 5.9. & 1 Cor. 2.16. 4. It washeth, comforteth, and reneweth the heart, and all the powers to bee conformable to Jesus Christ, Tit. 3.4.5. 2 Cor. 3.18. 5. It firmeth the heart in confidence in Christ, and expectation of his giving in Spirit, according to his Promise, to teach, comfort, preserve, and guide into all truth, Rom. 5.5.—10. Gal. 5.5. Rom. 8.32. Gal. 2.20. 6. It inflameth with love to God and Christ, 1 Pet. 1.8. 1 Joh. 4.19 and moveth love to men, 2 Cor. 5.14.15.19. and especially to brethren, 1 John 4.21. & 5.1. And in this charity it springs up joy, patience, &c. Gal. 5.22.23. 7. It fits and makes ready to beat the reproach of Christ, and to suffer for him and his people, 1 John 3 16. Rev. 12.11. 8. It saves from falling, and gets victory in temptations, 1 Cor. 15.1-14. 9. It preserves from vain glory, and makes fruitfull in good words and works to glorifie Christ, Phil. 2.1.3. and 1.20.21. John 15. 10. It breeds humble and great boldnesse to approach to the throne of Grace, and have accesse to God, Heb. 4.16. & 10.19. 1 John 2.1.2. Rom. 5.2. Eph. 2.16. 11. It fits the heart for a sweet, humble and profitable receit of spirituall visits, and entercourses of love, and a profitable use in venting them seasonably. 1 Tim. 1.13.—16. 2 Cor. 4.7.—13 & 12.1.—10. 12. It leads to a holy use of all Gods Ordinances, Creatures,
and dealings with us, Heb. 10.12-24. 1 Tim. 4.4.5. Rom. 8.32-36. 13. It prepares to enter through sufferings into glory, and sea∣leth to the same, 2 Tim. 2.11, 12. 2 Cor. 1.5. Rev.. 14.15. And these and such like are the efficacies of the spirituall appli∣cation of the pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, which effica∣cies are in beleevers, and in none else, what ever appearances any frame to themselves. CHAP. 11. 4. Of the vertue and operation of this pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, upon them that have perished in Obstinacy, and refusing to beleeve. JEsus Christ is the Son of God, and shall see of the travell of his soule, and so the fruit of his pretious Blood and Sacrifice, even upon them that would none of him: The Lord Jehovah having in acceptation of his sacrifice given over all into his hands and set his delight on him, so as all shall submit; and those that will not wil∣lingly, shall yet be subdued to acknowledge him Lord, to the glory of God, when also the vertue of his Blood and Sacrifice shall re∣flect on them (like the heat of the Sunne on sore eyes) to afflict them: So as all his enemies shal be found liers, and made his foot∣stool, Isai. 53.11, 12. Phil. 2.10, 11. Deut. 33.29. Psal. 110.1. And this may be evidenced 1. By the greatnesse of the grace that was procured for them by this pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, and received for them into his hands, to dispense; as remission of sins, justification, eternall redemption, and life, Rom. 3.24. & 5.18. 1 Ioh. 5.10, 11. And that so verily, that in refusing, they are by the Spirit that discovered grace through the vertue of this Sacrifice, said Iona 2.8. to forsake their own mercies, Ma. 16.26. to lose their own souls, 2 Pet. 2.1. to bring upon themselves swift destruction. It was great grace at first to make man in the Image of God, and a world of creatures for him, and to put him in Paradice, and to give him a tree of Life, &c, and to depart herefrom, and sin against it, a great transgression.
But man fallen, to worke redemption for him in such a way, and therethrough to extend mercy, and meanes to win him in to partake of it, was much greater grace; and so greater transgressi∣on to turn from it, and abuse the same, and refuse the offers of it. These are the ungodly indeed in a high degree, 2 Pet. 2.1. Iude 4.5. 2 By the greatnes of the wrath this sin provoketh, & fire it kin∣dleth: It did deserve death, and provoke wrath, when man first sinned, & fell from God; but that wrath God executed on his Son in our nature, and herein dying for our sinnes, and rising for our justification, and offering himselfe a Sacrifice to God for us, hath put away sinne, and abolished death, and satisfied justice, and so hath appeased that wrath, and quenched that fire, 2 Cor. 5, 19.21. Iohn 1.29. Heb. 1.3. & 9.26. 1 John 3.5. 2 Tim. 1.10. Col. 2.14. 1 John 2.2. It doth deserve death, and provoke wrath, and kindle a fire in judgments on men, that by the mercies & means, by vertue of the Sacrifice of Christ procured for, & extended to them men do not seek God, & by repentance & faith come in to him, to live to him, but still go on after their own lusts, chosing their own wayes, and living to themselves, notwithstanding all his goodnesse extended through Christ to them, to lead them to repentance, Act. 14.17. & 17.26-31. Rom. 2.4, 5. But this wrath is appease∣able, and this fire quenchable. And for such as in the day of their visitation, when Spirit comes forth in the meanes, doe receive his reproofes, and obey his call, and are prevailed with to belief of his Testimony, repentance of their evils, and faith in his goodnesse, and sabmission to him, to live to him; to such this wrath also is ap∣peased, and fire quenching, and will be altogether, Acts 10.43. Rom 3.25. & 5.1, 2. Isai. 54.1-10: in due season: But when God and Christ by his Spirit in the means used, and through the redempti∣on and purgation wrought by Christ, hath been visiting, en∣lightning, moving at their hearts, and striving with them, to ef∣fect repentance and faith in them, and so to bring them to himself; and they after the knowledge of the truth refuse, resist, or depart from it willingly, and will none of God, none of Christ, will not be brought in to him this way, to have all their life and confidence in his grace, and guidance by it; but persist in their wilfull refu∣sall, or Apostasie, till he leave striving, and give them up to their
own lusts, and Satan: This deserveth & kindleth such wrath, as wil not be appeased, and such a fire as will not be quenched, Gen. 6; 3: Prov. 1.23, 24, &c. Psal. 81.11. Ezek. 24.13. Matth. 23.37, 38. Heb. 6.4, 5.2 Pet. 2. Jude totū. And the execution of this is called, The wrath to come. Luke 3.7. 1 Thes. 1.10. fire unquenchable, Luke 3.17. Mark. 9.48. hell fire, Matth. 18.9. Mark 9.47. the second death, Rev. 20.14. 3 By the greatnesse and inexcuseable folly, rebellion and filthi∣nesse of this sinne, it being an under-valuing, neglect, and refusall of so great salvation and redemption first obtained, and then first preached by the Lord himselfe; yea, a denying him that bought them, and so a treading under foot the Sonne of God, Heb. 2.3. 2 Pet. 2.1. Heb. 10.29. a hardening the heart against the mercies and meanes that through the pretious Blood & Sacrifice of Christ was procnred for, and extended to them, to lead them to repen∣tance, and so counting the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, Rom. 2.5. Heb. 10.29. a turning from him that speakes from hea∣ven and so resisting and offering despite to the Spirit of grace that strove with them to bring them to God, Heb. 12.25 & 10.29. Act. 7.51. In a word, by their preferring darknesse before light, when light came, John 3.19. exalting their own wisdom, workes, and choyce, and objecting, and taking offence at the means, Do∣ctrine, and Spirit of Grace, and turning from it after it hath so farre been extended to them; they crucifie again, make of no ac∣count and efficacy to themselves the Sonne of God, and put him to an open shame, Heb. 6.6. A great ingratitude, and fearfull re∣bellion against so great and gracious a God and Saviour, and Spi∣rit, and so reall an offer and tender, Psalm 81.11. Great folly and madnesse to refuse so great and reall mercy and salvation and alto∣gether excuselesse, they cannot say we fell and were loft in Adam, & no redemptiō was wrought for us, wherby we might have been saved Our Fathers have eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge;Ezek. 18.2. Rom. 5.12 18. for the later part of the plea is false, & God wil punish it: for though they were lost in Adam, and could no way redeeme themselves, yet in Christ redemption was again wrought for them: Nor can they say this mercy was altogether hidd, and no meanes used towards them, that they might have sought, and found him, Act. 14.17. and 17.26. nor will this pleasure; we had in our selves no will or power to choose lyfe; For
though it was not in them, yet it was in him; And his spirit by which he tendred grace wanted not power, Mich. 2.7. He doth not looke to gather where he hath not sowne, though wicked Servants so say; But on his examination they will be dumb, Mat. 25.26. and 22.12. Sinnes of ignorance, and weaknesse, to which through the fall men are necessitated, and for which yet there is a remedy, though they are directly a∣gainst the Father, and indirectly against the Sonne, and holy spirit: sinnes against the meanes procured by Christ, and ex∣tended through him to lead to repentance, and faith, and so a∣gainst ordinary light, warnings, and motions; are against the Father, and directly against the Sonne, yet all manner of these sorts of sinne shall be forgiven unto men, but the willfull and rebellious sinning in refusing, and opposing the grace it selfe in Christ, and evidenced by the spirit, after light obstinately refu∣sing to have all life in, and guidance by that grace the spirit dis∣covers in Christ; But blaspheming the same: This sinning is directly against the Father, and the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost, and shall never be forgiven, Mat. 12.31. Marke 3.28.29. 4 By the evilnesse, and remedilesnesse of the state, and con∣dition, such sinning throwes these men into; And that may be seene in two things. 1 That whereas they were once dead through Adam; and a ransome was given for them by Christ, and life procured for them, and this set forth in the Gospel, and in the meanes ten∣dred to them with some quickning motions of the spirit, and hope of life, there being no other meanes or Sacrifice; They having wilfully cast aside this, have rent themselves out of this booke of life, renounced this life that was set in hope before them, and are become Trees twice dead, and pluckt up by the rootes, so as there is no more hope for them, Jude 12. 2 That whereas; when they were fallen in Adam, though truth and Justice pleaded for their Death; yet mercy was for them, and found out a ransome in which, truth, and justice did meete, and joyne with mercy nor their good; And though Ju∣stice might have risen against them for their strayings in igno∣rance, and unbeliefe; yet compassion, and mercy had patience,
and forbearance to waite for them, but now by his spirit he hath been striving with them, and they will none of Christ, but harden themselves against him, and oppose, and offer wrong, and violence to Christ, and his word, and people; even mercy also with Justice, and truth is turned against them; not that there is any change in God, but they have put themselves into such a condition, that his mercy becomes crosse to them, the light is pleasant to the eye, and that it troubles the sore eye, the change is in the eye, not in the light, so Gods love, and mercy is the same for ever; His delight is in his Sonne, and his plea∣sure in his people made one with his Sonne: yea, so great that when men harden their hearts against his Sonne, the Gospel, and spirit of his Sonne, and turne to oprresse those that are ves∣sels of mercy; The more he loves his Sonne, and the dearer his people are to him; the more doth his mercy move him to plead their cause, and plague their enemies, and so he smote Egypt, overthrew Pharoh, and his Host in the sea, smote great and mighty Kings, &c. For his mercy endureth for ever, Psal. 136.10.20. Oh heavy when mercy stands against them! 5 By the greatnesse of torments, and punishments to be ex∣ecuted on such sinners; which as the Scriptures sets it forth, is very terrible; for it is the same that at first was prepared for the Divell, and his Angels, who sinned freely, and without a Tempter, or any cause, Iude 6. Mat. 25.41. So it appeares that. 1 The Death on mankind for the first transgression was an Allenation from God, a Death in sinne, and a Death in punish∣ments, and torments due to sinnings against the grace of God manifested in the Creation: And had there been no remedy, or prevention, this death and punishment would have been e∣ternall; for men in particular suffering it, could never have o∣vercome it to get out of it (only by reason of Gods preventing mercy, in keepeing man from cating of that Tree of life, of which, if he had eaten, his Body had been immortall, and so capeable of eternall sufferings) He should suffer eternally in his soalc; And his body with the sting, and povson of sinn, and curse should be alwayes suffering till it turned to rottennesse, and so to dust againe; and this is the first death, which came
on all men at first, Gen. 2.17. and 3.19. And this Jesus Christ hath in dying for our sinnes, and riseing for our Justification as the publike person overcome, 2 Tim. 1.10. and obtained of his Father power to ease men in this life of so much paines of this mortalilty as he pleaseth, and to raise them all from this first Death at the last, 1 Cor. 15.21.22. 2 The Death or punishments on men for sinning against the grace of redemption, in hardening themselves against the Pati∣ence and bounty of God, and meanes through Christ procured, to leade them to repentance, and so for their turning herefrom, and going after their own wayes; are afflictions, and troubles on soule, and body, name, and estate, having some mixtures of mrcy, and being to hide pride from man, and force them to re∣pentance, &c. Leuit. 26. Deut. 28. Iob 33. And these are called, wrath, Judgements, punishments, corrections, out of which yet there is a way, and meane of escape, Iob 33. Heb. 1.12. Esa. 27.4.5. 3 But the Death and torment for these that have persisted in in resisting, the spirit in the meanes, and refusing this life in Christ, and to have him raigne over them, till they be given o∣ver to satan is more terrible, and is eternall, on soule, and bo∣dy raised and made immortad, and so capeable of eternall suf∣fering; And this is called the second death; Hell fire, The lake of fire, unquenchable fire, and even that which was at first prepared for the Divell, and his Angels, into which all these shall goe, who by their wilfull persisting in rebellion a∣gainst the truth, and walking in lyes, and murthers become of the wicked one, the Children of the Divell, and the seed of the Serpent. And so shall share of the same punishment, 1 Iohn 3.12. Iohn 8.41.44. Mat. 25.41. onely in the sting and tor∣menting worme, that never dyeth, but alwayes tormenteth, there is now this more to these miserable men, then to the Di∣vels; The remembrance of a Remedy since their first fall, which they have refused, which will torment exceedingly, but that cannot be in the Divels torment. 6 And yet there is one thing more, in which appeareth the ef∣fectualnesse of the Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, on these rebel∣lious refusers, and that proveth the appearance of the same, to
be in all these 5. forementioned poynts; And that is the judge∣ment and condemnation of these Rebe's in that. 1 The Lord Jesus Christ that shed his Blood, and offered this Sacrifice, shall even by vertue thereof be their Judge, even he that dyed, and rose, and revived for them, to be their Lord, Rom. 1.4 9.12. he that bought them, 2 Pet. 2.1. even he shall be their Judge, and they shall appeare before his judgement sear, 2 Cor. 5.10. yea even because he dyed for them, God hath exalted him, and they shall come before him to acknow∣ledge him Lord, by whom they might have been saved, and shall be judged righteously, Phil. 2.10.11. Esa. 45.23. And of this God hath given assurance, and offered faith to all men in that he raised him from the Dead, Act. 17.31. And this is one efficacy of his Sacrifice on such as refused him (in whom they might have enjoyed the comfortable efficacies) that they shall acknowledge him Lord, and be judged by him, Rom. 2.16. 2 Tim. 4.1. And they shall yeeld it right, it should be so. 2 That which shall be layd to their charge in this Judge∣ment, and that by which their sinnes shall be evidenced, and a∣gravated against them, their sinnes that will be layd to their charge will be their ignorance of God, and not obeying his Gospel, 2 Thes. 2.8. Their unbeliefe with all the fruits there∣of, Iohn 16.8.9.10. Their Impenitency, and not profiting by, but hardening their hearts against the meanes by the Sacrifice of Christ procured, and extended, to leade them to repentance, Rom. 2.4.5. Their evill thoughts, and hard speeches of him, and his goodnesse, in his word, wayes, people, Iude 15. and so for every Idle word, and all their Idolatries, and unmerciful∣nesse, and ungodly deeds, which through their disobedience to his goodnesse they have runn into, Iude 15. Mat. 12.36. yea every secret thing shall then be manifest: That by which the vilenesse of their sinnes, and justnesse of their Judgement shall be evidenced, will be the put chase Christ hath made for them, and they denyed him that so dearly bought them, 2 Pet. 2.1. The mercy extended to them, against which they har∣dened themselves, Rom. 2.5. And all the meanes, yea even the Gospel sent to move them to seeke the Lord, Mat. 11.16-24.
yea the very blood and Sacrifice of Christ, by which all the residue was procured for them, which they have contemned, Heb. 10.29. yea and the Spirit of grace, with all his spirituall hints of light, motions, reproofs, and allurements which they have despi∣sed, Heb. 10.29. Prov. 1.24.25, &c. All which will then appear as aggravations of their sinne and judgement; and this is another ef∣ficacy of the blood and Sacrifice of Christ, on such as have refused him, that when the day of grace is past, it will occasion the evi∣dencing and aggravation of their sin and judgement. 3. The order, rule, law, or medium, by and according to which the judgement shall proceed, and that is the Gospel; in which Christ had before been set forth a saviour for them, the propitia∣tion for their sinnes, and full of Spirit to send forth, and so inviting them to repentance and faith, with assurance of renovation, remis∣sion, and life on believing, and warning that the issue of all o∣ther wayes would be death. This Gospel, as it is the word which Christ and his Apostles spake; so such is the truth and verity of it, that even the rejectors thereof; it shall judge, and hee shall judge them by and according to it, Joh. 12.47.48 49. Rom. 2.16. And this is another efficacie of the pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ on such as have rebelliously refused it; that by the declaration or word thereof, and according to that declaration shall be the judg∣ment, Rom. 1.1.18.20. & 10.18. John 15.22. 4. That which shall convince of sin, and set home the sentence of sinne, and of judgement to the heart, and so kindle the fire that never shall be quenched; is even the same Spirit of the Lord, which by vertue of his Death, Resurrection, and Sacrifice, he in his ascension (Psal. 68.18.) received; and in the day of grace was striving with them. Gen. 6.3. to have convinced them, and began to kindle a fire that thē would have cōsumed nothing but their flesh∣ly affections and lusts, Isa. 40.7. their carnall wisdome and confi∣dence, and then have healed them and given them life, Pro. 1.23.24 but they would none of his reproofes, but quenched this heat, and resisted this Spirit, till he left striting with them. But now will this holy and Almighty Spirit from the Lord that bought them, return again upon them, and contince them of sinne, because they have not beleeved on Christ &c. John 16.8, 9 10. and so set home the sentence to their heart, that they cannotavoid it; and by his
Almighty breathing word, like a stream of Brimstone, kindle that fire that never shall be quenched, Isa. 30.33. And this is another efficacy of the Sacrifice of Christ on such as have rebelliously re∣fused him; that the Spirit, he, by vertue of his Sacrifice received to send forth to call men, shal yet set home the sentence even on those that rejected him. Oh then in that day, though to their woe, they shall see and confesse (what ever before they thought, or others told them) that Christ died for them, though they perish; that Christ bought them, though they have denied him; that hee had wrought re∣demption for them, though they have sold themselves again to va∣nity; that there was mercies for them in him, though they forsook them; that he strove with them, to win them to him, though they resisted him; that his word and wayes were good, though they beleeved not: And now to behold him that so dearly bought them, and graciously cal'd them, and they rewarded him with hatred for his love, to come in fury to judge them, and to perceive the Blood and Sacrifice that once would have spoken peace to them, to rise up against them; the Gospel that once declared good tidings to them from the verity of it, to bee a condemning word to them; mercy that once waited for them, to be now turned against them; the holy Spirit that was once moving in them to draw them from sinne to God, to bee now sentencing them under sinne, and unto death: O what a terrour will this be! And how will the remem∣brance of the redemption wrought by Christ, the mercy once shewn, and the doore to life once opened, through which they might have been saved, now adde to the terrour, and the remem∣brance of all the vanities, false Doctrines, and humane applause, for which they have turned aside, will but encrease the vexation, and (now while they see those that embraced and followed Christ whom they despised, to goe into the joy of their Lord, into eternall life) to see their own sin, and judgement in the height, and the ter∣rible presence of the Lord driving them into the lake of fire that burneth ever, and out of which there is no escape! Oh how great this terror! yea how easelesse, how tormenting, how intollerable, unavoidable, and remedilesse! How endlesse will the eternall suffe∣ring in that fire be, when the least drops of those mercifull effects of the Sacrifice, that are in this day tendered, and so refused, will
not be vouchsafed; nothing then but biting, gnawings, tor∣ments in every part of soule and body? Now consider this yee that forget God, Psal. 50.22. lest he teare you in peeces, and there be none to deliver. Those, that know and beleeve all these forementioned efficacies of the pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, they know also this terror of the Lord, & they are perswaded and recōciled to God, in beliefe of the reconciliation God hath wrought in Christ for the world, and they in witnessing the same, doe perswade and beseech others now in this day of grace, to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5.10, 11, 19, 20. & 6.1.2. in which the comfortable efficacies will be found. CHAP. 12. The usefulnesse of this pretious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, known and beleevingly remembred. THat we may have the better understanding of this, it is also to be understood, 1. Of what the Proposition is. 2. Of what knowing is here meant. 3. Of what faith it is here to be under∣stood. 4. What remembrance is here meant. And 5. what is meant by usefulnesse; that in all wee may conceive according to Scripture sense. First, for the proposition, It is of the pretious Blood and Sacri∣fice of Christ, and that is to be understood both of it selfe primely; and of the Doctrine of the Gospel in which it is set forth instru∣mentally: and that as is before shewn; concerning 1. The manifold sense in which those tearms are used in Scrip∣ture, as for his Death, His resurnection, His Presentation and of∣fering to God, The prevalency with God, the spirituall applicati∣on to believers, and prevalency in them; and the rich love of God, and satisfaction to God, and conscience and Spirit appearing and streaming there through, as is shewn Chap. 2. 2. The ends of this pretious Blood and Sacrifice, and that in respect of Christ, according to his double Mission into the world, and his double businesse in leaving the world; and in respect of mankind according to the double misery and enmity against God
they were fallen into. And in respect of the Church according to the double need she hath of Christ; & in all of them, the ends of the shedding his bloud, the end of his offering his sacrifice with the vertue of his bloud to God, The ends of the discovery and spirituall application of it to men, as is shewn Chap. 3. and 4. 3 The necessity of this pretious Bloud and Sacrifice, both of his dying, and resurrection; and of his presentation and offering it to God, and of his spirituall discovery, and application to men, as is shewn Chap. 5. and enlarged by some consideration of the Law, Chap. 6. 4 The excellency and dignity of this pretious Bloud and Sacri∣fice, and that in the Sacrifice it self, in respect of the Priest, the Sa∣crifice, the Altar: In the Declaration, in respect of the three Wit∣nesses, the Spirit, the Water, the Bloud: In the abundant grace, and the great hope appearing therein, as is shewn Chap. 7. 5 The vertue, operation, and prevalencie of this pretious Bloud, and Sacrifice of Christ, as it was offered to God, as is shewn Chap. 8. And as through that prevalency with God, mercy is shewn to men, as is shewn Chap. 9. And as it is spiritually applyed to the heart of Believers, as is shewn Chap. 10. And as it will be laid to the charge of such as have rejected it, as is shewn Chap. 11. And all this is to be understood about the pretious Bloud and Sa∣crifice of Christ, and in the Doctrine of Christ; and so is the meaning of the Proposition. 2 For the knowledge, or knowing here meant, and of which the Scripture meaneth, when it speakes of the knowledge, and know∣ing of Christ, which he giveth to men; 1 It is not that knowledge, or knowing which is naturall, Rom: 3.10. and 11.34. Truth it is, that as God through Christ, and for his sake for a time preserveth the naturall life of man; so through Christ, and for his sake, he giveth, and preserveth unto men for the time of this naturall life, their naturall understanding, reason, judg∣mentaind conception, Job 35.11. Rom. 1.32. By which they may learne and understand some things in the workes of God, Job. 36 24, 25. And some things in the Narration, or History of the Scriptures, or Word of God, Rom: 2.17.21. Luke 10.26, 27. And it
is also true, that God hath imprinted and manifested his wisdome, even some testimonies of his being and goodnesse in his workes of Creation and Providence, Psalm. 19.1-6. Act. 14.17. Rom: 1.19, 20. and 2.4. And in the Scriptures or Word of God hath set forth Christ the wisdome of God, what he hath done, what he is, and what he will do, and doth, 1 Cor. 1.24, Io. 5.39, 46. Rom: 4.23.25. And yet this is also true, that in respect of all men that are but na∣turall, and have but their naturall life and understanding, though preserved in mercy for Christs sake; This light shineth in darknesse and the darknesse comprehendeth it not. Iohn 1.5. Men by their na∣turall wisdome do not find out, or attain to know God in the wis∣dome of God set forth in the bookes of Creatures, or Scriptures, 1 Cor: 1.21. The naturall man cannot know the things of the Spi∣rit of God, which he teacheth concerning the things of Christ, be∣cause they are spiritually discerned, 1 Cor: 2.14. So that the natu∣rall man, with all his naturall powers and parts, cannot attaine the right knowledge of the things of God in Christ, by all his search, either in the Workes of God, or in the Word of God, Eccles. 10.15. 2 It is not that knowledge which is both naturall, and artificial, attained by knowledge of Arts, in use of Arts, and artificiall helps, whence that interrogation, & challenge, Isa 33. where is the Scribe? &c. A truth it is, that through Christ, and for his sake, God blesseth mens industly in study of Letters, Tongues, Arts, and Sciences, that are naturall and honest; and also their honest industry in use and exercise thereof; So as many thereby become very knowing, wise, prudent, and skilfull Orators and Disputers: In study of the works of God, they may attain excellent knowledge about the va∣riety of soyles and seasons, the nature of Beasts, Birds, Plants, the nature, dispontion, and manners of men, and so be very skilfull for husbandry, trading, and merchandize, Government of Common∣weales,Isa. 3.1.4. Lawes, Warre, Physick, &c. And this is a great mercy to a Common-wealth and a correction to want them: And in study of the Scriptures, such may attain excellent knowledge, for transla∣tion of Tongus, understanding and explicating Histories, discer∣ning of Times and some Proprecies, and of the scope and circum∣stances of places, and etyologie of words, which is a mercy to the Nation where they live (while they keep their bounds;) yea, and
to the Churches also, Matth. 2.5, 6. Luke 12.54,—57, Isa 3.1,—4. But yet this is also true, that the verity, excellency, depth, pretious∣nesse, enjoyment, and efficacy of the things of God in Christ, these Rabbies and Princes of the World for wisdome and understand∣ing, cannot by this wisdome find out, discern, approve, or receive, though they reade, and study the words in which it is exprest; yet in those words it is hidden from them, and they by their wisdome in all their searching cannot finde out this mysterious wisdome of God in Christ, 1 Cor: 1 20.21. and 2.7, 8, 14. Matth. 11.25. Luke 10.21. So as naturall and artificiall knowledge and wisdome can∣not reach, or attaine the right knowledge of the things of God in Christ, Prov. 30.2, 3, 4. So that the knowledge, or knowing here spoke of, is not naturall or artificiall, but supernaturall, as shall be shewn anon. 3 Neither yet is this such a knowledge, or knowing, of which, nature is no way capable of the receit of it, or such as doth destroy the naturall or artificiall knowledge, or as if they could no way consist, and be together in the same subject, Act. 18.24, 28. and 7.22, 23, Heb. 11.24, 25. The body or humane nature of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, neither did, nor could raise it self; yet was it capable of being raised, and was by the Divine Power not destroyed, but rai∣sed; And yet the resurrection, though it was of the humane nature, yet it was not at all by the humane, but by the divine nature, the ve∣ry Spirit and Power of God, that not the divine, but the humane nature was raised, Act. 2.23, 24, 30, 31. Rom: 4.24. and 6.4. The eyes of blind Bartemeus could by no naturall meanes attain to see, but they were capable of receiving sight by the guift of God, Mark 10.46. — 52. And for the better understanding this businesse, wee may consider, that it is appointed to men once to dye, Heb. 9.27. Eccles. 9.10. and when they do dye, and give up the Ghost, then all their naturall and artificiall knowledge and wisdome dyes together with them; And as they shall be one day raised again by the Spirit and power of Christ; so then the knowledge they have, shall not be naturall or artificiall, but only that which they shall have from the power of God that raised them, 1 Cor. 13.11, 12. And the members of Christ by vertue of their union with him, shall have all knowledge tending to happinesse from him by the divine nature filling them with light, and leading both soule and body, 1 Iohn 3.2.
So that they shall then know perfectly and see, as they are seen, and know as they are known; But here in this life as their bodies, so their naturall powers are spiritually humbled and mortified, that they may in the regeneration be quickned by,Rom 8.10 11, 12.23. and made service∣able to the Spirit, not annihilated, or slain; nor is the man perfect∣ly, and totally made alive in the regeneration here wrought, nor will be, till perfectly and totally dead, in respect of all naturall life; but the Spirit is alive for Righteousnesse sake, 1 Cor: 13.9. And the Spirit quickneth also the mortall body, and so he may as pleaseth him, The naturall powers and faculties, for such service as he plea∣seth:1 Cor. 1.29. The to tall redemption of the body, being yet waited for, our knowledge yet imperfect; so then, though neither natural, nor artificiall knowledge, bee the knowledge of spirituall things, nor doth, nor can attain it; yet the spirituall knowledge may consist, and be together with them in the same subject, and having humbled and slaine the pride of them, may make such use of them in some services as the Spirit pleaseth; and as it is a punishment or corre∣ction during this life, to have the body by Diseases disabled from service, and tormented with pain, Deut. 28.28. so is it to have the naturall reason and understanding made uselesse, or distracted; So that this knowledge, or knowing here meant, is not such as slaies, or makes the other altogether uselesse: As for that doting upon na∣turall or artificiall knowledge, the humane wisdome, or the wis∣dome of the Rabbies and Prince; of this world, by which many so magnifie it, as the only, or necessary, or at least the best mean, to find out and discover the things of God: It is a grosse and Idola∣trous conceit, and God hath executed judgment on that Idoll, and stained the pride of that glory, and so will do still, in that the wis∣dome of God is hidden from them, Matth. 11.25. Luke 10.21. and they know it not, 1 Cor. 2.7, 8 14. And few of them are called to it, 1 Cor. 1.26. And those that are, have their former wisdome be∣fooled, and they abased in the acknowledgment of the vanity of it, before they receive the spirituall wisdome, 1 Cor. 1.19, 20. And the truth is, this magnifying of humane wisdome and knowledge, is the very enmity of Christ, and the very Spirit of Antichrist, Mat. 15.4.9. 2 Thes. 2.4. that moves to the building of Babell to Idola∣try or Superstition, to be as God, in the Temple of God, to appoint Doctrines, Lawes, Officers, and to persecute the Truth, and the Children of the Truth: As for that saying, that this naturall and
artificiall knowledge, this humane learning and wisdome, is an Handmaid to Divinity: Though this be but the Doctrine of men, and no where affirmed in the Word of God, yet if it be rightly un∣derstood, it might by collection appear agreeable thereto; for if it should be meant an handmaid or help to find out, and attain Divi∣nity, that were rather to be a Mother then a handmaid, and this is before proved false: And if any object, in men sanctified, it may, that is also false, Job. 11.7, 8, 9. Prov. 30.2, 3, 4. He that hath seeing eyes will not be befooled, to take a candle to find out the Sun; And again, if by handmaid should be meant a guide, and help, to limit, order, and better, the teaching of the Spirit, the divine light, know∣ledge, and motions of grace, that they may be more profitable and effectuall; this is rather to be a Mistis then a Handmaid, and if suffered in this, it would soone corrupt from the simplicity of Christ. Prov. 30.22, 23. And against this the Apostle hath protested, 1 Cor. 2.1, 4, 5. But if by a handmaid, bee meant a handmaid indeed, that which is taken of its Throne, and submitted to Divinity, even to the Divine Spirit, and grace of Christ, to use as a Servant accor∣ding to its pleasure, and divine wisdome, and motion, for translating etymologizing, and discanting on words, for analyzing places, com∣paring places, using Similies, &c. Then if keeping the servants place is usefull, as grace leads to the use of it; And in this sence I con∣ceive some godly men have used this saying, and where it is so used it may be included in this saying, Psalm. 103. Blesse the Lord, O my soule, and all that is within me blesse his holy Name. 4 But the knowledge, or knowing here meant is supernaturall, spirituall, and divine, and that appeares in three things that are to∣gether in this knowledge, though distinct, yet never separate in this knowledge, or knowing. First, that the Giver or Teacher of this knowledge, is the holy Spirit, even God in Christ, and the Spirit proceedin from both, Prov. 2.6. For the Lord giveth wisdome, and out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding, Isa 48.17. I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, Isa 54.13. All my children shall be taught of the Lord, Iohn 16.23. When the Spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth, and this is in a heavenly manner, as the Scripture shewes. 1 By a divine, not bodily, but spirituall light, shine, or revelation,
in unbaring or manifesting to the soul, or mind, the things of Christ, Heb. 10.32. In which after yee were illuminated, 2 Cor. 4.6. hath shined in our hearts, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, Math 16.17. Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven, 1 Cor. 2.10. God hath revealed to us by his Spirit. 2. By a divine infusion, or inspiration to the heart of a Spiritu∣all streame, motion, or evidence and perswasion of the truth and goodnesse of that of Christ discovered, Isai. 44.3. I will powre my Spirit upon thy seed. Job 32.8. The inspiration of the Almigty giveth them understanding. Isai. 30.21. Thine eares shall heare a word behind thee, saying, This is the way. Isai. 50.4. The Lord hath given mee the tongue of the learned (saith Christ) that I should know how to speak a word in season. Isai. 52.6. They shal know in that day, that I am he that doe speak, behold it is I. 3. By a Divine power or Spirituall strength, so as he causeth the blind to see, and the deafe to heare, Isai. 29.18. and openeth the heart to attend, Act. 16.14. whence he is called, The finger of the Lord, &c. Mat. 12.28. Such is the Teacher, and teaching, by which this knowledge is attained. Secondly, the Object of this knowledge, That which the holy spirit teacheth, and glorifieth in teaching, is Christ and the things of Christ, as the verity, ends, necessity, excellency, and vertue of Christ and his pretious Blood and Sacrifice, the infinitenesse and freenesse of Gods love appearing therethrough, and the promises and hope given therein; yea Christ the wisdome of God, and the power of God, and wisdome, &c. to us, 1 Cor. 1.24.30. John 16.14. He shall glorifie me, for he shall take of mine, and shall shew unto you. John 15.26. he shall testifie of me, John 14.26. hee shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. And so 2 Cor. 3.18. & 4.6. Thirdly. the manner of knowing is likewise spirituall, and that is both, 1. By that new light, disposition, and spirit he hath put in the heart, which is as a new and spiritual eye, to see spirituall things, which is not by a humane discourse, collecting one thing from a∣nother, judging to know unseen causes from some seen and sensible effects, like humane wisdome, and the spirit of the world; but spi∣rituall
discerning in the very light, and of the very evidence of the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.12.16. so as they may prove the effects sound from their knowledge of the cause, 1 John 4.19. So John 1.14. We beheld his glory, the glory of the onely begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, Psal. 36.9. In thy light we shall see light. And in this, as no mans humane wisdome and learning doth further his discerning, so no mans ignorance, or want thereof, shall hinder, Psal. 119.130. The entrance of thy word giveth light, and giveth understanding to the simple. Matth. 11.25. Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast tevealed them unto Babes. 1 John 5.20. we know that the Sonne of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that wee may know him that is true. 2. By a certain inward experience of the beauty, excellency, and sweet savour of the things known; a pleasing delightfull, and reviving tast and savour, 2 Cor. 2.14 15.16. manifesteth the sa∣vour of his knowledge, a sweet savour of Christ, a savour of life unto life, Phil. 3.8. For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, for whom I have suffered the losse of all things, and do count them but Dung, that I may win Christ 1 Pet. 2.3. If yee have tasted that the Lord is gracious, to whom coming, &c. And this is the know∣ledge here meant: A supernaturall and spirituall knowledge of Christ, and the things of Christ taught by the Spirit of Christ, with light, motion and power, giving an understanding to discern, and heart to sa∣vour the things knowne. In which knowledge as there are di∣vers degrees: so some are but Babes and Novices in it, and so in respect of some others, unlearned and unskilfull in it: others more skilfull; yea some Fathers, and very stable. And this is the knowledge the Spirit in the Scripture speaketh of when it speak∣eth of the things of Christ and his Spirit. 1 Cor. 2.1.—15. 1 Tim. 3.6. Heb. 5.12.13.14. 2 Pet. 3.16. which whoso wanteth alto∣gether, whomsoever he hath heard preach the Gospel, what books soever he hath read, and what knowledge soever he hath attained in the Scriptures, what degree, what office, or profession soever he hath; yet he hath not seen the image of the Father, nor heard his voyce, Heb. 1.3. John 1.14. & 5 37.38. &c. And so knoweth not the Father nor the Son, nor the things of the Spirit, nor such as
are born of the Spirit, 1 John. 3.1. John 15.21. 1 Cor. 2.12.14.15.16. And so the knowing here meant is supernaturall, spirituall, and experimentall, bee it little or much, more or lesse, and so yet wavering or stable. CHAP. 13. 3. Of what Faith it is here to be understood, and 4. of what re∣membrance. 3. FOr the Faith here meant, it is a Divine and Spirituall faith: for the better understanding whereof, these seaven things may be considered about it. 1. The object of it. 2. The Mover or Worker of it. 3. The nature and act of it. 4. The motion in, and of it. 5. The subject in which it is, and immediate instruments in, and with which it moveth and worketh. 6. The power, life, or principle in in it. 7. The onenesse of it in diversity of the degrees, and acts. 1. For the object that the eye of this Faith is set on, & on which it looketh, to which it runneth, on which it leaneth and resteth; This object is Divine, and but one, even God. In the Lord put I my trust, Psal. 7.1. and 11, 1. and 121.1. and 123.1. and 9.10. Cant. 1.4. Yet this object is considerable in a threefold respect, viz. 1. In respect of the most inmost, and utmost object, for re∣fuge, foundation, and fountain of all help, safety and satisfying, and that is God himselfe, even the divine Nature in his infinite wisdome, power, mercy love, truth, &c. Psal. 42. God our refuge and strength. &c. Psal. 18.2. Rock, Fortresse, Deliverer, &c. Psal. 27.1. Light and salvation even God, Rom. 4.24. that raised up Je∣sus Christ our Lord from the dead, 2 Cor. 1.9.10. which raised the dead, who delivered, &c. and doth deliver, &c, 1 Pet. 1.21. By whom we beleeved. 1.5.5. trusteth in God, Heb. 2, 13. In respect of the inmost and absolute Medium, through which this faith discerneth, &c. commeth to, and fasteneth on God, and without which there can bee no discerning of, or comming in to God, or closing with him at all. And this inmost and absolute mediate object, is Jesus Christ the Sonne of God, made Man of the Seed of Abraham and David, who is the Saviour of the world,
and the Head and Husband of the Church, Rom. 1.3.4. 1 Joh. 4.14. John 4.42. Eph. 5.32. and 1.22.23. Christ saith, Iohn 14.6. I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no man commeth to the Father but by me. Eph. 2.18. Through him we have both an accesse by one Spirit unto the Father, Iohn 1.7. that through him all might beleeve, 2 Cor. 3.4. Such trust have we through Christ to God∣ward. Whence also this faith is called, Col. 1.4. and 2.5. faith in Christ: and Iohn 3.15. believing in him. And so Christ Jesus is object of this faith; and that 1. In respect of what he hath done for us, in dying for our sins, and rising for our justification, and offering up himselfe a Sacrifice and ransome to God, Rom. 4.25. 1 Tim. 2.6. 2. In respect of what he is (through that hee hath done) be∣come for us; as namely, that nee is (Eph. 2.14.) our Peace, 1 Iohn 2.2. the propitiation for our sinnes, 1 Cor 1.30. wisdome, righte∣ousnesse, sanctification, and redemption. Rom. 1.3. our Lord and Saviour. 3. In respect also of what (through that he hath done, and is be∣come for us) he now doth in heaven for us; and that is, Heb. 9.24. appeare in the presence of God for us. And Heb. 7.25. ever liveth to make intercession for us. And so Heb. 9 14.15. 4. In respect of what he will doe in and for all such as through grace beleeving in him, accept that he hath done, Rom. 5.11. and depend on him according to that he is and doth, for that he will do in and for them; as namely, that he will support and uphold them, Isai. 43.1, 2. and cause all to work together for good to them, Rom. 8.28. and send forth his Spirit from the Father to them, to beare witnesse of him to, and through them, Iohn 15.26.27. to mind them of his words, and teach them all things, Iohn 14.26. to take of the things of Christ, and shew to them, and so glorifie him to them, and thereby comfort them, and lead them into all truth, Iohn 14.14 16. & 16.13.14.15. to make them fruitfull in their ministration, Iohn 15.5.16. convincing the world, Iohn 16.7 8, 9 10. calling in to Christ, 2 Cor. 2.14-16. and 3.3. and answering their enemies, Matth 10.20. and to sanctifie and preserve them to the inheri∣tance, 1 Thess. 5.24. And thus is Jesus Christ the next and neerest object, and the onely absolute and inmost Medium, through which
this faith fasteneth upon God, or the Divine Nature, which is the most inmost and outmost object. Thirdly, in respect of the Instrument, and outward Medium, through which Christ, and so God in Christ, is beheld, beleeved, and trusted in: and this is the word of God, that which declareth Christ, and Gods love, and gracious mind in and through him: and so the name or great report, and fame of the glory or goodnesse of God in Christ, in his love, mercy, power, wisdome, &c. Whence he is said to have magnified his word above all his name, Psal. 138 2. and so this faith is called, A beleeving the Gospel, and receiving his words, Mark 1.15. Iohn 2.22. and 5.47. And so this faith and trust is in praising God in his Word, Psal. 56.10. and glorifying his word, Acts 13.48. And so the object of this faith is, God in Christ, in and according to his word. The first next Instrumentall and outward mediate object of this faith, is the word and Gospel, with the promises thereof, which dis∣covereth Christ, and God in Christ, and that, in which, and for which we are to trust in him, Psal. 119.49.50. The second inward, inmost, and absolute mediate object of this Faith, is Jesus Christ, in that which hee hath done, is become, doth, and will doe, which the Word reporteth and assureth, Phil. 3.3. The last, inmost, and utmost object of this Faith, is God in Christ, in his infinite wisdome, love, power, &c. which appeareth in, and through Christ, 1 Tim. 4.10. And so the object of faith altogether in one, is, God in Christ, as discovered in his Word by his Spirit. This, and this onely is the object of this faith. So that no Arme of Flesh, or device of men, not multitude of men, Ammunition, or Forts; not riches, nor strength, nor wisdome, nor any self-wrought righteousnesse, or workes, can be in any sort the object of Faith, Jer. 9.23. Job. 9. 1. Either the inmost, and utmost object of faith and trust, God onely is that, Mark 10.24. 1 Tim. 6.17. 2. Or the inmost and absolute mediate object, through which men beleeve and trust in God; Christ Jesus is only that, Luke 18.19. 2 Cor. 10.4.7.—18. 3. Or the Instrumentall and outward mediate object, through
and according to which, men beleeve and trust in Christ, and in God in Christ; his Word onely is that, Psal. 56.4.10. As for prayers and endevours in use of means, when they issue from, and be the fruits of this faith and confidence in God in Christ according to his Word; then in this confidence, blessing may bee expected in them, 2 Sam. 7.27.29. But they cannot be the object either as Rule, or Medium, or Object, as aforesaid, Rom. 9.32. & 10.2.3. The Word, the Rule: Christ, the Medium: God, the Object: and so God in Christ, according to his word, is onely and altoge∣ther the object of this faith. Secondly, for the Mover or Worker of this faith; that which produceth it, and in and by which it is raised and wrought; it is not the force of any humane discourse, reasoning, or Argument, 1. Cor. 2.1.4.5. nor is it the issue or birth of any fervent endevours, or workings of men, in, and according to the law of works, Gal. 3.2. yea though endeavoured and done to get Christ, the righteousnesse of God thereby, Rom. 9.31.32. and 10.2.3.4. neither yet is it a conclusion, or spring from the appearance of any inward or out∣ward changes, effected in a man by any such reasonings, or endea∣vourings, Luke 18.11, 12. 2 Cor. 10.7.12.18. But this Mover and effector verily is 1. The appearance of the grace of God, in and through the Gos∣pel, even of that free and immense love of God in the gift of his Sonne to be the Saviour of the world, and the satisfaction made by Christ, and the fulnesse of grace and truth in him. This grace of God appearing in and through Christ, moveth to believe, encoura∣geth and draweth thereto; whence this faith is called, The gift of God by grace, and not of works, Eph. 2.8.9. and they that have it, are said to have believed through grace, Acts 18.27. 2. The Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Sonne in dis∣covery of this grace, effecteth this faith; and so the hand of the Lord, that is, the Spirit of the Lord, or the demonstration of the Spirit and power, is said to bring to believe in God, Acts 11.21. 1 Cor. 2.4.5. And in respect of both these, this grace and Spirit working faith, it is said, After the kindnesse and love of God to manward, appeared; he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renew∣ing of the holy Ghost, Tit. 3.4.5. And so the beleevers are said to
be borne of water, and of the spirit, Iohn 3.5. And so as the spirit worketh faith, so for working it, he doth not glorifie the workes of the Law, or any frames, or workes of men. But he glorifies Christ, and Gods rich grace in Christ, to beget faith, and hope in men, Iohn 16.13.14. 1 Pet. 1.21. And so to say in a word; It is the spirituall appearance of rich grace, in, and by which this faith is wrought; Grace is the mover. 3 For the nature, and Act of this faith; There be three things together meeting in one, in this Act of believing, or this faith of which is here teached, as Scripture, and experience of Believers shewes; that is to say, 1 An assent, and credit-giving to the report, or Testimony of the Gospel, and that which by the spirit is evidenced, and appeareth through the same report: the want of which the Prophet complaines of, Esa. 53. Who hath believed our re∣port? which not-believing, the Apostle calles, making God a lyer, 1 John 5.10. And this assent and credit-giving to the re∣port of the Gospel, was in those, Act. 13.48. They magnifi∣ed the word of the Lord, (counted it good, and true) and so re∣ceived the Testimony, and so did the Thessalonians likewise, 2 Thes. 1.10. And this is the first Act, without which; no faith at all, Iohn 5.47. and 8.24. 2 An inward, and hearty approbation of the goodnesse of that reported in the Gospel, in respect of that Christ hath done, and that he is become, and that he doth, and that he is ready to do. And in respect of the rich, free, and great love of God appearing therein, so as all other Excellencies are but losse, and Dung in comparison of it, 1 Pet. 2.7. Phil. 3.7.8 9. 3 Through this assenting and believing-approbation; there is an inward, and hearty resting, and relyance upon Christ, and God in Christ, for the dispensation of this grace, and per∣fecting that which appertaines to him to do, Rom. 5.1.2.5-10. First, creditting the savings of the Gospel; and through those sayings, Believing Christ himselfe, and the spirits Testi∣mony of him, and in that believing, trusting in God in Christ, for that promised, and so believing the sayings, receiving Christ,
and trusting in God through Christ; is the nature, and Act of this believing. 4 For the motions, orstrings in this believing or faith; they are, 1 An inward and hearty acknowledgement of, and submissi∣on to Jesus Christ, as the Lord, and Saviour, and so to this grace appearing in him, 2 Cor. 5.15. He dyed for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that dyed for them, and rose againe, and so Rom. 14.8. Whe∣ther we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord, &c. verse 9. and 1 Cor. 6.19-20. Ye are not your own, yet are bought with a price, &c. Rom. 6.17. Ye have obeyed from the heart, the forme of Doctrine to which ye were delivered. True it is, that all men shall one day be brought so farr to the knowledge of the truth, that they shall therein be brought to confesse Jesus the Lord to the glory of God, 1. Tim. 2.4.6. Esa. 45.23. Phil. 2.10.11. But now, in this day of grace, from the appearance and force of his lov∣ing kindnesse, in beliefe of his goodnesse to submit to, and ac∣knowledge the Lordship, and grace of Christ; is the motion, and string of this faith, Hosea 3.5. 2 An inward, and hearty acceptance, and receiving of Christ, and this grace of God in Christ, for Pardon, Peace, righteous∣nesse, and life, so Iohn 1.12. As many as received him, &c. Col. 2.6. Received Christ Jesus the Lord, Act. 26.18. Re∣ceive forgivenesse of sinnes, Rom. 5.1. We have Peace, &c. verse 11. We have received the Attonement, verse 17. Receive the Abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousnesse, 1 Iohn 5.12 He that hath the Sonne, hath life. And this accepting, and receiving; is another motion in this faith. 3 An approach, accesse, in coming, or nigh-drawing to Christ, and this grace in him, and for farther onenesse, and enjoyment thereof, he also herein building farther upon himselfe, Rom. 5.2. By whom also we have accesse by faith into this grace, &c. Ephes. 2.18. Through him we have both accesse by one spirit unto the Father, 1 Pet. 2, 3, 4. Ye have tasted that the Lord is gratious, to whom coming, as unto a living stone, &c. And this approaching is another motion in this faith. 4 A hearty content, and well-pleasednesse takeing in, and
with Christ, and this grace in him, which is a feeding thereon, Phil. 3.3. And rejoyce in Christ Jesus, Col. 3.4. Christ who is our life, Psal. 16.5.6. I have a goodly heritage, Iohn 6.56, 57, 58.68 69. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, &c. And thus doth this faith move, in a submission to, and ac∣knowledgement of Christ, receite of the grace in him, approach∣ing to God through him, and well-pleasednesse, takeing in him our Portion, Psal. 15.5.9. Such the moveings in, and of this faith. 5 For the subject in which this faith is, the Instrument with which it moveth, and worketh, in and to all this, beholding, as∣senting, believing, trusting, acknowledgement, receite, ap∣proaching, & content-taking; It is the heart, the principall, the choyce, and inmost strength of the minde, will, and affection, even the spirit of all, which is usually called the heart in Scrip∣ture, Rom. 10.9.10. And shalt believe in thine heart; for with the heart man believeth unto righteousnesse, Ephes. 3.17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, so that this faith is not in, or with the minde, or conception onely, or with a light af∣fection; but in, and with the whole heart, Act. 8.37. And so it is with. 1 The minde, and understanding highly prizing Christ, and this rich grace in him, as the most excellent, pretious, and choice Pearle, and Riches. Phil. 3.7.8. 1 Cor. 1.24. Col. 2.3.10. 2 The will resolutely chusing, receiving, and accepting Christ, and this grace in him, as that which is most pleasing, and wel∣come, Psal. 73.24.25. and 119.30.37. 3 The affections closing therewith, as that which is most desirable, and satisfying, Psal. 16.5, 6, 7. Cant. 1, 2, 3, and 2, 3, 4, 5. 4 A springing, and reviving apprehension of truth, and goodnesse of that believing, however fainting before, Psal. 116.10.12. As old Iacob, though before fainting at the newes, yet when he believed the report of Iosephs being alive, Gen. 45.27.28. His spirit revived & he said, it is enough, my son Ioseph is yet alive, &c. And as Mary, Luke 1.46.47. My soule doth mag∣nifie
the Lord, and my spirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour, and as David, Psal. 103.1.2, 3. Thus is this faith in the heart, and with the heart man believeth (not only righteousnesse, but) unto righteousnesse, and so with the heart, moveth, as aforesaid. 6. For the strength, power, and principle, in, and of this faith; It is the divine power, and spirit of Christ, entring with his motion, or infusion, effecting: and spirituall seed, or dispo∣fition in the heart, in which, the divine power, and spirit of Christ, that wrought this faith, operateth in and with this faith, which faith is therefore rightly called, Col. 2.12. The faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Christ from the Dead: and the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead; is affirmed to worke in those that by it, believe: Ephes. 1.19.20. And by reason of this spirituall disposition effected in the heart of the Believer; it is called, The spirit of faith, 2 Cor. 4.13. And by this spirit of faith it is that the believer in believing is ena∣bled, 1 To behold, and discerne the object of faith, Christ in his fulnesse and beauty, and the rich grace of God in him, Iohn 1.14.16.18. Mat. 16.17. 1 Cor. 29. 1 Iohn 3.1. 2 Moved and overcome in the appearance of this grace to believe. 1 Pet. 1.21. Tit. 3, 4, 5. 3 Enabled to assent to, and receive the Testimony, 1 Thes. 1.5. And to believe, and accept the grace it selfe, 2 Thes. 2.13.14. And to depend on God for all the hope to come. Rom. .5.10. Gal. 5.5. 4 Prevailed with in the motions to the submission to, and acknowledgement of Christ 1 Cor. 12.3. To receiving him, Iohn 1.12.13. To approaching to God in, and by him, Ephes. 2.18. and to Content-taking in him, Col. 3.10.11. 5 Hath the new minde, spirit, and heart effected, Ezek. 36.27. 1 Iohn 5.20. And the minde and law of Christ written therein, 1 Cor. 2.16. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. 6 The springs, fruits, and operations of love, joy, peace, &c. Rise up, Gal. 5.22.23. Diffusing the vertue, and operation, in all the powers and faculties of he man, Mat 13.33. Purifying the heart unto unfained love of the Brethren, 1 Pet. 2, 22. Ra∣sing
up motions, and so springing forth in prayer, praise, confessi∣on, works of mercy, &c. 2 Cor. 4.13. And all notions about the Doctrine of faith, and Profession of faith where this spirit of faith is wanting, is but dead faith, Iames 2.17.26. And all workes wrought by humane force, not produced by this spirit of faith, are but dead workes, Heb. 6.1.2. Tim. 3.5. but this spirit of faith is the life of faith, and that which makes faith lively, in all that is said of it, Rom. 8.2.4.14. 7 For the one-nesse of this faith, in the diversity of the De∣grees, and Acts of it; the Scripture sheweth, That there are divers degrees of this true, and Divine faith: the first Degree is little and small, in comparison, as a graine of Mustard-seede, Mat. 13.31. Luke 17.6. And called little, or weake in faith, Mat. 6.30. Rom. 14.1. The second De∣gree is stable, stedfast, or strong faith, abiding in Christ, en∣deavouring temptations, and tryalls, Col. 1.23. and 2.5.1 Thes. 3.7.8. The third degree, is effectuall, and victorious, working faith, and overcoming, 1 Thes. 1.3. 1 Iohn 5.4. Though there are diversity of measures, or Degrees, and Growth therein, in each Degree, 2 Thes. 1.3. And in respect of the diversity of Degrees in faith; some are called Babes; some, strong men; and some; Fathers, 1 Iohn 2.12.13.14. 2 That the Acts, or Actings of this faith be divers, and ma∣nifold, as to say a areceiving Act, a springing Act, and a flow∣ing, and streaming Act: as in the Scripture, and experience; be∣lievers find. First, a receiving Act, this faith wrought by the spirit of grace in the heart receiveth the history, or record, and Testi∣mony of God in the Gospel concerning Christ, 1 Thes. 2.13. 2 Thes. 1.10. 1 Iohn 5.9.10.11. The grace of God in Christ testified, Rom. 1.5. and 5.17. As remission of sinnes, Act. 10.43. Justification, Peace, Sanctification, Liberty of accesse to God, and hope of glory, Rom. 5.1.2.3. Act. 26.18. Divine power, and strength of relyance on God, Rom. 5.5.10.11. And yeelding up according to the leadings of grace, 2 Tim. 1.7. 2 Pet. 1.1-4. Whence also such exhortations to believers, as Rom. 12.1.2. Phil. 2.1.2.12.13. and that 1 Iohn 4.4. and 5.4.
Secondly, a springing Act, for from this faith wrought by the spirit in the heart; springeth up love of God, and Jesus Christ our Lord, and joy in God, 1 Pet. 1.7.8. Rom. 5.11. And love of brethren, 1 Iohn 3.23. and 4.21. and 5.1. 2 Cor. 5.14. and patience, and meeknesse, &c. Gal. 5.22. According to that is said, Iohn 7.38. Thirdly, a flowing, or streaming Act, from the springs, the motions, flowing to put forth accordingly, Rom. 10.10. And this more ordinarily, to pray, give thankes, declare his good∣nesse, shew mercy, &c. Psal. 116.10. 2 Cor. 4.13. or more ex∣traordinary, in some miraculous operations, Mat. 17.20. Luke 17.6. Marke 16, 17, 18. 3 That notwithstanding the divers Degrees in this faith, and the divers manner of Acting, and Acts of this faith; yet the faith it selfe is but one, and onely one, Ephes. 4.4. As there is but one body, even one true Church, or Sanctuary that is uni∣ted to Christ, and shall be in, and with him for ever, Cant. 6.9. And this Church one seed, Gal. 3.17. One Sonne, Hosea. 11.1. One Christ, one body, though the members be many, 1 Cor. 12.12. And as there is but one head, husband, and Lord of this body, and Church with all its members, which is Jesus Christ the Sonne of God, and our Saviour, Ephes. 1.22.23. and 4.15.16. and 5.30. 1 Cor. 8.6. And as there is but one Baptisme, whereby we are baptized into this one Body, whereof Christ is the head, and that is by the spirit, and with the washing of water, and the word; And this is into the Death; and unto the resurrection of Christ, and so for conformity in one, and therethrough conformity in the other, 1 Cor. 12.13. Ephes. 5.26. Rom. 6.3, 4, 5. Tit. 3.4.5. And as there is but one God & Father, to whom we come, in coming to Christ, and he the Father of Christ, and of every of us, Ephes. 4.6. And as there is but one spirit, proceeding from the father, & the son, effecting, & breath∣ing one spirit, minde, disposition, or heart, & that the spirit mind, disposition, and heart of Christ, into which all that are bapti∣sed into Christ, are made to drinke, and so are one spirit, Ephes. 4.4 even so likewise, (as in the place fore-cited) there is but one faith. True it is; The word Faith, in Scripture, is used diversly; somtime for the object of faith, even the ground, and founda∣tion
of faith, and that which is to be, and is beleeved, and beleeved in, and to that end to be preached and heard, Rom. 1.5. & 10.6. Gal. 1.23. & 3.5. Sometimes the word is used for the grace of faith, Col. 1.4 & 2.5-12. Eph. 2.8. Sometimes for both the object, and the grace united with the object together, Acts 13.8. Rom. 4.11. & 9.30. And yet however taken; there is but one faith. The object in every respect is one. The Gospel, or word of grace, though it hath many branches and uses, yet is but one and the same Gospel. 2 Cor. 11.4. with Gal. 1.7.8.9. The Gospel, Col. 1.5.23. Even so the Lord Jesus Christ set forth in the Gospel, though set forth, as he is indeed, the Sonne of God, and the Sonne of Man; yea, God Man, and declared in respect of what he was, and what he became for us, and what he hath done, and what he is for us, and with what he is furnished, and what he is to us. And as he is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that beleeve, and the Judge of all, &c. yet he is but one, 2 Cor. 11.4. with 1 Cor. 8.6. the Christ, John 4.42. Even so God the Father that is in Christ, is one God, (though his works be manifold) 1 Cor. 8.6. Gal. 3.20. 1 Tim. 2.5. even so the holy Spirit that proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, and discovereth Christ, and God in Christ, and beareth forth the testimo∣ny, however his gifts and operations be many and manifold; yet the Spirit is but one, 1 Cor. 12.4 11. yea the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Spirit are, 1 John 5.7. one God, Mark 12 32.34. set forth in one Gospel. And so the object of faith is one; and so faith also, though so taken. The grace of faith, or the beleeving it self that is wrought in the heart by the Spirit of grace, however there are diversity of degrees in the same, both in the strength of beleeving, and also in the ful∣nesse of the discovery of the object beleeved, & in the effects ac∣cordingly, and also the Acts manifold, as is shewn: yet the faith it selfe is but one. And this is evident in the forenamed place, Ephes. 4.4. where both faith, and the object of faith, and the means, and the hope, and the people that receive it, are all mentioned distinct∣ly; so that the word faith there meanes, the grace of faith, and it is expresly affirmed to be one, There is one faith. As for humane and worldly faith, or a shew and pretence of divine faith, and hy∣pocriticall profession thereof, it is no faith at all in Scripture lan∣guage: there is no vertue in gtting or retaining it, nor danger
in departing therefrom in respect of any spirituall life. As for that beliefe of the report of the Gospel, and profession thereof, which is destitute of the life and operation of the Spirit of faith; it is no more faith then the body of a man is a man when the Ghost is gi∣ven up and departed, Jam. 2.26. So as there is no other true and li∣ving faith, but one; the receiving the history, and record, the recei∣ving remission of sinnes, justification and sanctification, and power for divine operations or miracles, the springs, the streames, the acts, as is shewn, are all by one and the same faith. And so it is one and the same faith, that in discovery of the object is tendered, and to which called, and which by the divine testimony is effe∣cted, and which in abiding is after confirmed, and which groweth and worketh by love: it is still one and the same faith, 2 Pet. 1.1. And this faith closing with, and the believer therein united, and be∣come one with the object of faith; it is still one, and then stable and sure to abide, Heb. 4.2.3. And this is the faith, Scripture speaks of. Fourthly, for the remembrance here spoken of, it is not that humane exercise of thoughts, in running over, and recording the words, stories, severall doctrines, reasons and uses, &c. that one hath heard, and read, thereby to habituate them in memory, that one may have them to think, and speak of at all times, though there bee a good use of such remembring, notwithstanding some turn it to an evil, Mat. 27.63. But the remembrauce here spoken of, is a beleeving remembrance, when in this faith, the death, resurrection, and Sa∣crifice of Christ, with the vertue of its presentation to God, and of its application to us, 1 Cor. 15.3.4. 2 Tim. 2.8. the love and pow∣er there-through testified, and dispensed, the hope therein given, and that therethrough tendered to be wrought, is believingly 1. In the discoveries, testimonies and sayings thereof noted, ob∣served and heeded diligently, as Jacob observed the saying, Gen. 27.11. and Lydia on the opening of her heart attended to the things, &c. Acts 16.14. As Moses said, Set your hearts to all the words which I testifie, Deut. 32.46. 2. The grace, consolations, hope, and instructions tendered in their discoveries, to accept and retain in the heart, with the choyce estimate, love, desires, and submission, Luke 8.15. Prov. 6.20.21,
22. as Mary kept the saying in her heart, Luke 2.51. and David, Psal. 119.11.16.24.72. 3 The motions and teachings of this grace, yeeld up to, and vent forth Rom. 12.1.2, Phil, 2.1.2.12.13. Tit. 2.11.12. Gal. 5.24. as David, Psal. 16.7. 4. The taking all occasions, and being minded by all occasions for the revived remembrance of these things in and of Christ, Psal. 16.8. By the creatures of God, the heaven, the earth, and the inha∣bitants, which (being by sin dissolved) are through the Sacrifice, mediation and power of Christ, upheld, Psal. 75.3. Col. 1.17. and so shewing forth his glory, Psal. 19.1-6. 2. By the particular mercies of God extended as a fruit of the Sacrifice of Christ, and that life that is in him, John 1.4.5. carrying forth some testimony of his goodnesse, Acts 14.17. and leading to repentance, Rom. 2.4. These give apt occasions to remember these things. 3 By the chastisements God layeth on men, especially, the suf∣ferings of Believers for the Gospel, apt to mind us of him that bare all our sorrowes, Isa 53.4. And hath sanctified sufferings for us, to whom we are to be conformed, and who is ready and able to do us good by them, and to deliver, &c. Rom. 6.4, 5. Heb. 12.2-7. 4 The Word of God minding us of these things. In Moses writing, Iohn 5.45. In the Shadowes and Sacrifices of the Law, Heb. 9. and 10. In the Prophecies, Act. 3.24. Rom. 1.2, 3. In the Do∣ctrine, Invitations, and Promises, Isa. 53.1-6. with Act. 13.34. In the full and plain Narration, 1 Cor. 15.3, 4. 5 The Ordinances of God mind us of these things, as Preach∣ing, 1 Cor. 2.4. and 15.1-4. 1 Iohn 14.14. Writing, Iohn 20.31. 1 Iohn 1.1-5. Confirming, Jud. 20.21. 1 Thes. 4.18. and 5.10.11. Prayer, &c. The Dore for which is opened by Christs sacrifice, and mediation, Heb. 10.19, 20, 22. and 4.15, 16. 6 The grace of God with the fruits thereof, given by the Spirit of Christ into the believing heart, aptly mindes of these things, Rom. 5.1.5-11. 7 The beholding believers through grace brought out of the state and fellowship of the world, into union and fellowship with Christ, and one another in him, mindes us, not only of the bloud of Christs shed, and his ransome given for all men, by which he hath
bought all of God; but of the vertue of his bloud also by his Spirit discovered, and applyed, and they there through redeemed, and purchased from among men unto God, Act. 20.28. Rev. 5.9. 8 Yea, even the beholding men, as men, though in their naturall condition, doth aptly mind of these things, Rom. 8.3. 1 Tim. 2.6. Heb. 2.9. 2 Cor. 5.14.15 — 20. 9 Yea, even the follies, disobedience, &c. of such men, are fit oc∣casions to put these things to remembrance, Tit. 3.2, 3, 4, 5. 10 Yea, even our own sins, being that for which he was cruci∣fied, Isa 53.6. and the combates within, all freedome being given in, and through him, doe give occasion of remembrance of these things, as is seen, Rom. 7.24, 25. and 8.1, 2, 3, 4. and so wee might proceed. So that in the believing the truth, and goodnesse of the things of Christ set forth in the Gospel, with such a love retaining them in the heart, as by all occasions to be stirred up to this receiving, attending, accepting, and yeelding up thereto, is the remembrance here meant. And to have the word of Christ dwell plenteously in us, teaching, &c. Col. 3.16. The way to this remembrance is, in the acknowledgment of our own weaknesse, and the vanity of all hu∣mane helps, through the beliefe of his love towards us, and what he hath done for us when we were enemies, and his more speciall love, in making his grace known to us, to depend on him for his spirit, to mind us of him, and his words, Rom. 5.6-11. Gal. 5.5. for which he hath given us his promise, Iohn 14.26. and 16.7. — 15. And this remembrance in the believing heart is profitable. 1 To preserve, and save from falling, 1 Cor. 15.2, 3, 4. 2 To return, and raise out of falls, and decayes, Rev. 3.3. 3 To meet with comforts, teachings, &c. Psalm. 63.5, 6, 7. And thus of the faith, and remembrance here meant.
CHAP. XIV. Of the usefulnesse here meant, what, and how manifold it is. THE usefulnesse of the pretious bloud, and sacrifice of Christ believingly remembred; so as there-through God is depen∣ded on; Is in, and to the believer two-fold. 1 In respect of them∣selves. 2 In respect of others: and both wayes manifold. First, In respect of the Believer himself, it is four-fold: 1 Receiving. 2 Springing up. 3 Streaming forth. And 4 waiting. 1 The first use is receiving: and so believing, and receiving, are used one for another, Iohn 1.12. And the receit in believing view, and remembrance is manifold, as is fore-shewn, namely, 1 Of the Word of Christ, the Record and Testimony God gave of him, 1 Cor: 15.1. 2 In receit of his testimony, is received the mind of Christ, so far as to receive information, light, and discerning in some mea∣sure of 1 That which Christ hath done in his death, resurrection, as∣cension, and sacrifice offered to God, what for all men, and what for all that by the heavenly call believe on him, as is shewne be∣fore. 2 That which (by vertue of this which he hath done) he is be∣come, and that in generall for all men, as that he is the propitiation for their sins, 1 John 2.2. And the Mediator between God and them, procuring for them patience, mercies, and some meanes for their Call, 1 Tim. 2.5. And that in speciall for those that in the heavenly call are prevailed with to believe on him, as that besides both the fore-mentioned for all men, hee is in speciall manner for them an Advocate, 1 Iohn 2.1. Yea, even the Mediator of the New Testament, that hy his spirituall application of the vertue of his sacrifice, they may receive the promised inheritance, Ephes. 5.25, 26. Heb. 9.14, 15. Yea, he is their King, and Teacher, and the high Priest of their Profession, and to them wisdome, righteous∣nesse, sanctification, and redemption, Heb. 3. and 7. and 8. 1 Cor. 1, 30. 3 That which by vertue of the sormer he now doth, and will
do, and that both in generall for all men, as the extension of his pro∣cured patience, mercies, and means, to bring them to the knowledg of the truth, Prov, 1.23. and 8.4 &c. & Psalm: 75.3. Act: 14 17. And such as refuse light when it cometh, he will one day bring them to acknowledgment of the truth, and then judge them, Jsa: 45:23. Phil: 2.10.11. Rom: 2.16 And also in special for those that through the acknowledgment of truth in the day of grace believe on him, how he presents them in himself spotlesse before God, Col. 1.22. interceding for them, Heb: 7:25. and will send forth his Spirit to teach, comfort, and sanctifie, uphold, lead, and preserve them to the Inheritance, &c. John 14.1, 2, 3, 26. and 15:25 and 16.13, 14, 15. 1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Psalm: 138:8. 4 The great and rich love of God through all this discovered, Ephes: 2.4, 5. His generall love of compassion to all men, Iohn 3:16.17. Tit: 2, 11, 12. and 3.4. and his peculiar and speciall love of delight to those in the heavenly Call united to Christ, Ephes: 5:25, 26. Psalm: 149.1. 5. The great terrour, and heavy inexcusable condemnation for all that when light comes, set light by, and will none of Christ to raign over them, Hebr. 2:2: and 10:29. Luk 19:27. 2 Cor: 5.10:11. And in this enlightning they receive a right judgment concer∣ning God, and Christ, and Man, and sinne, and righteoesnesse, life, and death, &c, Phil: 3.3 — 9. and so its said, we have the mind of Christ, 1 Cor: 2, 16. 3 In receiving this divine testimony and information, is received also an encouragement of the grace it self testified in Christ, Rom: 1.5. as remission of sins, &c. as fore-shewn, and the spirit of adop∣tion with divine power, &c. Gal: 3.2. Rom: 8:15. as before. 2 The second use is for springing up, as in believing-minding these things are received; so from this received in the same belie∣ving-mindfulnesse of Christ, springeth up 1 A high estimate of Christ, and the things of Christ, and desire of him, with a low estimate of ones self, and all ones owne things, Phil: 3.7, 8, 9. 2 An inward sorrow for all ones evill thoughts of God and Christ, and sins, against so gracious and loving a God, and Saviour, Act: 2.37. Zach: 12:10. 3 A fervent love of God, and Jesus Christ our Lord, with peace
towards God, and joy in God. 1 Pet: 1:7, 8. Rom: 5.2, 5, 11. 4 Love of brethren, and compassion towards men, 1 Iohn 3.23. & 4:21. and 5.1. 2 Cor: 5.14. 5 Desires of Gods glory, the Churches prosperity, and Mens conversion, and the coming again of Christ. 6 Detestation of evill, with love of God, and so patience, meek∣nesse, &c. Gal: 5-17, 22, 23. And these, and such like spring up in believing-remembrance of the sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, according to that, Iohn 7.38. 3 The third use is for streaming forth; for as in believing-re∣membrance of the sacrifice, and mediation of Christ there, are such receivings, and such springs, as fore-shewn; so in the same belie∣ving-remembrance, the springs arising from the receites doe move, and stream to flow, and vent forth, and is called a shewing forth the vertues of him that called, &c. 1 Pet: 2, 9. bringing forth good things, Matth. 12.35. A working cut the salvation that is a mans own in and with him, Phil: 2:12, 13. which is from the force of the spirit, grace, and love of Christ received, springing up in the in∣wards, fruits of zeale, charity, &c. fore-mentioned, streaming, and boyling to flow forth in motions and bowels, stirring thereto. And this, according to the channels opened, and occasions given, Iob. 32, 8, 18, 19, 20. 2 Cor: 5, 14, 15, 19, 20. And grace received, 1 John 1, 2, 3. Act. 4.20. 1 To deny ungodlinesse, and worldly lusts, Tit: 2.11, 12. Gal: 2.16, 17, 21. 2 To oppose false doctrines, and wayes, Revel. 2.2. Gal. 2.11.14. 3 To attend the Ordinances of God, and seek his face therein. Psalm. 27.4. and 23.6. To pray to him, and give him thanks, Psal, 116.2, 10, 13. Recount his favours, and sing his praises, Psalm. 145.1. — 11. 4 To confesse Christ Jesus the Lord and Saviour, in holding forth the word of life, exalting Christ, and yeelding themselves servants for Christ his sake, Rom. 10.10.2 Cor. 4, 5, 13. Phil. 2.12.16. 5 To use equity and mercy, to give to every one his due for the
Lords sake, and to doe good to all, especially them of the houshold of faith, Rom. 13.10. Tit. 3.1-4.8. Gal. 6.8.9 10. whence for all these, the exhortations to beleevers, run in such a strain suitable to the law of grace. Rom. 12.1.2. Phil. 2.1.2. 6. To confesse it their finne, wherein soever they have shut up these bowels (undervalued the grace beleeved, deaded the springs, or stopt the streames, either by forgerfulnesse, or neglect of yeelding to its motions, or turning aside to any other motions) and seeking pardon and healing of the same in returning to Christ, &c. 1 John 3.17. & 1.9. Mat. 26.75. Psal. 32.15. 7. In some, at some time, to some miraculous operations in re∣spect of that which is ordinary. Mat. 17.20. Luk 17.6. Mar. 16.17.18. And these and such like are the flowings forth of the springs from the grace received in the beleeving-Remembrance of the ver∣tuous Blood, Sacrifice, and mediation of Christ. 4. The fourth use is, for Patience, for as in believing-Re∣membrance of the vertuous Blood, Sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, and Gods rich love therein, such grace is received, such fruits doe spring, and such streames flow forth: so also (it being some time after believing, and walking in faith, before all that is set in hope be received, and in that time, many thoughts, trials, and tem∣ptations to be gone through, so that there is need of Patience, Heb. 10.36. 1 Pet: 1, 6, 7.) In this believing remembrance of the Sacri∣fice and mediation of Christ, patience is stirred up, and effected in exercise, and preserved, so as from that beheld in, & received from Christ, ariseth a sweet confident expectation, and patient abiding, and waiting through all Tryals, Sufferings, and services for his per∣formance of all his righteous Promises in his own season, and so for his preserving us to the inheritance, and for his owne visible coming again, and receiving us to himself, that we may be with him, and raign with him for ever, John 14:1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18. and 5.1 — 6. Tit. 2 11, 13. Heb. 11.26. Secondly, for the Believer in respect of others, this believing-re∣membrance of the vertuous Sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, is very usefull, and profitable, and that in three respects: 1 In respect of a right view, and estimate of them. 2 In respect of a right demeanour in word, and conversation to∣ward them.
3. In respect of a right confidence concerning them. 1. In respect of a right view and estimate of them; the beleeving-remembrance of the death, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, leads and moves the judgement and mind of the believer. 2. To esteem all that are onely naturall men, as those for whom Christ hath died, and given himselfe a ransome, and bought them, and is the propitiation for their sinnes, and mediator between God and them, 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 2.9. 1 Tim. 2 5.6. 1 John 2.2. 2 Pet. 21, 2. And in this respect to be loved, pitied, prayed for, and to have the Gospel declared to them, and to be served for their good, 2 Cor. 5.11.14, 15, 20. 1 Tim. 1.15. to ch. 2.1.—6. Rom. 1.14, 15.16. 1 Cor. 9.18.—23. & 10.33. And so to afford them all that honor and respect of the place, the disposing hand of such a redee∣mer hath put them in, 1 Pet. 2.16-19. 1 Tim. 6.1. 2. To esteem all that are not onely so ransomed, but by the gra∣cious providence of our redeemer, put in our charge and tuition, as the price of his blood graciously given, and committed to us by our Lord, to be brought up for him, and nurtured in the knowledge and feare of him, the Lord of us both, Gen. 18.19. & 33.5. Ephes. 6.4.9. Job. 13.14. 3. To esteem all that are through grace brought in to beleeve in Christ, as the Sons and Daughters of God, Brethren and Mem∣bers of Christ, and of us the House of God, whose we are, and to whom we belong, fit objects for speciall love and fellowship, so as Christ may be loved and served in them; and they with special love and service for Christ his sake, John 1.12, 13. Rom. 9.26. Eph. 2.19, 20. Heb. 1.6. Eph. 5.30. 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. &c. 4. To esteeme all of these called ones (that are not onely redee∣med of God by blood-shedding, but unto God by his precious Blood spiritually applied, Rev. 5.9: 1 Pet. 1.18.19.) as we have been in any sort instruments by whom God hath called them, 2 Thess. 2.13.17. or, are by his grace and providence, both led to some speciall charge and oversight of them, 1 Pet 5.1.2. so as to those we are more peculiarly related for more abundant care and service for them, Act. 20.28. 5. To esteem those who after light, and knowledge of the truth, have resisted it, and departed from it, turning the grace of God into lasciviousnesse, and opposing the power of godlinesse, persisting
herein, till given up of God, as ungodly, reprobate, and the feed of the Serpent to be contended with, turned from, and ceased praying for, Jer. 6.6.16-30. Iude 4.—19. 2 Tim. 3.5. 1 Iohn 5.16. Secondly, in respect of a right demeanour, in word and conver∣sation. 1. For words; it will mind us of right and true Gospel, and right words, which we need not cloak, curtaile, or equivocate in de∣livery, nor be ashamed of; but speak with boldnesse and plainnesse, Col. 1.13. Prov. 8.5, 6, 7. 2 Cor. 3.18, & 4.1. 2. Rom. 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.12. having that in them which is true, and meet to be spoken to every man, Prov. 22.18.—21. to reprove and confute all false do∣ctrines, wayes, and hopes, 2 Cor. 10.4, 5, 6. to instruct in the do∣ctrine and way of Christ, Rom. 1.16.17. to presse to convincement, Tit. 2.15. to comfort the convinced, & to allure to good thoughts of God in Christ, & so to beleeve, 1 Tim. 1.15.16.17. to encourage to abiding in the faith, Heb. 3.1-6. to exhort and provoke to love and good works, Tit. 3.8. to set forth the peculiar priviledges of such as in beleeving are made one in Christ, Rom. 8.2, 15, 26, 33. & to encou∣rage them to constancy in their holy profession, and fellowship, Heb. 10.1.19-25. And so to season all our words with grace, that they may savour of, and administer grace to others, Eph. 4.20, 30. Col. 4.6. 2 Tim. 3.15.16. 2 For conversation; it will mind to bee putting on bowels of mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of mind, meeknesse, long-suffering, forbearing and forgiving, &c. Col. 3.12. to blesse them that curse us, &c. Matth. 5.44.45. to walk in wisdome, and blamelesse to∣wards them that are without, Col. 4.5. Phil. 2.15. And faithful∣ly and fruitfully among the brethren, Iohn 15.1:10. and so to pray for good for all, 1 Tim. 2.3, 4. and peculiar good for beleevers, Phil. 1.8.9, 10. 3. For confidence; it will mind of that which will make con∣fident in him, to vouchsafe his presence by Spirit, so farr as to ma∣nifest the savour of his knowledge to others by us, for allurement, or convincement, 2 Cor. 2.14.17. and so confirm his words spoke by us, that even the rejectors shall one day confesse the truth there∣of, and be iudged thereby, Isai. 44.25.26. Phil. 2, 10, 11. Iohn 12.48. Rom. 2.16. and such as receive them, shall have a proofe of his owne gracious presence, and speaking there through, Matth.
10.40 2 Corinth. 13.3. so as wee shall bee fruitfull, 2 Pet. 1.8.9. And to conclude, the beleeving remembrance of the Death, Sa∣crifice, Ransome, and Mediation of Christ, is usefull for the re∣ceit of all mercies, chastisements, use of ordinances, and creatures, with purity, comfort, and profit, Rom. 14.14. 1 Tim. 4.4.5. Tit. 1.15. And thus in viewing what the Gospel saith of the precious Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ; in the sense of the words, the ends, the necessity, the excellency and dignity, the vertue, o∣peration, and prevalency, with the afefulnesse of the knowledge, and beleeving remembrance thereof; we may see that there was so great and good cause for the same to bee made knowne, believed, and remembred, and such a fulnesse in it, that we need not won∣der at it, That the Apostles should determine to know nothing else in their ministration, as 1 Corinth. 2.2. save Jesus Christ and him crucified; and that they would glory in nothing else, (Gal. 6.14.) save the Crosse of Christ; and that they should bee so dili∣gent to put believers in remembrance of these things. And our Sa∣viour appointed the Word preached, Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord, for the remembrance of these things: seeing these things rightly understood, containe all things necefull to eternall life. CHAP. 15. Observations from this whole Discourse in all the fourteen Chapters, and now for a litte further enlarging the usefulnesse; note these confirmations. 1. THat the doctrine of the Gospel setting forth Jesus Christ,Observ. 1. Act. 10.36. 1 Tim. 2.4.5.6 1 Ioh. 5.10.11 12. 1 Cor. 1.30. Psa. 68.18 Ioh. 16.7-15 Mat 28.18. Prov. 8. Heb. 5 9. Rom. 14.2.12. as now he hath come in the flesh, and died for our sinnes, and is risen for our justification, Rom. 1. Heb. 9. and having offered up his own selfe a Sacrifice to God for us, is received and exalted at Gods right hand, having obtained eternall redemption, and so is become the Lord of all: the propitation for the sins of the world: the Mediator between God and Men: Wisdome, Righteousnesse, Sanctification and Redemption, and life in him, for all. And hee all
this for, and to all that by the heavenly call beleeve on him, and for them the Mediator of the new Testament, that they may receive the promises, being immeasurably filled with the holy Spirit to send forth to men, even the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them, and to such as are brought in to him, to lead them into all truth, having all power and authority to call all the sonnes of men, that they might look, and live to him; to absolve, and bring to eternall life, all that obey his call, and to judge and condemne all that persist refusing, and will none of him. This Doctrine, as it is now declared in the Gospel, it is the one∣ly necessary doctrine to be taught, known, beleeved, and walked in, and it is a full sufficient and compleat Doctrine, or Law, and needeth no other doctrine to be added to it, either to goe before, or follow after, or be joyned with it, 1 Cor. 2.1-4. Gal. 1.7, 8, 9. 1. Either to convince the world of sinne, or righteousnesse, or judgement, and to empty a man of himselfe, John 16.7, 11. Phil. 3.3-8. 2. Or to call to Christ, and so to repentance and faith, and there through to receit of remission of sinnes, renewing, and life in Christ, 2 Thess. 2.14. 3. Or to encourage beleevers to abide in the faith, John 15.1-10. Col. 1.5-23. 4. Or to direct and lead Beleevers to sanctification and con∣formity with Christ in heart and life, 2 Cor. 3.3.18. Tit. 2.10.11.12.14. 5. Or, for Beleevers exercise, to preserve, and edifie themselves, and one another in the faith and love of God in Christ, and in the love of one another, through all sufferings and services of love, till they come to the Inheritance, John 15.4 7, 8. 1 John 2.24, 25. Jude 20. 6. Or to oppose all sins, and adversaries, and all false Doctrines, wayes, and hopes withall, 2 Cor: 6.4, 7. and 10.4.5, 6. Ephes. 6.17. Yea, this Doctrine of the Gospell, as it now sets forth Christ, and life in him; is a compleat, full, and sufficient Doctrine for all this, without addition: And for better understanding the suffici∣ency of the Gospell; this is to be heeded, That the life in Christ, the Redemption compleated in his own body for men, & the redemp∣tion
in the Declaration thereof tendered to be wrought in men, & by his Spirit in application of that in himself, wrought in such as believe on him; ever from the beginning was, now is, and ever will bee, one, and the same, 1 Iohn 1.4, 5, 9, 12. 1 Iohn 1.1, 2, 3. Heb: 13.8. But the fulnesse and cleernesse of the Doctrinall Declaration, and Dispensation, as well as of the spirituall commu∣nication of Christ, and the life in him, hath had its diversity of De∣grees. 1 There was some discovery of this life, even of the redempti∣on wrought by Christ in himself for men, and the power in him to make it known, and tender it to men, and give it into believing men, even at first; And that then declared, was Gospell, even the same, though not so full, and cleere, as the word of the beginning of Christ now, as appears by comparing Gen. 3.15. with Iohn 1.4. 1 Iohn 1.1-3. and 3.5-8. 2 After some time, God was pleased to give a more full disco∣very of Christ, and this life in him, in opening to and making with Abraham, an everlasting Covenant, to assure all the spirituall Seed of this life in Christ, and the priviledges thereof, by a sure and un∣alterable Covenant, Gen. 17. which was not another; but the same Gospell more full come forth, and the same that now is, though now more open, and cleer, Gal 3.8, 16, 28, 29. Yet till Christ was actually come; God saw it needfull to adde stil something, for the nurture, and guidance of his people, that they might estimate, seek, and lay hold of Christ, and this life in him: which still they were apt to sleight and neglect, and ready either to extenuate their evils, or to magnifie some wisdome and righteous∣nesse of their own: wherefore God gave them a Testament or Law by Moses his servant, one part whereof pointing out the righteous∣nesse due from man to God, thereby to discover their sinfulnesse, and make them say Amen to the Curse; And the other part, to type and shadow out Christ, that they might, in observation therof, look and wait for all grace through him that was co come: And this Law or Testament was not the everlasting Covenant, It was not the Gospell preached to Abraham, but a Law added, because of transgression till the Seed should come: and so long was the tea∣ching, and pressing of this Law needfull, and usefull, as subservient to the Gospell, &c. Gal. 3.19. to drive to Christ.
3 But when the fulnesse of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, &c. Gal. 4.1, 4. And hee being come in the flesh, and having suffered, and being in our nature exalted at the right hand of God; he hath given a new Testament, which is a first fruits of the everlasting Covenant, and the blessing of the Gospell, for the nurture of his people: and so the old Testament decayed, and passed, 2 Cor. 3.11. Heb. 8.13. Gal. 3.24, 25. And thus, though it was the same grace and life in Christ; yet in respect of this full and cleer dispensation that is now by the Go∣spel, it was hid in God, and not so made known, as now since Christ came, it was to his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spi∣rit, and by them in the Gospel, in which the same Spirit still teach∣eth, Eph. 3.2-9. Col. 1.26. 1 John 1.2, 3, 4. And so of the Gospel as now declared, is the Affirmation in the Observation to be un∣derstood; namely, That the Doctrine of the Gospel is the onely necessary, and full sufficient, and compleat Doctrine to be taught, known, believed, and walked in, &c. And this doth yet further ap∣pear, in that 1 This Gospell is that Doctrine which God gave Jesus Christ to preach, and sent him, and filled him with Spirit to preach, and he preached it, Iohn 12 49, 50 and 17.8, 18. with Isa 4.2.1. and 61.1, 2. Luke 4.18. Mark 1.14. 2 This Gospel is that Doctrine which Jesus Christ hath given to his servants to preach, and sent them into the world, and endued them with spirit to preach, and given them in charge to preach it, Iohn 17.8, 18. and 15.26, 27. 1 Iohn 1.1, 2, 3, 7. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. 3 This Gospell is that Doctrine which the Apostles confessed to have received of Jesus Christ, Gal. 1.11, 12. 2 Cor. 5 19. 1 Iohn 1.5. To be sent to preach, 1 Cor. 1.17. And for the preaching whereof, a necessity was laid upon them, 1 Cor. 9.16. 4. This Gospel is that Doctrine which the Apostles did preach to all men, every where, Luke 9.6. Acts 2. & 3. & 4 & 5. & 10. & 13. &c. and professed themselves to have preached, 1 Cor. 15.1-5. and to determine to know no other doctrine, 1 Cor. 2.1.—4. and have denounced the curse on all that shall preach any other doctrine, Gal, 1.8.9. 5. Yea, the fulnesse, sufficiency, and compleatnesse of this do∣ctrine of the Gospel, doth yet further appeare many wayes,
1. In the Name of it, the Gospel, that is, a joyfull message of good newes, or glad tidings from heaven, Isai. 52.7. with Rom. 10.15. It is good newes indeed, in that it is truth (Prov. 8.4.8.) from God; of peace and good will to men: Nahum 1.15. Luke 2.10. for mankind; of salvation, 1 Tim. 2.4.5, 6. which is in Christ, Isa. 46.9. and shall be given to all that in beleeving come in to him, Joh. 3.16. 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. 2. In the Titles of it, which are all full of truth, the Gospel of God, Rom. 15.16. the Gospel of Christ, Rom. 1.16. the Gospel of the grace of God, Acts 20.24. the Gospel of Salvation, Ephes. 1.13. the Gospel of the Kingdome, Matth. 4.23. the glorious Gospel, 2 Cor. 4.4. the everlasting Gospel, Rev. 14.6. the Gospel of peace, Ephes. 6.15. the word of reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5.19. of life, &c. 3. In the sum of it, both in the narration and affirmation, she∣wing the Sonne of God to be come, and what he became, suffered, and did for us, and what hee is, and doth, and what hee will do in, and for all that beleeve in him, as this whole Treatise hath de∣clared. 4 In the holy Spirit that is promised to be sent forth in the mi∣nistration of this Gospel, by which Christ will continue his owne presence with his servants ministring the same, John 14.16, 17. & 15.26, 27. & 16.7.—15. Matth. 28.19, 20. 5 The effects of the Spirit in the Gospel, forementioned, both witnessed to be effected thereby, and examples of its efficacies set forth therein, as Tit. 3.4. And to conclude all in one word. In respect of the Medium or Doctrine; the Gospel is the Foun∣dation to be built on, Eph. 2.20. 1 Cor. 3.10.11. the way to walk in, Col. 2.6. 2 Joh. 9. and the Schoolmaster to guide, and lead in the way, Tit. 2.11, 12, &c. and how full, and prevalent; this whole treatise hath shewn in particular. And as God hath given us foundation; so likewise one way, Jer. 32.39. and as Jesus Christ is the foundation, the way, the truth, & the life, and the Prophet and Leader, 1 Cor. 3.11. John 14.6. Acts 3.22,—26. and his Spirit that by which hee discovereth, testifieth, draweth to, and buildeth on himselfe, comforteth, sanctifieth, tea∣cheth and leadeth his children, Iohn 14.26. & 15.26. & 16.13, 14, 15. Rom. 8.2.14; even so the Doctrine of the Gospel is the Medium
or instrument through which, Christ by his doth all this, 2 Cor. 3.18. & 4.4, 6. whence, all such as abide in the Doctrine of Christ, are affirmed to have both the Father and the Son, 2 Iohn 9. Objection. But some are ready to object: this magnifying the Doctrine of the Gospel, makes void the Law, and taketh away all use there∣of; Answer. The truth is, It establisheth the Law, and leadeth to the right use∣fulness therof, which is met with (not in law-teaching & pressing, but) in the right teaching the doctrine of the Gospel: as may be seen, by comparing, Rom. 3.21.—31. with 1 Tim. 1.5.—11. For, by the Doctrine of the Gospell setting forth Christ under∣stood, and believed; the holynesse, righteousnesse, goodnesse, spiritua∣lity, and perfection of the Law is known and seen, not abolished: but ratified, and fulfilled in and by Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In that, 1. He came, and fulfilled all the righteous affections, and ser∣vices to the utmost, that it requireth. 2 He, as the publike man for us, suffered the curse, it sentenceth it too for all the sins it can charge us with. 3 He rose, justified, and presented himself righteous before God in the behalf of us. 4 Hee received spirit to send forth in the Declaration hereof, that men might believe on him, and in belie∣ving on him; have him for their righteousnesse before God, and be freed from being under the obligation of the Law: to be under the obligation of grace, to depend on him, and so receive spirit from him, to conform them to himself, & so raise up from a better prin∣ciple. The righteous affections, and services, law called for, and gave no strength whereby they might be produced, and to give the life law promised, and could not give, Rom. 3.10-27. and 8.2, 3, 4. Gal: 5.16, 18, 22, 23. and 6.8. as may be seen in that before said, in the 6. and 14. Chapters. In receit of which grace in the doctrine of the Gospell; as the be∣liever is freed from the obligation of the Law: so hee enjoyeth the goodnesse thereof, in the right ends and uses of it, in that 1 They own themselves, as in, and of themselves, the sinners, and cursed ones for whom Christ was made sinne, and a curse, and so are dead to themselves, their own strength, wisdome, and righteous∣nesse, Gal. 5.24. and 2.19, Rom: 10.3, 4.
2 They see the mercy of God in giving the law for such ends, and freeing them from the obligation of it, Rom: 7.9-25. and 8.2. 3. They are in every thought of this Law, kept from turning to it again for life of justification, sanctification, or glory: and so occasio∣ned to stick closer still to Christ for all, Rom: 7.9-25. Phil. 3.7, 8. 4 They, in remembring any good that law bound them to; count themselves much more obliged for the grace of Christ to doe it, 1 Cor: 8.8, 16. Ephes. 6.1-4. 5 They have the commands, as coming from the Gospell, not to get life; but to testifie and exercise charity, 1 Tim. 1.5. 6 They can, in Christ, see all the commands turned into Promises: so, as in hearkning to him, he will effect all in them, Psalm: 81.8, 9. and 138.8. So that; the Doctrine of the Gospell containes all that is meet to be taught: and doth not abolish, but establish the Law. Observation 2. 2 That the Doctrine of the Gospell containeth both the Word, of the beginning of Christ: setting forth what he hath done; and re∣ceived, and is, for all, and hath to bestow on them when they be∣lieve: And all the everlasting Covenant, and new Testament setting forth, what he is to, and will in due season doe for those that in be∣lieving are made one with him, Heb: 6.1-4. and 8, & 9, as is shewn throughout this Treatise; The first of these is to be preached to all men, as the foundation to repentance, faith, &c, Heb. 6.1-9. The second is to be opened to Believers for the encouragement of their hope, and for their edification, &c. Obser. 3. 3 That the grace of God discovered by the Spirit of Christ in this Gospell, and put in the heart of the Believer; is through the same Spirit, a sufficient Prop and School-master for, and to the Be∣liever: to witnesse peace, to comfort, renew, teach, lead, and preserve; in wayting for the coming of Christ, Tit: 2.11, 12. Gal: 5.5, 16, 18. Obser. 4. 4 That the believing-remembrance of this grace of Christ is the way of Believers, drawing frō Christ all receites, springs, & streams of consolation, and fruitfulnesse in themselves and for others: as is fore-shewn; it being the drift of this whole Treatise.
CHAP. 15. A pointing to some Applicatory usefulnesse. 1 IN this fore-discovery of the Gospell setting forth Christ; is Ground of Reproof, of 1. Those; that slander the Gospell of Christ, and of the grace of Christ, and the doctrine thereof, as insufficient to prepare men for Christ, or to sanctifie Believers, or as if it were Antinomianisme, and a doctrine of fleshly liberty. 2 Those; that confound things that are distinct, and make them one, and of like large extent, which the Gospell distinguisheth, set∣ting forth the one as more generall; the other, as speciall: As, the Reconciliation wrought by Christ in himself with God for men; And, the Reconciliation which by Spirit applying the former, hee worketh in men to God: His mission, to make propitiation, and offer sacrifice; And His mission, to preach the Gospell; And to His laying down his life, to satisfie Justice; And To confirme the New Testament; And To seale his ministration, and testifie love, and therein give us ex∣ample. 3 Those; that put all receit of eternall life, upon the very Act of Christs suffering, rising, and offering himself a sacrifice to his Fa∣ther; whereas all this did but procure it into his hands to bestow: and it is the spirituall application to the heart, in which the receite is. 4 Those; that take faith, only for a perswasion raised by conse∣quence, and arguments from Scripture, and frames, or that thinke faith to be nothing else, but a believing to be saved by Christ, or that one stands spotlesse before God. All which follies and mistakes, are discovered in this Treatise. 2. Here is ground of Admonition, and Exhortation, to all that through grace believe in Christ, diligently, and constantly at all times: and in all things
To heed the Gospels Declaration of Christ, and his grace there-through made known: And To abide, and walk in the acknowledgment, and faith thereof: And To suffer the grace there-through moving, and teaching; to have its perfect work in us, and to yeeld up thereto. And, how it will work in us, save, sanctifie, renew, comfort, and lead us; is already shewn: The experiment of the truth whereof, the Lord fill us with; As prayeth The unworthiest of all he hath shewn mercy to, Tho. Moore. FINIS.
