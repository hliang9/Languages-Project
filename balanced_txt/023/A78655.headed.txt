The Kings Maiesties Answer to the Petition of the House of Commons, sent on Saturday last, the nine and twentieth of this instant January, 1642. HIs Majesty having seriously considered of the Petition presented to him from the House of Com∣mons, on Wednesday the six and twentieth of this moneth, returns this answer. That he was in good hope his gracious Message, the twentieth of this moneth, to both Houses would have produced some such overture which, by offering what is fit on their parts to doe, and what is proper for his Majesty to grant, might beget a mutuall confidence in each other. Concerning the Towre of London, his Majesty did not expect, that having preferred a person of a knowne fortune, and an unquestionable reputation to that trust, hee should bee pressed to remove him without any particular charge objected against him, and therefore returnes this answer, That if upon due examination any particulars shall be presented to his Majesty, whereby it may appeare that his Majesty was mistaken in his opinion of the Gentleman, and that he is unfit for the trust committed to him, his Majesty will make no scruple of discharging him, but otherwise his Majesty is obliged in justice to himselfe, to preserve his own worke, lest his favour and good opinion may prove a disadvantage and misfortune to his servants without any other accusation, of which his Maje∣sty doubts not this House of Commons wil be so tender, (as of all businesse wherein his Majesties honour is so much concerned) that if they find no materiall exceptions against his person, they will rather endevour to satisfie and re∣form the feares of other men then (by complying with them) presse his Majesty to any resolution which may seeme so much to reflect upon his honour and justice. For the Fortes and Castles of the Kingdome his Majesty is resolved that they shall allways be in such hands (and onely in such) as the Parliament may safely confide in: But the nomination of any person to those places, being so principall and inseperable a flower of his Crowne, vested in him and derived to him from his Ancestors by the Fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome hee will reserve to himselfe; In bestowing whereof, as his Majesty will take care that no corrupt or sinister courses shall prevaile with him, so he is willing to declare that he shall not be indu∣ced to expresse that favour so soon to any person as to those whose good demeanour shall be eminent to him or his Parliament: And if he now hath or shall at any time by misinformation confer such a trust upon an undeserving person he is and alwayes will bee ready to leave him to the wisdome and justice of his Parliament. For the Militia of the Kingdome (which by the Law is subject to no command but of his Majesty, and of au∣thority lawfully derived from him) when any particular course for ordering the same (which his Majesty holds very necessary for the peace and security of his Kingdome) shall be considered and digested by his Parliament, and propo∣sed to his Majesty, his Majesty will return such an answer, as shall be agreeable to his honour and the safety of his people, His Majesty being resolved only to deny those things, the granting whereof would alter the fundamentall Laws, and endanger the very foundation upon which the publike happinesse and welfare of his people is founded and constituted, and would nourish a greater and more distructive jealousie betweene the Crowne and the Subjects, then any of these which would seem to be taken away by such a satisfaction: And his Majesty doth not doubt that his having granted more then ever King hath granted will ever perswade his House of Commons to aske more then ever subjects have asked. And if they shal acquaint his Majesty with the particular grounds of their doubts & feares, he will very willingly apply remedies proportionall to those fears. For his Majesty cals God to witnesse that the preserva∣tion of the publike peace, and the laws and liberties of the Subjects, shall always be his Majesties care and industry as of his life and the lives of his dearest Children. And therefore his Majesty doth conjure the house of Commons by all the acts of Iustice and favour they have received from him this Parliament, by their hopes of future happinesse in his Majesty, and in one anothers love of Religion and the peace of this Kingdome (in which that of Ireland cannot be forgotten) that they will not be transported with jealousies and apprehensions of possible dangers, to put themselves and his Majesty into reall and present inconveniencies, but that they will speedily pursue the way, proposed by his Majesties former message which in humane reason is the onely way to compose the distractions of the Kingdom; and with Gods blessing will restore a great measure of felicity to King and People. London, Printed for Iohn Burroughes, 1642.
