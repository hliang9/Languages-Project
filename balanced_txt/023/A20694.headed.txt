TO THE MOST GRACIOVS and Sacred Princesse ANNA QVEENE of Eng∣land, Scotland, France, and Ireland. SInce I had accesse to your Highnesse at VVinchester, (most gracious Queene) I haue beene twice vnder sayle for Denmarke, hastning my returne to my most royall King and Master, your deare and worthiest Brother; but by contrary windes and frost, I was forst backe a∣gaine, and of necessitie compeld to winter here in your most happie Kingdome. In which time I haue endeuoured by my poore labour and study to manifest my humblenesse and dutie to your highnesse, being my selfe one of your most affectionate Subiects, and also seruant to your most Princely Brother, the onely Patron and Sun-shine of my else vnhappie Fortunes. For which respects I haue presumed to De∣dicate this worke of Musicke to your sacred hands, that was begun where you were borne, and ended where you raigne. And though the title doth promise teares, vnfit guests in these ioyfull times, yet no doubt pleasant are the teares which Musicke weepes, neither are teares shed alwayes in sorrowe, but sometime in ioy and gladnesse. Vouchsafe then (worthy Goddesse) your Gracious protection to these showers of Harmonie, least if you frowne on them, they bee Metamorphosed into true teares. Your Maiesties in all humilitie deuoted, IOHN DOVVLAND.
To the Reader. HAuing in forren parts met diuers Lute-lessons of my compo∣sition, publisht by strangers without my name or approbation; I thought it much more conuenient, that my labours should passe forth vnder mine owne allowance, receiuing from me their last foile and polishment; for which consideration I haue vndergone this long and troublesome worke, wherein I haue mixed new songs with olde, graue with light, that euery eare may receiue his seuer all content. And as I had in these an earnest desire to satisfie all, I do likewise hope that the peruser will as gratefully entertaine my endeuours, as they were friendly meant. This onely obseruation I must set downe in the playing of my Lute-lessons for tuning of the Lute, which is, that the 7.8.9. string open, do answere in the eight the base string aboue, what letter soeuer it be that carries the base: As for example. Example. Yours IOHN DOVVLAND.
