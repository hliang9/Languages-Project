THE Petition of Themis AGAINST THE Salamancha Fiend. The humble Petition and Complaint of the Virgin THEMIS, SHEWETH, THat She hath been shamefully Deflowred, Ravished, and Dishonou∣red, by an infamous proffigate Wretch, call'd by the name of T.—O—, and formerly stil'd the Salamanca Doctor; but that learned University hath generously done it self that Justice, as to disown ever to have known, or to have been concern'd with o great a Villain; though (notwithstanding his very name is a scandal to the Protestant Religion) he is in this Kingdom permitted to wear the Canonical Robe; to bear the name of Priest, and Doctor of the Church; and yet it is believed he never receiv'd any Orders in the Church of England, or any Church whatsoever. What is this, but to be▪paw our Reform'd Church, and make it stink in the Nostrels of every rational man? when such Brutes, such Animals as these, which are neither Priests nor Christians, are [Nemine Contradicente] admitted to be the Supporters and Pillars of the Church o God. Nay, so far hath his noto∣rious Perjuries, his shameful Boldness, his Diabolical Machinations, his Witchcraft, his Art Magick, or something worse (I know not what to call it) prevailed upon the minds of the People of this Kingdom, that no sooner did this Monster appear, but immediately all the Faction went to work to pull down and destroy the Image of the Saviour of the World, that his memory might for ever be forgotten; and this Devil be erected in his place, as the only Saviour o us all, and of this Nation: for Saviour of the Nation is the title once was given him. In the year 1678. did this ugly Fiend appear in this Kingdom, (sent, no doubt, from Hall) to speak the Prologue to a most Horrid, Hellish Damnable, Pha∣natical Conspiracy. The Prologue, ('tis true) was an ugly frightful sound, a Popish Plot; but the bloody Tragedy which follow'd, proved a most inhuman direful Conspiracy indeed, too black for Hell, where certainly it was hatch'd, but here to be acted by the Sober Party: And the business to be done, was, the Destruction of your Sacred Majesty, the Protestant Religion, and Govern∣ment; and 'tis no wonder if it was to the amazement of your Majesty and your Privy-Councel since all the world who heard of it stood at gaze, and knew not what to say or think. 'Tis not o be wonder'd at if your Majesty thought your self unsafe till this Phanatical lot (which was christned a Popish One) was search'd to the bottom; But now at last, by Heavens Providence and your Majesties care, we are come to the very root of it, and every eye that is but half open sees the Engines, and whole contrivance of this direful Machination: To go about to prove it to your
Majesty, and your Honourable Privy-Councel, that we have been all trik'd, shamm'd and abus'd by the perjuries of this Villain O—, who, at the same time that he pretended to swear For your Majesty, swore Against you; when he seem'd concern'd for your Sacred Person, and your Kingdoms Preservation, he was actually destroying it; and at that very time when he made all the World believe that his great care was to defend your Majesties Lie, was this Rogue designing to murder you: I say, to go about to prove this, would be to imagine all the World blind, that all Mankind were metamorphos'd into Batts and Owls; it would be to seek the Sun with a Torch at Noon-day. The premisses consider'd, your Petitioner humbly prays, That the villainies of this impudent Fellow may farther be detected in some of your Majesties Courts of Judicature, and that he may have a st fward for all the Bloody Service he hath done the Devil and the Lord Shaftsbury; That all his Perjuries may be summ'd-up, and prov'd against him; That all his Contradictions may be reckon'd, and in gross laid before him; That the huge Sea of innocent Blood which he hath shed may be produced, to cry out aloud against this Murderer for Justice; That his foul mouth may be open'd wide, that each one may see the Hell that is there; That his viperous Tongue may be drawn forth, that all the World may see how it is infected with a killing Poyson, and that his horrid Bla∣sphemies may there appear in their natural colours; That his beastly Buggeries may be proved upon him, and that the foul Monster may appear in its own shape, which is no other than a prodigious lump of Deformity: And this being done, your Petitioner humbly prays, That Judgment may be pronounced. First, That he may be degraded from the Name and Title of Priest and Doctor; which is all he ever had; the Character we know he never received, though he hath been, and is permitted to exercize that Function, and swear In verbo Sa∣cerdoris, Secondly, That his Canon cal Robe be pluck'd over his ears. In a word, to make reparation to my Honour, and Innocency, let us see this shameless Villain strip'd naked, and fast bound at the foot of the Monument, stigmatized with the infamous Characters of his life, viz. Infidelity, Atheism, Lying, Perjury, Blasphemy, Buggery, Treason, Pillage, Napine, Sacriledge, Murder, Impudence, Ignorance, no Christian, no Priest, no Doctor, no Saviour, but a Devil without a cloven Foot. Thus, Dread Monarch, let us see this Monster exposed to the scorn and de∣rision of all the world, that he may be a terror to Posterity and future Ages; And your Petitioner (as in duty bound) shall ever pray for your Majesties Health, long Life, and happy Reign, &c. THEMIS. London: Printed for the University of Salamancha, 1684.
