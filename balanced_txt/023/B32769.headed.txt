The French King's Declaration of War against the Hollanders. AFter all that his Majesty hath done to give Peace to Europe, the Im∣portant places he hath restored to attain to the Treaty concluded at Nimeguen in the year 1678, and the care he has since taken, not only for the Establishment of the Truce, but also for the changing it into a perpetual Peace, his Majesty had reason to hope, that the States-General of the United Provinces of the Low Countreys, who had shewn so much earn∣estness for the conclusion of that Truce, would have been no less zealous for the maintaining of it. In the mean time his Majesty has had divers Ad∣vices for several months past, That the said States suffering themselves to be carried away by the desires of those who have no other intentions than to see a War begun again in Europe, were making extraordinary Levies and Preparations, and entring into Engagements with several Princes of the Empire, to hinder, by all manner of ways, the Establishment of the Cardi∣nal of Fustemberg in the Electorate of Cologne. And his Majesty finding himself obliged to support the Interests of the said Cardinal, whose Election was positively declared to be opposed against all manner of Forms, only because he was believed to be engaged in his Majesties Interests; He exhor∣ted the said States-General, by his Ambassador the Count d'Avaux, not to employ the extraordinary Forces they were raising in any thing that might disturb the Quiet of Europe; and caused it to be declared to them in express terms, that he should look upon what they attempted against the Cardinal of Fustemberg, as if it were against his own Dominions: His Majesty has been since informed that they have not forborn to begin the execution of their projects; and that they have drawn together an Army under the Com∣mand of Prince Waldeck, which is actually joyned with the Forces of the Princes that are leagued together against the Interest of the Cardinal of Furstemberg; Which his Majesty being no longer willing to dissemble, has resolved to declare War, as he doth by these Presents, against the said States-General of the Ʋnited Provinces of the Netherlands as well by Sea as by Land. His Majesty for this effect commands and enjoyns all his Subjects; Vassals and Servants to fall upon the Hollanders; and has expresly forbidden, and does forbid the having henceforward any Communication, Commerce or Intelligence with them upon pain of death. And to this end his Majesty does revoke all Permissions, Passports, Safeguards, and Safe Conducts that may have been granted by himself, or his Lieutenant-Generals; and other his Officers contrary to these presents; and has declared; and does declare them to be null; and of no effect and force; forbidding all persons whatso∣ever to have any respect to them. His Majesty orders and commands; that the Lord Admiral; Mareschals of France; Governors and Lieutenant-Generals for his Majesty in his Provinces and Armies; Mareschals de Camp; Colonels; Captains; Commanders & Conducters of his Forces as well Horse as Foot; French & Forreigners; and all other his Officers to whom it shall appertain; to cause the Contents of these Presents to be put in execution; within the extent of their respective Powers and Jurisdictions; for such is his Majesties Pleasure. He wills also and enjoyns; that these Presents be published and affixed in all the Towns as well Maritime as others; and in all the Ports; Harbours; and all other places of his Kingdom; and the Territories under his obedience; where it shall be needful; to the end none may pretend cause of Ignorance. Given at Versailles the 26th of November 1688. Sign'd Louis; and underneath Col∣bert. DƲBLIN; Re-printed; 1688.
