ANATOMICAL EXERCITATIONS, Concerning the GENERATION Of Living Creatures: To which are added Particular Discourses, of Births, and of Conceptions, &c. By WILLIAM HARVEY, Doctor of Physick, and Professor of Anatomy, and Chirurgery, in the COLLEDGE of Physitians of LONDON. LONDON, Printed by James Young, for Octavian Pulleyn, and are to be sold at his Shop at the Sign of the Rose in St. Pauls Church∣yard. 1653.
TO THE Venerable, & highly Accomplish't, THE PRESIDENT & FELLOWS of the COLLEDGE of Physitians in LONDON, GEORGE ENT Wisheth Health and full Felicity. ABout Christmas last, while, full weary of anxious, and in the end not much avai∣ling Solicitude, I endeavoured to render my mind serene, and free from that Eclipse; I addressed my self to that Eminent Person, the chiefest Glory and Ornament of our Colledge, Doctor Harvey, at that time resi∣ding not far from the City: and found Him very intent upon the per∣scrutation of Natures Works, and with a Countenance as cheerful, as Mind imperturbed, Democritus like, deep∣ly
searching into the Causes of natu∣ral things. I then instantly saluted Him, with, Are all Affaires well, and right? How can they, He gravely answe∣red, when the Common-wealth is sur∣rounded with intestine troubles; and I my self as yet far from land, tost in that tempestuous Ocean? And, un∣feignedly (added He) if the comfort of my Studies, and the remembrance of many things, long since fallen un∣der my observation, were not some re∣freshment to my Mind; I know not what could prevaile upon me, to de∣sire to survive the present. So it hath happened, that this umbratile kind of life, and vacation from publique Cares, which commonly causeth a Sadness of Mind in others, hath pro∣ved a Sovereign Remedy to mine. Here I answering, said, Sir, I shall soon afford you the Reason of that happy Event; which is this: While
the greatest number of men flatter themselves with thoughts of growing wise, by the notions of others Brains, and (without any addition, unless the deceitful Gloss of different Phrase, and new Method) with ostentation obtrude upon the World the Traditi∣ons of the Ancients; it hath been al∣ways your choice, about the secrets of Nature, to consult Nature Her selfe. And this kind of Study ever hath as less of Fallacy, so more of Delight: in regard, that frequently, while you are fixt upon the indagation of some one thing, many others offer them∣selves to your observation; and such, perhaps, of which you had no thought to enquire. For, your self (I well remember) was pleased once to tell me, that you never yet Dissected any Animal (and, indeed, you have dis∣sected very many) but you found in it somewhat beyond your expectation, and which you never so much as thought of before.
'Tis true, replied He; it hath e∣ver been the delight of my Genius, to make strict Inspection into Animals themselves: And I have constantly been of opinion, that from thence we might acquire not only the knowledge of those less considerable Secrets of Na∣ture; but even a certain Adumbra∣tion of that Supreme Essence, the Creator. And, though I was ever ready to acknowledge; that many things have been discovered by Lear∣ned Men of former times: Yet do I still believe, that the number of those things which remain yet concealed in the darkness of Impervestigable Na∣ture, is incomparably greater: nay, I cannot forbear frequently to wonder, and sometimes smile at those, who perswade themselves, that all things were so consummatly and absolutely delivered by Aristotle, Galen, or some other great Name, as that no∣thing was left to the superaddition of
any, that succeeded. Nature, tru∣ly, is Her self the most faithful In∣terpreter of Her own secrets: and what she exhibits, either more brief∣ly, or more obscurely, in one kind, the same she explains more largely and openly, in another. No man doubtless, hath ever rightly deter∣mined of the Use, or Office of any Part; who hath not in many Ani∣mals, beheld, and with himself di∣ligently considered the Fabrick, Si∣tuation, annexed Vessels, and other Accidents thereof. Those Ancient Oracles of Wisdom did terminate the knowledge, as of all Countries, so also of all Animals, Plants, and o∣ther things whatever, allmost with the narrow limits of Greece alone: But, to Us the whole Theatre of the World is now open, and, by the Se∣dulity of Travellers, we well know, not only the Place, Habits, and Man∣ners of its Inhabitants; but also,
what Animals, what Vegetables, what Minerals every Region is fur∣nished withal. Nor is there any Na∣tion so Barbarous, which hath not either by chance, or the constraint of some inevitable necessity, found out something for the common use and benefit of Mankind, which hath esca∣ped the invention of other Nations more Civilized. And shal we think that nothing of Commodity can accrue to the stock of Sciences, from these Helps and Advantages: but that all the Fountains of Wisdom were drawn dry by the First Ages? Certainly, this Fault is to be imputed to our own de∣fect of Industry; not at all to Na∣ture. To this, another Evil hath adjoi∣ned it self; which is, that many, wanting the Experimental cognition of things, from the formerly concei∣ved verisimilitude of some Opinion, afterwards boldly broach a positive
Judgment thereupon, as if it were certainly known: whereupon it fol∣lows, that they are not only grossly deluded themselves, but seduce o∣thers also (who are not sufficiently circumspect) into Error. These, and other Discourses of the like importance; flowing from the Doctor, with admirable readiness, as is customary with Him; I inter∣rupted Him, saying: Sir, How free you are from all culpability in this kind, all, who know you, sufficiently understand: and that's the reason, why many Learned and Judicious Men, who are acquainted with your Unwearied Industry, in the advance∣ment of Philosophy, greedily expect the Communication of your further Experiments. And would you then advise me, (smilingly replies the Doctor) to quit the tranquillity of this Haven, where∣in I now calmly spend my days: and
again commit my self to the unfaith∣ful Ocean? You are not ignorant, how great troubles my Lucubrations, formerly published, have raised. Bet∣ter it is, certainly, at some times, to endeavour to grow wise at home in private; then by the hasty divulga∣tion of such things, to the knowledge whereof you have attained with vast labour, to stirr up Tempests, that may deprive you of your Leasure and Qui∣et for the future. Yea but (answered I) to deserve well, and receive ill, is the usuall reward of Virtue: And the Winds, which raised those your troubles, have, like the Wind Caecias, drawn mischief upon themselves. With that, He shewed me His Exercitati∣ons, touching the Generation of Animals, A work framed, and po∣lished with very great pains. At sight whereof, I instantly rejoicing, said, I now have obtained what I
earnestly desired: and must tell you, that, unless you impart these Exerci∣tations to the World, you will both be wanting to your own Honour, and en∣vy the Utility of others. Nor shall you sustain any further trouble in the Business; for, whatever of Care is requisite to the oversight of the Press, I shall willingly take wholly upon my self. To this He condescended with much adoe, at first urging, among many other Disswasive Arguments, that this His Tractate would be im∣perfect, without the conjunction of the History of the Generation of Insects. In a word; at length I pre∣vailed: and He said, Loe, I resign these my Writings freely into your hands, with absolute power, either suddainly to publish, or for a while to suppress them, as you shall think convenient. Having returned Him very many thanks for so high a fa∣vour; I took my leave, and depar∣ted
as another Jason, enriched with the Golden Fleece. And when, up∣on my return home, I had surveyed the Book; I could not but admire that so vast a Treasure had laien so long concealed: And that, while o∣ther men arrogate so highly to them∣selves, onely for the entertainment of their nanseating Readers, with Trifles and Toies, and Dishes twice (yea, an hundred times) brought to the Table before; the Modesty of this Gentleman should be such, as to set so small a value upon these His Ex∣cellent Observations. And truly, when ever He hath been pleased to give any of his own Inventions leave to see the light, He hath not depor∣ted Himself with Ostentation, or su∣perciliousness, after the custome of many, as if an Oak had spoken, or he had deserved a draught of Hen's-Milk: but, His Dictates were Ora∣culous, and Merits above the reach
of Elogie, or Reward: but, with exceeding Modesty, as if onely casu∣ally, or without any difficultie of in∣quest, he had fallen upon the Disco∣very of those Mysteries, which, indeed, he long searched into with profest di∣ligence, and study indefatigable. And this also is an Argument of e∣minent Candour in Him; that he ne∣ver inwades the reputation of any Au∣thor, but every where delivers his own judgement, in mild and friendly language. For, with him it is Prover∣bial, that That Cause is worthy to be suspected for scarcely good and profitable, which its Author con∣tends for with brawling and fierce∣ness: But Truth can want no Patron. And when it was easie to him, to have woven this whole Web, from materials of his own; such was his care, for the prevention of Envy, that he yet chose to follow the clue of Ari∣stotle and Aquapendens, as if he
had contributed thereunto no more then meerly the Woofe. Of Him I shall speak no more, lest I appear to praise to his face a Person, whose Worth hath advanced Him infinitely above my praises; especially to You, to whom his Virtue, Candor, and In∣genie, are long since very well known. But, of My selfe, I shall adde onely thus much; that in this great Busi∣ness I have performed no more then the meer office of a Midwife: producing into the light this noble Issue of His Brain, in all its parts and linements perfect and consummate, as it is now presented to your View; but staying long in the Birth, & fearing, perhaps, some injurious Blast of Envy or De∣traction. To speak more plainly, I made it my Province to oversee and correct the Press; and because the Author writes so obscure a Hand (A thing, as we say, common to learned men (as that scarce any man, but who hath bin
accustomed thereto, can read it with∣out difficulty, I used all diligence to provide against the Errors of the Com∣positor, that might be occasioned there∣by; which I observed, not to have been duly prevented in the Impressi∣on of a small Treatise of the Doctors, not long since set forth. And thus, most Learned Sirs, have I rendered you the Reason of this my Writing to you; which is, to let you know, that our HARVEY hath Sacrificed to the Benefit of the Com∣monwealth of Learning, to the Dig∣nity of our Colledge, and to His own Eternal Honour. Farewel, and Prosper.
To the Incomparable Dr. HARVEY, On his Books Of the MOTION of the HEART and BLOOD, And of the GENERATION of ANIMALS. TO Sol, the grateful Persian homage payes; He Sees by them, and so Adores the rayes: Deeming the Suns just title to arise To th' Tribute, as to th' Vision of his Eyes. And such is thy due claime, Great Light of Art, Who to the long-dim World dost sight impart. To thy Loud Fame for ever be apply'd, As th' Conduct, so the Glory of our Guide. While gray Antiquity Oracular heares, Not for the Truths she brings, but for the Yeares, And her sowr Dictats from the Tripod thrown, Look more to be Obey'd, then to be Known.
Thy daring Art first stands her, and doth breed This Reseue thence, that Science is not Creed. Who for their Age alone doe Writers trust, Prize Armour, not for th' Proof, but for the Rust. From Books to Nature thy Appeale is made, Thy Copies by their Archetype are swayd. Though High and Reverend thy Authors sit, Yet the Creation is thy Classick Writ. The various Colonies, whose brood supplyes Inhabitants to Earth, to Seas, and Skies, These are thy Vatican, and onely these Are thy Infallible Hippocrates; Thy Sibyll-Volumes, and Thou knowst them all, Like their first Godfathen before the Fall. Their Natures, Kinds, Distinctions and Concent, The Parts conteinec't, and Parts continent, Their Order, Substance, Temper, Site, their Force, Relations, and confederate Entercourse.
Their different Cells which different Bowels bound, Rooft and partition'd from their Neighbours ground. The Numerous Intrals Thou hast searched through, Might both Appease the Gods, and Surfet too. Not in the dull Emerit Carcase, where The Shops remain where once the Workmen were; And onely yield this cold Account; there stands The Stuffe and Tools perhaps, but not the Hands. But in the Living Laboratories, when The Vitals ply'd their task like Lab'ring men; When Life and Industry one Fountaine fed, And to give over Work, was, to be Dead. And now the Beasts hold their Instructive life Innobled by the cunning of thy Knife. Their Fall heares Sacrifice to th' Publick good, Nor is it to be Slaine, but Vnderstood. There thy Observing Eye first found the Art Of all the Wheels and Clock-work of the Heart:
The mystick causes of its Dark Estate, What Pullies Close its Cells, and what Dilate. What secret Engiues tune the Pulse, whose din By Chimes without, Strikes how things fare within. There didst thou trace the Blood, and first behold What Dreames mistaken Sages coin'd of old. For till thy Pegasus the fountain brake, The crimson Blood, was but a crimson Lake. Which first from Thee did Tyde and Motion gaine, And Veins became its Channel, not its Chaine. With Drake and Candish hence thy Bays is curld, Fam'd Circulator of the Lesser World. Yet thou no sooner wroughtst this wonder out, Though proof both gainst the cool suspense of Doubt, And rougher Violence o'th' Despisers tongue, But Europe round with hot combustions rung: Its early first Defiance sprung up here, At last a swarm of Champion Pens appeare
From Forreign coasts, and to the conflict come, Some thy bold Challengers, thy Seconds some. But when Experience vanquisht their defence, And Prejudice was captive led by Sense: The Ingenuous laid down Arms, and fled to You, As their Instructor, and their Victor too. Thus twice endeer'd, thy Secrets we allow, By Truths at first, and by Opposers now. So Gold disputed, and Approved such, Comes Mettle, but parts Treasure from the Touch. A Calmer welcome this choice Peice befall, Which from fresh Extract hath deduced all, And for belief, bids it no longer begg That Castor once and Pollux were an Egge: That both the Hen and Houswife are so matcht, That her Son Born, is only her Son Hatcht; That when her Teeming hopes have prosp'rous bin, Yet to Conceive, is but to Lay within.
Experiment, and Truth both take thy part: If thou canst scape the Women! there's the Art. Live Modern Wonder, and be read alone, Thy Brain hath Issue, though thy  have none. Let fraile Succession be the Vulgar care; Great Generation's selfe is now thy Heire. M. LL. M. D.
THE PREFACE. SInce many have requested, and some have importuned mee; it will not, I hope, be unwelcome, (candid Reader) if what I have observed concerning the Generation of A∣nimals, out of Anatomical dissections (for I have found the whole matter to be much different, from that which is deli∣vered, either by Philosophers or Physi∣tians) I expose in these Exercitations, in favour, and for the use of the Lovers of Truth. All Physitians, following Galen, teach, that out of the Seed of Male and Female mingled in Coition, according to the pre∣dominant power of this, or that, the Child resembles either this, or that Parent, and is also either Male or Female. And some∣times they pronounce the Males Seed to be the Efficient cause, and the Females the Materiall; and sometimes again the clean contrary.
But Aristotle (Natures most diligent searcher) affirms that the Male and Female are the principles of Generation, and that she contributes the matter, and he the form; and that forthwith after Coition, there is formed in the Womb out of the Men∣struous bloud, the Vital principle, and first particle of the future Foetus, (namely, the Heart, in Creatures that have bloud.) But that these are false, and rash asser∣tions, will soon appear; and will like clouds instantly vanish, (when the light of Anatomical dissection breaks forth) nor will they require any elaborate confutati∣on, when the Reader, instructed by his own eyes, shall discover the contrary by ocular inspection; and shall also under∣stand, how unsafe, and degenerate a thing it is, to be tutored by other mens com∣mentaries, without making tryal of the things themselves: especially, since Natures Book is so open, and legible. I have therefore exhibited to publick view, what in these my Exercitations, I intend to deliver concerning the Generati∣on of Animals; not onely that posterity may thence discern the certain and appa∣rent truth; but also, and that cheifly too, that (by revealing the Method I use in searching into things) I might propose to
studious men, a new, and (if I mistake not) a surer path to the attainment of knowledge. For although it be a more new and dif∣ficult way, to find out the nature of things, by the things themselves; then by read∣ing of Books, to take our knowledge up∣on trust from the opinions of Philoso∣phers: yet must it needs be confes∣sed, that the former is much more open, and lesse frandulent, especially in the Se∣crets relating to Natural Philosophy. Nor is there any reason, why any man should be deterred by the trouble of it; if he will but so much as consider with himselfe, that even life it selfe is continu∣ed to him, by the never Wearied Agitati∣on of the Heart. Nor truly would this journy present so much of solitude and desart to us; did not most men by the custome (or fault rather) of the age wee live in, yeilding themselves up to slug∣gishnesse, desire rather to erre with the many, then with the expense of their paines and coine, endeavour to be wise with the few: when notwithstanding the Ancient Philosophers (whose industry also even we extol) went a quite contrary way to work; and by indefatigable toile sear∣ching after several experiments, have set
up a clear light to direct our studies. So that, whatever notable and approved thing we have in Philosophy, it all is de∣rived unto us by the paines and industry of ancient Greece. Yet when we content our selves with their discoveries, and calmly believe (which is meer sleepiness) that there is now no more place for new inventions, the spritely edge of our owne wit languisheth, and we extinguish the lamp which they lighted to our hands. And certainly he alone wil grant, that the whole truth was ingrossed by the Anci∣ents, (who is ignorant of the many noble discoveries, to pass by other Arts) lately found out in the business of Anatomy. And this was cheifly done either by such, who wholly intent upon some one thing, did casually descry some other: or (which is more commendable) by those, who fol∣lowing Natures conduct with their own eyes, have at length through a perplexed, but yet a most faithful tract, attained to the highest pitch of Truth. And in such an undertaking it is pleasant, not to be tyred onely, but even to faint away; where the Irkesomness of Discovering is abundant∣ly recompensed by the discovery it selfe. We use, being covetous of Novelty, to wander far into unknown lands, that our
own eies may witness, what our ears have received at second hand: where yet for the most part —minuit praesentia famam. Our sight decries report. Let us then blush, in this so ample, and so wonderful field of nature, (where per∣formance still exceeds what is promised) to credit other mens traditions only, and thence coine uncertain problemes, to spin out thorney and captious questions. Na∣ture her selfe must be our adviser; the path she chalks must be our walk: for so while we confer with our own eies, and take our rise from meaner things to high∣er, we shall be at length received into her Closet-secrets. Of the Manner and Order of attaining knowledge. THough there be one onely roade to Science, namely, that by which we proceed from things more known, to things known less; and from that which is more manifest, to that which is more obscure; and though Universals are chiefly known to us (for Science is begot by reasoning
from Universals to Particulars) yet that ve∣ry comprehension of Universals in the Un∣derstanding, springs from the perception of Singulars in our sense. So that both A∣ristotles L. 1. c. 2. 3. assertions are true, as well that in his Physicks; There is a way naturally lay∣ed from those things which are more known and cleare to us, to those things which are more intelligible and cleare by nature. For the same things are not both known to us, and simply so too: wherefore we of necessity must thus proceed; to wit, from those things which are by nature indeed more obscure, but yet are more clearer to us; to those things which are more cleare and intelligible by nature. But those things are first perspieuous and manifest to us, which are most confused. Therefore wee must goe from Vniversals to Singulars: for the Whole is more known by sense: now an Vniversal is a certain Whole. As that in his Analyticks. Singulars are more known by Post. 2. us, and doe first exist according to sense: for nothing is in the understanding, which was not before in the sense. And although that Ratiocination is naturally first and more known, which is made by Syllogisme; yet that is more conspicuous to us, which is made by Induction: and therefore we define Singu∣lars with more ease, then Universals: for there lyes more Aequivocation in Vniversals. Where∣fore
wee must pass from Singulars to Ge∣nerals. That which we have now delivered, hangs very well together, though at first it seem to clash: because Generals are first collected from Singulars by sense, and so farre onely are more known to us, as an U∣niversal is a certain whole and indistinct thing; and that Whole is more known to us according to sense. For though in all knowledge, we begin from Sense, because, (as the Philosopher said before) Sensible particulars are most known to Sense; yet Sensation it selfe is an Universal thing. For (if you minde it well) though (while we perceive) that which is in the outward organ of sense be a Singular, as suppose, a yellow colour, in the sight: yet that which is thence abstracted by the internall sense, and is judged and apprehended by it, is an Universal. Hence it comes to pass, that several persons, do at the same instant, abstract divers species, and fashion severall notions, even of one and the same Object. As it is evident in Poets, and Pain∣ters: who, though at the same time, and in the same place, all circumstances being alike, they behold one and the same Object, yet each of them, be they never so many, express and describe it a several way, ac∣cording
to the several Ideas which they have drawn in their Phansie. So that a Painter being to draw any one mans pi∣cture, though he take a thousand several draughts, will make them all distinct fa∣ces; and them too not onely differing from each other, but from the Archetype it selfe: yet with so small distinction, that if you look upon each of them apart, you will think hee still brings the same piece hee brought before: and yet set them all together and compare them, and you will plainely discover a difference. Now the reason of all this is, that in Ui∣sion, or the act of Seeing, each particular by it selfe was clear and distinct: which very particular, the Object being remo∣ved, (as suppose you should shut your eies,) abstracted in the Phansie, or laid up in the Memory, is presented obscure, and confused: nor is it any longer apprehend∣ed as a particular, but as some General and Universal thing. This subtilty Seneca doth elegantly ex∣press, Epist. 58. according to Plato's opinion. An Idea, saith he, is an eternal Exemplar of Natural things. I will explain this definiti∣on, that you may conceive it the better. Sup∣pose I intend to draw your picture, you your self are the Exemplar of that picture, from
whom my minde takes a representation, which she indeavoureth to pattern in her work. So then your face, which is my director, & which I labour to represent, is the Idea. And a li∣tle after, he saith. In my discourse even now I made use of a picture-drawer, to illu∣strate what I was speaking of. He, when he would paint Virgil, his eye is upon Virgil himself: Virgils face is his Idea, and the Exemplar of his future designe: now that which the Artist takes from this Idea, and worketh off, is the Picture. If you demand the difference between these two, it is this: the one is the Pattern, the other is the copy ta∣ken by the Pattern, and layed upon the work: He imitates the one, and makes the other. A Statue hath a face, but that face is but the Idos, or representation: But the Exemplar which the Statuary copies out, hath a face, and that face is the Idaea. Doe you desire a far∣ther explication? take it thus. The Idos is that which you see in the piece: the Idea is quite without the piece, and not onely with∣out it, but also had a being before the piece was at all. For those things that have been formerly observed, and either by use, or custome have taken deep root in the minde of the Artificer, doe consti∣tute art it selfe, and the Operative Habit: for Art it self is nothing but the reason of the
work, implanted in the Artists minde. And the same way by which we gaine an Art, by the very same we attain any kinde of science or knowledge whatever: for as Art is a habit whose object is something to be done; so Science is a habit, whose object is something to be known: and as the for∣mer proceedeth from the imitation of Ex∣emplars; so this latter, from the knowledge of things naturall. The Sourse of both is from sense and experience; since it is im∣possible that Art should rightly be pur∣chased by the one, or Science by the other, without a direction from Ideas. Yet in both Art & Science too, that thing which in sensible objects wee perceive, differs from the perception it self, which is kept in the memory, or imagination. That, is the exemplar, the Idea, the forme inform∣ing: this, the Representation, the Idos, the abstracted Species. That, is a natural thing, a real entity; this, a resemblance, or simili∣tude, and an ens rationis. That, is imploy∣ed about some particular thing, and is it selfe a singular, and an individual; this, is a kinde of universal and common thing. That, is in every Artist and Philosopher, a sensible thing, clear, and perfect; this be∣longs to the mind, and is obscure. For what wee discover by sense, is much more sure
and manifest, then what we discover by the Intellect: because the latter springs from the former, and is illustrated by it. To conclude, Sensible Objects are of them∣selves, and before Intelligible; but Intelli∣gible are after them, and arise from them: nor can we attain to them at all, without their help. Wherefore it is, that our judgement er∣reth about phantasmes and apparitions comprised in our minds, unless sense give a right verdict, established upon frequent observations, and infallible experiments. For in every Science, be it what it will, a diligent observation is requisite, and Sense it self must be frequently consulted. We must not (I say) rely upon other mens experience, but on our owne; without which, no man is a proper disciple of a∣ny part of natural knowledge; nor a competent judge of what I shall deliver concerning Generation; for without expe∣rimentall skill in Anatomy, he will no better apprehend it, then a man born blind can judge of the nature and difference of colours; or one born deaf, of Sounds. There∣fore (discreet Reader) trust nothing I say, about the Generation of Animals; I appeale to none but thine eyes. For since every perfect Science builds upon those
Principles, which it finds out by Sense: we must have a special care, that by customa∣ry dissections, we be sure those Principles are safely grounded. If we do otherwise, we may get a tumid and floating opinion: but never a solid and infallible knowledge: As it happeneth to those, who see forraign countries only in Mapps, and the bowels of men falsly described in Anatomical tables. And hence it comes about, that in this rank age, we have many Sophisters, and Book∣wrights; but few wise men, and Philosophers. And thus much I thought fit to pre∣mise as a Tast, that you may understand, by what helps I my self was assisted, and upon what consideration I was induced to communicate these my Observations, and Experiments: and that you treading the same path, may be able not onely to be in equitable Umpire between Aristotle, & Galen, but also forsaking al subtleties; and probable conjectures, and viewing Nature in her own glass, may search out many o∣ther things yet unrevealed, and perhaps more precious. Of the former matters, according to Aristotle. NO kind of knowledge is innate to us, according to Aristotle: For neither
Opinion, nor Art, nor Understanding, nor Speech, nor Reason it self, are in us by na∣ture, and from our birth; but all these are of the linage of those things, which hap∣pen to us from without, according to nature As also all those qualities and habits which are esteemed to be spontaneous, & placed within our own power; such are Virtues and Vices, for which we receive nei∣ther commendation, and reward, or dis∣grace, & punishment. The knowledg ther∣fore of any thing whatsoever must be ou proper purchase. But which are the first principles of this knowledge, is not the scope of this discourse. Yet I suppose it will not be amiss, t premise here, Whence, and How we com to know, that we may attain to a mo perfect understanding of the Generation Animals, and also take away any scruple which any man might raise about Aristotle opinion. For he affirms, all doctrine, an Analyt. post. l. 1. c. 1. Dianoetical discipline to be framed out of pre∣cedent knowledge: Whence it seems to in∣sue, that there is either no first knowledge or else that that first knowledge is bo with us; which is dissonant to what is sai before. This doubt is hereafter cleared by A∣ristotle Ib. l. 2. cap. ult. himself; where he teacheth th
manner how knowledge is acquired. For having taught, that all certain knowledge is gained by Syllogism, and Demonstration; and that all demonstrative Syllogismes, are built upon some first, true, and necessary principles; he at last inquires, how princi∣ples become known, and what is that notify∣ing habit; as also, whether habits are begot∣ten, since they were not in us before; or else, whether they lurked conceal'd, in case they were in us? We have not, saith he, those habits; for it happens that they are hid from those who acquire more exquisite knowledge by de∣monstration. But if we receive them, when we had them not before, how should we make it known, and how should we learn out of a non-preceding knowledge? It is plaine there∣fore that we have them not, and that they are not in us, and we not know of them; and that they cannot be begotten in men that have yet no habit at all. Wherefore it necessarily follows, that we have some power to attain them, and yet not such a one as is more excel∣lent, and exquisite then they. Now this seems to be a common thing to all creatures living: to have a connate power of Judging, which is called Sense. Now since they have Sense, some of them retain in them the things they perceive by sense, and some not. They who retain not,
have either no knowledge at all, or else no knowledge of what they do not retain, beyond the bare sensation it self. Others do retaine in their Soul something of what they perceive. And since there are many such, they are thus differenced; that in some there doth result a certain discourse from the memory of things retained, and in some not. By Sense there∣fore memory is made, as we say; and out of a frequent remembrance of the same thing, is experience made: (for many numerical Re∣membrances, are one Experience) but out of Experience, or an Universal resting in the soul (namely out of one, which is distinct from the many particulars, and is one and the same in all of them) is raised a Principle of Art, and Science: of Art, if it relate to Generation; (that is, to doing, or effecting;) of Science, if it appertain to that which is, (that is, to the knowledge of an Entity simply;) so that the habits we speak of, are neither naturally in us, neither are they made out of other habits more known, but they proceed from Sense. By which words of Aristotle, it evident∣ly appears, by what Order the knowledge of any Art, or Science is attained: Name∣ly, by Sense there remains an impression of the thing perceived: by that impression is made a remembrance of it, and from mul∣tiplied memory, proceeds Experience: from
Experience, Universal Reason, Definitions, Ma∣ximes, or common Axioms, which are the most certain Principles of knowledge. As for example, The same thing, under the same capacity cannot possibly be, and not bee. Every Affirmation, or Negation, is either true or false; and so forth. Wherefore, as we said before, no per∣fect knowledge, which may be called ours, is in us; but such as is in some sort derived to us from Experience, and Sense; or is at least examined, and approved by them, and strongly grounded upon some knowledge pre-existent in us. For without memory, there can be no experience, which is nothing else but a multiplied me∣mory: neither can memory bee, without a remaining impression of the sensative ob∣ject, and the object cannot remaine, where it never was. The great Dictator of Philosophy hath Metaph. l. 1. c. 1. another passage to this purpose. All men naturally desire knowledge. And this is evidenced, by the love of our Senses: amongst which we prefer the sight; because this chief∣ly conveyeth knowledge to us, and distingui∣sheth best of things. Now naurally Animals are sensative: but some of them remember not what they perceive by sense, and some do. And for this cause
some are prudent, some are more capable of discipline then others that remember not. Pru∣dent, without being taught; as all those that have not the sense of hearing, as Bees, and all such other kinds of creatures; But all crea∣tures may be taught which have both memory, and hearing too. Therefore other creatures have phansies, and memories, but have no title to experience. But Men have Arts, and Ratiocination. And to them experience comes by remembrance: for many recordations of the same thing, make one Experience. Wherefore experience seems much of kin to Art, and Science. For by expe∣rience men gain both Art and Science. For Experience begets Art (as Polus rightly notes) but Inexperience, Chance. By which he clearly shews, that no man Apud. Plat. in Gorgiâ. can be truely called prudent, or knowing, who doth not by his own experience (at∣tained by manifold remembrance, fre∣quent sensation, and diligent obser∣vation) know things to be so. For without that, we think onely, or beleive: and such a knowledge as that, is to be re∣puted other mens, rather then our owne. Wherefore fond and erroneous is that Method of seeking truth, in use in our times: while most men diligently inquire, not what the truth is, but what other men
say it is: and inferring Universal conclu∣sions from particular premisses, & thence shaping to themselves irrational deducti∣ons, they transmit to us things like truth, for truth it self. Hence it is, that Sophisters and halfe-knowing men, polling other mens inven∣tions, saucily impose them upon us for their own; (shifting onely the phrase and order, and adding some impertinencies of their own) and render Philosophy (which ought to be clear and perspicu∣ous) obscure, intricate, and confused. For whosoever they be that read authors, and do not, by the aid of their own Senses, ab∣stract true representations of the things themselves (comprehended in the authors expressions) they do not resent true Ideas, but deceitful Idols, & Phantasms; by which means they frame to themselves certaine shadows and Chimaera's, and all their theory and contemplation (which they count Science) represents nothing but waking mens dreams, and sick mens phrensies. Give me leave therefore to whisper this to thee (friendly Reader) that thou be sure to weigh all that I deliver in these Exerci∣tations, touching the Generation of living Creatures, in the steady scale of experi∣ment; and give no longer credit to it,
then thou perceivest it to be securely bot∣tomed, by the faithful testimony of thy own eyes. This very thing did Aristotle per∣swade us to; who when he had discour∣sed much of Bees, added at last: That the Generation of Bees is after this manner, ap∣pears De gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. by reason, and by those things which are seen to come to pass after the maner of Bees. Yet have we not a sufficient discovery of what may fall out. Therefore when the discovery shall be compleated, then is Sense more to be trusted to, then Reason. For so far onely is Reason to be relied upon, as those things which are demon∣strated, agree with those things which are perceived by sense. Of the Method to be observed in the knowledge of Generation. SInce therefore in the Generation of A∣nimals (as in all other things of which we covet to know any thing) every inqui∣sition is to be derived from its Causes, and chiefly from the Material and Efficient; it seems fit to me, looking back on perfect animals (namely by what degrees they are begun, and compleated) to retreat, as it were, from the end to the beginning: that so at last when there is no place for farther
retreat, we may be confident we have ar∣rived at the principles themselves: and then it will appear, out of what first mat∣ter, by what efficient, and what procession the plastick power hath its original; and then also what progress Nature makes in this work. For both the first, and re∣moter matter, appears the clearer (being stripped naked as it were) by Negation; and whatsoever is first made in Generation, that is, as it were, the material cause of that which succeedeth. So, for example, A Man, was first a Boy (because from a Boy he grew up to be a Man;) before he was a Boy, he was an Infant; and before an In∣fant, an Embryo. Now we must search farther, what hee was in his Mothers Womb, before he was this Embryo, or Foetus; whether three bubbles? or some rude and indigested lump? or a conception, or coagulation of mixed seed? or whether any thing else? according to the opinion of writers. In the same manner, before a Hen or Cock came to perfection, (and that is cal∣led a perfect Animal, that can beget its like) there was a Chicken; before that Chic∣ken, there is seen in the egge an Embryo, or Foetus; and before that Embryo, Hieronymus Fabricius Aquapendens hath descried the
rudiments of the Head, Eyes, and Spine of the Back. But where he affirms, that the Bones are made before the Muscles, Heart, Liver, Lungs, and all the Viscera; and that all the inward parts ought to exist before the outward; he relieth upon probability, ra∣ther then experience; and laying aside the verdict of sense, which is grounded upon dissections; he flies to petty reasonings borrowed from mechanicks: which is ve∣ry unbeseeming so famous an Anato∣mist. For he ought to have told us what daily changes his own eyes had discover∣ed in the egge, ere ever the Foetus came to perfection. Especially seeing he professed∣ly wrote the History of the Generation of the Chicken out of the Egge; and hath described in pictures what progress is made from day to day. It was, I say, befitting so much diligence, to have acquainted us from the allegation of his own sight, what things in the egge are made first, what last, and what happen together: and not to have confined himself to the example of build∣ing of Ships, and Houses, to render a clou∣dy conjecture and perswasion only, of the order, and manner of forming the parts. We therefore (according to the Me∣thod proposed) will explaine, first in an Egge, and afterwards in other Conceptions
of several creatures, what is constituted first, and what last, in a most miraculous order, & with a most inimitable prudence and wisdome, by the great God of nature; and at length we will discover, what we have found out, concerning the first mat∣ter out of which, and the first efficient by which, the foetus is made, as also of the order & Oeconomy of Generation: that thence we may attain to some infallible know∣ledge of each faculty of the formative and vegetative Soul, by the effects of it; and of the nature of the Soul it selfe, by the parts, or organs of the body, and their functi∣ons. Now this indeed we could not perform in all kind of Animals; because some of them cannot be gotten; and others again are so exceeding small, that our eyes can hardly discern them. Let it suffice therefore that we have done it in some creatures, which are more known to us; to whose platform, the first originals of all other creatures may be re∣duced. We have made choice therefore of such, as might render the credit of our experiments lesse questionable, namely larger, and perfecter creatures, and such as are within our own power. For in the larger creatures, all things are more con∣spicuous;
in the perfecter, more distinct; and in those that are in our own power, & conversant amongst us, more obvious: so that we have liberty (at pleasure) by searching into them, to rescue our obser∣vations from wavering hesitation. And of this sort, in the race of Oviparous crea∣tures, are Hens, Geese, Pigeons, Ducks Eishes, Shel-fish of both kinds (as Lob∣sters, Oysters, &c.) Fishes that have no shells at all, Frogs, Serpents: also Infects, as Bees, Waspes, Butterflies, Silkworms. And of Viviparous, Sheep, Goats, Dogs, Cats, all Cattel that divide the Hoofe; and in chief, the perfectest of all creatures, Man himself. Having thorough insight & knowledge of these things, we may then contemplate the abstruse nature of the Vegetative Soul; and discern in all creatures what ever, the manner, order, and causes of their Generation: because all other creatures agree either generically, or specifically with the fore-ci∣ted, or at the least with some of them; and are procreated after the same manner of generation, or else in a manner proporti∣oned to it. For Nature being divine, and perfect, is always consonant to her self in the same things. And as her works do ei∣ther agree or differ (namely in kind, speci∣es,
or some analogy) so her operation (that is to say, generation or Fabrick) is the same or different in them. Whoever entereth this new, and unfrequented path, and in∣quires for truth in the vast volume of Na∣ture, by Anatomical dissections, and expe∣riments, he meets with such a croud of ob∣servations, and those too in such exotick shapes, that to unfould to others the my∣steries himself hath discovered, will bee more toyl, then the finding of them out: for many things occurr which have yet no name; such is the plenty of things, and the dearth of words. So that if a man should cloath them in Metaphors, and express his new inventions by old words, and such as are in use: the Reader could no more un∣derstand them, then canting: and would never be able to comprehend the business, since he never saw it. And then again to mint up new and fi∣ctitious terms, would rather cast a mist, then enlighten. For so he must needs ex∣press things unknown, by that which is lesse known: and the Reader would be more afflicted to unriddle the words, then to understand the matter. And therefore Aristotle by unexperimented persons is thought obscure: And this perhaps was the reason, why Fabricius ab Aquapendente
chose rather to describe the Fabrick of the Chicken in the Egge by tables then words. Therefore be not offended, Courteous Reader, if in setting out the History of an Egge, and in the description of the Genera∣tion of the Chicken, I make use of a new me∣thod, and sometimes of unusual terms; nor think me hereby more desirous of vain∣glory, then of advantaging others by true experiments, and such as are groun∣ded in Natures self. To take off that pre∣judice, know, I tread but the steps of other men who have lighted me the way, and (so farre as is fit) I make use of their noti∣ons. But in chief, of all the Ancients, I follow Aristotle; and of the later Writers, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente, Him as my General, and This as my Guide. For as they which finde out new Plantations, and new Shores, call them by names of their own coyning, which Posterity afterwards accepts and receives; so those that finde out new Secrets, have good title to their compellation. And here, me thinks, I hear Galen advising; If we consent in the things; contend not about the words:
OF GENERATION. The Reason why we begin with a Henns Egge. EXERCITATION I. HIeronymus Fabricius Aquapen∣dens (whom, as I said be∣fore, I have chosen for my guide) in the beginning of his Book concerning the formation of the Egge and Chicken, hath these words: My purpose is to treat of all sorts of formation of the foe∣tus, taking my rise from that which proceeds from an egge; For this ought to precede all other discourses of this nature, in that it not only be friends us with a more easie discovery of Aristotles thoughts concerning this matter, but because the Treatise of framing the foetus out of an egge is much the fullest, and exceeds the other both in extent, and difficulty. But we begin our discourse from the history of an Egge, both for the reasons by him recited, and likewise, because we may thence borrow more in∣fallible grounds, which (in regard they are more
known to us) may enlighten us to contemplate the Generation of any other Animals. For since Egges are a cheap merchandize, and are at hand at all times, and in all places; it is an easie matter to observe out of them, which are the first evident, and distinct ground-works of Generation; what pro∣gress nature makes in formation, and with what wonderfull providence shee governes the whole worke. Fabricius goes on: That the contemplation of fra∣ming the foetus out of Egges is the largest of all, ap∣peares in this, that the greatest part of animals are be∣gotten of egges. For to pass by almost the whole race of Insects, and imperfect Creatures, which sense it self dis∣covers to spring from eggs; even the most part of perfect productions are of that extraction. Hither he refer∣reth, All sorts of Birds; and of Fishes too; (bating only Whales) also Crusted-fish, Shell-fish, and Fishes with∣out scales,; and amongst Terrestrials, all Creeping things, Creatures that have numerous feet, and also all kindes of Serpents; and amongst four-footed Beasts, all sorts of Lizards. But we pronounce (as shall appeare hereafter) all animals whatever, even Viviparous also, nay man himself to be made of an Egge: and that the first conceptions of all living creatures which bring forth young, are certain Egges, just as the first con∣ceptions of all Plants are certain seeds. And there∣fore Empedocles rightly stiled the seeds of Plants, a sort of Egges. The history therefore of Egges is most spacious, because it yields an insight into all kinde of generation. Wherefore of an Egge, we shall first shew, where, whence, and how it is made. And then, by what means, order, and degrees, the foetus or chicken is fa∣shioned, and perfected in the Egge, and of it.
Here again Fabricius: The productions of Ani∣mals do some of them spring out of Egges, some out of Seed, and some out of Putrifaction; and hence it is, that some are called oviparous, some viviparous, others the issues of putrifaction, or creatures born of their own accord; by the Greeks, . But I dislike this division; because all Animals may in some sort be said to be born out of Egges, and in some sort out of Seed: besides, they are stiled Oviparous, Viviparous, or Vermiparous, ra∣ther from the issues themselves bring forth, then from the original matter of which themselves were made; namely, because they produce an Egge, a Worm, or a living Creature. Some of them are also said to be sponte nascentia, creatures born of their own accord, not because they quicken out of pu∣trid matter, but because they are begotten by chance, by natures own accord, and by an aequi∣vocal generation, (as they call it) and by parents of a different species from themselves. For other Animals also do bring forth an Egge, or a Worm, as their Conception, and Seed; out of which, after they have exposed it to the wide world, they pro∣duce a foetus, and so are named Oviparous, or Ver∣miparous. But now the Viviparous are therefore so called, because they retain and cherish their conce∣ption, or seed, so long within their own bowels, till the foetus come forth shaped, and alive.
Of the place of Generation. EXERCITATION II. NAture (saith Fabricius) was first solicitous of the place, which she at length decreed to be either within the Animal, or without it; and appointed the womb to be the place, within the creature; but without, the egge: in the womb, nature generates of seed and blood; but, in the egge, of such parts as the egge is made of. For whatsoever is begotten of seed properly so called, is begun, and perfected, either in the same place, or in a diverse. All Viviparous creatures have both their original and perfection in the womb it self; but all Oviparous, as they have their founda∣tion within their parent, and there become an egge; so are they compleated into a foetus, when they are divided from their parent. And, in the Catalogue of these, some creatures continue their eggs so long within themselves, till those eggs be ripe, and accomplished: and thus doe Birds and Beasts too, as many as bring forth eggs; and serpents likewise. But others againe expose their seed whiles it is yet unperfect and immature, to acquire its growth, perfection, and ripeness from abroad: and thus do many sorts of Fishes, Froggs; also Fishes without scales, and both sorts of Shell∣fish, and Snails, whose eggs, when first excluded, are but designes or beginnings, being yolks onely, which do afterward invest themselves with whites, and by degrees attracting, concocting, and affix∣ing aliment to themselves, become perfect seed, and a compleat egge And of this kinde also is the
seed of Insects (which Aristotle saith is a Worme) which being exposed incomplete at the first, seek their own food, and so thrive, and enlarge, from an imperfect egge, to a perfect egge, and seed. But the Henne, and all other Oviparous creatures, doe lay a perfect egge; of which, from without the womb, they hatch a foetus. And for this cause Aquapendens mentions two places assigned to ge∣neration; one Internal, namely the womb; the other external, which he calls the Egge. But (in my o∣pinion) he might, upon better grounds, have cal∣led the Nest, or Repository, the external place; be∣cause in that the exposed seed is cherished, ripen∣ed, and hatched into a foetus. For the Generation of Oviparous creatures, is mainly differenced by their Nest. Nor is it less then admirable, that such little creatures should make choice of these rece∣ptacles with such exquisite prudence; and shape, build, guard, and conceale them, with such uni∣mitable art and contrivance: whence we must needs conclude (with the Poet treating of Bees) that they are endowed with a portion of divine inspiration: and that we may easier admire their uninstructed art and prudence, then attain unto it. Of the Ovary, or upper part of the Henns womb. EXERCITATION III. THe womb of the Henn is divided by Fabricius, into the Upper, and the Lower; the Upper hee names the Ovary.
The seat of the Ovary is next under the Liver at the spine of the back, above the descending trunk of the great Artery. For just in that place where in bigger sangineous creatures, the Coeliacal arte∣ry goes into the Mesentery, namely, at the original of the Emulgent veines, or a little lower; and in that place where the preparing seed vessels which go down to the Testicles have their rise, in all other sanguineous & viviparous creatures; & where also the cock wears his Testicles, there is the Hens Ovary found. For some Animals have their stones hang∣ing out, others conceal them about the Loins with∣in; in a middle space as it were, at the beginning of the preparing vessels. But the Cock hath his stones immediatly adjoined to the vasa praeparantia, as if his seed wanted no preparation. Aristotle in∣deed saith, that the Egge is begun at the midriffe; but we, saith Fabricius, in our treatise of Respiration, deny that Birds have any midriffe at all. Which diffi∣culty is thus resolved: Birds are not quite destitute of a midriff; because they have a thinne membrane instead of the midriff; which Arist. calls cinctum, or septum: but they have no musculous midriffe, as other Animals have, neither is it used by them for Respiration. But, to say truth, Aristotle acknowledged no muscles at all. Thus, in one and the same breath he accuses the Philosopher, and excuses him too: yet hee him∣self is in an Errour the while. For it is certaine, that Aristotle did acknowledge muscles (as we have elsewhere observed, and demonstrated) and also that membranes in Birds (which are not onely pla∣ced transversly to gird the body, but are also ex∣tended according to the longitude of the belly) do supply the place of the diaphragma, or midriff, and do conduce to respiration: as in another place in our Exercitations, concerning the Respiration of
animals, we have clearly proved. And, to say no more at present, Birds do not onely respire with much more facility then other creatures, but in their songs doe tune and accent their voices with manifold variety: yet, notwithstanding all this, their Lungs are so knit to their ribbes and sides, that they can be but very little dilated, raised up, or contracted. Besides all this, (though no man to my remembrance hath ever observed so much be∣fore) their Bronchia, or extremities of the rough Artery are hollow as far as the very abdomen, and they treasure up the inspired aire in the cavities of their membranes. Even as Fishes, and Serpents draw the aire into large bladders, which are seated in their abdomen or belly, and so reserve it, and by that means are conceived to swim the better: and as froggs, and toads, in the Summer time when they breathe most, doe imbibe much more aire then at other times into their numerous vesicles, (which occasions their wondrous swelling) that so they may afford more liberall exspirations in their croaking: So in Birds, the Lungs seem rather a thorough-fare, and a passage for breathing, then the adaequat organ of it. Which had Fabricius observed, he would not then have denyed, but that those membranes (at lest with the assistance of the muscles of the belly) doe serve for respiration, and execute the office of a diaphragma: since even that is not a respiratory organ, without the help of the muscles of the belly; though it have also another imploy∣ment in those creatures in whom it is musculous, and fleshy; Namely, to depress the stomack enlar∣ged with meats, and the guts distended with winde and excrements; lest the heart and lungs should be straitned by their intrusion, and the closet of life it selfe invaded. Now, since there is no fear of any
such mischance in Birds, their midriffe is membra∣nous, and exceeding advantagious to the work of respiration; and for this cause they are said to have a diaphragma. Moreover, were birds quite desti∣tute of a diaphragma, yet Aristotle were not to be blamed, for saying, That Eggs receive their first ru∣diment at the septum transversum; for by this name he onely points at the place where the diaphragma is commonly found in other Animals. So we also say, that the Ovary is scituate at the beginning of the preparing spermatical vessels, though a Henne hath no such vessels at all. The Perforation of the Lungs, by me first disco∣vered (of which I made mention but now) is in no sort dark and obscure; but, in Birds especially, very patent: so that in an Ostrich I found many perforations, into which I could easily thrust the top of my finger. In a Turkey, nay in an ordinary dunghill Cocke, and almost all Birds whatsoever, a probe being put into the winde-pipe, will finde an open and wide passage, clean through the lungs in∣to the cavities of the abdomen, or lower belly. Blow the aire into their lungs with a pair of bellowes, and you shall finde it hasten into the lower parts, and that not without a sensible force. Nay, we may very well question whether, even in man whilest he is living, the air doth not pene∣trate into the cavity of the chest, by the aforesaid passages. For could otherwise the putrefied mat∣ter of impostumated, and the blood shut out of the veins of pleuritical persons, flow from thence? How could the aire, when the breast is wounded (though the lungs be untoucht) rush out of the wound? or how could injections cast into the ca∣vity of the chest, be returned again with the spit∣tle? But of this at large in our Exercitations, of
the Causes, Instruments, and Use of Respiration. I return now to the Ovary, and the upper part of the wombe of the Henne; in which the first rudi∣ments of the Eggs are conceived, which are (accor∣ding to Aristotle) small at first, and white; but in∣creasing, afterwards become of a pale yellow. As for this upper womb mentioned by Fabricius, the truth is, there is no such thing at all, till the Henne have conceived, and hath the principles of Eggs within her, which may then be properly cal∣led a cluster of wheals. And therefore he saith very rightly: The superiour matrix is nothing else but al∣most an infinite crowd of yolks, which are amassed in one heap together, being of a round figure, and of di∣verse magnitude; amongst which there is a like diffe∣rence from the greatest to the least, as between a grane of mustard-seed and a walnut, or a medlar. This mul∣titude of yolks are united and knit together as it were upon a bunch: and therefore I call it a Vitellary, or a bunch of yolks, because it much resembles a bunch of grapes. As Aristotle also said of fishes that want scales, where he writes, That their eggs are laid as if they were glewed together like grapes; for as in a bunch of grapes, the berries are some biggest, some less, and some least of all, and each is tyed to its proper sprig, so is it in the Vitellary. But now in Fishes, Frogs, hard or crusted Shell∣fish, and Snails, the matter is much otherwise; for they contain in them Eggs of the self-same magni∣tude; which being discharged, do grow alike, are perfected alike, and at the same time produce yong ones. But in the Ovary of a Henne, and almost of all other Oviparous creatures, there is a distinct increase of the yolkes, from almost an invisible smalness, till they arrive to a complete magni∣tude: though the Eggs of Hennes (not unlike the
eggs of those creatures which conceive and lay their egges together) are hatched into chickens in the same nest, almost at the same time. Yet in Pigeons (which lay, and hatch onely two egges at a time) I have observed all the Eggs in the Ovary to be of a like magnitude, excepting only those two which were greater then the rest, and were now ready to descend into the second uterus, or womb; so that of them there is great increase, not by the multitude of their young at once, but by the fre∣quency of their repeated births, which happen e∣very moneth. So in cartilaginous Fishes; as the Thorn-back, the Fork-fish, the Dog-fish, &c. two eggs are only ripe at a time, and falling down on both sides from the right and left horn, they are cherished in the lower womb, and exclude their young alive (as the Viviparous creatures do:) yet in their Ovary they have almost an infinite number of eggs, and of different dimensions; in the Thorn∣back I have numbered above a hundred. But the Eggs of other oviparous creatures are ei∣ther perfected when they are out of the womb, as the eggs of fishes; or at least concocted, as the eggs of snailes, of hard shell-fish, and of spiders. The snailes they treasure up their eggs in froth; crusted shell-fish, (as shrimps, cray-fish, lobsters) carry them about fastned to their finnes; but the spider beareth them about with her, as it were in a bas∣ket wrought of her webbe, and so cherisheth them. The Beetle wrappeth her eggs in dung, (rowling them in it with her hinder leggs) and so layeth them up: and, in all these, there are an incredi∣ble number of eggs. Fishes have two oblong blad∣ders, or bags, as you may see in the Carp, the Her∣ring, and the Smelt; in all which, as there is no womb at all discernable, besides the Ovary, so is
this Ovary sometimes so thronged with eggs, that it far exceeds the bulk of the whole body besides. Of the Ovaries of these Carps and Mullets, amas∣sed together, and salted, and hardned in the smoak, is made that kinde of meat so much in re∣quest with the Greeks and Italians (called by these Botarcha, by the Greeks , that is to say, pickled eggs) such as is that which is found in our red Herrings, & the red and compacted seed with∣in a Lobster. That meat which is made of the salted eggs of Sturgem, is called Caviare, which re∣sembleth black sope, and is the delight of glut∣tons. In all fishes (which have a numerous offspring) so great abundance of egs is generated, that the whole capacity of the belly can hardly contein them, when they are newly conceived, much less when they are of any growth. And therefore in fishes, sa∣ving their Ovary, there is no other part dedicated to generation. For their eggs take growth abroad; nor need they any womb for that office. And this O∣vary seems to carry some Analogie to the resticles, or litle seminal bladders, not only because they are found in that place where the stones are bred in males; (for the stones in Cocks are scituate, as we have said, at the ingress of the Coeliacal artery, neere the midriff, and there the Hens Ovary is found) but also, because in both sexes of fishes, at the time of generation, there are two litle bags passing through the whole belly, alike in site, figure, and magni∣tude; which increasing at the same time, are fil∣led, in males with a similary, spermatical, and milky substance, (whence it is called fishes milke) and in the females, with litle invisible graines or sands; so that in the beginning of conception (by reason of their close fabrick) they look like a si∣milar
body, and like the males milk regularly coagulated, and may afterwards be discerned like the smallest sands clinging together in their pro∣per bags. In lesser Birds (which bring forth egges, and those few ones, but once a year) you will scarce finde any Ovary at all; but just where the stones hang in males, there in females, instead of an O∣vary, are found three or four bubbles (according to the number of egges, whose foundation they are) as discernable as the testicles of the males. In the horns of the Serpents womb (which are like the spermatical vessels of the males) appear the first rudiments of the eggs, like litle balls fastned on a string, as is usual in womens bracelets, or chaplets of beads made of amber. They therefore that are found in the Vitellary, or Ovary, are not to be counted perfect eggs, but the first ground-works or rudiments of eggs, which are in such order and magnitude disposed in the bunch, that one may daily succeed the other, to supply the hennes laying. But no egge in the Ova∣ry is cloathed with a white, for onely yolks are found there; which, as they gain growth, get with∣out the small ones; that being arrived to a larger room, they may the better thrive and enlarge. And therefore that of Fabricius is very true, where he saith, The greater yolks of the bunch are in the sur∣face, pag. 3. the lesser are in the middle, encompassed as it were by the greater; lastly, the least of all lie undermost. For as they get greater bulk by growing, they are separated from their fellowes; which, while it is doing, every yolke, besides his proper coat, bor∣roweth another from the Ovary, which encompas∣seth it without, and tyeth it to the foundation from whence it sprung: wherefore by Fabricius it
is called pediolus, sive pedunculus, the stalk, because by its means, as the fruit draweth nourishment and increase from the tree, so doth the yolk from the cluster. For this stalk is a membranous hollow fast∣ning, which is extended from the bottom of the cluster to the yolk: which so soon as it arrives at, it is dilated, and (just as the optick nerve is spread in the eye) co∣vereth the yolk with an outward coat. Hence Aristo∣tle probably called it , that is, the li∣tle umbilical appendix, or pipe. This litle stalk con∣veighs De Gen. An. l. 3. c. 2. with it many vessels into the yolke, through which they are many waies divaricated. These things are indeed truly delivered by Fa∣bricius, but he mistaketh, when he saith, This coat doth not environ the whole yolke, but onely a litle more then half of it, just as the cover of an acorn, called the cup: whence it cometh to pass, that the outward part of the yolke, being deserted by the fore-mentioned mem∣brane, is exposed to the view without veines, and ap∣peareth naked. For it embraceth all the yolk; but in the outward part of the yolk, it is not easi∣ly discerned from its own coat, because they both are very thin. But, in the fore-part, where the yolk respecteth the foundation of the cluster, this coat adhereth not to the yolk, neither doth it send any veines into it, but only begirts it like a bag. Every yolk assumeth a particular coat from the same foundation; and therefore this place is not to be reputed the common womb, since no∣thing is here to be found, beside the cluster, or heap of many eggs, of different magnitude, arising from the same foundation. Now this Foundation is a particular body of it self, arising at the spine of the Fowle, annexed to the great Artery and Vein, being loose, porous, and fungous, that so it may produce divers yolks out of
it self, and afford each of them their coats; which coats do afterwards stretch, as the yolks enlarge, and inclose them like a Bag, with a narrow neck, but a large belly, in like manner as glass-vials are fashioned by the breath of the Glass-maker. Fa∣bricius saith further; The yolks, as they spring from a very small original, being about the magnitude of the seed of Millet, or Mustard, so they are very litle, and white, as Aristotle observes, and do also increase by de∣grees; and, as the same Aristotle saith, grow like yolks, and yellow, till they attain the just magnitude which e∣very body knoweth them to be of. But I have observed them to be much less then the seeds of Millet, even as slender as the smallest wheals, or spots, or sands, (such as I have told you are found in the Ovaries of Fishes) scarce to be discovered by the eye it self, as if they were onely the ruggedness of the membranes of that part from whence they proceed. Of the Infundibulum, or Tunnel. EXERCIT. IV. THe next part of the Womb of the Hen, is by Fa∣bricius called the Infundibulum: for it is like a Tunnel, or Trumpet, tending down-ward from the Ovdry, (which it every where encompasseth) and growing wider by degrees, is terminated in the su∣periour production of the Womb. This Infundibulum doth afford a passage to the yolks (when their stalks are broken off) into the second womb (as Fabricius thinketh) and resem∣bleth the Tunicae vaginalis, or coat of the Testicles in
the Cod, consisting of an exceeding thin membrane, and easie to be dilated, that so it may entertain the yolks which dayly rowle thither, and conveigh them into the aforesaid Uterus. Do you desire an Illustration of this matter? fa∣shion in your minde a very slender plant, whose knobby roots may represent the cluster of yolks, and its trunk the litle vaginal, or sheath-like pipe: as the stalks of that herb do in the winter dye, and vanish away; so, in like manner, when the Hen ceaseth to lay any more egges, the entire Ova∣ry, together with the Infundibulum, are retired, and abolished, and (like useless things) quite dried up; leaving onely the fundamentum remaining, and some tracks and footsteps of their roots. That this Infundibulum doth onely supply the office of a thorow-fare, is hence enough evinced, in that the yolke is never found residing in it: but as the Testicles sometimes do through the Tunica va∣ginalis creep upwards into the Groin, and as those Testicles are in some creatures (as the Hare and Mole) hidden within the Abdomen, and do from thence again return and descend; so by the Infun∣dibulum do the yolkes slide down from the Ovary into the Uterus; and it supplieth the place of that Tunnel (as it also hath its form and shape) through which liquors are transmitted, from one vessel into an other of a narrower neck.
Of the Exteriour part of the Uterus of the Henne. EXERCIT. V. FAbricius prosecuteth the description of the Uterus, after the Ovary, and so by a perverse method, premitteth the treatise of the superiour part, and production of the womb, to that of the very womb it self. And is also too precise and conclu∣sive in assigning three circles to it, and in determi∣ning their certain scituations, when indeed them∣selves are uncertain. And there also he doth pre∣posterously repeat the definition of the Infundibu∣lum. Give me leave therefore to propose here my Ob∣servation, and history of the Uterus of the Henne, (which I apprehend to be more commodious, ac∣cording to Anatomical method) and to proceed from the outward parts to the inward, (contrary to the course of Fabricius.) In a Henne that is plucked, you may perceive the Fundament, not (as in other creatures) gather∣ed up into a ring, but having a depressed orifice di∣vided transversly, shrunk up as it were into two lips, the superior of which gathereth the inferior into it, and so covereth and concealeth it. That uppermost lip, or covering, ariseth from the root of the rump; and, as the upper eye-lid covereth the eye, so doth this the three orifices of the Privity, (name∣ly that of the Fundament, of the Uterus, and of the Ureters) which lye retracted under this covering, as under a praepuce, or fore-skin: as in the Lap of a Woman, the passage into the womb and bladder is
vailed by the labra of the privity, and the parts called Nymphae; so that, without dissection, or at lest some forcible retraction of that covering, nei∣ther the passage of the Excrements out of the guts, nor of the Urine out of the Ureters, nor of the Egg out of the Uterus, can appear in a Hen. And there∣fore those two excrements (namely the Urine, and the Dung) are rejected both together, as out of a receptacle common to them both, by lifting up of that covering, & so disclosing the perforation: and so likewise in coition, the Hen unvaileth her lap, and accommodateth it for the Cock that treadeth her: as Fabricius observed in a Turkey-Hen, which courted a Cock. I have seen an Ostrich-Hen (when her Keeper gently stroked her back, with designe to inflame her) groveling on the ground, lift aside that vaile, and expose and stretch out her lappe; which the Cock perceiving, being instantly cupid∣struck, proceeded to tread her; and having one leg on the ground, and the other on her back, with an exceeding large Yard (of the dimensions almost of a Neats-tongue) pursued his attempt: great was the noise and clamours on both sides, and their necks often extended and retracted, and many other expressions of content. Nor is this proper to Birds onely, but common also to other Creatures, which by removing aside their Taile, and extending their Lap, prepare themselves to receive the Male. So that the Tail in other creatures seems to be almost of the same use, with the Vail in the Hen, which, unless it be removed, or lifted up, there is neither passage for the excrements, nor the addresses of the Male. In Hinds and Does (as if they were more severe∣ly chast then other beasts) such a skreen of mode∣sty, and skinney covering, shrowdeth both the lap,
and passage of urine, which must of necessity be lift∣ed up, ere they can have conversation with the Male. In Beasts also that have tailes, there must be an elevation of them, before they can bring forth their young. And Midwives also, by unction and retrusion of the extremity of the os sacrum, do fa∣cilitate womens labours. A certain Chirurgion of my acquaintance, an ho∣nest man, being returned from the East-Indies, told me upon his credit, that in the Island called Bornea, in the Inland and Hilly parts of it, there are a race of men born with Tails, (as Pausanias writes of another place) and that he saw a Virgin of that flock, whom they had much ado to catch, (for they are wilde) who had a fleshy, thick tail, a span long, reflected between her leggs, to conceale her modesty: such care hath nature to hide those parts. The fabrick of this Covering in a Hen, is like to that of the upper lid of the eye, composed of skin, and of a fleshy and musculous membrane, with fibers every where drawn from the circumference to the Center; and its inward superficies, like that of the eye-lid, and fore-skin, is soft. It hath also in its ex∣tremity a semicircular small gristle, like the Tarsus of the eye-lid: and, beside that, between the skin, and fleshy membrane, a cartilaginous interstitium, from the root of the rump joined in a right angle to the semicircular Tarsus, or gristle: (as Batts have a kind of litle taile, concealed under their membra∣nous wings) by reason of which composition, this covering doth, as it were with a taile, shelter and hide the perforations of the privities. The Per∣forations in the Funda∣ment of a hen. Wherefore, no sooner is this protection cut a∣way, but certain perforations appear, whereof some are more apparent, others more obscure. The more
visible, are that of the fundament, and the lap; namely, the passage of the excrements, and the en∣trance into the womb: the obscurer are, as well that through which the urine flowes from the kidnies, as also that smaller one found out by Fabricius, into which (saith hee) the Cock doth immit his seed; which cavity notwithstanding Antonius Ul∣mus a diligent dissector in Aldrovandus did not own, nor any one else besides Fabricius, so far as I The Sink. know. These Holes are all so neer neighbours the one to the other, that they seem all to consent and pass into one and the same cavity; which (because it lies in common both to the excrement and the urine) may be called the Sink; because, in it, the excrements of the guts, together with the u∣rine descending from the reines, are mixed toge∣ther, till they be together excluded. And through this the egge also passing forth, worketh its way. The making of this cavity is such, as if both the excrements descended into the Bladder, and nature did abuse the urine into a natural clyster. And therefore it is something thicker and ruggeder then the gut, and also in ejection and coition, thrusts it self out, (the covering, as I have said, being re∣moved) and hangeth out like the inside of the gut: and at that time all the holes appear distinct∣ly; which presently again upon its retraction, be∣ing collected as it were into a purse, are hidden out of sight. The more conspicuous Holes, (namely that of The scitu∣ation of the orifice of the womb. the fundament, and the lap) obtain a contrary sci∣tuation in all fowles, from all other creatures; for in these, the Pudendum, or female genital, is seated foremost, between the right gut and the bladder: but in those, the passage of the Excrement is placed fore∣most,
and between that passage and the rump, the passage into the matrix. But that Hole into which Fabricius thinketh the The Per∣foration of the Purse, so called by Aquapen∣dens. Cock doth cast his seed, is discovered between this doore of the matrix, and the rump. But, for my part, I acknowledge no such employment of it; for, in Pullets or young Hens, it is hardly found at all; but in grown fowle it is promiscuously as well in the Cock as in the Hen. And, besides that, this hole is very small and obscure, and cannot there∣fore be imagined to be of so concerning an office; for it scarce admits the point of a small needle or a slender hair, and terminateth also in a blind and obscure cavity: nor could I ever perceive any se∣minal humour at all in it; though Fabricius affirm∣eth, that the semen is there reserved as in a purse, for a whole year together, and that in the interim all the eggs receive fecundity from thence, as shall be discoursed hereafter. All Birds, Serpents, Four-footed beasts, which are Oviparous, and Fishes also, (as is evident in Carps) The pas∣sage of U∣rine in a Hen. are endowed with Kidnies and Ureters, through which the Urine floweth: which Aristotle, and o∣ther Philosophers hitherto knew not. But Birds, and Serpents, whose Lungs are fungous, have but ve∣ry litle urine; because they drink but litle, and that by sips; and therefore they need no Bladder of Urine, but do deposit it (as we have said) into the common sink and receptacle with the dryer ex∣crements. But in Carps, and some other fishes I have found a Bladder of Urine. In a Hen, the Ureters descend form the Kidnies on both sides, (which Kidnies are large and ample and seated in the cavity or hollow of the back and do end in the cavity or common sink. But their
Out-let is so obscure, and concealed in the very entrance of the cavity, that to discover it from without, or to search it with the most slender probe, is altogether impossible. Nor is it indeed any great wonder; for in all creatures, even in the greatest of all, the insertion of the Ureters neer the neck of the Bladder, is dark and winding, that (though urine, nay and stones too do sometimes glide through them into the bladder) not so much as the aire it selfe can go back that way, nor the urine, be it never so much forced. All these things are clear in an Ostrich; in which I have found, beside the outward orifice of the com∣mon cavity, which was vailed by the Covering; an∣other orifice within the Fundament, which was round and gathered up, and shut as it were with a sphincter muscle. But to pass these, and return to our purpose. The Orifice of the Womb, or Lap; namely the passage out of the publik cavity into the womb of The Ori∣fice of the Uterus. the Hen, is as it were a certain soft protuberance or rising, loose, wrinkled, and orbicular; just like the end of the Fore-skin closed up, or a prominence of some interiour coat of the matrix. But it is scituate (as I said before) between the perforation of the fundament and the rump, tending something to the left hand; which Ulysses Aldrovandus conceives so to be disposed, for more convenient coition, and more commodious reception of masculine incur∣sion. But I have often observed, that the Hen doth indifferently incline her back parts towards the Cock, on which side soever he prepare his ascent, be it on the right or left. I finde no Penis, or Yard at all in a Cock, neither could Fabricius finde any, though it appear most manifest in Drakes, and
Ganders. But, instead thereof, I finde an Orifice in a Cock (not different from that of a Hen) but it is less, and narrower; which Orifice is like wise found in the Swan, the Drake, and the Gander: but the Penis of the Drake and Gander (in the act of Coiti∣on) is sent out of this orifice. In a black Drake, I saw a Penis of that extent, that after coition, the Duck pursued it as it trailed upon the ground, with intent to devour it; (deem∣ing, as I suppose, that it had been a worm) which occasioned the Drake to retract it sooner then his custom is. In a Male-Osirich, I found, within this orifice of the Privy-parta a very large glans, or nut of the yard, and a ruddy nerve, of the form and magnitude of a Deers tongue, or small Neats tongue; which I ob∣served him many times brandish in coition, stiffe, and something embowed: which, when he had dispatched into the female, he detained there a good space, without any commotion of these parts at all, as they had been staked together; yet all the while strange were the gesticulations of their Heads and Necks (as if they had approved their Nuptials) proclaiming their full compla∣cence. I have read in D. du Val, a most learned Physi∣tian of Rouen, that a certain Hermaphrodite was delivered up to the Chirurgians and Midwives, to determine whether he was a Man or a Woman. They, upon discovery, judged him to be a woman; and thereupon he was enjoined to habit himselfe like one of that sex. He notwithstanding was in the mean time accused of soliciting women, and playing the mans part. And at last he had a penis issuing out of its hidden prepuce, (as out of a wo∣mans secrets) which executed the mans office.
I my self once saw a mans penis so shrunk up (excepting onely when it was provoked) that no∣thing appeared in the wrinkled prepuce above the scrotum, but the meer extremity of the Glans. In a Horse, and some other creatures, the vast di∣mension of that part is shut forth from within. In a Mole also, that litle Animal, there is a great re∣traction of the penis into the skin and muscles of the Abdomen; and his female also hath a longer and deeper Matrix then is usual. I conceive, it is with a Cock, who hath no pe∣nis, as it is with the lesser sort of Birds; which quickly conclude their acts of coition, and do per∣form them by affriction onely. For the Orifices of the Privities (of the Cock and Hen) by often con∣junction, as by repeated salutes, do celebrate coi∣tion, not by one continued inition, (which orifices being turned outward, do protuberate, wax stiffe, and stretch after the manner of a Glans; especially that of the Cock, which onely doth outwardly press upon the female, and, as I suppose, doth not enter in. In the Coition of Horses, Dogs, and Cats, and o∣ther creatures, when the male presenteth his penis, the female proportioneth her parts stiffe, and ex∣tended. And Birds also that are tame, suffer them∣selves to be gently stroked, and swelling with Ve∣nereal appetite, expose that Orifice, which you may by your finger perceive to be hardened and resisting. Nay sometimes birds are so lustfull, that if you only gently smooth their backs, they will instantly incline, and extend and make bare their Uterine Orifice; which if your finger softly com∣ply with, they will declare their accepted recrea∣tion, in extravagant murmurs, and flutterings of their wings. And that the females will even thence
conceive eggs, both Aristotle beareth witness, and I my self have found in a Thrush, a Black-bird, and others: and this experiment I gained long since, and by chance, but at my own cost. For my wife had an excellent, & a well instructed Parrat, which was long her delight; which was now grown so familiar, that he was permitted to walk at liberty through the whole house: where he missed his Mistresse, he would search her out, and when he had found her, he would court her with a cheer∣full congratulation. If she had called him, he would make answer, and flying to her, he would grasp her garments with his claws, and bill, till by degrees he had scaled her shoulder; whence he descending by her arm, did constantly seat himself upon her hand. If she bad him talk, or sing, were it night, and never so darke, he would obey her. Many times when he was sportive and wanton, he would sit in her lap, where he loved to have her scratch his head, and stroke his back, and then testifie his contentment, by kinde mutterings, and shaking of his wings. I still interpreted all this to proceed from his customary familiarity and obsequiousness, for I alwaies thought him to be a Cock-Parrat, by his notable excellence in singing and talking. For amongst Birds, the females seldom sing, or provoke to discourse; but the males onely charm the fe∣males by the pleasant musick of their voice, and allure them to pay their homage to Venus. And therefore Aristotle saith, If Partridge-hennes stand Hist. an. l. 5. c. 5. and l. 6. c. 2. over against the cocks, and the winde blow from whence the cocks are, they conceive and grow big, and for the most part, they teem even by the voice of the cock, if they be at that time wanton and lustfull: and this al∣so may fall out from the cocks flying over them; namely if the cock do transmit a fructifying spirit into the Hen.
And this happens chiefly in the Spring-time; whence the Poet: Virgil. 2. Georg. Vere tument terrae, & genitalia semina poscunt. Tum Pater Omnipotens foecundis imbribus aether. Conjugis in gremium laetae descendit, & omnes Magnus alit, magno commistus corpore, foetus. Avia tum resonant avibus virgulta sonoris, Et Venerem certis repetunt armenta diebus. Earth swells in Spring, and fertile seed requires, Descending Aether with her vote conspires, And fruitful showrs cheer his glad consorts hart, Which do to all her Issues growth impart. The Desart woods are then the shrill Birds Quire, And all Beasts are inflam'd with Venus fire. But not long after these kinde dalliances, the Par∣rat, which had lived many years sound and heal∣thy, grew sick, and being much oppressed by ma∣ny convulsive motions, did at length deposite his much lamented spirit in his Mistresses bosom, where he had so often sported. When dissecting his car∣kase, (to finde out the cause of his death) I found in the womb an egge almost completed, but, for want of a Cocke, corrupted. Which many times befalleth those Birds, that are immured in Cages, when they covet the society of the Cock. By this and other examples, I am induced to believe, that the Dunghill-Cock, and the Cock-Phea∣sant, doe not onely delight their Hennes by their voices, but also do confer something by those very voices to the conception of the egges: for even at night, some of the Hens at roost with him, do be∣stirre themselves at the Cocks crowing, shaking their heads and wings; as if possessed by a gentle hor∣rour, their senses were ravished as after Coition. A certain Fowle, as big again as a Swan, was not
long since brought into Holland out of Java, a Island of the East-Indies, which fowle the Dutchmen called a Cassoware: the figure of this fowle Al∣drovandus representeth, and saith, that the Indians Ornith. lib. 20. p. 541. call it Eme: it is not cloven-footed, as the Ostrich, but hath three claws on every foot; one of which is armed with so long, so hard, and so strong a spurre, that it will easily pierce through an Inc∣board. Now its manner of smiting is forward; its body, legs, and thighes, are like an Ostriches, but it hath not a broad bill, as the Ostrich hath, but a roun and black one. Instead of a crest, it hath upon the head a round extuberant horn; it hath no tongue at all; eateth any thing without distinction, be it stones, or coales, and those red-hot too, likewise pie∣ces of glass; it hath two feathers springing out from every quill, and those black, short, and thinne, ap∣proaching to the nature of hair, or down; it hath very litle wings, and imperfect; it is a creature of a horrid aspect, and hath long red and blew gils hanging down the neck (like a Turkey-Cock.) This fowle continued in Holland above seven yeares, and afterwards Maurice, the most Illustrious Prince of Orange sent it, with other things, for a Present to King James, in whose gardens it lived above five yeares: but afterward, when two Ostri∣ches, Cock and Hen, chanced to be kept in the same place, and the Cassoware oftentimes over-heard them at the act of coition, being but in the next pennes (where they were fed apart) She unexpect∣edly conceived egges (stirred up, as I suppose, by a certain sympathy, from those that were something of the same kin and linage with her) yet all that saw her, did conjecture she was rather a Cocke, then a Henne, considering her we apons and martiall pro∣visions. One of these egges she laid whole and en∣tire,
which I opened and found it compleat; for it had a white embracing the yolk round about, to∣gether with the chalazae, or specks like hailestones annexed on both sides, and also a litle cavity or emptiness in the obtuse end of it: there was like∣wise the cicatricula, the litle cicatrice, or whitish speck; the shell was thick, hard, and strong, which I caused to be made into a cup (the top being taken off) such as is usually made of the Ostriches egge. This egg was something less then an Ostriches egg, but every way perfect, as I said before; yet with∣out all question it was but a subventaneous and an unfruitfull one, by reason of the want of a Cock. But at the same time as she brought forth the egge, I did presage she her self would die; and that according to Aristotle, who saith, That Birds will be sick and dye, unless they bring forth, which fell out not long Gen. an. l. 3 after: and dissecting her, I found an imperfect and corrupt egge in the Upper end of her Uterus, which caused her untimely death, (as I had for∣merly observed in the Parrat and other Birds.) Most Birds, by how much the more salacious they are, so much the more fruitfull are they; and sometimes doe without a Cock (either from high feeding, or some other cause) conceive eggs, which very seldom are either perfected, or brought forth at all, without the use of a Cock; but they thenoe fall into desperate diseases, and at length dye. But the Dunghill-henne doth not onely conceive egges, but lay them also; and those perfect too, but yet subventaneous and barren ones. So also many of the Insects (in whose list are Silk-worms and But∣terflies) do both conceive, and lay egges, without conjunction with the male, (as fishes also) but they are all addle, and wind-eggs. As if it were the same thing for these creatures to be with egge, as for
virgins to have their wombs grow warm; their termes flow, their breasts increase, and (in a word) to be∣come marriageable; which if they be too long de∣tained from, they are assaulted with dangerous symptoms; (namely hysterical affections, or furor Ute∣rinus) or else fall into the green sickness, and seve∣rall other distempers. For all Creatures, when they are love-struck, grow extravagant, and if de∣barred of enjoyment, do at length recede much from their usual temper. Hence some women grow frantick for love; and this extravagancy is so out∣ragious in some, that they seem bewitched, planet∣strucke, or possessed. And this inconvenience would be frequent, did not pious education, respect to their reputation, and in-bred modesty, temper and asswage these inordinate commotions of the minde. Of the Privities of a Henne. EXER. VI. FRom the exterior uterine orifice, is the passage to the inner parts, and matrix, in which the egge is perfected: and this passage in other creatures is termed vagina uteri, or vulva, into which the males penis is transmitted to the matrix. But in a Hen, this passage is so perplexed, and so wrinckled and folded, by reason of the laxity of its inward coat, that though there be an easie passage from the matrix outward, insomuch that a very great egge can come forth without any great difficulty; yet that the masculine penis should get in, and that the seed should finde admission into the inner ca∣vity
of the Uterus, is scarce probable: for I could not trace a way inward, with either probe, or bristle, nor could Fabricius neither; nay, if you will credit his testimony, the very aire cannot be blown into the womb: which, I suppose, was the cause why he, describing the history of the Egge, proceedeth from the interiour to the exteriour parts: And al∣so considering this fabricke of the womb, he deny∣eth pag. 30. the seed to attain so farre as the cavity of the womb, or to constitute any part of the egge: of which opinion I willingly profess my selfe. For you shall finde nothing at all in a fertile egge, ei∣ther added, or altered, (which is not in an addle one) to give any suspicion of the entrance of the Cockes seed into the womb or egge. But yet though all the egges are, without the accession of the Cock, subventaneous and addle; yet by his assistance (e∣ven for a good while after his treading) the sub∣sequent egges, of which there is yet no principle, or matter out of which they can be made, become fertile. Fabricius, that he may express after what manner the seed of the Cock maketh the egges fer∣tile, pag. 17. hath these words: Since no seed at all appear∣eth in the egge, and yet it is cast by the cock into the womb, it may be demanded, to what purpose the cocks seed is cast into the womb, if it pass not into the egge? as also, if the seed be not in the egge, how can the egge be made fertile by that seed which is not in it? My o∣pinion is, that the seed of the cocke injected into the be∣ginning of the womb, doth make the whole womb, and also all the yolks that come into it, and lastly, the whole egge, fertile; and that it doth this by its vertue, or spi∣ritual irradiating substance; after the same manner, as we perceive other creatures become fertile, by the te∣sticles, and seed: for if any man consider that incre∣dible transmutation, which doth seize upon a creature
that is gelded, by which it looseth its heat, vigour, and fecundity in the whole body; he will easily consent, that what we say, may well befall the single womb of a Hen. But that it is most true, that the power of rendering all the egges fertile, together with the womb it self, pro∣ceedeth wholly from the seed of the Cocke, appeareth, e∣ven from the practice of women, which having a Hen without a Cock, commit her for a day or two to a neigh∣bours Cock: and from this small commerce, all the eggs are endowed with fertility, for all that year. And this is also confirmed by Aristotle, who is of opinion, that de Gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. after birds have once had the advantage of coition, al∣most all the egges they lay afterward are fertile. Now, lest the vertue of making fertile, which is contained in pag. 38. the seed, should by any means exhale or evaporate, but that it may remaine long in the womb, and so be im∣parted to the whole; nature hath concluded, and trea∣sured it up as it were in a purse, in the cavity neer the fundament, which is annexed to the womb, to which there is onely an entrance, but no retreat, so that the seed being there long detained, its vertue may be the better preserved, and communicated to the whole womb. But I did doubt the verity of the foresaid expe∣riment, and that the rather, because I perceived the Philosophers words were falsly recited; for, hee doth not say, that, Birds, when they once have had the advantage of coition, almost all the egges they lay are fertile, but, they lay almost all their egges: where the word Fertile is superadded by Fabricius: for it is one thing, to say, that Birds are with egge after coition; and another thing, to say, that those egges are made fertile by coition. And this is more ma∣nifest by Aristotles precedent words, where he saith, In Birds, not so much as those very egges which are be∣gotten by coition, can for the most part gain their just
growth, unless that coition be continued. And the rea∣son is, because, that as in women by coition with the male, the menstruous excrement is drawn forth (for the womb being warmed draweth the moysture, and the pores are opened) so it falls out in birds, whilest the menstruous excrement cometh by litle and litle, which cannot get out, because it is but litle, and is contained above about the diaphragma, but slideth down into the womb it self. For with this the egge is nourished, as the foetus of viviparous creatures is nourished with that which comes in at the Navel. For after birds have once been at tread, they still persist to have almost all their eggs, but yet small ones, and imperfect; and therefore barren: for the perfection of an egge, is its fecundity. If therefore without continued coi∣tion, not so much as those very eggs which are con∣ceived by that coition, do attain their Growth, or (as Fabricius interpreteth it) their Perfection; much less can those egges be fertile, which the Birds persist to lay, without coition. But let no man think that these words (name∣ly, the womb being warmed draweth, and the pores are opened) do any way conclude, that the womb can draw the seed of the Cocke into its cavity; for we must take notice, that the Philosopher doth not say, that the womb draweth the seed from without, but, that in women, the menstruous blood is drawn out of their own bodies, the veines and passages being opened by the heat caused by coition; and so likewise in Birds, that the blood is drawn to the womb, it be∣ing warmed by repeated coition, and that the eggs do thence encrease; as the foetus of viviparous crea∣tures do by the Navel. But what he adjoineth concerning that cavity or purse, in which he fancy∣eth that the seed is entertained, even for a whole year together, is confuted by us formerly; where
we affirm, that no seed at all is contained in it and that both henns and cocks indifferently have that cavity. Wherefore, though I easily believe (if by ferti∣lity we understand an encrease of more and fairer eggs) that poor womens henns (whose poultry pro∣bably wanteth good feeding) will lay lesser and fewer egges, except they have resort to a cock (ac∣cording to that of the Philosopher, namely, If they once mixe with a cocke, then they continue to have fairer, better, and more egges, for the whole ensuing year; to which end also, plenty and wholesom∣ness of feeding do very much conduce) yet that hennes, by some few acts of coition with a cock should lay all fertile egges for a whole year toge∣ther; that, I say, seemeth to me improbable. For if a few acts of coition were of force to so lasting a generation, Nature (which maketh nothing in vain) would have made the male birds less salacio then they are: nor would the cocke so often in one day invite his hennes to Venery, nay sometimes force a rape upon them. Wee all know, how the henne, so soon as she forsaketh the nest where she hath layed her egge crieth out with a shrill voice, and enticeth the cock to coition; who also replying with a loud and di∣vided tone, carefully seeketh her out, and having found her, instantly ascendeth: which surely Nature had never permitted, but for procreation sake. A Cock-Pheasant, penned up in an aviary, both with such scorching lust, that unless he have sew∣rall hennes with him, (six at the lest) he will  extremely afflict them with repeated Coitions, and rather retard their fertility, then promote it  once saw a Pheasant-henne, so spent and worn o
by the cocke who was shut up with her (whom she could no wayes escape, neither by flight, nor con∣cealment) that her back was grown bald by his fre∣quent ascents, untill at last, in miserable torture, e expired for grief. Yet, when I cut her up, I sound not the lest rudinient of an egge. I have ob∣served likewise a Gander, who wanting a mate, so∣journed with the hennes, where his lust was so un∣bounded, that for some hours together he pursued a young pullet whithersoever she fled, arresting her with his bill, till at length he triumphed upon her weariness, and subdued her to a Rape. A dunghill-cock having gotten the mastery in the duel, doth sate his desires not only upon the concu∣bines of his foe, but upon the conquered himself. So likewise some females are so prone to Venery, that they will chastise their males with their bite∣ings; (as if they meant to whisper and advise them of conjugal delights) sometimes getting up∣permost themselves, endeavouring by these and other arts to entice them to their recreation: and in this rank are pigeons, and sparrows. And therefore it seems not so likely, that a few coitions celebrated in the beginning of the yeare, should store up fecundity enough, to endow all the egges for a twelve-moneth following. And yet once (that Fabricius may have some patronage) in the Spring time (attempting some discovery of the time wherein coition is most success∣full, and the necessity thereof) I did separate two hennes from the cocke for foure dayes space, which in that time laid three egges a piece, which were as prolifical as the rest. And I did after that immure another henne, which on the tenth day of her se∣paration laid an egge, and another egge on the twentieth, and both were fruitfull: so that it may
seem possible, that one or two acts of conjunction may fructifie the whole cluster, and consequently all the egges of that year. I shall tell you likewise, what I farther obser∣ved at that time; when I restored the two hennes (which I had formerly divorced) to the cocke a∣gain, whereof one of them was now big with egg, the other had newly layed; the cock ran instantly to the latter, and enjoyed her greedily three or four times: about the former, he circuited often, and by trailing his wings at her feet, seemed to greet her kindely, and congratulate her return; yet presently retired to the other, and repeated his lust again, and again, committing violence upon her refusal; neglecting in the mean time the henn that was with egge, using no solicitation nor request. Truly I admired, by what significations he could be inspired to know, that coition could be useful to the one, and unseasonable to the other. It is not easie to say, how males will either by the eye, eare, or smell, distinguish (even from farre) which females are ripe for their turne, and desirous of their com∣pany. Some, though they onely hear their voice, or sent their urine, or foot-steps only on the ground are presently heightned, and pursue them to a compliance. But of this elswhere, in our tract o the Love, Lust, and act of Generation of Animals, w shall treat at large. Wee returne to our pur∣pose.
Of the Belly of a Henne, and other Birds. EXERCIT. VII. FRom the outward Orifice through the privy parts, we arrive at the Uterus or matrix of the Henne, wherein the egge is perfected, encompassed by the white, and covered with the shell; but before we speak any thing of its scituation, and position, something must be premised, concerning the pe∣culiar anatomy of the Belly of Birds. For I have ob∣served the stomacks, guts, and other entrals of Fea∣thered creatures, to be otherwise seated and consti∣tuted in their lower belly, then of other creatures that go upon the ground. All kindes of Birds, almost, have a twofold sto∣mack, whereof one is the Ingluvies, the other the Ventriculus, properly so called: in the former they treasure up their meat, and prepare it; in the lat∣ter, they digest it, and concoct it into the chyle: the first, we call the crop or craw; the latter, the Gi∣sard. Birds reserve in their craw the whole grains which they ingorge, and from thence transmit them into the gisard, moistened, macerated, and softned by the water which they imbibe, that it may there be grinded, and concocted. And for that purpose, almost all sorts of Fowle swallow down sands, stones, & other harder bodies, & reserve them in their gisard with their meat; (when no such thing is to be seen in their craw) and this gi∣sard of theirs is compacted of two exceeding thick¦st strong muscles, (which in lesser Birds are compo∣sed of flesh or ligaments) that with these two, as it
were with two Grind-stones, fastned together with two hinges, they may grind and mould their food; whilest the stones supply the place of teeth, of which they are destitute. By this means they digest and chylifie their meat, and afterward by compression (as we strain a juice or a pultis out of herbes or fruits bruised) the softer and more liquid part ly∣eth uppermost; and that they conveigh into the beginning of the guts (which in them is just at the entrance into the gullet, seated above the gi∣sard. Now that this is so, appears in several sorts of Birds, in whose gisard, if gravel, or any other harder and rugged bodies continue any time, they receive so much impaire and smoothness from the continual attrition, that at last they grow useless, and so are ejected. And for this cause Birds exercise their tongues in the choice of their pibbles, and if they discover that they are no rough, they presently refuse them. By this mean I have found Iron, Silver, and Stones, almost worn away and consumed in the gisard of an Ostrich, and the Cassoware; which gives occasion to the popular perswasion, that they digest Iron, and are nourished by it. In Falcons, Eagles, and other Birds of Prey, if you bring your ear near, when their gisard is empty you shall evidently discover the noise of stones col∣lected in it, grating one against another. For Hawkes doe not swallow pibbles to coole and all their heat, (as the common sort of Falconers dream) but to grinde their meat: as also other Birds (whose gisard is made fleshy on purpose t mould their meat) for the same intent, do ingor pibbles, or sand, or such like bodies. The gisard of Birds therefore, is seated within the capacity of the Abdomen, beneath the Heart,
Lungs, and Liver; but the crop sticketh (for the most part) as it were out of the body, in the lower part of the necke, at the Os Jugale: in which (as I have said) their meat is onely mollified, and prepa∣red: and from it some Birds return their meat ma∣cerated to their chickens, and nurse them up (at the same rate as four-footed beasts doe theirs with milke) as you may observe in all sorts of Pigeons, and also in the Spermologi, which we call Rooks. And Bees also, when they are returned to their Hives, do refund the hony which they gather from the flowers, and have digested in their stomack, into their proper celles: and so do Hornets and Wasps nourish their off-spring. And a Bitch hath been seen to disgorge the meat which she had swallow∣ed before, and half concocted, to supply her whelps. Wherefore, the wonder is less, when we see poore beggar-women, when their milk faileth them, to feed their Infants with scraps, which their owne teeth have first prepared, and reduced into a kinde of pap. The Guts in Birds arise (as is said) from the up∣per part of the Gisard, and are replicated up and down in Longitude (not transversly, as in us.) And next to them, just under the heart, about the mid∣dle of the body, where the diaphragma (which is wanting in Birds) is seated in Beasts, is their Liver, which is very large, and divided into two lobes, (for they have no spleen neither) placed on either side, and fills the hypochondria: below the Liver is the gisard put, under which lye the replications of the intestines, having very many slender mem∣branes interposed, which are filled with air: for into these (as we have said) the rough arteries of the lungs descend with open mouth. The kidnies (which are large in Birds) being of an oblong fi∣gure,
composed as it were of gobbets of flesh, having no cavities at all, doe lye on both sides of the Spine, and great descending vein and Arterie, and are buried in the spacious oblong cavity of the huckle bones or sides-men. From the fore-part of the kidnies are the Ureters extended in Longitude, even to the common sinke, and fundament it self: that so the serous excrement may from the Reines be wafted thither. Now Birds have very litle of this serum, because they are small drinkers, and some of them (as the Eagle for one) drink not all. Nor doth their urine flow apart by its self; but, as we have said, doth distill from the Ureters into the common receptacle, which is allowed also to en∣tertain the excrement of the guts, whose discharge is by this means the better provided for. The urine of Birds differeth from that of other creatures; for the parts of their urine are two-fold, one more serous, and liquid, the other more gross and thicke, which in men in health we call the hypostasis, and when the urine is now cold, it sinketh down to the bottom: now Birds (clean contrary to other viviparous Animals) have greater store of this thick sediment; which is distinguished from the other part of the urine, by its white or silver-like com∣plexion, and it is not only discernable in the clo∣aca or sinke, (where it much aboundeth) and gi∣veth a tincture to the excrements of the guts: but in the whole conduct of the Ureters, which are di∣stinguished from the coats of the kidnies, by this very white excrement. Nor is the thicker substance which descendeth from the Reines, only visible in Birds, but in Serpents also, and other oviparous crea∣tures; especially those whose egge is guarded by a harder kinde of shell. And they have much more abundance of this, then of the thin∣ner
serous part: and it hath a middle consistence between a thicker kinde of urine, and the excrement of the guts; so that as it passeth through the Ure∣ters, it resembleth milk coagulated, or something thickned, and presently upon ejection it congeal∣eth into a crust that is friable. Of the scituation and fabrick of the rest of the parts of the Womb in a Hen. EXERCIT. VIII. BEtween the Gisard, and the Liver, at the Spine of the backe, where in men and other animals the Pancreas lyeth, between the vena Porta, and de∣scending trunck of vena Cava, at the beginning of the Emulgent veines, and the preparing spermatical vessells, where the Coeliacal artery goeth into the Mesentery, there also in a Henne and other Birds, is the Ovary, and cluster of yolkes bred, which hath Before it the Trunk of the Vena Porta, the gul∣let, and the mouth of the Gisard; and Behinde it, the Hollow vein, and the Great Artery descending by the Spine of the backe; Above it lyeth the Liver, Under it the Gisard. And therefore the Infundi∣bulum, which is constituted of a very thin mem∣brane, descendeth down-ward from the Ovary, all along the back, between it and the Gisard. And from the Infundibulum or Tunnel (between the Gi∣sard, Guts, Reines, and Loynes) the Process of the Uterus, or its superiour part, having many revolu∣tions
and cells (like the Colon & right-gut in a man) descendeth into the Womb it self. But the Womb it selfe, which is continuous to this Process, is seated below the Gisard at the Fundament, at the lower end of the Abdomen, between the loynes, kidnies, and right-gut: so that when the egge now cloathed with the White is contained in it, it presseth down so low, that you may easily perceive by your fin∣ger, whether it be soft, or hard, and ready to be layed. This Womb, in a Hen, is of different magnitude and fabrick: For in a Henne which is big with egge, or hath lately layed, it differeth very much from the womb of a Virgin-henne, or Pullet; for her womb is fleshy and round, lik an empty purse; smooth without, within rough, having certain folds and revolutions according to its longitude: at first sight, you would conceive it to be a larger kinde of bladder of Urine, or a second lesser gisard. But in a teeming Hen, and one ripe for the cocke (which our housewives distinguish by the redness of their crest, or comb) the Uterus is of much better growth, and more carnous, having larger folds, and thicker, and of that extent, that it may conveniently re∣ceive an egge. And this womb is extended and passeth upward a good way, along the Spine of the back, and is made up of many complications and cells; (as the Collick-gut is) which several cells are composed of the replications of the womb it selfe. The Bottom hereof, as it is the largest, so it is the thickest, and most carnous part of all, fortified with more and greater foldings then the rest, whose fi∣gure within is Ovale, as if it were the Mould to cast egges in. I call the Ascending part, or production of the Womb, a Process: Fabricius calleth it, the se∣cond Uterus, and saith it consists of three rundells
or turnings: Ulysses Aldrovandus calleth it the sto∣mack of the womb: there are, I confess, most com∣monly three spires or rundels, yet this is not so constant, but that nature fashions it otherwise, for varietie, (as she doth sometimes in the circumgi∣rations of the Colon. This womb, the higher it goeth, the slenderer and sparer it groweth by degrees, and hath fewer and lesser circumvolutions, till at length as it were dissolving into very thin membranes, it becomes to be the Infundibulum, which arising up as farre as the diaphragme, encompasseth all the Ovary. And therefore Fabricius divideth his second womb into three parts; viz. the beginning, the middle, and pag. 17. the end. The beginning, saith he, degenerating into a stender and most soft membrane, frameth a wide orifice, representing as it were a litle pipe or tunnel. The mid∣dle part (which I call the Process of the Uterus) is constituted of three transverse spires or Rundels, and serveth to furnish the yolk of the egge with a white, and extendeth it self to the lowest and most capacious place or part of all; which he calls the End of that Uterus, wherein (saith he) the Chalazae, or specks, and the two membranes and shell are formed. The whole substance of the Uterus (especially about the folds) as well in the Uterus it selfe, as in its Process, is embroydered with many large veines, and yet there are more divarications of Arteries then of Veines. The Folds which in the inside of the womb are oblique and transverse, are of a fleshy substance, and look exceeding white and milkey, breathing forth a kinde of stiffe moysture; so that the inward superfi∣cies both of the Uterus, and also of its Process, is li∣ned as it were with very much, and thinne whites of egges; by which meanes the descending yolk
gaines greater bulk, and cloatheth it self in white by degrees, till it arrive at full perfection. You shall seldom finde the Uterus unfurnished of eggs, but that there are some still either sticking in the revolutions of the Process of the womb, or else conteined in the Uterus or womb it selfe. If you blow up this Process when it is empty, it will appear like a litle oblique distorted pipe, rising up sharp at the end in manner of a snailes shell, or a Top. And the Fabrick of the womb is like that which wee lately observed in the privy parts; namely, that though there be open way enough to receive the egge in its descent, yet there is scarce any return to be obtained upwards again, (even for the air it self, though backed by inflation.) The Process of the Uterus, together with the spires, is so diminished in a Hen past laying (as we have said) and also in young pullets, that it resol∣veth into most thin membranes, and is quite abo∣lished, and leaveth no appearance of it, as neither of the Ovary, or Infundibulum; only there remains (like the root of the cluster) a glandulous and spongy substance, which tasteth pretty sweet in a boyled Hen; as in Viviparous creatures (especially if they be young and tender) the Pancreas, and Thy∣mus doe; which therefore the people call the Sweet-Breads. The Womb, together with its Process, is by the helpe of a membrane fastned to the back: which membrane Fabricius doth therefore call Mesome∣trium; because, the second womb, together with this membranous body, wherein many veines are divarica∣ted, may fitly be compared to the Intestines, and their Mesentery. For as the Mesentery keepeth firm the Guts, so doth that Mesometrium fasten this long Process from the chine, lest being dislocated, and in∣volved,
it should disturb and obstruct the passage of the yolks, whereas now being free and open, it entertaineth them gently. Through this Meso∣metrium, many vessels stored with blood, are bran∣ched into every replication of the womb. And therefore it beareth much analogy to the Mesen∣tery, both in its beginning, substance, fabrick, use, and office. There is also a Ligament (like a fillet) extended long-wayes from the bottom of the womb to the Infundibulum, such a one as we may see pro∣duced in the upper region of the Colon; which is as it were a portion or fragment of the outward coat, going along and contracted, that the rest of the Process might by its help be wrinckled into folds and replications. Thus, if you cut off a gut, and put in a thred into it all along the whole length of one side of it, and then tye it hard, the other oppo∣site side will curle up into wrinckled complications and windings. This then is the Constitution of the womb of a Henne that layeth egges; namely, fleshy, large, du∣ctile and extensive into length and breadth, full of windings, spires, and convolutions all along the spine of the back from the fundament, upwards, and continuous to the Infundibulum.
Of the generation of the Egge. EXERCIT. IX. THe yolk, in the cluster, is onely a litle wheale or push, and growing by degrees, attaineth the complexion and bulk of a yolk; and falling off from the cluster, it descendeth through the Infun∣dibulum; and rowling through the Spires and ca∣vernes of the Process of the womb, doth cloath it selfe all over with the White: though (as Fabricius rightly observed against Aristotle) it doth adhere to the womb no where at all, nor is it nourished by any Umbilical vessels: but as the egges of frogs or fishes, provide themselves whites out of the wa∣ters wherein they lie; or as beanes, pease, and o∣ther pulse and graine, being moistened, do swell, and thence acquire aliment to the blossoms which spring from them: So in like manner out of the aforesaid foulds of the womb, an albugineous hu∣midity issuing thence (as it were out of a dugge, or Uterine cake) the Yolk (by vertue of a vegitative heat, and faculty wherewith it is endowed) find∣eth out, and concocteth its white. And therefore in those foulds, and in the cavity of the Uterus, a liquor, in tast much like the white of an egge, doth most plenteously abound. And in this sort the yolk descending by little and little, is invested with a white, until at last, assuming membranes, and a harder shell in the extremity of the womb, he is com∣pleated for his Exit.
Of the Growth and departure of the Egge from the Womb. EXER. X. ATtend Fabricius: as we pronounce (saith he) the action of the Stomack to be Chylification: and pag. 8. the action of the Testicles to be the Generation of Seed; because we find chyle in the Stomack, and Seed in the Testicles: So we confidently affirm the Action of the Birds womb, to be the Generation of egges, because there we finde the eggs. But this is not the on∣ly Function of the womb, but the Augmentation of the egge also, which succeedeth immediately after the Generation, till the egge be perfected, and purchase a just enlargement, is implyed. For the Henne doth not naturally lay her egge, before it be compleat, and have attained a convenient magnitude. The Action therefore of the Uterus is both the Generation, and Augmentation of the egge: Now Augmentation sup∣poseth Nutrition, and includeth it. But since all Generation proceedeth from two Principles; namely, the Efficient, and the Subject Matter: The Efficient in the procreation of egges is nothing else, but the In∣struments, or proposed organs, namely, the twofold Uterus: and the Subject Matter, is nothing but Blood. But we, for Brevity sake (omitting, as is meet, all controversie) as we do easily allow, that the use and office of the womb, is to procreate egges: so we pronounce the Adaequate Efficient (as they call it) to be contained in the egge it selfe: and wee do conceive that both the Generation, and Aug∣mentation of the Egge, proceedeth not from the
womb, but from an innate natural principle of its own: And that this Principle doth flow first from the whole Henne, into the Yolk while it yet is on∣ly a rudiment, or first wheale as it were; which afterwards like a congenial heat, or Efficient Na∣ture) inherent in the Yolk, nourisheth and Augment∣eth it: As there is a certain in-bred faculty in e∣very part of the Body, by which it is fed and aug∣mented. As concerning the manner how the Yolk is invested with the White, Aristotle seems to de Gen. an. l. 3. c. 2. have conceited it to be thus: That there is in eggs, while their membranes are yet tender, a kind of Um∣bilicall channel, existent in the sharper end of the eg (at which he determineth the eg to begin) by which it increaseth: which perswasion Fabricius repre∣hendeth, denying any being at all to any such chan∣nel; Or that the Yolk doth any where adhere to the womb: and salveth that scruple concerning that small appendix found in the egge after it is layed, saying; The augmentation of the egge is two-fold, pag. 11. according to the two-fold womb, that is the superin, and inferior: and also, according to the two-fold sub∣stance, whereof the egge is compounded, that is, the Yolk and the White; the Yolk is increased by a true Augmentation; namely, by blood; which is conveyed to it by the Veins, whilest it is yet adjoyned to the Vi∣tellary. But the White is increased, and groweth to the yolk, after another fashion: For it receiveth not nourishment by the Veins, nor by a true kind of Nu∣trition, as the Yolk doth but by Juxtaposition, adhering to the Yolk, while it passeth through the Second Ute∣rus. But in my Opinion, the Egge is augmented af∣ter the same manner (wheresoever it be) as the yolk is augmented in the cluster, viz. from an In∣trinsecal concocting principle, with this distincti∣on
onely, that while it is in the cluster, its ali∣ment is conveighed to it by the vessels, but in the womb it findeth it ready for it to imbibe. For in all Nutrition and Accretion, a Juxtaposition of the parts is equally necessary, and also a Con∣coction and Distribution of the applied nutriment; nor can the one be thought to be lesse a True Nu∣trition then the other: for both of them are made by a new accession, apposition, agglutination, and transmutation of the Aliment. Nor can Beanes or Pease, which attract moisture from the Earth (which they suck in like spunges) be said to be lesse truly nourished, then if they did draw in that moisture through the Orifice of Veins: And Trees also drinking Dewes and Showres in at their Barks, are as truly nourished, as they are by their Roots. But concerning the manner of this Nutri∣tion, we have spoken more largely in another place. At present, it remaines that we encoun∣ter another difficulty; that is, whether the Yolke, while it acquireth a White, doth not make some separation, and choice in it: and so, while it is about augmenting, whether some more earthy part be not dismissed into the Yolk or middle of the egge, (as into the Center, as Aristotle would have it) and the lighter, and thinner parts be not reserved in its superficies or surface: For between the Yolk which is yet in the cluster, and that which is in the midst of the eg when it is perfected, this is the difference in chief, that though the former be yellowish in colour and appearance, yet its consi∣stence representeth rather the VVhite; and being sodden, thickneth like it, groweth compact, and viscous, and may be cut into slices. But the Yolk that is in the midst of a perfect egge, being boiled,
groweth friable, and of a more earthy consistence, not thick and glutinous like the White. Of the Egg-shell. EXERCITATION XI. IT is convenient, that having declared how the Egge is generated, wee should now treat of its parts, and their differences. An Egge is compound∣ed pag. 22. (saith Fabricius) of a Yolke, a White, two Chala∣zae, or specks, three membranes (namely one mem∣brane proper to the yolk alone, and two other, common to the whole egge) and last of all, of a Shell. To all which, two things are to be added, which may not be truly ranged amongst the parts of the egge; one where∣of is a certain small cavity in the blunter end of the egge neer the top of the Shell; the other is a certain litle white print, like a small round Cicatrice, affixed to the superficies of the yolk. The accompt of every of which we shall lay down more punctually, beginning from the outward parts. The outward Covering (which is by Pliny called the Barke, Rind, or Paring; and by ( Serenus, the Egg-shell) is a hard, slender, friable, and porous tegument, having divers colours, namely, white, pallid, red, spotted, and sprinkled with several p∣ctures: to wit, the Hens, and Pigeons egg-shells  white; the Water-fowles, pale; the Hawkes, or Ke∣strells, red as Vermilion; the Pheasants, spotted, and di∣stinguished with points, as Aristotle noteth. All eggs have not a shell; for Serpents eggs have none; and de Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. some hens (though rarely) lay eggs without a shell
This shell, though it be hard, is not equally hard in all parts, but is more hard about the top, and superiour part of the egge. And therefore Fabricius saith, It is a question, when the egg-shell is formed, and out of pag. 13. what subject-matter. For Aristotle and Pliny affirm, that the shell is not made within, but when the egge is Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. & gen. an. 1. 8. l. 10. c. 52. de gen. an. l. 3. c. 2. laid, & as it is going out; so that the outward heat dry∣ing up the moysture, the Air condenseth & hardneth it. And this is done, as Aristotle supposeth, both that it may have the easer passage, and also that it may not pain the parent: As they say that an egge softned in vineger, may be crowded into a vessel of a nar∣row neck. Fabricius indeed was long at odds with this o∣pinion, by reason he had found an egge with a hard shell in the belly of the Hen; an experiment which is dayly proved by house-wives, whilest endeavouring to know whether the Hen be ready to lay, they grope the belly without, to try whether the shell be hard. But af∣terwards, when he had received from creditable wo∣men, that the egg-shell assumed its obduration from the ire in its exit, which aire doth exiccate a stiffe moy∣sture which environeth the egge, and condenseth and fastneth it to the shell, before the shell of it self be ex∣actly hard: and having also discovered the same by his own experience, he altered his opinion, and was perswaded, that the egge in the Uterus hath truly a shell, which shell is of a middle consistence, between soft and hard, but that it obtaineth a much greater degree of obduration presently after it is layed, by rea∣son of a certain clammy tenacious humidity which con∣cealeth about the shell, occasioned by the evaporation f the thin and moist parts; with which humidity the whole superficies is bedewed, which adhering to the ten∣der shell, is dryed and hardned, the cold ambient aire mducing something thereunto. And this (saith he)
you may soon perceive, if you keep Hennes in your yard, and be dexterous and diligent to receive the eggs from them, as they lay. This opinion of Aristotle did for a long time prevaile with me, till I discovered the contrary by infallible experience. For I take it as a mea∣sured truth, that the Egee-shell is most commonly hard even in the womb itself. And I once saw an egge cut out of a live Henne, which had no shell at all, but yet was througly drenched and begin with a glewey moisture: and yet the egge never hardned at all, by the congelation, or evaporati∣on of the moisture about the Skin, (as Fabricius would have it) nor was it any whit altered by the ambient cold aire, but continued the tendernesse which it had in the womb. I have also seen a New∣laied egge, which had a compleat hard shell, over which was a case made of a cuticular soft mem∣brane, which membrane did never congeal. More∣over I have seen an egge exactly surrounded with a Shell, save only on the very top of the acute end of the egg, where remained a smal soft rising, such a one as Aristotle perhaps conceived to be the Re∣liques of the Navel. And therefore Fabricius seemeth to me to be in an errour; for though I was never so good at slight of Hand, to surprise an egge in the very laying, and so make discovery whether it was soft or hard; yet this I confidently pronounce, that the Shell is compounded within the womb, of a sub∣stance there at hand for the purpose: and that it is framed in the same manner as the other parts of the egge are, by the Plastick faculty: and the rather, because I have seen an exceeding small egge, (Fabricius calleth it Ovum Centeninum, and our Women call it the Cocks egge) which had
Shell of its own, and yet was contained within an∣other egge, greater, and fairer then it, which egge also had a Shell too. And this Egge I shewed King Charles my most gracious Master, in presence of many others. And that very year, cutting up a large Limon, I found another small, but yet a perfect Limon in it, which had also a yellow rind: Which thing is now frequent in Italy, as I am informed. It is the usual errour of the Philosophers of these times, to seek the diversity of the causes of Parts, out of the diversity of the matter, from whence they should be framed. So Physitians affirm, that the different parts of the body are fashioned and nourished by the different materials of Blood, or Seed; namely the softer parts, as the Flesh, out of a thinner matter; and the more earthy parts, as the Bones, &c. out of grosse, and harder. But this er∣rour now too much received, we have confuted in another Place. Nor are they lesse deceived, who make all things out of Atomes, as Democritus; or out of the Elements, as Empedocles. As if (forsooth) Generation were nothing in the world, but a meer Separation, or Collection, or Order of things. I do not indeed deny, but that to the Production of one thing out of another, these fore-mention∣ed things are requisite: But Generation her self is a thing quite distinct from them all. (I finde Aristotle in this opinion) and I my self intend to clear it anon; that out of the same White of the Egge (which all men confess to be a similar body, and without diversity of Parts) all and every the parts of a Chicken, whether they be Bones, Clawes, Feathers, Flesh, or what ever else, are procreated and fed. Besides, they that argue thus, assigning onely a Material cause, deducing the causes of
Natural things, from a voluntary or casual con∣currence of the Elements, or from the several dis∣position or contriving of Atomes: they doe not reach that which is chiefly concerned in the Ope∣rations of Nature, and in the Generation, and Nutrition of Animals: namely, the Divine Agent, and God of Nature, whose operations are guided with the highest artifice, providence, and wisdome, and doe all tend to some certain end, and are all produced, for some certain Good.) But these men derogate from the honour of the Divine Architect, who hath made the Shell of the Egge with as much skill, for the egges defence, as any other particle; disposing the whole out of the same matter, and by one and the same formative faculty. Now though what I have delivered is very true, (namely, that the egge whilest it is yet in the womb, is guarded with a hard Shell) yet I have still prized Aristotles judgement so highly, that I never would recede from his Oracles without premedi∣tation, and therefore I do conceave (which thing also my own observations do confirm) that some accession to the induration of the egge-shell, doth accrew from the ambient air in its very exit: and that, that stiff and slimy moisture, (wherein it is drenched at its being laied) doth presently after its exclusion harden. For the Shell, while it is yet in the womb, is much thinner, more transpa∣rent, and of a smoother superficies: But after lay∣ing, it is much thicker, lesse translucid, and of a rough Superficies (as if it were rough cast with a white powder, which had newly dried to in∣sides.) And now we are upon this subject, give me leave to expatiate a while.
In the Eastern barren Islands of Scotland, there is such a mighty affluence of all-most all sorts of of Sea-fowle, that if I should relate all that I have heard, though from persons of great integrity, I fear I should be suspected more Fabulous then those several Authors, who discourse of the Scotish or Soland-Geese, which they story to be born from the fruit of certain Trees falling into the Sea (which fruit or Geese, themselves never saw) However I shall venture to relate what my owne Eyes have seen. There is a little Island, the Scots call it Basse, (by this, Reader, guess at the rest of them) it is not far from the shore, seated in the Main Sea; stand∣ing upon a rugged and dangerous Clift, (you may call it rather one great continued Stone, or Rock, then an Island) it is not above a mile about. The superficies of this Island (in the moneths of May and June) is almost covered quite over with Nests, Egges, and Young-Ones, that for their infinit abundance, you can scarce set your foot in a spare place, and such a mighty flock hovereth over the Island, that (like thick clouds) they darken and obscure the day: and such a cry, and noise they make, that you can hardly hear those that stand next you. If you look down into the Sea beneath you (as from a steep Tower, or Pre∣cipice) you shall see it all spread over with se∣veral sort of fowle, swimming to and fro, in pur∣suit of their Prey. Just at the rate, as some ditches and lakes in the Spring time, are paved with Frogs; and open Hills, and steep mountains, are stuck and embossed with flocks of sheep, and Goats. If you saile round the Island, and look up into the several Clifts, and Cavernes of it, you shall finde them all peopled and inhabited with several co∣lonies
of Birds and Fowle, of distinct Kinde, and magnitude: more indeed, then in a clear night, when the Moon is absent, there are Starres to be discerned in the Firmament: and if you ob∣serve the several Regiments of those that saily out, and those that flocks home wards at the same time, you would take them for an infinite swarm of Bees. It is not to be imagined what a vast yearly revenue the Lord of the Island maketh of the Plumes, and the Remainders of the Nests (which are use∣ful for firing) together with the Egges which hee seetheth, and then trafficketh away: that which he himself told me, was indeed incredible. But this one thing which reflects neerer upon our dis∣course, seemeth to me remarkable in chief, and doth give a cleer testimony of the excessive multi∣tude: which is, that this Island as you approach it, shineth with a white glasing, and the clifts re∣semble mountaines of the purest Chalke, though the native complexion of the Stone be obscure and black. That which thus discoloureth the Island, is a white crust, which is friable, and of the very same Consistence, Complexion, and Nature with the Egge-shell; so that all parts of the Island are plaistered over with this hard tegument, and crumbling or friable crust or shale. The bottome of the Island which the Tyde washeth every day, retaining still its natural colour, clearly sheweth that that fucus, or sophisticated whiteness, proceeds from the liquid Excrements of the Birds (which they discharge when they disburden their Belies) and by which, as it were with an Egge-shell, white, hard and friable, the Walls are crusted and dis∣guised: And after the same manner, doe Aristotle and Pliny consent, that the Egge-shell is formed. None of these Birds are Citizens of the place, but
Forreigners all, and resort thither for convenient Laying, and there they continue some weeks as in their Inne; till they and their Young-ones be all in condition to fly away together. But that white Ruff-cast is so solid, firme, and thick, that you would think it were the genuine and natu∣ral substance of the soile. This liquid, white, and bright Excrement, doth glide with the Urine from the kidnies of the Birds through the Ureters, into the common cavity or Jakes, and there covering over the excrements of the guts, passeth forth together with them, and it is a thicker part of their Urine, then that which we call the Sediment or Hypostasis in ours. We have spoken something of this matter before, and wee have demonstrated it fuller elsewhere. Store of this white excrement is there chiefly to be seen, where the Hawkes defile the walls that do neighbour their pertches with their ejections, which they be-dawb with a glewy white, and di∣stinguish as it were with a Ceruse. I have found as much of this slimey cement in the repository of a dead Ostrich, as would fill ones hand: so also in a Land-Tortoise, and several other Four-footed creatures, that are Oviparous, this white plaistering-stuff doth abound; and being disloaded, the thinner parts evaporating, it doth soon con∣geale either into a friable crusly substance, or into a dust or powder, resembling the egg-shell, pound∣ed in a Morter. Amongst the so many several kindes of Birds (which make their conflux to the aforesaid Island for Procreation sake) and so many several stru∣ctures of their nests, wherein they hatch their young, there was one Bird shewed me above all the rest, which layeth one onely egge, fixing it upon the
steep point of a sharp stone, (having neither nest, not any other materials to support it) and that so se∣cure, and firmly, that the mother-bird can leave it there, and return again to it at pleasure, without any prejudice to the egge at all. But if this egge be once removed from its station, no art nor cun∣ning in the world can fasten it again, but it in∣stantly falleth into the sea, as from a precipite, without redemption. The reason is, because the place where it is mounted, is incrustated all over with the white cement; and the egge being newly layed, wreaketh with a stiff and viscous humidity, which presently congealing, it is agglutinated to the subjacent stone, as it were with a kinde of soulder. An example of so nimble a concretion as this, we may see at the Statuaries, who out of calcined Ala∣baster, or certain morter tempered with water, doe make a liquid cement; which being artificially applied, will take off the figure of the countenance of a dead man, or the shape and resemblance of any thing whatsoever, be it never so litle; and so that growing hard, remaineth for a Mould. As therefore in almost all liquors there is some earthy consistence, (as in Wine, there is the Tariar; in Water, mudde or sand; in Lie, salt; which when the greater part of the moisture is exhaled, doth subside, and congeal at the bottom) so is there a white sediment, descending with the urine from the Birds kidnies into the common Jakes, with which I did conceive the egge was there incrustated, and plaistered over; as the pavements are by Hawks, and the clifts of the fore-said Island by the numerous conflux of Birds and Fowle: And thus Chamber-pots, and places where people urine much, use to be over-cast with a yellow crust, from the
concrescence of that substance, which createth stones in the kidnies and bladder, and other parts of the Body. I did, I say, conceive (especially being induced thereto by the authority of Aristotle and Pliny) that out of this white hypostasis, which doth much abound in all Oviparous creatures, (whose eggs are encompassed by a hard shell) the fabrick of the Henns egg-shell was erected, and congealed (upon exclusion) by the cold ambient aire. And this opinion is so rooted in me by many other experi∣ments, that I can hardly forbear to believe, that some part of the shell at lest, is produced from thence. But (as Fabricius rightly adviseth) let reason be silent, where experience warranteth the contrary; for it is too much the crime of the age we live in, to obtrude opinions built upon conjecture, and slender reasoning, as infallible truths (without any testi∣mony at all from sense.) For I am certainly assured from Experiment, that the egge (at lest here in England) is adorned with its shell, while it hath its abode in the Womb, though Aristotle and Pliny affirm the contrary, and Fabricius also is not very obstinate in the nega∣tive. Perchance indeed in hotter countries, where the hennes are of a stronger constitution, the egges are commonly layed soft, and without shells, but that is very rare amongst us. So when I was at Venice, Aromatarius, a famous Physitian, shewed mee a small leaf formed between the two shales of a Pease cod, though with us in the like case there is onely a small knob of the future pulse to be seen. So much doth the indulgent temper and clemen∣cy of the Heavens, Soil, and Aire, conduce to the fe∣cundity, and happy increase of things.
Of the rest of the parts of the Egge. EXERCIT. XII. WHere, how, and when the rest of the parts of the egge are generated, we have partly de∣clared already in the history of the Womb; and shall partly mention hereafter, when we come to treat of their Use. The White (saith Fabricius) is by Pliny called pag. 22. The White. Ovi albus liquor; by Celsus, Ovi candidum; by Pala∣dius, Ovi Albor; by Apicius, Ovi album, and alba∣mentum; in Greek, ; by Aristotle, ; by Anaxagoras, , Lac avium, the Milk of the Bird. And it is the cold, stiffe, white liquor of the egge, of different thickness, (for at the obtuse and a∣cute end of the egge it is more fluid, but more crass in other parts) and quantity (for it is in more abundance at the blunt end of the egge, and less at the sharp, and yet still less in the other parts) embracing the yolke round about. But I have ever observed in a Hennes egge, not onely a difference in the same White, but two di∣stinct Whites in the same egge, and both of them in∣volved in a peculiar membrane of their own: One of which is more thin and fluid, and almost of the same consistence with that humor which we have said to flow in the folds of the Uterus, and to con∣stitute and nourish the White. The other White is more thick and viscous, & dyed of a deeper white∣colour then the other; which in stale, and such eggs as the Hen sitteth on, after some dayes of her Incuba∣tion, waxeth yellowish; and as this thicker White doth immediatly surround the yolk, so doth the li∣quid
White encompass this. Now, that these two whites are really distinct, will soon appear, if af∣ter you have broken and removed the shell, you ick the two membranes which come next to ind; for then presently this liquid and exteriour White will runne about, and the two membranes sinke to the bottom of the bason: but the grosser White will all the while keep within its own bounds, and globous figure, as being terminated with its owne proper membrane, which yet is so subtile and slender, that your eye cannot perceive it; but if you cut it cross the White, it will pre∣sently stream out, and lose its round figure: as when a bladder is divided, the moisture contained therein is set at liberty; and so also if you make a breach upon the proper containing-coat of the yolke, the saffron-coloured juice will issue out, and its former globosity be destroyed. The Yolke (saith Fabricius) is called in Latine Vitellus, from Vita, Life; because the chicken liveth The Yolk. pag. 23. upon it: It is also called from its colour Ovi Luteum, the yellow of the Egge; in Greeke, ; by Hippo∣crates, ; by Aristotle, , and ; e Antients (as Suidas out of Menander) ▪ that is, the pullus, or chicken; because they concei∣ved the chicken was bred of that part. It is the soft∣est juice that is in all the egge, and confined within a most thin membrane, which being broken, it presently glideth forth, and is then inconstant to any figure: it is treasured up in the middle of the egge, being some∣times yellow, and sometimes of a mixed complexion, betwixt yellow and pallid; it is exactly circular, and of divers magnitude, according to the diversity of the magnitude of the Fowles themselves; for Water-fowle have a larger yolke, and Land-fowle a larger White, saith Aristotle. According to whom also, The yolk Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
and White are of a contrary nature, not in colour only but power; for the yolk is condensed by cold, which cold doth not condense the white, but dissolve it. And so on the contrary, the white is condensed by fire, but the yolk is not condensed thereby, but remaineth soft unless the egge be over-rosted; being more dryed and hardned by being boyled then rosted. And as in the greater world, the earth is deposited in the Center the Air and the Water being round about it, so al∣so the yolk, as the more earthy part, is incircled by the two whites, whereof the one is grosser, the other finer. Nay (Aristotle addeth further) if any man beat many egges together in a bason, and boyle Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. de gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. them with a soft and gentle fire, the yolks will in their entire mass gather themselves orbicularly into the midst, and the whites surround them. Yet Physitians generally do decree the White to be the colder part. But of that more hereafter. The Chalazae, that is, the Hail-stones, or litle pearls or specks, like Haile (which the Italians call The Cha∣lazae. Galladura, and wee the Treddle) are two in every egge; one seated in the obtuse, the other in the Acute Angle of the egge. The major part of both which is found in the white, but yet they adhere closer to the yolke, and are annexed to its membrane. They are something oblong bodies, more congealed, and whiter then the white it self, knotly, and in some sort transparent, as Hail is, from whence they bor∣row their compellation: for every Chalaza con∣taineth several hail-stones as it were, glewed to one another by the white. One of these Chalazae is lar∣ger then his fellow, and more distant from the yolke, towards the blunt end of the egge; the other smaller, and tendeth from the yolke to the sharp end of the egge. The larger of these two is made up of three knotty substances, like haile-stones, or
seed-pearles, which are placed a small space one from the other, the lesser lying behinde the greater. In all eggs of all Birds whatsoever, whether they be fertile, or addle, these chalazae are to be found, and that in each end, one; whence the fond per∣swasion of old Wives, that the chalazae are the Cocks seed, and the subject matter out of which the chicken is procreated, lyeth waste, and overturned. And yet Fabricius himself, though he absolutely deny that they are made of the seed of the Cock, yet he laboureth with many arguments, to prove, pag. 48. that they are that immediate matter, which the Cock endoweth with fecundity, and out of which the fabrick of the chicken is erected: which he endeavoureth to evince by this fraile ground, that (forsooth) in an pag. 57. egge when its boyled, the chalazae are in such sort con∣tracted and shrunk up, as that they represent a con∣ception, or chicken shaped, and hatched. But how improbable a thing is it, that every egge should have two seeds or rudiments, for the constitution of one only chicken, when no man living ever yet be∣held any foundation or progress of a chicken, but only in the blunt angle of the egge? And moreo∣ver, there is no sensible difference at all between the chalazae of those eggs which coition hath made fruitful, and those which are altogether barren. But this worthy man was mistaken in the intent of the chalazae, which shall appear more clearly hereafter. In the eggs of the least Birds of all, you may track these chalazae, which appear there like a fine thred, or slender nerve. But in the two ends of the egs of the Ostrich and Cassoware, I have seen exceeding thick, long, and white chalazae, consisting of many little globous bodies, of different dimension.
In the blunter end of the egge, neer the shell in The Ca∣vity. the inside, you may discover a litle small cavity, or hollowness; which is sometimes exactly at the top of all, and sometimes inclining to one side, al∣most directly opposite to the Chalaza which is at the other end: the figure of it is most commonly circular, but in a goose or duck-egge it is not so pre∣cisely round. This cavity you may plainly see, ap∣pearing like a cloudy spot, if at night you hold an egge against a candle in one hand, and lay the o∣ther hand transversly upon the obtuse angle of the egge. In a new-layed egge it is but litle, seeming in magnitude of the bigness of the ball of a mans eye; but it increaseth dayly, according as the egge groweth staler, and the weather hotter. After one dayes incubation, it spreadeth main∣ly, as if some thinner part of the white, which ly∣eth uppermost, were exhaled, and the rest contra∣cted, and so the space grown wider. For this ca∣vity resideth between the shell, (which in that place hath no membrane to line it) and that out∣ward membrane which containeth all the liquidi∣ties of the egg. All eggs whatever have it, nay, I have found it in the eggs which remain as yet in the Uterus of the Henne, so soon as ever they as∣sume a shell. Some that pretend to cunning in this matter, will prognosticate, that if this cavity be directly in the top of the egge, the chicken then will be a cocke, but if it deflect to the side, it will be a henne. But this is most certain, if the cavity be very small, it signifieth the egge is new-layed, but if it be any thing large, a stale one. But more largely of this hereafter. There is a very small white circle embracing the The Cica∣trice. coat of the yolke (in fashion of a small Cicatrice)
which Fabricius therefore calleth Cicatricula; but he setteth litle by it, counting it rather a blemish, then a part of the egge. This is a very litle spot, about the bigness of a small Lentile, like the ball of a Birds eye, being white, flat, and round. And all egges have this too, even from their very first original in the yolk. And therefore Fabricius is deceived, while he fancieth this spot to be nothing but a relique of the stalk broken off from the yolk; by which it was incorporated to the cluster in the Ovary. For the Pedunculus or stalk (as himself ac∣knowledgeth) is hollow, and as it approacheth neerer to the yolk, it dilateth it self, that it may encompass it round, and shut it up as in a litle bag or purse; for it is not fastned into the middle of the yolk (as the stalks of Apples, and other Fruits are) that so it should leave a relique behinde it, when it falleth off. Now if sometimes in a very fair yolk (as Fabricius reporteth) you chance to finde a double Cicatrice, it may probably oc∣casion a Monster, or Twinnes, (as shall be discour∣sed hereafter) but doth no way import a double stalk. But he is extremely overseen, in thinking this Cicatrice to be utterly useless: for it is the most material, concerned part in the whole egge, for whose sake all the rest of the parts are created, and the original and foundation out of which the Chic∣ken it self is formed. And Parisanus doth falsly contend, that this is the Cocks seed.
Of the difference of Eggs. EXERCIT. XIII. THere is a two-fold acceptation of the word Egge; proper, or improper. An egge in its proper Ac∣ceptation is that thing, to which Aristotles definition Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5. of an egge doth square: An egge is that thing, one part of which doth constitute an Animal, and the rest doth nourish it, when it is constituted. In its improper acceptation, it is that to which Aristotles definition de gen. an. l. 1. c. 2. about the same place is proportioned. An Egge is that thing out of which the whole Animal is constitu∣ted. And of this kinde are the eggs of Ants, Flies, Spiders, some kinde of Butterflies, and many other very small egges of that kinde: which Aristotle doth almost every where scruple to call by the name of eggs, but stileth them little wormes. Thus far Fabricins; but we (whose designe is chiefly to treat of the pag. 19. generation of Hen-eggs) have no intention to de∣liver the several distinctions of all sorts of Eggs, but only to lay down the diversities of Hen-eggs. Of Hen-eggs therefore, some are new-laid, and some staler, the former are whiter then the later; for The di∣stinction and diffe∣rence of Eggs from their Age. time doth clowd them, and especially incubation. The New-laid also have a very small hollowness or cavity in the obtuse angle; and if they be very new indeed, they are something rough with a dust or powder that sticketh to their sides; but those that are stale, as their complexion is darker, so their shell is smoother. New-layed eggs (if they be whole) being put near the fire will sweat, and are of much pleasanter taste, and more esteemed of, then o∣ther. And eggs after two or three dayes incubati∣on,
are even then sweeter relished then stale ones are: as if the cherishing warmness of the Hen, did refresh and restore them to their primitive excel∣lence and integrity. And after full fourteen days (when the Chicken now beginneth to be downey, and extendeth his dominion over half the egge, and the jolke is almost still entire) I have boyled an egge till it was hard, that so I might discerne the position of the chicken more distinctly, which was limned out in the white of the egge, as if the chicken had been cast in a Mould: and yet the yolke was as sweet and pleasant as that of a new-laid egge, when it is in like manner boyled to an in∣duration. The yolke of an egge taken out of a live Hen, and presently eaten, tasteth much sweeter raw, then dressed. Eggs are likewise distinguishable from their fi∣gure; From their Fi∣gure. Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. l. 10. c. 52. lib. 9. de Rust. c. 5. for some are longer, and sharper then others. Out of these oblong and acute eggs (according to A∣ristotle) are hennes begotten, and of the blunt, cocks. But Pliny saith the contrary; The rounder sort of eggs (saith he) breed Hennes, the other, Cocks. And Columella is of his minde too: If one would have good store of Cocks (quoth he) let him place the longest and sharpest eggs under his Hen; and if the contrary, let him provide the roundest he can get for money. Ari∣stotles Scaliger upon the place. opinion is grounded upon this reason; namely, because the Rounder are the hotter; for it is the custom and condition of heat, to congre∣gate, and fix; and that heat is most powerful, that  most operative. And therefore from the strong∣er, and perfecter principle, the stronger and per∣fecter Animal doth arise. Now such is the Male in respect of the Female (especially the Cock being compared to the Henne.) And now on the other side, the lesser sort of egges are reputed imperfect,
and the least sort of all, utterly improlifical. And therefore Aristotle, to procure a constant race of egges of a fair size, recommendeth the frequent co∣ition of cock and hen; for he concludeth the barren and subvontuneous egges to be all of the lesser sort, and more insipid; and that because they are moi∣ster and imperfecter then others. Now this distin∣ction of egges here spoken of, is to be understood of the egges of one and the same hen (for should a hen lay eggs alwaies of the same dimensions, she would alwaies hatch them all cocks, or all hennes) because if you take it otherwise, the conjecture of which will be a cocke or a henne, raised from the signes above mentioned, will be very dubions. For several henns, lay eggs of a several shape, and mag∣nitude: for some lay oblong, some rounder, and li∣tle differing the one from the other. For though I have sometimes found a difference in the eggs lay∣ed by the same henn, yet the distinction is so ex∣ceeding small, that unless a man be very well ver∣sed, he will not perceive it. For since all the eggs of the same henne, are cast and modelled in the same womb (as in a Mould) they are all impressed with, neer upon, the same figure: and therefore it cannot be avoided, but that they should much re∣semble one another (as those excrements that are figured in the same complications of the same Co∣lon) insomuch that I my selfe have with case in a litle basket of egges sorted every hennes egges by themselves. And who ever practiseth it, shall be nimble at it. Certainly it is worth our wonder which dayly experience declareth in Keepers. The more diligent sort of Keepers of Parks, that have the charge of several herds of Deer, will tell you punctually which and which are the Hornes of such and such Deere, as often as they ca
their Heads. A silly, ignorant Shepherd, who had the care of a great flock of sheep, grew so well acquainted with every particular sheep, that if a∣ny one were missing (though he had not arithme∣tick enough to count them) he could punctually tell which it was, of whom it was bought, and whence it came. And once, to make tryal of him, his Master commanded him, out of forty lambes which he penned up in a Fould on purpose, to sin∣gle out the particular lamb of such an Ewe, which he did exactly, and carried to the Damme. I know some Huntsmen, that if they have once seen a Deer, or the hornes of a Deer, or footsteps only in soft ground, are able to know the same Deer again from all the Herd besides, even by those very horns, or tread: (just as the Lion is distinguished by his Pew) nay having meerly seen the print of the Deers hoofe, they will exactly resolve, how large the Deer is, how fat, and how swift: as whether he be well in breath, or over-hunted; and also, whether a Buck or a Doe. And more then this, there are some, who when forty Dogs are pursuing the Chase, and are in full Cry, will distinguish them all, (though a great way off) and will by their  inform you, which Dog is first, and which behinde; which hunteth upon the sent, and which is at a loss; whether the Deer be still in flight, or  a Bay, & disputing the conquest with his horns; whether he have stood long, or be newly rowsed. And all this in the very midst of the dogs, hunters, and windings of the horns, even in a woody Park, and where they were never in their lives before. We are not therefore to wonder so much, if those t practise it, can discover which Egge belong∣eth to which Hen: I would we could as easily judge which Son belongeth to which Father.
But the chiefe difference of Eggs consisteth in this, that some are fruitfull, and some addle, which From their Fe∣cundity. are called Ova improlifica, irrita, Hypenemia, or subventanea, and Zephyria. They are called Hy∣penemia, which being layed by the Hen without conference had with the Cock, are therefore of no use to the generation of Chickens, being stiled hy∣penemia, quasi a vento prognata forent, as if they were begotten by the winde: as Varro saith, that Mares in Spain conceive by the Winde. For the de Re rust. c. 1. West wind is exceeding fruitfull, and thence the name Zephyrus, quasi , enlivening; for so Virgil: —Zephyrique tepentibus auris Laxant arva sinus, superat tener omnibus burner, Parturit omnis ager, &c. —And when warm Zephyrus blows, The fields dissolve, soft moisture overflows, And every Pasture grows. And therefore the people of old, seeing their Hens in the Spring-time lay, this wind then blow∣ing, did conceive Zephyrus to be the Author of the generation of those eggs. Eggs are likewise Urine, and Cynosura (when the Hen will sit no longer upon them) so called, because egges grow oft∣en addle in the Dog-dayes, for the henne deserteth them by reason of the extream Heat; or else be∣cause about that time of the year, it thundered often: for Aristotle saith, that Egges rot, if at the Hist an. l. 6. c. 2. Pliny lib. 10. c. 54. time of the Hennes incubation it chance to thunders Those egges are esteemed foecunda, fruitfull, which (if there be no outward impediment) by a quick∣ning heat will generate chickens; which may be effected not onely by the incubation of the Hen
whose egges they are, but of any other Fowle of competent magnitude to cherish and cover them, or by any other cherishing warmth whatsoever. For Aristotle saith, That chickens are as well hatched upon the ground of their own accord, as by the Ibid. birds incubation: As in Egypt they cover the egges with dung. And the Story goeth, That a good fellow of Syracusa sate so long upon a mat under the which eggs were layed, that ere he had done tipling the chic∣kens were hatched. The Emperesse Livia is also reported to have cherished an egge so long in her bosom, till the chicken was bred. And to this day in Egypt, and other parts, chickens are hatched by stoves and ovens. An egge therefore (as Fabricius truly affirmeth) is not only the Uterus, and place pag. 19. of residence of the chicken, but the matter also on which the whole generation of the foetus doth de∣pend: which generation the egge doth performe and accomplish, both as Agent, Matter, Instrument, Place, and ever other Requisite whatsoever. For certain it is, that the chicken is constituted by an internal principle in the egge, and that there is no accession to a complete and perfect egge, by the Hennes incubation, but bare cherishing and prote∣ction: no more then the Hen contributeth to the chickens which are now hatched, which is onely a friendly heat, and care, by which she defendeth them from the cold, and forreign injuries, and help∣eth them to their meat. And therefore the Incu∣bation of the Henne is required, that she may upon that relation undertake the education of the chic∣ken, instruct and direct their walks, prepare and look for their feeding, and by the comfort of her wings cherish them. And all these things will not be so well performed by any but her. We have in∣deed Capons, and mungrel-fowle, such as are the is∣sue
of a Pheasant-cock and a Dunghill-henne, which will sit upon the egges, and hatch them too, but they have no dexterity to guide the chickens, or mannage the charge of their education. I can here but admire (intending to treat lar∣ger hereafter of the same matter) with what con∣stancy and patience, almost all female Birds will out-sit whole nights and dayes, and impare their healths, and almost famish themselves; and to what hazards they expose themselves in defence of their egges, which, if upon necessary occasion they are at any time constrained to leave, oh! how earnestly, and with what dispatch doe they hasten their return! Ducks, and Geese, for the time of their absence, cover their eggs with straw. And with what undaunted resolution will these feeble parents many times combat in right of their egges, which perhaps are subventaneous or addle, nay sometimes artificial of-springs, the issues of chalk or ivory, whose injuries yet they will revenge with the same magnanimity, with those done to their legitimate productions? Indeed the Birds affe∣ction towards the dull, liveless egge, is exceeding wonderful, which is altogether incapable of ma∣king any return of friendship or respect. Who can forbeare to be amazed at the affection, or phrensie rather of a Henne that is glocking, or ready to sit which nothing can extinguish, but a deluge of cold water; for so long as this rage is upon her,  groweth quite careless, and walkes like a bed him, with her wings trailed, and feathers rough, and ad∣vanced, and she her self mournful, and restless:  she meet with any Henne sitting, she will depose her, having all her thoughts bent upon egges and incubation; nor will she desist, till shee either  egges to sit upon, or chickens to discipline: which
then she doth assemble, nurture, feed, and protect with admirable zeal. Who can refrain smiling, to see a Henne follow young Ducklins, and having hatched up that supposititious brood (apprehend∣ing them to be her own) pursue them when they are now swimming in the Pond, while she her self circuites about the brimmes, and many times at∣tempts to sail after to the hazard of drowning, still calling, and enticeing them back, as if they had mistaken themselves. Aristotle giveth this reason why steril egges pro∣duce Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. no chickens, namely, because the juices con∣tained in them receive no thickening by incubation, neither doth their yolk or white recede any thing from the nature they were of before. But of this wee shall discourse hereafter, in our general contemplation of Generation. Our women, that they may distinguish between egges that have chickens in them, and egges that are barren and addle, after the fourteenth or sixteenth day from the Hennes first sitting, do gently drop the egges into warme water, and those that sinke to the bottom they account barren, but those that swim, fertile. And if the chicken in the egge be of any considerable growth, and bestirre himself lustily, the egge will not onely tumble up and down, but leap and caper. And if you listen close for some dayes before exclusion, you may perceive the chic∣kens, kick, make a noise, and cry after their manner. Which kinde of Commotions when the Sitting Henne discovereth in her nest, she removeth the egges, and rowleth them to and fro, (as care∣full mothers do their disquiet and peevish infants in the craedle) till the chickens being accommodated with convenient posture, lye hushed, and still. Hen-eggs are likewise distinguished from their From Number.
Number. For some Hens (saith the Philosopher) lay Hist. an. l. 6. c. 1. all the year long, bating onely the two Winter moneths. Some gallant Hens will bring sixty eggs before the Su∣ting time; yet these are not so fruitfull as the ordinary sort of Hens. The Adrian Hens are small, but lay e∣very day; yet they are very testy, and many times  their chickens; and their feathers are of change  colours. Some domestick Hens will lay twice a day and the fecundity of some, shorteneth their dayes. Some Hens in England lay every day; but the ordinary fertile race, for the most part, lay for two dayes together; namely, the first egg in the morn∣ing, the second in the evening following, and the third is a day of vacancy. Some Hens have an un∣lucky custome to break their eggs, and leave their nests; but whether this be their disease, or vice, is yet unresolved. There are differences also taken from Incubation; for some Hennes sit once, some twice, others thrice, Incuba∣tion. and some oftner. Florentinus writeth, that certain Hennes, Natives of that Alexandria which is in E∣gypt, called Monosirae, of whom springeth a race of Game-cocks, doe sit two or three times, having the chickens which they have newly hatched taken from them, & brought up apart. By which mean it cometh to pass, that one Hen will hatch forty, sixty, and sometimes more chickens at one sitting. Some Eggs also are of a large, some of a less, and Magni∣tude. some of the least size of all; and these last are com∣monly called in Italy, Centenina; and our Women, to this day, (as of old also) bely them to be Cocks-eggs, and that they produce Basilisks. The Common people (saith Fabricius) think this small egge to be the Hennes concluding production, after she hath layed at pag. 10. hundred eggs (from whence it is called Centeninum, the Hundredth egge) which hath no yolk at all; yet
hath all the other parts, as the Chalazae, the White, the Membranes, and the Shell. For it is likely that this is then layed, when all the yolkes are already com∣pleted into Eggs, and there is no more remaining, yolks the Vitellary, that may become eggs; but yet on the other side, there is still some litle White behinde, and  of that Modicum of White it is probable this litle Egge is framed. But this seemeth not probable to ; because it is an assured truth, that when the Ovary is exhausted, the Second Uterus also (as him∣selfe confesseth) is also spent, and wasted into a eer membrane, not containing any residue of the White, or Moisture at all. Fabricius goeth on: There i sound a two-fold Ovum Centeninum, one without a yolk, (and this is properly called Centeninum) which is the last the henne layeth, with which the henne, con∣cludeth her Laying for that season: the other also is a very small egge, but hath a yolke, and is not the con∣cluding, but some intervenient egge, after which the henne doth persist to lay egges of a just magnitude, as before; but it faileth in its dimensions, by reason of some impair in the vegetal faculty, as it happeneth to Peaches, and other Fruits, whereof some are of a full growth, and others exceeding small. He might have accused for this mischance, the inclemency of the Aire, and Soile, also the penury, and pravity of the nourishment. But, that the last Egges are alwaies very litle, I cannot willingly consent. Nor are even Egges without their Monsters. For Aldro∣vand. Or∣nithol. l. 14. pag. 260 the Augurs (saith Aristotle) did account it Ominous, when Eggs were laid that were all yolke; or when such egges were found in the henne, she being cut up, under the Septum Transversum, and they of the magnitude of a Perfect Egge. And hither may be referred Ova Gemellifica, Twinne-eggs, which are furnished with two yolkes;
such as I lately found in the Uterus of a henne, i being complete, and guarded with a Shell, having Yolks, Cicatrices, and the grosser Whites, all doubles it had also four Chalazae; but, as for the White of thinner consistence, there was onely One, which did encompass all the rest: it had also two onely com∣mon investing Membranes, and one single Shell. For though Aristotle affirme, that some hennes alwaies produce such Eggs; yet, that it so happeneth by the course of nature, I can hardly believe. And though two chickens may be hatched out of such Eggs, (which I have experimented, contrary to Fabricius his perswasion, who saith, that of such all eg, the chicken hatched will have four legs, two heads, & four wings; of which hereafter) yet they are not vital, but commonly dye soon, and that either for defect of Aire, or room in the Shell, or that one is an impediment to the other, and doth violence to it; for it cannot be, that both should be equally rea∣dy and ripe for Exclusion, and that one should not prove an Abortion. To summe up all: The Differences of Eggs are chiefly of three kindes: For some are Fertile, and some Addle; some produce Cocks, and some Hens; some spring from Parents of the same species, and some from Parents of a diverse species, and so bring mungril-chickens; such as are conceived from a Dunghill-hen, and a Cock-Pheasant, and so resem∣ble either the Cock that obtained the first, or last Coition. For, according to Aristotle, the egge which is con∣stituted by Coition, passeth from its own kinde into an∣other, Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. in case the henne proceed to Coition, (having either a barren egge in her, or else an egge conceive by the semen of cocks of different kinde) before the yolk have procured its white. And thus are barren egg
fructified, and fruitfull eggs entertain the form of that ocke, who had the last courtesie in Coition. But if the White be already obtained, it cannot be, that either barren eggs should be altered into fruitfull; or that those egges which are already conceived by Coition, should pass into the kinde of that cock who was last en∣tertained. For the Cocks semen is (as Scaliger sharp∣ly observeth) like A Testament, where the last will In loc. is that which taketh place. To these differences may be perhaps added, that, whereby some Eggs are strong, veget, and (if wee may so say) couragious; for as there is a soule in Eggs, so have they likewise a competent vertue. For as in other sorts of Animals, some Females are so libidinous and full of venery, that they take like Tinder, from one single act of Coition (be it never so feeble, and the male never so impotent) and conceive forthwith, and bring diverse foetuses by that one act: others again are so dull and sluggish, that unless they be provided with a more gene∣rous male, and him also highly inflamed (and the coition likewise repeated and continued) they will remain unsuccessfull. The same also befalleth in Eggs, whereof some, though conceived by coition, are improlifical, unless they be impowered by re∣peated, and continued coition. Hence it cometh to pass, that some egges are quickly altered, and after three dayes of Incuba∣tion discover some rudiments of a foetus: but o∣thers are either easily corrupted, or are slow in their progress towards chickens, and yield no ex∣pectation of a chicken, even at the seventh day: As shall be hereafter proved, in the discourse of the Ge∣neration of the Pulbus, or Chicken out of the Egge. And thus farre of the Womb of the Hen, and its Office: as also of the Generation of the Hen-egge, its
differences, and accidents: wherein we have deli∣vered what we have experimented our selves; by which you may give judgement of other Ovip∣rous creatures. It now remaineth that we should prosecute  history, of the Generation, and Formation of the Foe∣tus out of the Egge. For (as I informed you be∣fore) the whole Contemplation of the brood of H and Cocks is comprehended in these two things namely, how the Egge is produced of the Henne and Cocke, and how the Cock and Henne are fra∣med out of an Egge: and by this circle the pro∣pagation of their Race may by the benefit and fa∣vour of Nature, be prolonged, and continued. Of the generation of the Foetus out of a Hen-egge. EXERCIT. XIV. WEe have already discovered the Formation, and Generation of the Egge; it remains that we now deliver our Observations, concerning the Procreation of the Chicken out of the Egge. An un∣dertaking equally difficult, usefull, and pleasant as the former. For Natures Rudiments and At∣tempts are involved in obscurity and deep night, and so perplext with subtilties, that they delude the most piercing wit, as well as the sharpest eye. Nor can we easier discover the secret recesses, and dark principles of Generation, then the me∣thod of the fabrick and Composure of the which
world. In this reciprocal interchange of Generati∣on and Corruption consists the Aeternity and Dura∣ of mortal creatures. And as the Rising and etting of the Sun, doth by continued revolutions complete and perfect Time: so doth the alternate vicissitude of Individuums, by a constant repetition of the same species, perpetuate the continuance of ading things. Those Authors which have delivered any thing touching this subject, do for the most part tread a several Path: for having their Judgements pre∣possessed with their own private opinions, they pro∣ceed to erect and fashion principles proportionable to them. Aristotle of old, and Hieronymus Fabricius of late, Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. have written so accurately concerning the Forma∣tion and Generation of the Foetus out of the Egge, that they seem to have left litle to the industry of Posterity. And yet Ulysses Aldrovandus hath under∣taken Ornithol. l. 14. the description of the Pullulation or formati∣on of the Chicken out of the Egge, out of his own Ob∣servations: wherein he seems rather to have direct∣ed and guided his thoughts by the Authority of A∣ristotle, then his own Experience. For Volcherus Coiter, living at Bononia at the same time, did by the advice of the said Aldrovandus (whom he calls Tutor) dayly employ himself in the opening of Egges then sat upon by the Hen, and hath discovered many things truer then Aldro∣vandus Nobil. exer. l. 6. himself, of which he also could not be ig∣norant. Likewise Aemilius Parisanus (a Venetian Doctor) despising other mens opinions, hath fan∣cted A new procreation of the Chicken out of the Egge. But because somethings, (according to our ex∣perience) and those of great moment and conse∣quence,
are much otherwise, then hath been y delivered, I shall declare to you what dayly pro∣gress is made in the egge, and what parts are alt∣ed, especially about the first dayes of Incubation at which time all things are most intricate, con∣fused, and hard to observe, and about which Au∣thors do chiefly stickle for their own observation, which they accommodate rather to their own  conceived perswasions (which they have entertained concerning the Material and Efficient causes of the generation of Animals) then to truth her self. What Aristotle relates concerning the Prc∣tion of the Chicken, is most true in it selfe; yet li one who had not experimented the matters him self, but had received them from other experien∣ced persons, he doth not rightly distinguish them by their proper times: and is very much mistaken concerning the place in which the first principle of the Chicken is cast, which he decrees to be in th Acute Angle of the Egge, and is therefore justly re∣prehended by Fabricius. Nor doth he seem to have observed the beginning of the Pullus in the egge, or to have been able to have found those things there, which he accounts necessary to every Gene∣ration. For he would have the White (because no∣thing can possibly be made of nothing, according to the natural course) to be the Matter constitution the Chicken. Nor did hee sufficiently apprehend how the Efficient cause (namely the Cocks seed)  act without a contact; or how the Egge could of its own accord, without any inherent geniture of the Male, ingender the Foetus. Aldrovandus, partaking of the same error with Aristotle, saith moreover, (which none but a blind man can subscribe to) that the Yolk doth in the first dayes, arise to the Acute Angle of the Egge: and
tinks the Grandines to be the Seed of the Cock; and that the Pullus is framed out of them, but nou∣rished as well by the Yolk as the White: which is clean contrary to Aristotles opinion, who concei∣ved the Grandines to conduce nothing to the fe∣cundity of the Egge. Volcherus Coiter delivers truer things, and more consonant to Autopsie, yet his three Globuli are meer fables. Nor did he rightly consider the prin∣ciple, from whence the Foetus is derived in the Egg. Hieronymus Fabricius indeed contends, that the Grandines are not the Seed of the Cock: and yet he ill have the body of the Chicken to be framed out of them. (as out of its first matter) being made fruitfull by the Seed of the Cock. He likewise saw the Origi∣nal of the Chicken in the Egge; namely the Macu∣la, or Cicatricula annexed to the membrane of the Yolke, but conceived it to be onely a Relique of the stalk broken off, and an infirmity or blemish onely of the Egge, and not a Principle part of it. Parisanus hath plentifully confuted Fabricius his opinion concerning the Chalazae or Grandines, and yet himself is evidently at a loss in some certaine circles and points of the Principle parts of the Foe∣tus (namely the Liver and the Heart:) and seems to have observed a Principium, or first Principle of the Foetus, but not to have known which it was,  that he saith, That the Punctum Album in the Middle of the Circles is the Cocks Seed, out of which the Chicken is made. So that it comes to pass, that while each of them desire to reduce the manner of the Formation of the Chicken out of the Egge, to their own pre-conceived opinions, they are all wide from the mark. For some conceive the Seed and Blood to be the Matter which doth constitute the Chicken: Others
conceive the Seed to be the Efficient and producing cause, or Artificer that builds the fabrick of it: wh yet upon deliberate consideration it appears most infallible, that there is no matter at hand at all,  no menstruous blood, which the Seed of the Male can fall to work upon, or coagulate: (as Aristotle would have it) nor is the Foetus made of the Seed of Male or Female, or any commixture of them both. The first Inspection of the Egge, what the first day of Incubation doth produce in the Egge. EXERCIT. XV. THat we may the better discover what the first day of incubation hath produced in the Egge we must first know what alterations will befal o egges of their own accord; by which a stale egge is distinguished from a fresh, (without any consi∣deration of the Hens sitting at all) that so it may appear, what is wrought by the very incubation it selfe. There is therefore (as we have declared before) in all egges, a certain cavity or hollow i the blunt end of the egge; which cavity as the egge groweth staler, increaseth accordingly: especi∣ally in hot Countries and seasons (by reason the exhalation of a thinner part of the white:) we have spoken in the History of the egge. An while that cavity doth exspatiate, it enlarges mo according to the longitude, then latitude of the
Egge, and obtaineth a figure at last which doth re∣e from being orbicular. The Egg-shell being now less transparent, grow∣th cloudy. The White groweth thicker, and more viscous, ding towards a duskey or Straw-colour. The Proper membrane or coat of the Yolke be∣cometh more remiss and loose, shrinking up into winckles. The Chalazae continue still the same place, site, and consistence, at each end of the egge (and that not in new-layed egges onely, but stale ones; nor  those alone that are conceived after coition, but wind-eggs also;) by whose firme connexion, the Yolk and White are so fast cemented together, that both retain their proper position. For these are two abiliments mutually opposed, or the Poles and inges of this Microcosme: so composed, as if they were onely a conflux of the numerous coats of the White, and were wound as it were into a knotty rd, at both ends where they respect the yolk. And hence it cometh to pass, that the yolk is not easily ted from the company of the White, except the Chalazae be first divided: which done, they pre∣sently dis-join. And by the assistance of these hin∣es, the yolk is both fixed in the center, and preser∣ed in its right consistence. So that the chief part f all, namely the Cicatricula, retaineth still the  region or altitude in the Egge, and continueth a middle space from both the extremities. For is Spot, or Cicatrice, as well in a stale, as new-laid gge, is still found in the same consistence, magni∣fide, colour, and site. But so soon as ever the egge lineth to Pullulation, be it either from the Incu∣bation of the Hen, or the accession of any other fo∣ing heat whatsoever, this Spot is presently di∣lated,
and widened like the Ball of the eye: and from it (as from the choisest center of the egg) the secret plastick faculty doth issue out, and germi∣nate. And yet this first Principle of the egge was never yet (to my knowledge) observed by any man. Now, at the second day of Incubation, when the Egge hath grown warm four and twenty houres under the Hen, as its cavity which is in the obtuse angle is much amplified, and fallen lower; so al∣so doth the interiour constitution of the egge vary and change. For the Yolk which before stuck fast in the center of the White, ariseth towards the bl angle; and the middle part of it, where the Spot i ingrafted, is elevated, and applyeth it self to that membrane which encompasseth the cavity, so that now the Yolk seemeth to be annexed to the cavity by the Cicatrice. And as much as the Yolk riseth upward, so much is the grosser part of the White depressed towards the acute or lower angle Whence it appeareth (as Fabricius rightly noted) that either Aristotle was in an errour, or else the Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. there is a fault in the impression, where it is said, A∣bout that time (namely, within three dayes and a nights) the yellow humour is lifted to the  there where the eggs beginning is, and where the egg is naked there about (namely, at the dilated cavity. For Aristotle calleth that the beginning where the Acute Angle is, which parteth last from the Henn Ibid. l. 3. c. 2. But notwithstanding all this, it is an undoubt truth, that the Yolke ariseth towards the Blunt an∣gle of the egge, and that the cavity is there dilated And so questionless Aldrovandus is deceived,  (though he speak as if he had experimented  matter) saith, that the Yolk riseth to the Acute an∣gle. I confess, I have sometimes seen, about
second and third day, the Cicatricula dilated, and a foundation laid towards the formation of the Foetus, when the yolk as yet was not ascended. But this is very rare, and I conceived it to happen so, by reason of the imbecillity, and infirmity of the Egge. On the second day of Incubation, or first of Inspe∣ction, the fore-said Spot is dilated to the magni∣tude of a Pease, or Lentil, and is divided into cir∣cles, (as if they were drawn by a pair of Compas∣ses) which have a very small white Point for their Center. It is very probable, that Aldrovandus also did observe this Macula, or Spot; for he saith, In the midst of the yolk there appeared some kinde of whi∣tish thing. So did Coiterus, where he saith, The second day, there remained in the middle of the yolke a whiter part. And Parisanus also, who saith, The second day, I saw a white substance about the bigness of an in∣different faire Lentile, and of that figure: and this (saith he) is the Cocks semen, enwrapped in a white and most slender coat, lying under the two common membranes of the egge, but above the proper contain∣ing coat of the yolke. And yet I conceive, that no man hitherto hath acknowledged, that this Cica∣tricula was to be found in every egge, nor that it was the first Principle of the Egge. In the meane while the Chalazae or seed-pearls, do decline on each side from the two ends of the egge, towards the sides: and this proceedeth from the shifted scituation of the White and Yolk. So that one of the Chalazae descendeth something from the obtuse angle, and the other ascendeth pro∣portionably, from the Acute; as in an Oblique Sphere, by how much one Pole is elevated above the Horizon, by so much is the other depressed un∣der it.
And now the Yolk (especially about that part where the Cicatricula resideth) doth begin to dis∣solve and melt a litle, and the proper coat thereof (which in staler egges is remiss, slack, and wrinc∣kled) groweth smooth and full; the Yolk it self also seemeth to have regained the same colour, consistence, and inoffensive taste, which it former∣ly had, when the egge was new. And this is the first dayes Progress of the Egge, towards a Chicken, and the first platform of its approach. But Aldrovandus addeth, that there is as yet no alteration at all in the White; wherein hee saith right. But where he affirmeth, that the Se∣men of the Cock is perceived in the Yolk, he is appa∣rently in the wrong. His Argument by which he would maintain the Chalazae to be Semen Galli, is exceeding slender, and that is, because egges which are destitute of these Chalazae, are not fruitfull. Hee is much in the right; for indeed they are not Eggs without them. For in all eggs, be they fertile, or not fertile, these Chalazae are inseparable In-mates. But perhaps the Good-wives deceived him (which call these Chalazae, Galladura, in Italian) and so be∣trayed him into the common Heresie. Nor is Hie∣ronymus Fabricius less guilty of Imprudence, who offereth to our view the formation of the Pullus, graven in several Tables; contending, that it is bo∣dyed, and constituted out of these Chalazae; not so much as taking notice, that the Chalazae are all this while both of them entire, and unaltered (ha∣ving onely removed their stations) and that the Exordium of the Chicken is to be sought a good distance from the Chalazae.
The second Inspection of the Egge. EXERCIT. XVI. WHen two dayes are now passed, the afore∣said circles of the Cicatricula are more am∣ple, and conspicuous, being of the breadth of the Ring-finger, and sometimes of the Middle; where∣in the whole Macula or Spot is divided into two (and sometimes into three) Regions, and those oftentimes inammelled, and obscurely shadowed with several colours; fully representing the figure of an Eye, and that not only by reason of its pro∣tuberance, like that in the Tunica Cornea, or horny membrane, or coat of the Eye; but magnitude al∣so, and likewise of that most transparent, most lu∣cid humour contained in it: whose Center repre∣senteth the Pupilla, or sight of the eye; but having a white point fixed in the center, it resembleth the eye of some small Bird, where the middle of the Pupilla is blemished and disfigured by some suffu∣sion, or Cataract: (as they call it) and from this Resemblance we call it Oculum Ovi, the Eye of the Egge. Between these Circles is contained a most bright refulgent liquor, clearer then any Crystal∣line humour in the world; which if you look upon against the light, the whole Macula will now ra∣ther appear in the White of the Egge, then rivited into the membrane of the Yolke (as formerly it did) and (like some part or portion of the White, dis∣solved, and clarified) contained and bounded within a most slender coat belonging to it self. And this is the reason why I call this Liquor, Oculum, the Eye, or Colliquamentum Candidum, the white
dissolved substance; as if it were some portion of the white of the Egge, melted and liquefied by the heat shining in its own sphere apart, (unless it be scattered and distracted by concussion) and seem∣eth like a more refined, and more concocted, spiri∣tuous part, distinguished from the courser White by a peculiar inclosure of its own, and seated and in∣throned in the midst, between both Yolk and White. It as much surpasseth the rest of the White in clear∣ness, and transparence, as the most Crystal Spring excelleth the troubled Lake. The Coat encircling this humor, is so nice and fraile, that (if you be not exceeding circumspect) it will soon be rent, and so disparage the purity of this, with the confu∣sion of other liquors. And here my thoughts were a long time strang∣ly divided, what I should resolve concerning this Candidum colliquamentum; whether I should name it the Calidum Innatum, or Humidum Radicale, the Radical Heat, or Moysture, or the prepared matter from which the future foetus was to take its rise: or the Aliment exactly concocted, such as the Ros is reputed to be amongst the secundary humours? For I was fully satisfied (as I shall declare hereaf∣ter) that in the midst of this the first rudiments of the Foetus lay, and that this also was its nourish∣ment, and after it was of some growth, the place of its abode. Hence it appeareth, that this Colliquamentum is soon enlarged, (namely in the compass of a day) as is evidently deciphered in Fabricius his second Figure, especially the inward Region of it; which, while it dilateth it self, it obliterateth and quite expungeth the outward. As you may observe in the Eyes of those creatures whose fight of the Eye is very large, and therefore they see better in the
Night then in the Day (of which kinde are Owles, Cats, and the like; whose Sight is most dilated in the dark, but more contracted in the Light:) for if you transferre such a creature nimbly from the light into the shade, you shall perceive plainly how the the sight is distended, so that it will much diminish the other circle, (which is called the I∣ris) and almost quite over-run it. Parisanus lighting upon these circles, was much mistaken; for he mustereth up amongst his cir∣cles, a white one, a yellow one, one of the complexion of honey, and another white one besides; asserting the foetus to be made of the middle white point (which doth indeed really appeare in the midst of those circles) which he fancieth to be the Semen Galli. And that he may approve himself more cunning and subtile yet, Before (saith he) there appeareth any blushing or redness in the body of the Foetus, there are in it as it were two exceeding small Bullulae or Bubbles; neither of which hath any ruddiness at all at the first: and one of these Bullulae he would obtrude upon us for the Heart, and the other for the Liver. But the truth is, that no such Bullula is to be seen at all, before a sanguine ruddiness doth appear; Nor doth the Foetus look red at all at first; Nor do any of those Bullulae give us any representation at all of a Liver, but both of them express the two Ventricles of the Heart, and by leaping (as shall be explained hereafter) do make mutual returns to one another by their Systole and Diastole. Aristotle seemeth to have understood this colli∣quamentum, Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. where he saith, About that time (name∣ly the third day) there is a certain membrane diva∣ricated with certain sanguineous fibers, which contain a white liquor, arising from the spriggs of those veines. For by white liquor, he could not mean the whole
white of the egge; because the coat of the white is not then sprinckled with veins, but onely the coat of this colliquamentum. And therefore he saith, There is a membrane also, intimating a distinct mem∣brane from those of the Yolk and White, in that he saith it ariseth from the spriggs of the veines, about the third day. Coiterus also seemeth to have ac∣knowledged this colliquamentum, saying, Some part of the White approacheth neerer to white∣ness then the other, and some to density. Now the aforesaid colliquamentum is encompassed with its proper coat, and is distinct and separate from the rest of the White, before any part at all of the blood appear. We shall have occasion to discourse hereafter of the mighty use of this colliquamentum, in relation to the foetus of all kinde of Animals. For while they swim there, they are guarded, and skreened from all concussion, contusion, and other outward in∣juries, and are also nourished by it. I saw long since a foetus of the magnitude of a Pease-cod, cut out of the Uterus of a Doe, which was complete in all its members (so that it was appa∣rently a Male by the parts:) I shewed this pretty Spectacle and Rarity of Nature to our late King, and Queen. It did swim, trim and perfect, in such a kinde of White, most transparent, and crystalline moysture (as if it had been treasured up in some most clear glassie receptacle) about the bigness of a Pigeous egge, and was invested with its proper coat.
The third Inspection of the Egge. EXERCIT. XVII. WE have seen the second Progress, or prepa∣ration of the Egge towards the Foetus, which falleth within the third dayes Observation. It fol∣loweth that we now attend the third Appearance; which presenteth it selfe to our view after three daies and as many nights. And of this Aristotle: There doe begin to appear Hist.  1. . 6. c. 3. some indications of Generation in Hennes, after three dayes, and so many nights; (as suppose upon Mun∣day morning, in case that on the precedent Fryday∣morning the Eggs were layed under the Hen, then ready to sit) and the declaration of this Inspection, is the purpose of Fabricius his third Figure. If therefore you observe on the fourth day, you will meet a great Metamorphosis, and wonderfull alteration; which are more evident, for almost e∣very hour all that day long: about which time the Egg beginneth to step from the life of a Plant, to the life of an Animal. For now the Limbus or hemme of the colliquamentum beginneth to blush and purple, being encompassed with a slender bloody line: and in the center almost of it, there leapeth a capering bloody point, which is yet so ex∣ceeding small, that in its Diastole, or Dilatation, it flasheth onely like the most obscure and almost in∣discernable spark of fire; and presently upon its Systole or Contraction, it is too subtile for the eye, and quite disappeareth. So slender are the first Ru∣diments of Creatures lives, which the Plastical fa∣culty
sets on foot by so undiscoverable beginnings. If you are desirous to make discovery of this observation toward the declining of the third day, you may if you be extreamly intent, by the assi∣stance of a clear & great light, or by the Sun beams, or a Perspective, make a shift to discerne it. For else, this purple streak is so exceeding nice, and fine, and the motion of the Punctum saliens is so impercepti∣ble, that you will only loose your labour. But, at the beginning of the fourth day it is evident, and at the end thereof, most notoriously visible, that the Punctum sanguineum saliens hath now Animal mo∣tion (saith Aristotle) in the candid liquor: (which I call colliquamentum.) And from that (Point) two hollow threads like veines, full of blood, are car∣ried crooked to the purple Line, and the coat en∣compassing the colliquamentum: scattering as they pass along many fibrous branches through the whole space and continent of the colliquamentum, all which spring from the same Original (as the boughs of Trees from the same Trunke,) In the crooked Angle of this Root, and the Middle of the colliquamentum, the Punctum Rubrum Saliens is en∣throned, which keeps time and decorum in its pul∣sation, compounded of a Systole, and Diastole. In the Diastole, as if it did imbibe a larger proportion of blood, it dilates it self, and leaps; but connives in the Systole, as if it suffered a convulsion by the stroke, and resigned the blood again. Fabricius hath described this Punctum or Point, in his third Figure, and, (which is strange) took it for the body of the Foetus; as if either he had not observed its leaping, and pulsation, or else had not understood that text of Aristotle, or at best had forgotten it. But that which is yet more strange, is,
that he should be nothing mindfull all this while of his chalazae, from which himself deduces the rudiments of the chicken. Ulysses Aldrovandus, a Writer in Bouonia, about Ornithol. l. 14. pag. 217. that time saith, There appeared in the White a litle kinde of Punctum saliens, or capering Point, which is the same which Aristotle decrees to be the Heart. Out of which I plainly discovered a litle Trunke of a vein to arise, and two other litle branches tending to∣wards this, which were those very channels of blood, which he had wrote to be sent forth to the two coats en∣compassing the Yolk and White. Now I am clear of his Opinion, conceiving those passages to be Veins, and to have a pulsation, containing a purer blood in them, and such as is usefull and proper for the generation of the more principle parts; namely, the Liver, and the Lungs, and the like. But both these are not veines, nor have they both a pulsation; for one is an Arte∣rie, the other a vein, as wee shall hereafter shew: where we shall also declare, that these Meatus do become the Umbilical vessels of the Foetus. Volcherus Coiter hath these words: The litle bloo∣dy Point, or Globulus found before in the yolke, is now rather in the white, and evidently pulsatile. Now he is out, in sayng, It was found before in the yolke; for that Point which was in the yolke was white; and did not leap neither; nor doth the bloody point or Globulus appear to leap the second day af∣ter Incubation. But that Point (which we have de∣clared to be placed in the Middle of the round, as if it were the center, and which is annexed to the yolke) doth vanish quite away, before the Point, which Aristotle calleth Punctum saliens, can be dis∣cerned at all, or (as I believe) becometh red, and leaping. For both these Points are seated in the center of the colliquamentum, and neer the root and
original of the veines which spring from thence: but they are never seen together, but the Red, which is the Punctum saliens, succeeds in the place of the White one. In this indeed Volcherus is in the right, where be saith, The Punctus saliens is now rather found in the White, then in the Yolke. By which words,  was incited to make diligent search, whether th Punctus albus be transmuted into the Punctum san∣guineum; because both of them are almost of the same magnitude, and did seem scituate in the same place. And sometimes, I found, the glistering purple circle which is the outermost, ending about the vermilion horizon, encompassed by the Colliqua∣mentum; in whose center there was the Punctus al∣bus, but not the Ruber, or Saliens: but I never saw those two Points together. This disquisition is of great moment; namely, Whether there be blood before Pulsation, and, Whether the Punctus arise from the Veines, or the Veines from the Punctus? According to my observation the Blood seems to be before the Pulse; and I therefore believe it, be∣cause, Upon Wednesday about the Evening, I put three egges under the Henne, and upon Saturday, a litle before the same time, I found these egges cold, as being forsaken by the Henne; however, open∣ing one of them, I found the rudiments of a Chicken; namely the Purple and bloody Line in the circle: but in the center, instead of the Punctum saliens, I found the Punctum album, which is bloodless. By which I perceived the Henne had not long desert∣ed her charge: whereupon, seizing upon her by force, I penned her up all night, having first layed the two former remaining egges, with other that were not there before, into the Nest. Now for the success: The next morning betimes, my two egges
were well recovered; and I found in the center the Punctum Micans, which was much less then the Punctum Album; out of which (namely the Pun∣ctum Album) a spark or lightning, darting as it were from a cloud, appeared in the Diastole onely: So that to my Apprehension, the Punctum Rubrum did leap out of the Punctum Album, at least that Punctum is generated in the Punctum Album, and  being now there, hath its Birth, or at least its  there. Nay, I have many times observed, The Punctum saliens, when (as quite expired) it lay deprived of all motion, it hath regained fresh motion and pulsation, by a new heat and cherish∣ing. Therefore in order of Generation, I conceive that the Punctum and Blood do first exist, but the pulsation arriveth not till afterward. And this is most certain, that nothing at this time appears, besides the bloody streaks, the Pun∣ctum saliens, and those Veins which are all derived from one Trunk (as that Trunk it self from the Pun∣ctum saliens) and do afterward constitute the Um∣bilical Vessels: which being disseminated farre and wide, the foetus at length (according to it growth) doth attract sustenance from the Yolk and White. You may see a lively resemblance of these Veins & their propagations in the leaves of Trees, whose fibres do all proceed from the pedunculus or stalk, and are diffused from one Trunk through the whole capa∣city of the Leaf. This whole entire Colliquamentum, distinguished and sprinkled with bloody fibres, representeth the form & magnitude of the two wings of a Butterflie. And it is no other then that Membrane which Ari∣stotle In loc. supra dict. speaks of, where he saith, The Membrane diva∣ricated with bloody fibres, containeth then a white li∣quor, springing from those Meatus of the Veins.
About the end of the fourth, and beginning of the fifth day, being now enlarged, it seemeth to be changed into a small thin bladder, containing blood in it; which it ejects at every contraction, and recalls again at every diastole. Hitherto I could not discover any distinction of Vessels: for the Arteries do not yet differ from veines, either in coat, or Pulsation: and therefore I call the vessels indifferently veines, or with Ari∣stotle, Meatus Venales, Veinal Passages, or Chan∣nels. This Punctum (saith Aristotle) now bestirres it self like an Animal; for Motion and Sense distin∣guish an Animal from a non Animal. Since there∣fore this Punctum begins now first to move, wee may justly say it hath put on the nature of an A∣nimal: and that the Egge which was before en∣dowed with a vegetative soule, is now over and a∣bove that, furnished with a Motive and sensation power; and is raised from a Plant to an Animal and that at the same time the soule of the Foetus is gone in, which first formes the chicken ou of the Egge, and afterward informs that chic∣ken. For Aristotle demonstratively resolves of the Lib. de A∣nimâ. Faculties, by the Operations; and from them also concludes of the cause and fountain of Life (name∣ly the Soul) and that to be in, actually, (where the Operations actually are.) And I am confirmed by many proofs and expe∣riments, that not motion onely is now the compa∣nion of the Punctum saliens, but also Sense it self For upon every touch, be it never so gentle, it is variously provoked, and disturbed, (at the same rate as sensative bodies proclaime their distastes by particular motions) and so offended with repe injuries, that they did confound the chime and
order of its pulses. So in the Plant, called the sensa∣tive Plant, and other Zoophyta, we conclude there is sense; because upon touch they contract them∣selves, and take it unkindly. I have, I say, often seen, and so have many more who have been present, this Punctum, upon conta∣ction by a needle, probe, or the finger it self, nay up∣on the admission of a more searching heat or cold, or any other thing that could molest, and disor∣der, declare many symptoms of its resentment; for it would flie into many permutations of pulse, beating much stronger, and nimble then before. So that, no question, this Punctum doth (as an A∣nimal) Live, Move, and Perceive. Moreover, expose an egge too long to the colder aire, and the Punctum saliens beats slower, and hath a languishing motion; but lay your finger warm upon it, or cherish it kindely any other way, and it presently gaineth strength and vigour. And after this Punctum hath declined by degrees, and being full of blood hath ceased from all motion, exhibit∣ing no specimen of life at all, and was given up for lost, and dead, upon laying of my finger warm up∣on it, for the space of only twenty pulses, the poor heart hath awaked, and recovered again, and as it were rescued from the grave, proceeds to its for∣mer harmony afresh. And this hath been done a∣gain and again by me, and others, by any other reviving heat, were it of the Fire, or warm Water: as if it were in our dispose to condemne the litle Soule to the Shades, or repreive it to life, at plea∣sure. What we have here delivered, doth for the most part come to pass the fourth day from the first In∣cubation, or at the Third Inspection. I say, for the most part; for it falls not out perpetually so, because
there is a great diversity in the maturity of Egges, and some come to perfection sooner then their fel∣lows. As is usually in the fruits of any Tree, whereof some are ripe, and ready to fall of them∣selves: whilest others are crude and greener, and cannot be shaken from the Boughs. So that some Egges are lesse forward the fifth day, then others the third. And (that I may instance in what I have found and tryed) I have found this true in very many egges, whom the Hen hath fostered the same length of time, and I have opened them all the same day. So that I have had no cause to quar∣rel against the weaker Sex, the distemper of the Aire, the neglect of the Henne, or any other Ac∣cident; but onely the innate weaknesse of the Egge; and the penury of the ingenit Heat. Ova Hypenemia, or Addle Egges, do at this time (as in a critical day) begin to alter and discover their genius: For as fruitful Egges, by the innate plastick vertue do alter and resolve into a Colliqua∣mentum (which doth after shift into bloud) so Sub∣ventaneous Eggs, at the same time, begin to cor∣rupt, and putrifie. And yet I have sometimes observed the Macula or Cicatricula to be distended wider even in barren egges; but it never rose up to the top, nor was ever circumscribed by the circles orderly drawn about it. I have also sometimes seen the Yolk grow clear, and liquifie, and the parts congealed, as it were, by rash, inconsiderate coagulation, float up and down like scattered clouds. And though these Egges cannot yet be called corrupt, putrid, and unsavory; yet they are very much prepared towards putrefaction, and do compleatly arrive thither, by the continu∣ation of the warmth of the Sitting-Henne, and set out their progresse towards corruption, from the
very place and stage, whence prolifical Eggs advance to Generation. The Perfecter sort of Egges therefore do now about the declension of the fourth day, acquire a twofold, or bipartite Vesicula pulsans, or vesicle of pulsation, one making answer and replies, to the other by a double pulsation, in that Order and Method, that whilest one is contracted, the other shines and swells with blood; which presently be∣ing contracted, dischargeth it self of the blood that was in it; and in a moments time intervening, the former swells and returns the Pulse, so that you may evidently see, that the action of these ve∣sicles is Contraction; by which the Blood is driven, and pumped into the vessels. The fourth day, (saith Aldrovandus) the two Puncta were discovered, and each of them did move: which two points were without doubt the Heart and pag. 217. the Liver; which Viscera Aristotle saith are seen in the Egges after three days Incubation. But Aristotle never said so, nor are those viscera usually to be seen before the tenth day. And I won∣der Aldrovandus could think one of these Puncta Pulsantia was the Liver: as if the Liver ever had any such motion. It is safer to believe that one of the Puncta salien∣tia (when the Foetus enlargeth) doth constitute the Auriculae or deaf Ears, and the other the Ventriculi, or Ventricles of the Heart. For in grown bodies, the Ventricles of the Heart are after this manner filled, and supplied by the Auriculae, which by their Systole, are depleated and emptied againe: as we have observed in our Tract, de Motu cordis & sanguinis. In better grown egges, sometimes a∣bout the declining of the fourth day, I know not what cloudy substance did obscure these Vesiculae
Pulsantes, and did (like an interposed shade) ob∣struct my Inspection, that I could not so clearly di∣scerne the Puncta salientia. Yet by the help of a clearer light, and with a Perspective, and conferring with my observations for the subsequent days: it appeared to be the Rudiment of the foetus, or a Cloud exhaled from the Colliquamentum, or an Ef∣fluvium congealing about the beginning of the veines: as shall more at large be treated of in the fifth days observation. Aldrovandus also seems to have observed it: The fifth day, (saith he) that Punctum which we cal∣led the Heart, did no longer appear to move out∣wardly, but seemed rather to be covered, and con∣cealed; and the two Meatus Venosi were seen more con∣spicuous, but one larger then the other. But the Learned Aldrovandus is deceived, for this Tutelar deity taketh possession, and locks himself up in most reserved and secret recesses (when the habi∣tation is almost compleatly erected) a long time after. And he likewise mistakes, where he saith, that by the innate vertue of the veins, the remaining portion of the white is turned into a kind of straw-co∣loured substance. For that complexion is in the the thicker white, of all egges that are stale, and is daily increased in them, (namely, according as the Egge groweth Staler, as is said) and that without any assistance of veins, by reason of the thinner substance exhaling. But the Foetus growing bigger, (as we shall de∣clare in its place) and the circles of the branches of the veins being disseminated up and down, part of both the juyces are dissolved, not (as Al∣drovandus would have it) by an innate vertue of the veins, but by the heat of the blood inhabiting there. For into what part soever of the moisturer
the foresaid veins extend their Territories, there presently appears a colliquation or resolution in the bordering parts; and therefore the Yolk at that time seems double, because its superior part (which is joined to the cavity above, about the obtuse angle) being more mollified, and dissolved then the rest of the Yolk, appears like melted Wax, compared to the other cold, compacted part. And upon that score (as all melted things do) it obtaineth a larger roome. And that Upper part, liquefied by the genital warmth is disterminated from the other li∣quors (and especially from the White) by a peculiar most thin coat of its own. Whence it happens, that a breach being made upon this slender, frail, and invisible membrane, there presently follows a con∣fusion and mixture of the Yolk and White, which disturbs the whole frame. And it is many times a cause to frustrate and void Generation (when those liquors become to be of a diverse, nay of a contrary nature) according to that Text in Ari∣stotle, de gen. an. l. 3. c. 2. so often cited. Egges are depraved and made addle most in hot weather, and that upon good rea∣son. For as Wines grow sower in hotter weather, the dregs being subverted (for that is the cause of their depravation) so Egges are destroyed, their Yolk being corrupted: for these are the more terrene and earthy parts in both. So that Wine is disturbed by a com∣mixture of the dregs, and the Egges by diffusion of the Yolk. And hither you may justly reduce that of Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. him too, where he saith, Egges that are under the Henne in tempestuous thunders, are corrupted. For the exceeding smal membrane is by so great a noise quickly torne asunder. And therefore perhaps, confused and putrid Egges, are called Ova Cynosu∣ra, because (as we have observed) it thunders Lib. 8. c. 5. most in the Dog-days. And therefore Columella
rightly admonisheth, that most men deeme the Sum∣mer-Solstice to be inconvenient for hatching of chickens. This is most certain, that Egges suffer quassation, concussion, and dissolution very easily, if any man disturb them while the Hen is Sitting, because at that time the liquors in them are liquefied, and swell, and the membranes embracing them are di∣lated, and grow tender. The fourth Inspection of the Egge. EXERCIT. XVIII. THE fifth day of Incubation, is discerned first (saith Aristotle) the body of the Pullus, being ve∣ry Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. small, and white, wherein the head is conspicum and in it the eyes much turgent, which continue so a long time, for it is long ere they abate, and connive. But in the lower part of the body, there is no part  first extant, correspondent to the upper. But ths Branches which shoot out from the Heart, one tending to the ambient membrane, the other to the Yolk, do supp the office of the Navel. The original of the Chicken therefore from the White, but its nourishment from the Yolk by the Navel. By which words Aristotle seems to distrib the whole Generation of the Pullus into three class or orders, namely from the first day of Incubation to the fifth: and thence, on to the tenth or fourteenth and so on to the twentieth. As if he had o recorded those things in his History, which he  covered at these three Inspections. The great
changes in the Egge do indeed happen at these times: as if by these Decretory days, as by three distinct degrees, the progresse of the perfect Egge, to the utmost exclusion of the Chicken, were di∣stinguished. For the fourth day the first particle of the Foetus, namely the Punctum saliens, and the Blood appear; and after that the Foetus is corporated. The Seventh, the Chicken is distinguished into parts, and beginnes to move. The tenth it beginnes to be down-feathered; about the twentieth, it breathes, and cryes according to its kind, and seeks to make its escape. The Life which it obtains about the fourth day, seems to emulate that of Plants, and is to be esteemed onely a vegitative animation. But from that to the tenth, it enjoyes a sensative and moving soul as Animals do: and after that, it is compleated by degrees, and being adorned with Ples, Bill, Clawes, and other furniture, it hastens to get out, that being at length emancipated, it may be unconfined and free. Aristotle therefore enumerates amongst those things which befall after the fourth day, chiefly three; that is to say, the fabrick of the body, the branchings of the veines, which now supply the Nature and Office of the Navel: and the matter or substance whence the Foetus doth first spring, and is constituted, and nourished. Concerning the Fabrick of the Body, he relates four things, first, what magnitude it is of; second∣ly, what complexion; thirdly, what parts are most conspicuous, (namely the Head, and Eyes) and last∣ly, what distinction or difference there is between the Parts. Truth is, the Body is exceeding small, resembling in form that common worm or Mag∣got, out of which the Flie is bred; it is also white of colour, like that little Worm, which the
Flie depositeth in putrified flesh. to be cherished, and bred up; and he elegantly addes, that it is most notorious from its Head and Eyes. For that which first appears, is a similar and indistinct Body, as if it were some concrete and congealed substance of the colliquamentum it self (like that Gelly which is made of the decoction of Harts-horn) being like a transparent cloud, which were hardly distinguish∣able, were it not divided as it were into two parts; whereof the one lies in a heap together; and is much larger then the other, being the Rudimens of the Head; which is first discerned on the fifth day: in which the Eyes are anon manifestly distin∣guished; which at first are the biggest of all, much puffed up, and prominent, and are discriminated both from the rest of the Head, and the whole Body besides, by a certain blackness cast round about them. Any one of these, is larger then the whole Head; as also, the Head alone exceeds all there of the Body in magnitude. This Whiteness of the Body, endureth a while, as also, the tumor of the Eyes: (which are filled also with a most clear moisture or water within, but are dark and black∣ish without, as it is also with the Brain) that is to say, to the tenth day, and more: for (saith A∣ristotle) It is late ere they diminish, and contract to their allotted proportion. Nay, according to my observation, the Eyes of Birds do never reduce themselves to the Proportion, which is allotted as the standard between the Eyes, and the Head of a Viviparous Animal. For if you lay aside the Skin, which covereth the Eyes of a Henne, or any other Bird, either of them alone will soon countervail the whole bulk of the Braine: In a Woodcock and the like, any one of the Eyes is bigger then all the Head besides, (bateing onely the Bill) but it is
common to all Birds whatsoever to have the Orbita, or cavity which containes the Eyes to exceed the Braine it selfe, as you may see in their cranium, or Scull. But yet it falls out that their Eyes seem les∣ser, because they are all (except the Sight or Ap∣ple onely) shrouded with Skin and Plumes; nor are they of an Orbicular Figure (which might oc∣casion their prominence or standing out) but of a Depressed, as Fishes eyes are. In the lower part of the Body (saith Aristotle) there is no part extant at first, which is correspondent to the Superior: And so indeed it is: The Body at first were scarce discernable, were it not for the Eyes and the Head; so that downwards, it is not di∣stinguished by any members at all, whether Wings, Feet, Breast-bone, Rump, or any Viscus: nor in∣deed is it graced with any Shape of a Body: but as far as I could discover, it is onely a Litle Sub∣stance, next adjacent to the small veine, like the carina or keele of an imaginable small Ship wound up together, and like a Maggot or Worme, with∣out any platform of Ribbes, Legs, or Wings: to which is fastned a litle round body, which is the rudiment of the Head, which is more discernable thn it, and divided into three Bubbles, (on which fid: soever you make your Inspection:) But it is indeed divided into four, whereof two are largest, and blackish, being the rudiments of the Eyes; the third of the Braine; and the fourth of the cerebellum, or After-Braine. All these are full of exceeding clear Water, but in the middle of the Blackness of the eyes, is the Apple or Ball of the Eye (as in the Center) shining like a transparent Spark or Crystal. Hence I suppose, the Tres Bullae, the three Bubbles which are onely conspicuous, have imposed upon those, who have not througly observed the thing.
For having learnt, according to the old doctrine of the Schooles, that there were three Principalities in the Animal Body, and three Principal Parts; (namely, the Braine, the Heart, and the Liver) executing the chief Functions: They soon indu∣ced themselves to believe, that these Three Bullae were the platformes, and ground-works of these three parts. But Coiterus, as becomes a skilful A∣natomist, affirms much truer, that he saw, on the Seventh day after Incubation, the Bill, and the Eyes, but could discover none of the Visce∣ra. But to Aristotle againe. Those Branches, which proceed from the Heart, one of them tendeth to the circumambient membrane, the other to the Yolk, sup∣plying the office of a Navel. The Foetus being now bodied, those veines do execute the office of a Na∣vel: and one of their branches, or propagations is disseminated into the outward coat, which em∣braceth the White; but the sprouts of the other go directly to the coat of the Yolk, and are dissemina∣ted through its juyce or liquor. By which it is plaine and evident, that both the Liquors are dedi∣cated to the nourishment of the Foetus. And though Aristotle say, that the Original of the chicken is from the White, and its nourishment from the Yolk by the Navel: Yet he doth not say that the chicken is made of the White; for the Foetus is made of that white Liquor which we call the colliquamentum: and all that which we call Oculum Ovi, the Eye of the Egge, is contained in the White. Nor doth he say that the sustenance of the Chicken is onely from the Yolk by the Navel: but I shall interpret his words (according to my one Observations) thus: Though the Pullus assume its original in the White, yet it is not fed by the White onely, but by the Yolk
also (to which one of the Sprigs of the Umbilical veines doth extend) nay chiefly by the Yolk; for the White (according to Aristotle) is the more con∣cocted, and purer liquor of the egge, but the Yolk the more terrene, and solid, and therefore more congruous to the Chicken, when he is growne stronger: and therefore (as shall be said hereaf∣ter) it supplies the place of Milk, and is that which is last consumed; for the remainder of it (after the Chichen is hatched, and walkes a∣broad with the Henne) it yet contained in its Belly. What I have hitherto spoken, cometh to passe, from the fourth day to the seventh. But When, How, and in what Order, all the Particulars are framed, I shall now explaine. The Next Appearance, which presents it selfe the fifth day, about the short veine drawn from the Angle (where the two points leaping in course are seated) there appears a grosser, and whiter substance, like a little cloud, (which yet is transparent) through which the foresaid veine doth obscurely, and as through a cloud, cast a glimpse of it self. I have seen the same sometimes, in well grown eggs, upon the fourth day. But this is the Rudiment of the Body, which now every hour groweth more close, and compact, and doth encompasse the foresaid veine, and also is annexed to it, like a litle globous body. That globous Rudiment doth much exceed the Keele (as I may call it) of this little Worm, in magnitude: and it is of a trian∣gular figure, that is to say, (like the small sprout of a knotted shrubbe) obscurely divided into three pieces: Whereof one is Orbicular, and larger then the other two, and looks black, by reason of some most slender fibres, which are drawn from
the Circumference towards the Center: resembling the platform of the Septum Ciliare, and therefore it implyes, that this particle is transformed into the Eye. In the midsts of this, is a very little Pupilla or Eye-Ball, appearing like a most bright point: (as we have said) and upon that ground I raised my conjecture, that this entire litle round body, was designed for the Rudiment of the Head: and that that black circle was to be one of the Eyes, to which the other standeth opposite on the other side: for they are so seated, that you cannot dis∣cerne them both at once, because the uppermost covereth and hideth the lower. This first Rudiment of the Body, which we af∣firm to grow about the veine, (hath obtained an oblong, and something an embowed figure, (like the Keel of a Ship; it is of a mucous consistence, like the film or hoariness which is contracted by moist things, when they are pent up in a close place. But the small veine to which this hoary substance doth ac∣crew, is the descending Vena Cava, passing along the Spine of the Back: as my subsequent observa∣tions have cleared. If you diligently mind the order of the pulsation of the two vesicles, you shall discerne the blood driven by the Systole of that which was last contracted into the beginning of this veine, and this vein distended by it. So that there are two manifest Contractions and Dilatations of the two vesicles which cause a motion and pulse in one another: and the preceding Con∣traction of the one, creates the Distention of the other: for the blood being darted into the second vesicle, by the Contraction of the cavity of the first, causeth an impletion, distention, and pulsation in it: which by and by contracting it self, disgorgeth the blood (which it now received from the former
vesicle) into the beginning of the foresaid veine, and so dilateth that. I call it yet a vein, though by its pulse I conceive it to be the Artery, called A∣orta; for the Arteries are not yet distinguished from the veines by the thickness of their coats. Having often observed these things with much caution and circumspection in several eggs, I stood a while in suspense, what opinion I should enter∣tain of them. As, whether I should conclude this concrete, and annexed globous body were made of the Colliquamentum, (in which it swam) as out of a compacted and coagulated substance; as Clouds are formed out of vapours in the upper Region of the Air (which vapors were never discovered to ascend:) Or else out of some Effluvium or exha∣lation of blood transpiring, or some Transudation, weeping by a kinde of diapedesis, from the vein. For the first Rudiments even of the greatest things, are exceeding small, and so very obscure, because very litle. This, I presume, I am assured of, viz. that the Pun∣cta salientia, the Branchings of the veins, & the Vena cava it self are first existent, & that afterwards this corpulency or bulke is joyned to them. And I am also most certain, that the Blood is driven into this Vein out of the Punctum saliens, and that by this Vein that litle bulke or body is fed. For that first hoariness or Mucus is first of all made by an Ef∣fluvium of the Vein, (to which it grows) and from it afterward draweth its nourishment and en∣crease: As filme and hoariness doth in other moist places grow between the chincks of walls, which lie long unswept; as Camphyre upon Cedar-planks, and Moss upon Stones, and Barks of Trees; or last∣ly, as a kinde of downe is bred upon some kinde of Wormes.
I did also doubt at the same time, whether this Rudiment of the Head and Body had its existence so soon, as the coagulation of the Colliquamentum, together with the Blood, and Punctum saliens had theirs, but was then imperciptible by reason of its thinness, and clearness of substance; till congeal∣ing into a grosser film, it put on a more solid, com∣pacted whiteness, by which it might be discerned: while yet the Blood which is thicker and shining might be well perceived in the Colliquamentum which is so diaphanous. But whilest I consider the matter more narrowly, I am fully satisfied, that the Blood hath a being, before any other part of the body besides, and is the elder brother to all other parts of the foetus; and that from it, both the mat∣ter out of which the foetus is constituted, as also the aliment by which it is supplied, is desumed, and is (if any thing be) the first genital particle. But how I am induced to this perswasion, shall be after∣wards copiously recited, when we discourse con∣cerning the primitive fructifying Part, the Innate Heat, and Radical Moisture; and when also wee shall resolve what is to be thought concerning the soule, out of many Observations conferred to∣gether. About this time, almost every hour, all things appear larger and clearer, and more distinct, and unfolded; and now there comes a nimble Altera∣tion in the Egge, and many things appear one up∣on the neck of another. The Cavity of the Egge is now much larger, and layeth the upper part of it all void and empty, as if a fifth part of the Egge were vanished. The litle branches of the Veins are farther spread out, and grow more numerous in their distributi∣ons, not onely into the Colliquamentum, (as be∣fore)
but up and down both into Yolke and White, & both those liquors are chequered over with fibers. The upper part of the Yolke is much dissolved and melted, as if it were a distinct thing from the infe∣riour, and that the yolke were now become two; the superiour shining like melted wax, swelled, and bright; and the inferiour and earthier, together with the duller part of the White, being depressed to the acute angle. And the proper coat of the su∣periour part of the yolke is now so thinne, that the least concussion breaks it; upon which ensues a con∣fusion of liquors, and an utter frustration of gene∣ration. And now is the first Rudiment of the Foetus to be clearly seen (as you may perceive it in Fabricius his fifth and sixth Tables;) which being put into a bason of clear water, will plainly discover, what parts of the body are already framed, and what are yet wanting and behinde. For there appears the form of a small Worm or Magot, as we see the rudiments of Wormes and Flies in the boughs of Trees, in the knots of the Bark, in Fruits, Flowers, and other things; but especially in Oak apples, in whose center, within a small round Shell or Kernel, is contained a clear liquor, which thickning and coagulating by degrees, is interlaced with most slender fibres, and represents the shape of a Magot, but continues a while immoveable, till at length endued with sense and motion, it becomes an ani∣mal, and departs a Flie. Aristotle describes a Generation like this, in Hist. an. l. 5. c. 19 those things that are called Sponte nascentia. Some creatures are born of the Dew, which falls upon the Leaves. And a while after he saies: Butterflies are made of Worms, but these Worms of green Leaves; and especially of the Leaves of that sort of Raphanus,
which some call Brassica. They are first smaller then Millet, and afterward very litle worms; then encrea∣sing, within three dayes they become litle Magots; and after this being more grown, they cease to move, and changing their form, are called Crystallides, being contained in a hard crust; and if you touch them, they stirre: a great while after the crust or shell is broken, and so they being become winged creatures, take their flight, and are called Butterflies. But we shall prove anon, that the Generation of all creatures is alike, and that all creatures, even perfect ones, are begotten of a Worm; which Aristotle also seemeth to have noted, where he saith: In all Creatures, even those which produce a perfect egge, the de gen. an. l. 3. c. 9. first conception groweth before it be distinguished: such is also the nature of the Worm. Now this difference there is between the generation of the Worm, and o∣ther Creatures; that the Worm growes before hee have his shape, or distinction into parts: according to that of the Philosopher, An animal is made out of a Worm, not as if it were made out of a part of it, as out of its Egge; but in that the whole Worm grows, and so becomes a dearticulate animal; namely, in grow∣ing it becomes to be jointed or distinguished. We have indeed cause to wonder, that the Ru∣diments De hist. an. l. 5. c. 9. of all Creatures whatsoever, especially of Creatures that have blood, (viz. of a Dog, a Horse, a Deere, an Oxe, a Henne, a Viper, nay of Man him∣selfe) should so exactly resemble the shape and consistence of a Magot, that you can perceive no difference at all. Towards the end of the Fifth day, or the begin∣ning of the Sixth, the Head is distinguished into three vesicles or litle bladders; whereof the first; and greatest, which is round, and blackish, is that of the Eye: in whose center the Pupilla is discove∣red
like a crystalline Point. Under this a lesser vesi∣cle, whereof part is hidden, represents the Brain;  which the third, like a crest adjoyned, or a smal nd knobb, appears uppermost; of which at last he Cerebellum or After-brain is made: yet in all ese you shall finde nothing, besides a cleare wa∣ter. And now the Rudiment of the Body, (which we all the Keel) doth more distinctly represent the pina dorsi, or Chine of the Back: to which, sides begin to be built and appear; for the Wings and legs do now jut out from the Magot. And the ves∣sels do now plainly express the Navel. The fifth Inspection of the Egge. EXER. XIX. THe sixth day the three Bullae of the Head doe more plainly appear, and the coats of the eyes are now distinct: also the Legs and Wings do bud forth; as at the end of June, the Gyrini (which the Italians call Ravabottoli, and we Tadpoles) be∣gin to have leggs, when now they forsake the wa∣ers, loose their tayl, and put on the shape of Frogs. The form of the Chickens Rump is yet no o∣ther, then that which is seen in all other animals, may in very vipers, namely a round slender tail. The Parenchyma of the heart now groweth to the vesicula pulsans; and a litle after the Rudiments of the Liver, and Lungs are discovered, and also the Bill, all appearing exceeding white, especially the Bill. And about this time all the Viscera and the
Guts may be seen. But the heart exposeth it  first to sight, and the Lungs before the Liver or the brain. But before all are the eyes visible, because o their largeness and blackness of their colour. And now the foetus moves, and gently tumbles, and stretcheth out the neck, though nothing of a brain be yet to be seen, but meerly a bright water shut up in a small bladder. And now it is a perfect Magot, differing onely from those kinde of worm in this, that those when they have their freedome, crawle up and down, and search for their living abroad: but this worm constant to his station, and swimming in his own provision, draws it in by his Umbilical Vessels. The Viscera and the Guts being now erected, and the foetus being furnished with motion too; yet the fore-part of the Body still lyes wide open, being deprived of the Thorax, and Abdomen; and the Heart it selfe, the Liver, and the Guts hang∣ing out. About the end of this day, and the beginning of the seventh, the claws are distinguished; and the foetus begins to have the Effigies of a Chicken, it o∣pens the bill, and kicks: lastly, all the parts are delineated, especially the Eyes. But the Viscera or bowels are yet so obscure, that Coiterus truly affirme. That he saw indeed the Eyes and the Bill, but could discover no Viscus at all, though never so conceal∣ed or confused. That which followeth from the beginning of the sixth day to the end of the seventh, cometh  pass sooner in some, and in some eggs later. No are the coats of the Eyes seen, though they have nothing in them but a liquid clear humor: the Ey themselves are something prominent, or hanging out of their seats, and each of them doth no le
exceed the brain in magnitude, then the head, the rest of the body that is fastned to it. A litle bubble, like a crest, placed out of the cir∣cuit of the brain, supplied the place of the cerebel∣lum, and that is also full of a clear water. The brain seemeth obscurely divided, and shines not so much as the cerebellum doth, though it look whiter. And as the Heart is now to be seen without the inclosure of the chest, so is the cerebel∣lum, out of the Confines of the cerebrum. In cutting off the Head, I saw (by the benefit of y Perspective) in the Necke, a bloody speck of e veine which ascends to the braine. And by his means onely could I distinguish the rudiment of the Spine, from the other Pulpe, it was of a milkey complexion, but firmer consistence then milk. And so also like slender cobwebs, narrow white lines, wan∣ing through the pulp of the body, to give some imen of the Ribbs, and other bones; and this is much more discernable in the formation of other Viviparous Animals. The Heart, the Lungs, the Li∣ver, and, instead of Guts, the most slender threds, re all white. The Parenchyma of the Liver ows to the Umbilical vein, there where it enters o the Liver, upon thin fibrous strings: in like manner as the Rudiment of the Body grows to the  passing from the Heart, or to the Vesicula pul∣s. For as Grapes grow to the cluster, buds to eir stalks, and the eares of corn to the straw: So th the Liver to the Umbilical vessels, like mush∣ out of Trees, or proud flesh in Ulcers, or fleshy rs which border upon the branches of the Ar∣es, by which they are fed, and spread sometimes   vast tumor. Having had an Eye upon this emploiment of Arteries, or circulation of the blood, I have some∣times
perfectly cured exceeding great Herniae car∣nosae, beyond all expectation; providing onely, that the litle artery being tyed or cut off, no nu∣triment or spirit might have accession to the part affected; by which it fell out, that the fatal tumor was afterwards easily extirpated either by incision, or adustion. A certain man, besides other infirmities, (and of this story I can produce many testimonies) had a Sarcosis or fleshy tumor in his Scrotum or God, big∣ger then a mans head, hanging down to his Knees; and from it, another Hernia carnosa, as thick as ones wrist (or a cable) passed into his Abdomen, so that the disease growing to so great a height, no man would undertake the Cure, by incision, or o∣therwise. Yet I perfectly cured this so vast excre∣scence, which so much distended the Scrotum, and encompassed the Testicle, by the means aforesaid; and yet left the leading and preparing vessel to the use of the Testicle, without any prejudice or touch upon the other vessels descending into the S∣tum, by the Tunica vaginalis, or coat of the Testi∣cles so called. But these and other Cures, accom∣plished clean beside the common opinion, I shall in my Physical Observations (if God grant me life) discover at large. I mention these things with this intent, that men may plainly see, that the Liver grows to the vessels, and is generated some time after the Blood is born, and that its parenchyma is produced by the Arteries, (which administer matter to frame  and also that for a while it continues white, and without blood; which is likewise common to o∣ther parts of the body. For after the same man and order, as we have declared the production  the Chicken to be out of the Egge, doth the
ration of Man, and all other Animals proceed. By which it appears, how incongruous their per∣swasion is, (though it hath obtained both of old, and now too) who decree the Liver to be both the  where the Blood is wrought, and the Author of it; and do upon that account, rank it amongst the hiefe and first-born parts of the Body: who also give so much renown to this Viscus, that they pro∣claim it to spring with the Heart, from the first beginning, out of the semen of the mother; and do rigorously maintain the Fable de tribus Capellis, or the three imaginary Bubbles. In which Quire, Pa∣risanus of late, with a loud, but unmannageable voice, hath sung his part of the Catch. These honest men never took notice, that the Vesicles move, the Heart pants, & the Blood is now perfectly concocted, before any track or founda∣tion of the Liver appears. Without all question the Blood is to be counted the Author of the Liver, ither then the Liver the Author of the Blood. For the Liver is made after the Blood, and of it, cleaving the Veins that contain the Blood. Nor yet can I subscribe to the Aristotelians, which repute the Heart to be the Author of the id. For its substance also, or Parenchyma is born  the Blood, and is then superadded to the Ve∣la Pulsantes. But I am much in doubt whether Vesicula, or Punctum saliens or the Blood, that is to y, whether the contained liquor, or the containing ssels be the elder. Now it seems in reason, that  container is made for the contained; and there∣fore after it. This indeed our cies can truly witnese,  the Veines are the first woof, and the first visi∣ foundation of the body, and that all the other  are superadden to them, and born after . But of this matter hereafter more at large.
In the Interim we cannot chuse but smile at that fond and fictitious Division of the Parts, into Spermatical, and Sanguineous; as if any part were immediately framed of the Semen, and were not all of one extract and original. But I return to our purpose. The extent of the Colliquamentum doth not reach over more then half the Egge. The Heart hanging out, stands something off from the body. And if you makes diligent inspection, you may discover some of the Umbilical Vessels beat. The sixth Inspection of the Egge. EXER. XX. ON the seventh day all things are clearer, and the primordia of each particular part are now visible; namely, the Wings, Leggs, Genitals, the di∣vided Claws of the feet, the Thighs, the Sidesien, &c. Now the Foetus bestirrs it self, and kicks, and the Chicken is found complete, there being no ad∣dition to be expected after but only the growth o the parts yet tender: which the more they en∣crease, the more the White decaies; and the out ward membranes uniting, supply the place of the Secundina, or after-birth; as also the Veines do e∣very day more and more represent the Navel. Therefore I conceive it convenient to pass from the Seventh, to the Tenth day, because nothing worth observation doth intervene in the mo time, though Authors usually, especially Aristotle do not do so.
Notwithstanding all this, if you observe ma∣ny Egges at a time, you shall finde some that are forward, and better grown, have all the parts apparent in them; other Truants will present them Iess distinct. Though on the other side, many things concurre to the work, as the Season of the year, the warmth of the Nest, Outward che∣rishings, Deligent Incubation, and the like. I re∣member I have sometimes seen in a sluggish Egge, the cavity indeed dilated on the seventh day, and the Colliquamentum sprinkled ore with veines, also a Magot in the midst of it, together with the rudi∣ments of the Eyes, and other things which come to pass in other Egges, about the fourth or fifth day; yet there were no vesiculae pulsantes at all: nor could I finde the Trunke or root out of which the Veines rise. And therefore I justly counted it a seeble backward Egge, endowed but with a sickly generative power, and now upon the point to die. And that chiefly, because its Colliquamentum was more cleare and refulgent then usual, and the veines did also shine a litle. For when the Vital spirit departs, that part first declines and corrupts, which is first in order of Generation. The Inspection after the tenth day. EXER. XXI. WHatever is visible the tenth day, is delivered so accurately by Aristotle, that litle or no∣thing remaines to be added. And this opinion, ac∣cording to my Paraphrase, is thus: The tenth day
all the Chicken is visible; and all pellucid, and white, save only the Eyes and divarications of the Veines. And the Head is bigger then all the rest of the body besides; and the Eyes stick fast in the Head, or ra∣ther stick to the Head as Appendixes, being yet un∣furnished of a Pupilla or Eye-ball; (that is, having none yet perfectly formed; and yet it is no hard matter to discover the distinct coats or membranes) for if then you pluck them out, you shall finde them blacke, and bigger then Beanes: from which if you take off the skin, there flows a white, cold humour, very refulgent if you hold it in the light, and beside that humor, there is nothing (namely in the whole entire Head) contained at all. And this is the state of these parts, from the seventh day, to the tenth. At the same time (saith Aristotle) the Viscera or Intrals also appear, and all the appurtenances belong∣ing to the Belly and Guts; namely, the Parenchyma of the Heart, Lungs, and Liver, &c. but all are white, mucilaginous, and washy, and have no firm consi∣stence in them. And the Veines also that proceed from the Heart, are applied to the Navel. And from the Navel one Vein passeth to the membrane contain∣ing the yolke; which is then more liquid and dissolved, then his natural constitution uses to be. But the other, to the other membrane, which containeth the whole membrane (namely the coat of the Colliquamentum) which encompasseth the Foetus, and the Yolke, and the interjacent humour. For while the Chicken grows by degrees, part of the yolk is above, and part below; but the White being in the midst, is liquid. And the white is also under that lower part of the yolke, as it was under it before. So farre Aristotle. And now you may plainly see the Veines ac∣company the Arteries; as well those which  to the Whites, as those which pass to the yolk. The
yolke also now dissolves, and yet not all of it, but that which lyes uppermost: nor do the spriggs of the Veines run through the whole yolk, but through that part onely which we have said to be like mel∣ted wax. So also the Veines which tend to the White, have some Arteries for their companions. And the greater part of the White it selfe, is dis∣solved also into that white moisture (called the Colliquamentum) which surrounds the Chicken swimming in the midst of it, and lieth between the two divisions of the yolke; namely, the Upper, and the Lower: under which (in the acute angle of the Egge) the grosser and more viscous part of the White remaineth. The Upper part of the yolke appeares now more liquid and resolved, then the Inferiour doth; for wheresoever the fibers of the Veines disseminate themselves, the parts grow pre∣sently tumid, and softer. But Aristotle adds, saying, the White at the tenth day sinketh down, being now grown less, viscous, thicker, and yellowish; namely that part of it which is not transformed into the Colliquamentum. Now the greatest part of the White is resolved into the Colliquamentum, and the Foetus; that is, all the thinner part of the Albumen, and the greater part also of the thicker. But the Yolk appears now larger, then it was at first. By which it is evident, that the Yolk doth not yet serve for nutrition, but is afterwards de∣signed for that office. And as farre as I could con∣jecture, by the disseminations and distributions of the Veines, the Foetus is at first nourished by the Colliquamentum; for the Veines are first distributed into it alone, and thence into the membrane of the thinner White; and after that, into the grosser White, and Yolk: so that even the grosser White
becomes the nutriment, before the Yolk. For the most tender Foetus, whilest it is yet a small Magot, is fed with the thinnest diet of best concoction; that is, the Colliquamentum, and the thinner White. But when it grows more hearty, it is received with en∣tertainment proper for its age and strength. In the next words, Aristotle describes the scitu∣ation of the particulars contained in the egge. At the upper and lower end of the egge, doth the mem∣brane of the egge reside, not the membrane which be∣longeth to the shell, but under it: and in that mem∣brane is contained the white liquor: (namely the Colliquamentum) then the Chicken, and the mem∣brane containing it, which provides such a separation, that the Foetus it selfe doth not wallow in the liquor. Where I suspect a fault in the Text. For the thing it self speaks, that it should be rather thus. Then the Chicken encompassed in a Membrane, is seated, or swims in that white liquor; which Mem∣brane is not that exterior one, which immediately lineth the shell, but another Membrane, lying un∣der that: which when the exterior White is spent, and the remaining thicker White is depressed into the Acute Angle, of two Membranes (namely, that of the thinner White, and that which is proper to the Colliquamentum) is made one coat, which be∣gins to appeare like the Secundine, called Chorion. Yet Aristotle saies well, In that Membrane is contai∣ned the white liquor: for by that he doth not un∣derstand the Albumen, but the Colliquamentum made of that Albumen, in which the Foetus swims; for the remainder of the Albumen is now sunk down into the Acute Angle.
The Inspection after the four∣teenth day. EXERCIT. XXII. From the seventh to the fourteenth day, all parts are enlarged (as hath been said) and more visible. The Heart and all the other Intrals are now concealed in the several Venters or Bellies of the Chicken: and those that before were expo∣sed, and naked, cannot now be seen, but by o∣pening the breast, and lower belly. Now is the Chicken cloathed in Plumes, whose roots appear, like black points. The Apple of the Eye is now distinct, and the Eye-lids are plaine to be seen: likewise the Membrana Nictatoria, or membrane moving the Eye-lid, is visible in the greater Canthus or corner of the Eye, which is a membrane peculiar to all birds, by which they cleanse their Eyes. Also now the Gyri or Involutions of the braine are distin∣guished, and the After-braine is covered by the Scull: and the Taile hath attained the form of a Rump. After the fourteenth day, the Intrals (which were white before) put on by degrees a ruddy flesh-colour. The Heart now entered into the cavernes of the Chest, and being guarded by the Sternum, or Brest∣bone, enjoyes the habitation which himselfe hath erected. The Braine and After-braine grow firm and solid in the Arch of the Cranium or Scull. But the Guts and Gisard, are not concluded in the Ab∣domen, but hang out, being continued and fastned to the rest of the Intrals.
One of the two Vessels which are derived to the Navel from the Belly neer the Fundament, is an Ar∣tery (as the Pulse discovers) springing from the Great Artery: the other is a Veine, conveighed from the Yolk by the Guts into the Vena Porta, or Gate∣vein, at the concavous part of the Liver: for the other Trunck of the Umbilical vessels having recei∣ved its branches from the White, passeth by the convex part of the Liver, and is inserted into the Vena Cava, or Hollow veine, neer the basis of the Heart. As these parts grow daily more conspicuous, so the greater portion of the White is daily consum∣ed; but it is not so with the Yolk, which is hither∣to almost entire, and of the same bulk it was the first day. In the subsequent dayes, you may see the five Umbilical vessels, whereof one is a very large veine, arising from the Hollow veine above the Liver, and scattering branches into the White: the other two veines derived from the Gate-veine (having both the same original) are disseminated into the two parts of the Yolk; (which we have before descri∣bed) and have two small Arteries which arise from the Arteries of the loins, accompanying them. The Chicken doth now possesse a greater roome in the egge, then all the other things contained in it: and beginnes to be down-feathered; and the larger the Chicken growes, the more the White di∣minisheth. And it is worth the observation, that the membrane of the Colliquamentum, which were have said is joyned with the outward coate, and with it doth constitute the Secundine, or Chorion) doth now likewise containe all the Yolk, and be∣ing grown more contract, doth convey the Yolk
together with the Guts to the Foetus, and fasten them to it, and shut them up like a purse, where the strings are drawn together. And though it was subtile, and transparent before, yet now as it growes more contract, so it thickens, and becomes more fleshy: and at length, like a Hernia intestina∣lis in the scrotum or Cods dilated, it covereth the Guts together with the Yolk, and sustaineth them all: till at last growing narrower by continuall contraction, it constitutes the Abdomen of the Chicken. You may finde the Yolk thus disposed between the Guts, the belly hanging looser about the 1st day: and yet not so fast rooted, but that the Guts (as it happeneth in the Hernia intestinalis) easily driven either backward into the belly, or downward into the Scrotum, may be moved up and down together with the Yolk. I have seen the Yolk in this manner fall from the belly of a Pigeon, which in the summer time, had too hasti∣ly broke loose from the shell. About this time the Chicken hath a huge belly, as if it laboured of a Hernia. And now the Col∣liquamentum by degrees growes troubled and thicke, being altered, and diminished, (which was before in very great quantity) and the Chick∣en lies brooding upon the Yolk. And in those days, before the Liver attains a bloody complexion, or executes the of office the second concoction (as they say) the Gall (which is separated by the virtue of the Liver, and is an excrement of that second con∣coction, as is commonly thought) is now to be seen, of a green colour between the Lobes of the Liver. In the Cavity of the Stomack there is a clear Liquor, having the very same consistence, colour and tast, with the Colliquamentum, in which the Foetus swam; which gliding down the Guts changeth its colour
by degrees, and is converted into Chyle; and at last just such an excrement is discovered in the lower end of the Guts, as that which the Chickens eject after they are hatched. When the Chickens are more grown, you shall see the liquor concocted and coagulated in their Stomack: as in Infants that feed on Milk, there is a thick substance, which turnes into Whey and Curds. And now the White being almost spent, and a small quantity of the Colliquamentum remaining, the Chicken for some days before exclusion, doth no longer swim, (but as we have said) lies broo∣ding upon the Yolk; and rouling himselfe up in a heap, his Head for the most part being nusled between his right Legge and Wing, he is compleat∣ly accoutered with Bill, Clawes, Plumes, and other furniture. He sometimes wakes, and sometimes sleepes, and stirring himself, respires and cryes. If you lay the Egge, to your Eare, you shall plainly hear the chicken busling, kicking out his Legs, and according to Aristotle, he will stare upon you, and in his manner cry and complaine. If you let it fall gently into warme water, it will swimme, and the chicken within it, being roused by the am∣bient heat, will bound and leap, and the egge (as is said) will tumble up and down. And this is the experiment which women make to prove the fruitful from the barren eggs, for the latter sink in the water. When the White is now clean consu∣med, a litle before exclusion, that other Navel (which as we said is derived to the White) is ob∣literated & expunged, or as Aristotle saith, that Na∣vel which is extended to the exteriour Secundine, is loosened from the Animal, and falls off. But that which is conveyed to the Yolk, is knit to the small gut of the chicken.
The first Excrements that are found in the chick∣en, Hist. an. l. 6 c. 3. are white and muddy, like the egge-shell softned and dissolved. And such also are to be found out of the Foetus wrapt up in the Secundine. To which Aristotle consents, saying, At that time the Chick∣en discharges much excrement to the outward mem∣brane. And a white excrement is discoverable, not onely within, but without the belly. But in processe of time, when the exclusion of the Foetus approa∣thes neerer, the excrement growes greenish, like that which the chicken ejects after exclusion. And you may also perceive in his craw, a part of the Colliquamentum swallowed down, and in his Gi∣sord a schiston, or coagulated substance. Nor is the complexion of the Liver hitherto ei∣ther purple, or sanguine, but declining from white to yellow, as the Livers of Fishes, yet the Lungs are sanguine. The Yolk is now concluded in the Abdomen be∣tween the Guts: and that not onely while the chicken remaines in the egge, but also when he is excluded, when he walkes abroad with his Mother to seek his provision. By which it appears true, which Aristotle so often repeats: That the yolk is intended for the Aliment of the Chicken: for the yolk being shut up within him, the Chicken for the first dayes after exclusion (till his Bill is confir∣med and strong enough to divide and prepare his meat, and his Stomack enabled to digest it) feeds upon it: so that it carrieth some analogy and pro∣portion to milk. Aristotle casts in his suffrage with us, in the place so often recited. Much of the yolk Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. doth now lye under the Chicken: which yolk at last de∣creases, and in processe of time, is all turned into the chicken it selfe, in whose bowels it is contained: so that ten days after the chicken is excluded, if he be
dissected, you shall finde even then some small remain∣der of the yolk adhering to his Intestines. Nay I have found some Reliques of the yolk after the thir∣tieth day. And, if the argument be of force from the production of the Umbilical veines (which we have shewed to be terminated in the Vena Porta of the Liver, by one or two Trunks) the Chicken is now nourished by Aliment attracted by the Umbili∣cal vessels from the yolk: in the same manner as he afterward is sustained by the chyle drawn out of the Intestines by the Meseraike veins. For the vessels on both sides are terminated at the Gate of the Liver, whither they do alike convey the nou∣rishment they draw; that we may not flie to the Vene Lacteae in the Mesentery (which in feathered Creatures are no where to be found) Give me leave to adde something here, which I have tried often; That I might the better discern the scituation of the Foetus, and the Liquors after the fourteenth day, to the very exclusion: (the greate part of the White being now exhausted, and the yolk divided) I have boiled an egge till it grew hard, and then pilling away the shell, and seeing the Scituation of the Chicken, I found both the remaining part of the White, and the two parts of the yolk (which as we have said before, are divi∣ded by colliquation caused by the gentle warmth) of the same consistence, colour, tast, and other ac∣cidents, as any other stale egge, thus ordered, i And upon this Experiment, I did much pondar whence it should come to passe, that Improlifical Eggs should, from the adventitious heat of a Sitting Henne, putrifie, and stink; and yet no such in convenience befall the Prolifical: But both their Liquors (though there be a Chicken in them to, and he also with some Pollution and Excrement)
should be sound, wholesome, and incorrupt; so that if you eat them in the dark after they are boyled, you cannot distinguish them from egges that are so prepared, which have never under∣gon the Hens incubation. Of the Exclusion, or Birth of the Chick∣en out of the Egge. EXERCIT. XXIII. THe Egge is (as we have said) a kind of an ex∣posed Womb, and placed where the Foetus i formed: for it executes the office of the Matrix, and shelters the Chicken till its just time of Birth: who when he is perfect, is born from thence. O∣viparous creatures are therefore not distinguished from Viviparous, in this, that these bring forth their Foetus live, but they do not; (for the Chick∣en in the Egge doth not onely live and move, but doth breath also, and exercise a voice, and being born, enjoyes a perfecter life, then the issues of other Animals) but their maine difference con∣s in the manner of Generation; namely, in that Viviparous creatures continue their Womb within them, in which the Foetus is fashioned, cherished, and compleated: but Oviparous expose their Egge or Matrix without: yet neverthelesse they do ri∣pen and cherish it as much by Incubation, as if they did reserve it within their bowels. For though the Mother do sometimes upon sun∣dry occasions desers the Egges, yet her affection
continues still with them, and making speedy re∣turns, she receives them in her tender bosom, for stereth, and diligently defends them. But when the Chicken now covets the freer aire, the Shell being parted, he entereth into the world, and this about the one and twentieth, or two and twentieth day. The Common mistake of Fabricius, and almost all others, concerning this Exclusion or Nativity of the Chicken, must not be passed by. Read Fabricius himself: The Chicken (saith he) doth want the free aire before it wants meat, because there is yet some ali∣ment pag. 55. residing within it: in which condition the Chic∣ken being unable to break the shell, in regard the shell is hard, and his hill soft, and also by reason of the di∣stance between them, his bill being sheltered under his wing he gives his mother a signe, by which he signif the necessity he stands in to have it broke up, and this sne he uttereth by his cry. For the Chicken is at that time solusty, and the cavity so enlarged, and so great a quantity of air contained within it, that his resto∣rations being large, can send forth an exsufflation, and cry proper to his kinde, and probably such a one as doth express his request; which also the standers by may easily heare: and this do both Pliny and Aristotle mu∣tually affirm. Which clamour of the Chicken comming Lib. 10. c. 53. de Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. to the Hennes care, and she finding a necessity of breaking the shell, that her darling may enjoy the fr aire to continue its life; or, if you will, she being affe∣cted with a strong desire to see her beloved Infan breaks up the egge with her bill; which is no hard matter to do, since in that place, by reason the cavity hath been long destitute of liquor, and hath been much dryed by the aire within it, and the heat without it,  shell is become more fraile, and brittle. The cry there∣fore of the Chicken, is the first and greatest taken of
desire of enlargement, and of the oxigence it stands in ant of Air: Which the Henne so exactly under∣stands, that if it so fall out, that she perceive the ckens cry to be low, and inward, then she turns  egge up side down with her feet; that she may cleave  egge just in that place from whence the voice comes, out any injury to the chicken. Hippocrates ad∣ L. de nat. puer. another token of the Chickens inclination to get out  shell; namely, that the Chicken being now strait∣ for want of sustenance, bestirres himself strongly, quest of better feeding; and that the Membranes ow every where torne a sunder; and that the Mo∣ discovering these violent Motions of her young, ratching holes in the Shell, delivers it from bon∣e. Thus far Fabricius, pleasantly and elegantly: this arguments are not well bottomed. For e found by Experience, that the Chicken it  (and not the Henne) doth break up the Shell:  this is also most consonant to Reason. For  could the egges which are fostered in Stoves  Ovens (as it is in Aegypt and elsewhere) be o∣wise broken up? Where there is no Mother to  the distressed supplicants, nor redresse their brings. And so how can the egges of your Land ea-Tortises, your fishes, silkwormes, vipers, and bes be unlockt, when either the Issues them∣ are mute and silent, or else lye hid under nd, quite out of hearing. Chickens there∣fore born by themselves, and break loose from  egges by their own industry. And this I prove by infallible Arguments. For in the rforation of the Shell, the gap is so litle,  it bears no proportion at all with the Bill of , but exactly answers the chickens; and d about the hole (in manner of a coronet)
the Shell stands up in splinters, being always pierced at the same distance from the top: and the shivered pieces (especially if the breach be new made) always jets out erect, and tufted. And as when Glass-Windowes are broken, a man may easily discover whether they were burst from within, or without; if he do but take the paines to compare the bent and inclination of the fragments remaining: So also when the egge is pierced, by the erection of the splinters all along the circuit of the Coronet, it is manifest that the invasion came from within. And I my self, and many more with me, when we have heard the Chicken grate and scrape the Shell with his Claws, have presently seen it bored with his Bill, and a circular breach forced through it in the manner of a coronet. I have also seen the chicken bear up the top of the Shell with his Head, and so shake it off. We have been something large in this sub∣ject, because the speculation is not to be contem∣ned: as will appear hereafter. But as for Fabri∣cius, he is easily answered: For I grant the chicken hath a voice in the Egge, and perhaps a significant petitory voice: But it doth not thence follow that the Henne breaks the Shell, nor that the chickens Bill is so soft, and at so great a distance, that it cannot penetrate the Shell; especially since the Shell, according to his own arguments, is now very brittle. Nor doth the chicken alwayes con∣fine his Head to his Wing, that so he may be made incapable of working his passage, but then only when he is asleep, or else hath given up the Ghost For sometimes, as Fabricius confesseth, he wake kickes, scrapes, soratches, straines the Shell, strag∣gles, tears the membranes that enwrap him,  (and that he implores help by these cries,
doe not withstand it) and all these actions may a∣ny man hear, that has a mind to it. Wherefore the Hen diligently listening, so soon as she discovers the voice to be remote, and come from below, she doth not burst the egge, but gently move it to and fro with her foote, till she have procured a more commodious scituation for the prisoner. Yet it doth no way appear, that the Pullus doth by his cry signifie the necessity of his release from the Shell to his Mother, or desire an enlargement of her procuring, for you may often times, even for two dayes together before exclusion hear him cry in the Shell. Nor doth the Henne by the se∣veral removes of the egge, seeke a convenient place to break it up: but as when the sick Infant in the cradle is disquiet, weepes, and roares, his affecti∣onate Mother turnes him from side to side, and rocks him till he lye at ease: so likewise the Hen, when she finds her chicken bufling, or crying in the egge: or after his exclusion tumbling up and down in a distempered posture: she presently arts up, and provides that the weight or heat of her body may not offend him, and moves him from place to place with her Clawes and Bill, till he have procured his ease and quiet. Of Twinne-Egges. EXERCIT. XXIV. THey are called Ova Gemellifica, or Twin-Egges, de hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. which bring two chickens; being (as Aristotle ) Stocked with two yolks, which in some are di∣vided
with a slender partition of White, to preserve them from confusion: but in others there is no White at all, but the yolks are contiguous. I have often seen these Ova Gemellifica or Twin-Egges, where they have had two Whites to every yolk, together with common, and proper mem∣branes respectively embracing them. And I have againe seen other egges where the two yolks did cleave to one another, and were both encompas∣sed with one single Common White. There are some Hennes (saith Aristotle) which bring none but Twinne-Egges, in which the Yolke is clear∣ly disposed, as we said before: for a certain Henne in Ibid. two and twenty egges, layed none but Twinne-Egges; except onely those that were barren. Now it comes to pass, that one of the Twins is bigger then the other: but the last is a Monster. With us sometimes there are Twin-Egges, and the Chickens also are sometimes Twins too, though very seldome. And for my part I never saw two such Chickens that both of them lived: but one perished either in the egge it self, or in the Exclu∣sion. And this also seems to have befalne Aristotles Chickens, because he saith, One was bigger then the other: implying that one of them was hartier then the other, and sooner quickned: but the o∣ther weaker, and so less ready to endure exclusion: For (I am perswaded that) the two Yolks are of different production, and maturity. And there∣fore it can hardly be, but that the forwarder Chicken, being now ripe for enlargement, in break∣ing up the egge, to make way for his own nati∣vity, must needs induce abortion to his brother: And should he forbear to break up the egge, his own life were in imminent danger, being now streightned for breath. So that in Exclusion, the
one or the other, receives their inevitable doome. Fabricius either not observing, or not under∣standing pag. 29. those words of Aristotle, saith: If there chance to be such an egge that hath two yolks in it, the Chicken that is produced thence, is born with four legs, and four wings, and two heads, and so becomes a kind of Monster: but the Chickens never come forth so distinctly two: (as that they may truly be called two) but have onely one main Trunk of body, where two heads, and four legs and the like are adjoyned. Whence it appears, that himself never saw, nor heard by others that had seen it, that such kind of Egges produce Twins: and therefore he must needs be of my mind; namely, that such egges rarely happen; and that they never exclude two vitall Foetuses. Yet I cannot but admire that (if he saw this place of Aristotle) he should say, that such an egg doth never produce two distinct Chickens, but always a Monster: especially since he believes, that the Foetus is formed of the Chalazae, as out of the sub∣ject Matter, and he could not but see four chalazae in every Gemellifical Egge. I rather believe that when in a Gemellifical Egge there are two Yolkes concluded in the same White, and are so conjoy∣ned together, that their cicatriculae, while they are opened together, do constitute one Eye (which we call the colliquamentum) a Monster chicken may be then produced, having four Legs, two Heads, . because I can see nothing to hinder it; and such a one I suppose was bred of Fabricius his Egge. Yet nevertheless, where the two yolks are di∣stinct, and separate by their proper Coats, and are furnished with their Grandines, and Whites, and other necessaries conducing to the Generation
of the Foetus: I conceive we ought to conclude with Aristotle, that such an egge as it hath all the parts required to two egges (save only the Shells) so it obtaines the virtue and power too; and un∣less it be barren and addle, will for the most part produce two chickens, but seldom a single Mon∣ster.
CERTAIN THEOREMS taken out of the foregoing Hi∣story of the Egge. EXERCIT. XXV. THe History of the Hen-Egge, is such as hath been said. Wherein we have delivered how the Egge it selfe is ge∣nerated, and how by its Action (which is Propagation) it formeth the chicken. All which, hath perhaps been sufficiently prolix, and tedious to such who are not yet acquainted, whither these so great undertakings, and so exact and accurate Observations, tend. And therefore I hold it convenient to discover what fruit and advantage may be reaped by my labour: and hereupon (to use the expression of our most lear∣ned Verulamius) we shall proceed to our Second Vintage: collecting certain Theorems out of our former History; some of which are Infallibly True, some Doubtful, and must submit to a farther Dis∣cussion: Some are Paradoxical, and contrary to the received opinion: Some of them also relate
to the Cock, or Male, some to the Female; some, to the Egge it self; and lastly, some to the Forma∣tion of the Pullus. Which when we have once throughly discussed, and understood, Our know∣ledge and insight into the Generation of all other Animals, will be lesse exposed to difficulty, and Errour. What an Egge is. EXERCIT. XXVI. THe Theorems, which are employed about the Contemplation of the Egge, some do teach what an Egge is, some what its Generation, and others what Parts go to its Constitution. And first it is evident, that One Chicken pro∣ceeds but from one Egge: which though it be a One Chic∣ken pro∣ceeds but from One Egge. kind of an exposed Womb, yet it seldome produces more Chickens then One. And though sometimes it produce two, yet that egge is not to be accounted a single, but a double egge; as having obtained both the Nature and Parts of two eggs. For the egge is a certain Conception procee∣ding from Male and Female, qualified with the An egge is a Con∣ception. power of both: and out of it being One, one A∣nimal is constituted. Nor is it the Beginning, but the Fruit also, and the End; Namely, the Principium, the Beginning Both the Beginning and the Fruit. or Principle of the Ofspring, that is to be genera∣ted; but the Fructus, the Fruit of Both Parents; namely, the Cocks and the Hens Work (or End,
which they proposed to themselves in Generation) and the Original of the future foetus. Now, the De gen. an. l. 1. c. 18. Seed and the Fruit (according to Aristotle) are di∣stinguished from one another, under the notion of For∣ar, and Latter: for the Fruit is that which is made ut of another, and the Seed is that out of which ano∣ther is made; for otherwise they were both the same. The Egge also seemes to be a kinde of Medium; It is also a certain Medium. not onely as it is the Principium, and the Finis, but as it is the Common work or production of both Sexes, and compounded of both: which contain∣ing in it self the Matter, and the Efficient or Ope∣rative Faculty, it hath the power of both, by which he produceth a Foetus like to One, or the Other. It is also a Medium, or thing between an Animate and n Inanimate creature; being neither absolutely impowered with life, nor absolutely without it. It is a Mid-way or Passage between the Parents and the Children; between those that were, and those that are to come, and the very Hinge and Center about which the Generation of all the Race and Family of Cocks and Hennes doth move, and depend. It is the Terminus à quo, the Point or Original from which all the Cocks and Hennes in the world do arise and spring: and it is also the Terminus ad quem, the Aim and End propo∣sed by nature, to which they direct themselves all their life long. By which it comes to pass, that all Individuals, while to supply their Species they be∣get their Like, do continue and perpetuate their duration. The Egge is at were the Period of this Eternity; for it is hard to say, Whether the Egge be made for the Chickens sake, or the Chicken for the Eggs. Now, which of these two, namely the Egge or the Henne, have the priority in Nature, or Time, we shall now copiously handle, when we
come to discourse of the Generation of all Animals in general. The Egge also (which is chiefly to be noted It is also the Sper∣ma. answers in proportion to the Seeds of Plants, and hath obtained the same qualifications with them, so that it may justly be stiled the Sperma, and Semen, or Seed of the Hennes (as also the Seeds of Plants may be rightly called Ova Plantarum, the Plants Egges) not onely ex quo, out of which, as out of a subject Matter; but also à quo, by which, as by an Efficient cause, the Chicken springs. In which also there is no part of the Future Foetus, actually  it, but yet all the parts of it are in it potentially. Now, Semen, or Seed properly so called, doth differ from Genitura, Geniture, because (accord∣ing Ibid. The dif∣ference between Sperma & Genitura. to Aristotles definition) That is called Genitura, which proceeding from the Male-Parent, is the chief and principle cause of Generation; namely, in fll as nature hath designed to coition; but the semen is that, which proceeds from both Parents in the act of coition, the Seed of all Plants is like to this, and so is the Seed of some Animals, which have no distinction of Sex at all, be∣ing as it were at the first a kind of mixture of both Sexes, or promiscuous conception, or Animal: for these kind of creatures have in their single selves, as much as is required of both Sexes. An Egge therefore is a Natural Body endowed with an Animal power: namely, with a Principle of Motion, Transmutation, Rest, and Conservation. And lastly, it is such a thing, as all impediments be∣ing removed, it will passe into an Animal: not do heavy bodies, when all obstacles are out of their way, tend downward more naturally; then Seed, and the egge, do by an inbred Natural Pro∣pensity incline to become a Plant, or an Animal. And the Seed also, and the Egge, are the Fr
and End, of that very thing, whose Beginning and Efficient they are. Of One Chicken there is but One Egge: So A∣ristotle, Of One Seed is begotten One Body; as for ex∣ample, Gen. an. l. 1. c. 20. of One Graine of Wheat, One Eare; of One Egge, one Animal; for a Twinne-egge is Two Eggs. And so Fabricius saith, Truly: An egge is not onely an exposed Uterus, and place of Generation, but the very thing also on which the entire Generati∣on of the Chicken depends; which the egge accom∣plisheth, both as Agent, as Matter, as the Place, as the Instrument, and all other things, whatsoever are neces∣sary requisites to Generation. He proves it to be in Organum, or Instrument, because it consists of se∣veral parts, and that according to Galen, who re∣quires pag. 47. this to the very being of an Instrument, that it be composed of divers particles, which conspire all to one , but under several capacities, and for several uses: for some of these parts are the chiefe Agent in the Action; some are necessary Assistants, without which the Action could not be performed at all; others conduce to the more convenient & better performance; and lastly, some againe, to the welfare and preserva∣tion of all the rest. And he also proves it to be an Agent, where he propounds out of Aristotle and Galen, the two actions of the Egge; namely, the Generation, and Augmentation, and Nutrition of the Chicken. And lastly, he saith exceeding well, when he affirms, that in the Operations of Nature, the Artificer or Agent, the Instrument, and the Matter are one and the same thing: So the Liver is both the Efficient, and the Instrument of sanguification: and so the other parts of the body: wherefore Aristotle was in the right, saying, It is hard to distinguish the A∣gents from the Instruments. In artificial Operations de gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. indeed the Agent and the Instrument are divided, as
the Smith and his Hammer, the Painter and his P∣cil. And the reason is rendered by Galen, becau in artificial Operations, the Artificer is without 1. de form. Foet. Work; but in Natural the Efficient cause is include in the Instruments, and received with intimacy in the very substance of the Organ. To which I ad those Perspicuous passages of Aristotle, Of thing that are, some are caused by nature, and some by o∣ther causes: by Nature do Animals, and their Parts Phys. l. 1. e. 1. also Plants, and simple bodies, as the Earth, Fire,  and Water, consist: For these and the like, we s are made by Nature. Now all these forenamed crea∣tures seem to be differenced from those which are not made by Nature. For all those things that  made by Nature, seem to have in themselves a Prin∣ciple of Motion, and Rest; some in relation to place some in relation to increase and diminution, and s, in relation to alteration. Now a Horse-Litter, and Garment, and all such kinde of things, according to their several notions, as farre forth as they are the pro∣ducts of Art, they have no inbred principle of Muta∣tion: but so far as it chances, that they are framed of Stone, or Earth, or bodies composed of these, so far they have one. As if Nature were a certain principle and cause, why that thing doth move, and rest, in which it first is, of it self, and not by Accident. Now I say, not by Accident; because it may come to passe that a man may be the cause of his own health, in case he be a Physitian: Yet he is not in health under the same Respect, as he is a Physitian; but it is a men Accident, that the same Man should be in Health, and a Physitian too. And therefore these two things are some∣times apart. And thus it is in all other artificial things: for none of them have in themselves an Efficient Principle, but some of them have such a Principle in others, that are without themselves, as a House and
all other Manual Productions: some indeed have it in themselves, but not by themselves: namely, all those things which may by accident become causes to them∣selves. Nature therefore is that thing which she hath eady been said to be. And all those things have ature in them, which have such a kind of Principle. And all those things are substances. For Nature is ever me subject, and in some subject. We have related these Passages more at large, The Effi∣cient Cause of Generati∣on is in the Egge. and in their Authors own words; that so it may appear, that what we attribute to the egge, is ally in it; namely, the Matter, the Organ, the fficient Cause, Place, and what ever else is requi∣red to the Generation of the Pullus. And chiefly, for the clearing of some most difficult questions,  namely, which is, and what kind of Principle it is, from whence Motion and Generation do pro∣d? Also, by what Power the Seed doth act, according to Aristotle? And lastly, what it is that oth inspire and qualifie the Seed with its faecun∣dity? (For Aristotle decrees, that Nature is the Principle of Motion and Rest, Innate in all bodies, d not Accidental.) Whether that which in the gge, is the Cause Efficient, and Principle of Gene∣ration, and of the Vegetative and Vital Operations, be some Innate thing in it, or something Added to it? And whether it be in it first, and by it selfe, as a kinde of Nature: or else by Accident, as the Physitian is in the Cure? Whether it be some In∣ed, or some Acquired power which doth trans∣form the Egge into a Chicken; or nourish it when it was but begun in the Ovary, augmenting, and perfecting, also preserving it while it is not Set upon by the Henne. Moreover, what it is that fructifies the egge, whether it be to be called the Soul? or a Part of
the Soul? or some faculty of the Soul? or some thing that has a Soul? or an Intellect? or la the Deity? because it acts for some end,  disposes all things by providence, and  mitable art, and after an incomprehen manner; and always provides what is best, b for the being, and well-being; as also for de∣fence, and ornament. And this not onely in perfect egge which it fructifies, but even in a sub∣ventaneous one too, nourishing, augmenting, and preserving it. And doth not onely supply and nourish the yolk in the Vitellary, but that very le speck (whence that proceeds) being of no grea magnitude then Millet, or Mustard-seed, which i feeds and enlarges; and at last invests it with the White, the Chalazae, the Membranes, and the Shll For it is probable, that even an Improlifical, barr egg, by an innate and inbred principle (though it be contained in the Bowels of the Henne, and adhear to her) doth feed, conserve, augment, alter (in like manner as Fishes and Frogs-egges, which being exposed do grow, and are perfected) and transforme it self out of a small Whelke or spek into a yolk, and afterward take its journey from the Ovary to the Uterus (though it have no Con∣nexion to the Uterus) and there inrobe it self in the White; and at last compleat it self with the Membranes, Chalazae, and Shel. But be it what it will, which doth alike both in a Subventaneous, and in a Fruitful, equally produce the same effects, after the same manner, and from the same Causes or Principles; whether it be the same Soul, or the same Part of the Soul; in both it is very well worth our inquiry. Now in probability, the same things do spring from the same Causes.
Though the egge while it is making, is contai∣ned within the Henne, and grows to its parent in Whether the Egge be a Part of the Henne?  Vitellary by the Pedunculus or stalk, and is sup∣plied from the Hens veines: yet may it not be aid to be a Part of its mother, nor to take life and getation from her soul, but from its own pro∣per power, and intrinsecal principle: As Mush∣s, Misletoe, and several kindes of Moss are bred  of Trees, (which though they adhere to the lant, and are sustained by the same sap with its wn blossomes, and leaves, yet are they not Parts of those Trees, nor are they called so. Aristotle to salve these doubts, allows a Vegetative soul to de gen. an. l. 3. c e, even in the very Subventaneous Egge, where he saith, Both Females, and all things that live, have a Ve∣getative soul, as hath been often said: Wherefore this gge (treating of a Subventaneous egge) considered a the Conception of a Plant, is perfect, of an Animal, it is Imperfect. And in another place he teacheth the same thing, enquiring: After what manner de gen. an. l. 2. c. 4.  Subventaneous egges said to live? for they cannot be said to live as fruitful egges live: For then an Ani∣mal might be produced out of them. Nor are they in the condition of Wood, and Stones; because they pe∣rish by a kinde of corruption, as things that formerly did in some sort partake of life. It is certain therefore that they have some Potential soul: But what Soul is that? doubtlesse that Soul which they last enjoyed, which is a vegetable Soul; for this is indifferently in all Plants as well as Animals. And yet the same soul is not in Subventaneous Egges, and in fruitful. For if so, A Chicken might alike be formed out of both. But how their Souls differ, and in what, Aristotle doth not suffici∣ently declare, in his enquiry, Why all the parts of an egge are framed in a Subventaneous Egge, and
yet an Animal is not procreated thence? Because (saith he) it is necessary it should have a sensative soul. As if in fruitful Egges there were a sensative soul, besides the vegetative. Unlesse you apprehend it thus, that the Vegetative soul is Actually in a fruit∣ful egge, which containes in it a sensative soul, in Potentiâ; out of which afterwards an Animal, and the sensative parts of an Animal are produced. But this doth not sufficiently salve the scruple, not release the mind involved in perplexities and doubts. For an Egge seems to be the true Sper of an Animal, according to that of Aristotle. In those things that have life, and no distinction of Sexes, de gen. an. l. 1. c. 20. the Seed is a kind of Conception already. I call that a Conception (which bears proportion to Seed) which is the mixture of Male and Female; wherefore out of  Seed proceedeth one Body, v. g. out of one egge  Animal. One egge therefore seemes to have one Soul: now What soul is that where∣with the Egge is in∣formed. whether is that Soul the soul of the Henne? or of the Cock? or a mixt soul of Both? For the doubt chiefly concerns those egges, which proceed from Animals of a distinct kind: as out of a dunghill Henne, and a Cock Pheasant. I enquire whether such an egge participate of the soul of the Henne, or of the Pheasant? or is the soul of the Egge com∣pounded of them both? But how can there be a commixture of souls, if (according to Aristotle) the soul (as being the form) be an Act, and a Sub∣stance. For no man can deny, but that that thing whatsoever it be, which is the Principle and Cause of those Effects which we see produced in a Fertile Egge, is a substance susceptible of divers powers, forces, and faculties, as also of several conditions, vertues, vices, health, and sicknesse. For some Egges are longer lived then others: and some do
procreate Chickens endowed with the vertues, and soundnesse of constitution of the parents; and o∣thers produce them inclinable to distempers. Nor can we for this inconvenience accuse the Matter, out of which they are generated, since the disea∣ses of the Male are sometimes transferred to the Chickens; who is not concerned any thing at all in the Matter of the egge. For from the Male the Plastical and Generative faculty onely doth pro∣ceed, which renders the egge fertile, but doth constitute no part of it. For the Geniture which is emitted from the Male in Coition, doth not en∣ter into the Matrix: (where the Egge is formed) Nor (as we have said before, and Fabricius also joynes in the Suffrage) can it any way penetrate those recesses, and much lesse the Ovary, which is seated neer the Precincture, or Midriffe of the body, that so it might communicate any portion of the Matter, or any thing at all besides its sin∣gle Vertue. For constant experience testifies, that one and the same act of Coition doth fructifie ma∣ny egges together: and not onely those that are existent in the Uterus and the Ovary; but those al∣so that are not yet begun: as we shall declare here∣after, and have already proved in our History. If therefore the Egge be rendered Fertile from its own proper soul, or be endowed with an innate The Egge doth not live by the Soul of the Henne. fructifying principle of its own; by which either a dunghil Chicken, or a mongrel-issue between the dunghil-Henne, and the Cock-Pheasant doth arise; and that either Male, or Female, like the Male, or Female-Parent, sound, or sickly; we must then conclude, that the Egge (even while it is contai∣ned in the Ovary) doth not live by the Soul of the ne; but is a freeborn, Independant Issue from  very first original: As the Acorne taken off from
the Tree, and the Seed from the Plant, are no lon∣ger to be counted parts of them; but creatures, as it were, at their own dispose; living and sub∣sisting, by an inbred vegetative faculty peculiarly their own. Now if we affirm that a Fertile Egge hath a soul, a question will arise; whether that self-same soul, be now at present in the Egge, and how after, in the Chicken, or whether their souls be distinct. For we must of necessity acknowledge, that some Principle there is which doth constitute, and nou∣rish the egge; and also that there is a Principle which produceth and sustaineth the Chicken. The question therefore is, whether the Principle, or soul of the Egge and Chicken, be one and the same, or more then one, and diverse? For if there be more then one soul; (namely, one which belongs to the Egge, and another to the Chicken) it will be farther enquired, whence, and at what time the Chickens soul arrives to it? And what that is in the Egge, which dilates the Cicatricula raises the Yolk to the top, and produces that Eye, (which we call the Colliquamentum) alters the Con∣stitution of the liquors, and doth predispose all things for the fabrick and structure of the Chicken when as yet there is nothing at all of the chicken existent? Whence also can we pretend that pro∣per and convenient Aliment is derived to  Chicken, to sustain and augment it, when there i yet no Chicken at all? For these operations s to belong to the Vegetative soul of the Chicken,  cause they relate to the Chickens use; namely  nutrition, and Augmentaetion. But now, when the fabrick of the Chicken is in hand, and half-per∣fected, what is it that makes the Foetus, One  the same thing with the Liquors, conjoining the
together by continuity, and concrescence? What is it that feeds, and enlarges the Pullus; that doth vindicate those juices which are advantageous to its nourishment from Putrefaction, preparing, melting down, and concocting them? Since the soul is the Act of an Organical Body, which hath life in Potentiâ, it is an incredible thing that that soul should be in the Chicken before its body have received any Organization. Nor yet can we believe that the soul of the egge, & the chic∣ken is one and the same: for the soul is the Preserver of that thing only, whose soul it is; but the Puttus and the Egge, are two distinct things; and do exer∣cise not only distinct vital operations, but Contrary; in so much that one of them seems to result from the Corruption of the other. May we then say, that the Cause and Principle of life to them both is one and the same? namely to the Chicken which is yet but an Embryo, and to the rest of the Egge, as if it were the simple and single act of one and the some body; or as if out of the parts constituting  natural body, one soul did spring, which were all in the whole (as they say) and all in every part. As we finde in the Trunk, Leaves, and Fruits  Tree: in which, wheresoever we make a sepa∣ration or division (be it in what part it will) wee say, that the first Cause and Principle of that part,  the same with that of the Whole, as being the Form and End of the One, but the Principle only of the Other. For so in a Line, in what point so∣ever a division be made, it will be the End of the ore-going part, but the Beginning of the subse∣quent. And the same thing may seem to befall in lity, and Motion; namely, in every Trans∣mutation, and Generation. And so much at present concerning these mat∣ters:
which we shall more exactly, and more co∣piously handle, when we treat in General of the Nature of the Soul of the Foetus, of any Animal what∣soever; as also what it is? From whence, and when it comes? What part it takes first possession of? and how it is all in the Whole, and all in every part? And also how it is the same, and yet diverse? All which we shall determine and resolve out of multiplied experiments. That the Egge is not the Production of the Womb, but of the Soul. EXER. XXVII. AS we conclude (saith Fabricius) the Action of the Stomack to be Chylification; and the acti∣on pag. 8. of the Testicles to be the Generation of Seed; because the Chyle is found in the Stomack, and Seed in the Testicles: So we positively resolve, that the Generati∣on of Egges is the action of the Uterus of the Fowle, be∣cause the egge is found resident there. So then we evidently know, and understand, which is the Instru∣ment and Place of the Generation of Egges. But  againe, since there are two Wombs in a Fowle, th Superior and Inferior, and those much unlike one ano∣ther, and therefore their Actions are divers, yet it i apparent which action is peculiar to each. For  Superior is ordained for the Generation of the Yolk the Inferior of the White, and the other parts,  the whole, as is evident even to sense: For in the Supe∣rior nothing is contained but a throng of Yolks, but
the Inferior the entire perfect egge. And yet this is not all the employment of the Womb; but the Augmen∣tation of the egg, which presently insueth after the egge is generated, and continueth till it be compleated and have attained its just stature or magnitude, is also im∣plyed herein. For a Hen doth not naturally lay her egge till it be perfect, and have its just proportion. The Action therefore of the Womb, is both the Generation and Augmentation of the Egge. Now Augmentation includeth and supposeth Nutrition. But since all Gene∣ration is effected by two; namely, the Agent, and the Matter: The Agent in the procreation of Egges is no∣thing else, but the Instrument or proposed Organs, namely the twofold Uterus. But the Matter is nothing else but Blood. Now we, though we acknowledge the Action of the Uterus to be in some sort the Generation of the Egge, yet we do not agree upon any termes in the world, that the Egge is nourished and encrea∣sed by the Uterus. And this both for the reasons before alledged, when we discoursed concerning the soul of the Egge, which nourisheth it: and al∣so because it is an improbable thing, that an Ex∣ternal Agent (as the Womb is, in regard of the Egge) should form, nourish, and angment all the interi∣or parts of the Egge, according to their several dimensions: nay according to Aristotle, it is alto∣gether de gen. an. l. 2. c. 1. impossible. For how can an agent that is ex∣trinsecal in respect of the patient, work upon the Aliment that is elsewhere provided, and restore it into the place of that which is wasted away, ac∣cording to all dimensions; or how can any thing be affected and altered by that, which doth not touch it? Therefore doubtlesse the same things befall the Generation of Egges, as happen to the exordiums of all living creatures; namely, that they
should be constituted by some preexistent external thing; but presently (upon the reception of life) nourish, and augment themselves; and that by  proper inspired efficacy, proceeding from a Prin∣ciple which is now borne, and implanted in them. What we have lately delivered concerning the soul, doth seem to evince clearly, that the Egge is neither the Workmanship of the Uterus, nor con∣trouled or governed by it: For it is apparent that even a Subventaneous egge is furnished with a Vege∣tative Soul, because we discover even such an egge also to enjoy Vegetation, Nutrition, Augmentati∣on, and Conservation, which are infallible sight of the fore-said Soul. Now these faculties can∣not issue out of the Mother, or Matrix, because the Egge hath no Coherence, or Union to it; but tumbles and roules in its Cavity free, and dis∣joyned (like a Son who hath obtained his Free∣dom) and growes up to perfection, as the Seeds of Plants do in the Womb of the Earth, by an in∣ternal Vegetative Principle, which can be no lesse then a Vegetative Soul. Much more will it appear, that it hath a Soul, when we consider, after what manner, and by whose impulsion, the Round and Ample Yolk, being new loose from the Vitellary, maketh its de∣scent through the Infundibulum, (which is a slen∣der Tunnel, wrought with a niost thin membrane, which hath no provision of motory fibres) working out its own way, till through all those streights it arrive at the Uterus; where it nourisheth, aug∣menteth, and invests it self in the White. And yet all this while, there is no Motory Instrument at all in the Vitellary, which should expell it thence, nor in the Infundibulum, which should transmit
it, or in the Uterus which should attract it: Nor is the Egge fastned by veins to the Uterus, as in the Ovary, nor hath any dependance upon it by the Umbilical Vessels; as Fabricius truely affirms, and is obvious to every eye. What then remains, but that upon discovery of such wonderful Operati∣ons, we should cry out with the Poet, Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus 6. Aenead. Mens agitat molem. An innate Spirit feeds, an Infus'd Soul Into each part, doth the whole Mass controul. And though the first ground-workes of Egges (which we have proved to be but Whelkes, as it were, and of the magnitude of the Seed of Mil∣let) do cohear to the Vitellary by the mediation of Veins and Arteries; (as the Seeds of Plants are born adhearing to the Plants) and thereupon seem to be Parts of the Henne, and to be nourished and live after the manner of other Parts: yet it is evi∣dent, that as the Seeds of Plants being dis-united from the Plants, are no more accounted parts of them; no more are Egges, now come to maturity, impowred with fertility, and separated from the Vitellary, any longer to be ranked amongst the Parts of the Henne, but like a Son come to age, and at his own dispose, are regulated and enliven'd by their own proper soul. But of this morefully hearafter, when we shall discourse concerning the Soul of an Embryo in ge∣neral; and of the excellence and divinity of the Vegetative Soul, ordering all things after a won∣derful manner: (which providence, art, and di∣vine discretion, as farre exceeding our capacity,
as God excells Man; and therefore are (confessed by all) truly admirable, not to be gazed upon by our cloudy apprehensions, by reason of their in∣effable lustre. What shall we say then of those litle Animals, which are begotten in our own bodies, which no man ever doubted to be regulated and vegetated by their own proper soul? And of this kind are Worms in the Stomack, Guts, and Fundament, Lice, Nittes, litle Wormes in the Flesh, Mites: Or what shall we resolve concerning those Wormes, which proceed from Plants, and their fruit? such as you may finde in Galls, Nuts, the Scarlet-Berry, and Eglantine, &c. For an Animal may be created al∣most in all drye things, growing moist, or moist things Hist. an. l. 5. c. 32 growing drye. It is impossible that those Animals which are bred in the Galls should be enlivened by the Okes soul, though they live joyned to the Oke, and provide their Aliment out of the Sap of the Oke. And so it is credible, that the very Ru∣diments of the Eggs, while they are yet in the Cluster, do subsist by their own, and not by the Hennes Soul, though they are united to her by Veins and Arteries, and she also do administer nourishment to them. For (as we have observed in our History) the Whelkes do not all grow at once (as Grapes grow in the Bunch, and Graines in the Eare of Corne) as if they were inspired by the same concocting and formative faculty; but are increased one after another; (as by their own efficacie) and that which first separates its selfe from its fellowes, changeth colour and consist∣ence, and of a White Whelke is made a Yolke; and so they follow one another in order: And which is more remarkable, in Pigeons, and some other Birds, they grow up from the Cluster in
paires to make up one Laying, and one of them moves for the most part a Cock, and the other a Henne. And yet in the meane time some of the Papulae, or Whelks in the Ovary stay at a stand, till two other grow up for a new production, which have received fecundity from the repeated coition of the Male, and are both inspired with a Soule. Which when they have received, they order them∣selves, and grow; living at their own, not at their Parents command. For indeed what can you fancie to dispose, select, separate, and perfect these Papulae, or Whelks (rather then the other) unless it be their own proper soules. For though they assume nourishment from their Parent, yet they doe it no otherwise, then the Plants attract from the Earth, or the Foetus from the Yolke and White. Lastly, because the Papula continuing in the Ovary, receives its fecundity from coition, and such a one too, that it by and by passeth into the forme of the Cock concerned in the coition; (whe∣ther it be Dunghill-Cock, or Cock-Pheasant) and since so great a difference befalls the Papulae, as there is in the males themselves of different kinde, what shall we conclude to be in the Papulae them∣selves, by whose virtue they are distinguished both from themselves, and their female parent? Doubt∣less it must needs be the soule, by which they are diversified both from one another, and from their Mothers also. And just in this manner doe Mushromes, and Plants growing to Trees, live. We discover like∣wise often in our own bodies, that Cancers, fleshy, and also phlegmatical Tumors, and such like swel∣lings, are supplied and fed as it were with their own proper vegetative soules; while in the interim
the true and genuine parts of the Body, doe exte∣nuate and wither: And that because these tumors doe seduce all the aliment to themselves, and so defraud the rest of the body of its fostering juyce (as of its Genius) whence they are called Phage∣daenae and Lupi, Devouring Cankers and Wolves. And perhaps Hippocrates by his , under∣stood those diseases, which spring from venom, or contagion; as if they were furnished with a life, or inspired with a certain divine principle, by which they provide for themselves, and pro∣pagate their kinde, and so did beget by contagi∣on distempers like themselves, in several person. Wherefore (Aristotle saith) Animae plena sunt om∣nia, All things are filled with a soule. And i De Gen. an. l. 3. c. 11. Ibid. l. 4. c. 11. another place, he conceives that even Wind hath its life, birth, and decease. But the yolke, which it is now divorced from the Ovary, and spoiled of all commerce with the Henne, then doubtless (a beanes and such like pulse derive of their own ac∣cord humidity from the Earth, which they im∣bibe, and digest) passing through the Infundibu∣lum, and residing now in the Cavity of the Ute∣rus, it doth attract a slow thick moisture, which it receives into it selfe, and from it obtaineth nu∣trition and augmentation, begirts it selfe with the White, and being ingarrisoned in the membranes and the shell, is at last exact and perfect. All which being duely considered, wee conclude, that it is stored with a peculiar soule of its owne.
That the Egge is not made without a Henne. EXERCIT. XXVIII. TO omit what ever is in dispute; and to wave all controversies till we come to the General contemplation concerning this subject; we now pro∣ceed to things of more certainty, & more obvious. And first it is manifest that an Egge cannot be made fertile, without the help of the Cock and Henne. For without a Cock it cannot be fruit∣full, without a Henne it cannot be at all. And this is opposite to that opinion, which deduceth the first rise and fabrick of all living creatures out of the clay of the Earth. For since the several parts of Generation (namely the Testicles and Leading Vessels in the Cock) are formed with such eminent Art, Industry, and Reason, and likewise the O∣vary and Uterus in the Henne, together with the Veines and Arteries which are subservient to them, are so skilfully composed, and the situation, fi∣gure, and temper of every particular, are dispo∣sed in a miraculous method; and all these things are some way or other required to the generation and fecundity of the egge: most certain it is (for nature makes nothing in vain, nor doth she go to work by digressions, where she may be more com∣pendious in her dispatch) that an egge cannot be any other way produced, then now it is, (namely, by a cock & a hen) neither by nature of her own ac∣cord, nor by any other means whatever; nor can ei∣ther cock or hen be produced, but frō an Egge. So that the cock & the hen are made for the Eggssake, and likewise the Egge for the Cock and Hens sake: and
you may be justly doubtfull with Plutarch, which of these is first, namely the Egge, or the Henne For she was first in order of Nature, but the Egge i order of Time. For whatsoever excells, is first in order of Nature; but that from which another i produced, is first in order of Time. Or else we may say, That that Egge from which this or that par∣ticular Henne sprung, is of more Antiquity th the Henne: and so on the contrary, That Hens which produceth this particular Egge, is elder then it. For this Vicissitude and Circuite perpetuate the Race of Cockes and Hennes; while now the Chicken, and now the Egge by a constant series and return do continue an Immortal Species, out of the decay and ruines of the Individuals. And af∣ter this sort do many sublunary creatures emulate and approach to the Perpetuity of Celestial bo∣dies. And whether we affirm a soul to be in the egge or not, yet by this circumvolution it appears, that there is some principle of the vicistitude from the Henne to the Egge, and again from the Egge to the Henne, which conferrs a sempiternity unto them. And that very thing (saith Aristotle) beareth an Analogie to the substance of Starres; and causeth the Parents to propagate, and their seed, or eggs, to be de gen. an. l. 2. c. 3. prolifical: and is like Proteus, disguised in several formes, ever existent both in the Parents, and in the Egges. For as that Minde or Spirit which rules the world, doth continually reduce the same Ri∣sing and Setting Sun from several Quarters and Regions of the Earth: so also in the Progeny of Cocks and Henns, the Vis Enthea, or divine Princi∣ple, which is now called the Plastical, sometimes the Nutritive, and sometimes the Augmentatin Power or Virtue, is also ever conceived to be the
Conservative, and Vegetative too: and now putting on the form of the egge, and now of the Chicken, continues for ever. And though some Animals are born of their own Accord, or (as they common∣ly say) of Putrefaction: and others only produced from a Female (as Pliny notes in some kinde of Lib. 9. c. 16. living creatures there is no Male at all; as in the Ruffes, and the Roches: for they are all taken great with spawn) yet whatsoever is produced from a perfect egge, doth not proceed but from both Sexes. And therefore, saith Aristotle, The Male and the de gen. an. l. 1. c. 2. Female are chiefly to be counted the Principles of Ge∣neration. The Cock therefore and the Henne are the two first Principles of the egge; the fruit, or com∣mon conception of both which is the egge, containing in it the virtue of both Parents. So that an egge can no more be made without the assistance of the Cock and Henne, then the fruit can be made with∣out the Trees aid. And each particular Individuum, both Cock and Henne, seems to be created for the egges sake, that the same Species may be prolong∣ed, though by the ruine and obsequies of the Au∣thors. And it is also clear, that the Parents are no longer youthfull, beautifull, complete and Jo∣vial, then they can generate, or fructifie their eggs, and produce their own like, by the mediation of those eggs. Which work of nature so soon as they have accomplished, as if then they had attained the highest , or Pitch of their perfection, and last end for which they were born, they presently wither, grow old, and Emerit, and as if God and Nature had forsaken them, they decline spee∣dily, and hasten to their end, like creatures weary of their lives. Whereas on the contrary, the Males when they arm themselves, and are in all respects
well appointed for Loves encounter, how strangly doth the potent Cupid heighten their enflamed spirits, how spruce are they, how do they pride it; how vigorous, how testy are they, and prone to conflicts! But when this office and performance ceaseth: oh! how soon doth their force abate, and their late fury coole! how doe they hale in all their swelling sails, and check their darings? Nay even while this jocund Sacrifice to Venus is in sea∣son, no sooner is the act performed, but they grow tame and pusillanimous; as if it were then deep printed in their thoughts, that while they impart a life to others, they are in full career to their own urnes. Onely our Cock, full fraught with seed and spirits, approves himselfe the onely cheerfull loser, and with the plaudit of his wings and voice, crownes his past triumphs, and lights his wedding Torch at his own Cinders. And yet he also flags after long game, and like an Emerit souldier resignes his Commission. And so the Hens likewise, like Plants worn out, grow decayed Ma∣trons, and fore-go their Nurseries.
How a perfect and fruitfull Egge is produced by Male and Female, according to Aristotle. EXERCIT. XXIX. WEe have lately said, that an Egge, especi∣ally a fruitful one, is no spontaneous issue; nor doth proceed from any thing but a Hen, nor yet a fruitfull one from her neither, without her in∣tercourse with a Cock: According to that of A∣ristotle; We are to conclude, that male and female De gen. an. l. 1. c. 2. are the chief principles of Generation: the Male, be∣cause he hath the preeminence in the original of the Motus and Generation, the Female in the original of the Matter. Now according to our decision, A fertile egge is truly a sperme, and genit all seed, Analagous to the seed of Plants, and the first conception resulting from both Parents, and the promiscuous produ∣ction of them both. For as an Egge cannot have a being without a Hen, so it cannot have fecundity without a Cock. It remaines therefore that we enquire, how the egge is made by the hen, and how it is made fertile by the Cock; for we see that subventaneous egges, and those animate too, are produced by the hen: but yet are not prolifical without the Cock. And therefore both Cock and Hen lay their stock toge∣ther to constitute a fertile egge. And yet (as I conceive) not in that manner as Aristotle would have it; namely, that the Male should be Master only of the original of the Matus and Generation: and
the Female onely contribute the Matter. For the con∣trary appears in Subventaneous egges: And tho it be true, where he saith: The Male and Female are different according to reason, because their facul∣ties are diverse, and according to sense, because some of their parts are divers too. The difference between them according to reason consists in this, that the Male is that creature which doth generate in another; the Female is that, which generates in it selfe, and out of which, that which is generated is made, being contai∣ned in that which doth generate it. But since these  distinguished by the diversity of the Faculty, and of the Office or imployment; and every performance of  office requires an instrument; and the parts of the bo∣dy are commodious instruments to the faculties; it i necessary that some parts should be accommodated for procreation and Coition; and that those parts should be different too, that so the Male and Female may be distinguished. Yet it doth not thence follow, which he see desirous to infer, saying: The Male is the Efficient and by the vertue of its Geniture doth produce that which is designed out of the Matter conteined in  Female: and the Female doth always contribute the Matter. So that it is necessary that the Female should contribute the Body, and the Quantity or Magnitude, but there is no such thing required at the males hand. Nor is it necessary that the Instruments, or the Effici∣ent it self should be in those things that are produ by them. The Body therefore proceeds from the female, and the soul from the male. For the Substance of  Body is the soul. For an egge, and that an anima one too, is produced by the Hen alone, without the Cock. Whence it appears, that the Female  Hen is also the Efficient cause; and that all power of Production, or the Soul doth not proceed
the Male. And this the example urged by Ari∣stotle seemes to confirm: for he saith. Those crea∣tures De gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. that proceed to Coition, and re not of the same kind (which they do, whose season is alike, and time of hearing, together neer at hand, and do not much differ in the dimensions of their bodies) do bring forth their first issues like to themselves, partaking of the Species of both kindes: as those that are begotten by a Wolfe and a Bitch, or by a Partridge and the Dunghil∣rood: but in process of time, these diverse Parents, produce a diverse issue, the off-spring at length assum∣ing like form with the Hen, as forraigne Seed is at last transformed according to the Nature of the Soile where it growes, for the Soile contributes matter and Body to the Seed. By which words it is manifest, that in the Ge∣neration between a Cock-Partridge and a Dunghil-Hen, the Male is not the sole efficient, but the Fe∣male is concerned too: because a Common Spe∣cies and form, and not that of the Male onely, is produced; being alike, both in Body, and Soul, as well to the Female as the Male. Now the Soul  the Forme and Species of an Animal. And againe: the Female may seem to have most ight to the title of Efficient, for he saith, in Pro∣sse of time, these diverse Parents produce a diverse , the off-spring at length assuming like form with the Hen. As if the Seed of the Male were lesse pow∣erful; and did in time lose the Species which it imprints; as being razed out and expunged by  more potent Efficient. And this that instance concerning the soil doth more strengthen: For, reign Seed is at last transformed according to the ture of the soile where it growes. By all which it  probable, that the Female is a stronger  in Generation, then the Male: For in the
Universe likewise, the Earth is held to be, as it were, the Female and the Mother: But the Heavens and the De gen. an. l. 1. c. 2. Sun, and the other Bodies of that kind, Philosopher call by the name of Father and Genitor. Now the Earth also produceth many things of its own ac∣cord, without any Seed: And amongst Animals, some Females do procreate of themselves without a Male; (thus the Henne generates a Subventane∣ous Egge) but the Male never begetteth any thing without a Female. Nay by those very Arguments which contend to prove the Male to be the Principle of Generati∣on, and the primary Efficient; the energy or ef∣ficiency of the Female seems to be confirmed, and ratified: For that is to be counted the Primary Efficient, in which the reason of the foetus, and form of the Production is most eminent; and whose apparent similitude is discovered in the foetus, and also which hath an existence it self before, and then generates. Since therefore, the Form, Rea∣son, and Similitude of thè foetus is no lesse (not more) in the Female then in the Male; and she also is in being before, as a Primary Mover: We may well conclude, that the Female is as eminent an Efficient of Generation, as the Male. And though Aristotle truly say, that the Con∣ception or egge assumes no part of its body from the Male, but onely its form, species, and soul, and that the Female contributes onely the body, and quantity de gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. Yet it doth no way appear to the contrary,  that the Female doth contribute in some s both Form, Species, and Soul, (and not the Ma singly) As is evident in the Hen, which produ Egges without a Male (as the Trees beare the Fruits, Herbs and Seed without any distinction of Sexes at all.) And Aristotle himself confess
that even a Subventaneous Egge hath a Soul. The Female therefore must be the Efficient Cause of the Ibid. Egge. And yet though there be a Soul in the Subven∣taneous Egge, yet that Soul is not Prolifical; and therefore we must acknowledge that the Henne is not properly the Efficient of a Perfect Egge, but that she is so made, by Authority and Commissi∣on procured from the Cock. For an Egge, except it be Prolifical, cannot justly be said to be Perfect. Now such an Egge is produced onely by the Male; or rather by the Henne, having received such in∣structions from the Cock; as if from his Coition, the Female did receive the Art, Reason, Forme, lawes, Rule and Model of the future Foetus. Thus the Female (like a fruitful Tree) being made fer∣tile by Coition, is made Oviparous, bearing per∣fect and Prolifical Egges. For though the Henne have at present no rudiment of Egges at all ready in the Ovary, yet being fructified upon Coition, he suddainly after, both hath, and layes Egges; and those also Prolifical ones. And here the experi∣ment of poor Women is of use; Which having a Hen at home, but never a Cock, they commit her for a Fabric. pag. 37. day or two to a neighbours Cock: and from that small communication, all her egges succeed fruitful, for all that seson. That is, not onely those Egges, which now are Yolks, and onely want a White, or else have some Rudiment of their future growth, though never so litle; but even those Egges also which are not yet begun at all, and are to be con∣ceived a great while hence, are all rendered fruit∣full by the same vertue.
The Benefit of this Disquisition con. cerning Fecundity. EXERCIT. XXX. THe Disquisition wherein we examine, What it is in the Egge that renders it fruitful? is ve∣ry subtle, and difficult, and of exceeding great use: As also what is in the Conception, what in the Seed, and what in the Hen that confers Fecundity upon them: Likewise what in the Cock distinguish∣eth him from a barren cock? Is it the same cause, which we call the Soule in the Foetus? or some part of the Vegetative Soul? For the knowledge of the First Cause conduceth much to the compleat science of Generation: For Science springs from Known Causes, especially those that are the first Causes. Nor is this indagation lesse useful to the knowledge of the Nature of the Soul. But when once the verity of this is throughly dis∣covered, not onely Aristotles opinion concerning the Causes of Generation is refuted, and chastised; but even those things also which Physitians have written against him, are easily disproved. Our Quere therefore is, whether that which affords the Fertility to the Egge, Yolk, Papula, or Whelke, Cock, Hen, and to its Womb, be one and the same thing, or diverse? Likewise whether it be a Sub∣stance from whence this vertue flowes? For it seems to be susceptible of Powers, Faculties, and Acci∣dents. Or whether it be also a Corporeal thing For that seems to be mixt it self, which generates a mixt thing; namely a similitude common to both Cock and Hen; such as is that ambiguous Species produced by a Cock-Phesant and a Dung bil
Hen. It seems also to be a Corporeal thing, which suffers from without; in so much that it doth not onely produce feeble issues, but deformed also, and sickly ones, and such as are obnoxious to, and do inherit the Virtues, and Vices of their Pa∣rents. We may also make a question concerning each particular, whether that which confers the Ferti∣lity, be ingenerated, or comes from without? Namely, whether it be transferred from the Egge to the Chicken; from the Hen to the Egge, and from the Cock to the Hen. For it seemes to be a thing ex Traduce; namely, which is transferred from the Cock to the Hen; and from Her to the Egge, the Womb, and the Ovary: From the Seed to the Plant, and back again from the Plant to the Seed. For this is common to all things that are perpetuated by Generation; namely, that their first rise should result from Seed. Now the Seed, the Conception, and the Egge are all of one and the same kinde, and that which renders these Fruitful, is in all of them the same thing, or some∣thing of a like nature; and that is some divine thing, and hath an analogy to the Heavens, to Art, Intellect, and Providence. As is plain by the won∣derful operations, artifice and counsel of those creatures, in whom nothing is constituted in vain, rashly, or by chance, but all for some Good, and to some End. We shall hereafter be more ample, concerning the Universal Speculation, and know∣ledge of this thing: Having already spoken as far as occasion hath presented it self to discourse of it by the by, in order to the Hen-Egge. Name∣ly, how many things is that thing in, which brings Fecundity? and how is it in them? whether as an Accident, as either an Affection, a Habit, a Power,
or a Faculty? or as a Forme, and a Substance or as a thing Contained in a thing Containing or as a thing reserved in some peculiar part? For it is most certain, that the very Subventaneous egge is compleat in all parts as far as sense can discover, and yet it is Barren: and likewise, that the Uterus, and also the Hen are perfect, and so is the Cock; and yet they all were barren, were they deprived of that which conveys their Fecundity to them. All which we shall relate, after we have expound∣ed, What, and How, the two Principles, Male and Female, do confer to the Egge, and to Generati∣on; and likewise in what manner they may both be called the Efficient Causes and Parents of the egge. That the Egge doth not proceed from the Cock and Henne, after that manner which Aristotle would designe. EXERCIT. XXXI. IT is most certain, that the Fertile Egge cannot be made, but by both Cock and Hen: and yet not in that fashion as Aristotle thought, as if for∣sooth, the Cock alone were the prime Efficient, and the Hen did contribute nothing but the Stuff, or Materials. For I am not of his mind, where he saith: When the Seed of the Male enters into the Womb of the de gen. an. l. 1. c. 4.
Female, it doth reduce the purest part of the Excre∣ment into a consistence: and a litle after. But when the excrement of the Female is in the Womb, it is made by the Geniture of the Male, like to congulated Milke. For that Coagulum is Milke conteining vital Heat, which carrieth parts that are alike, the same way to∣gether, uniting, and joyning them. Now the Geniture eanes it self just so towards the Menstrua, or excre∣ment. For the nature of the Menstrua and of Milk is the same. Therefore the parts being gathered toge∣ther, the corpulent humour is discarded, and upon the refaction of the more earthy part, the Membranes re∣sult to encompass the whole; and this upon necessity, and to some intent and use besides. And these things proceed in the same manner, as well in all Oviparous, as Viviparous Animals. But the matter is much otherwise, in the gene∣ration of the Egge. For the Seed (or Geniture rather) proceeding from the Male in Coition, can by no means enter the Womb. Nor hath the Hen after Conception, any excrementitious substance, or purer part of any such substance, or any Blood at all in the Cavity of the Womb, which might re∣ceive perfection from the Geniture of the Male. Nor are the Parts of the Egge (namely the mem∣branes and the Liquors) procured by any kind of Coagulation; nor is there found any thing like Coagulated Milk, as is clear and evident out of what hath passed. And hence it follows, that neither the Conception (out of which the Animal springs, as out of Fertile Seed) is after that man∣ner as Aristotle imagined: For the Conception is after the same manner in Viviparous, as the Egge is produced in Oviparous creatures: as himselfe confesses, and shall anon appear in some of our Observations. For it is a certain truth, that the
Egge, be it barren, or fertile, is made and formed by the Hen alone: onely the fertility indeed is derived from the Cock. I positively affirme, that the Cock conferres neither Matter nor Form to the Egge; but onely that thing by which the Egge is Fertile, and made fit and capable to produce a Chicken. And this Faculty the Cock imparts by his Geniture, discharged in Coition; not onely to the Egge which is then begun, or already made, but to the Womb also, and the Ovary, and likewise to the Hen her self: and that after such a manner, that the egges which are yet to come (of which there is now no particle in being either in the O∣vary, or any other part of the Body) shall have the happinesse to be fruitful by it. Nor after that manner which Physiti∣ans phansie. EXER. XXXII. THe Conception according to the opinion of Phy∣sitians is thus: In Coition the Male and Fe∣male being both delighted, do eject their Geniture, or Seed into the Cavity of the Womb; and there their united stock or contribution is mingled together; obtaining from both the potentiality of Matter, and the activity or force of the Efficient cause. And that so it comes to passe, as the Geniture of this or that Parent shall get the upper hand, the concep∣tion proves either Male or Female. And they far∣ther suppose, that immediately after Coition (the
Active and Passive ingredients now cooperating to∣gether) something of the Conception is put in and, and begun. They still affirming, contrary to those who side with Aristotle, that the Male is no more the Effici∣ent cause of Generation, then the Female, but some∣thing compounded of them both: & likewise, that neither the Menstruous Blood, nor the purest part of it; but the Sperm it self is the first Matter of the Conception: and upon this ground, they call the first ground-works, or first parts of the Conce∣ption, Spermatical Parts; which are afterwards to be nourished and supplied by Blood. But the thing is plain, that this also is not the manner, by which the egge is produced by the Cock and Henne. For the Hen doth emit no Seed at all in Coition, out of which the egge may bee framed: nay more then this, there is no part of her Seed to be any where found: for she is quite destitute of all parts necessary to the Generation of Seed; namely, of Testicles, and Spermatical Vessels. For though the Hen hath an Efficient power toge∣ther with the Cock, (as appears by our former dis∣course) and that power which renders the egge fer∣tile, be in some sort a mixt power; yet this pro∣ceeds not from the over-ruling force of the Geni∣tures, or from the manner of their mixture: for it is very certain (and Fabricius confesses it) that the Cocks Seed enters not into the Cavity of the Womb: nor is there any particle of the egge made in the Womb presently upon Coition; though Aristotle ge∣nerally affirms there is, (saying, that some part of the Conception doth forthwith insue) Nay I shall de∣monstrate hereafter, that this commixture of Seeds doth never obtain in any Animal whatsoever; and that presently after Coition (though it succeed and
be fruitful) there is no particle of Seed, or Blood or of any begun or attempted Conception, real∣ly in the Womb, or to be found there. Nor is there in truth any thing to be discerned, in the Concep∣tion or Egge, that may any ways argue the Seed the Male to be conteined, or mingled in it. The Common people indeed do falsly conceive, that the Chalazae are the Cocks Seed: and I much won∣der, that since there are two of them (in each ex∣tremity of the egge, one,) that no man hath hither to fondly pronounced, that the one was the Cock, and the other the Hens Seed. But this popular error is soon blown over; for the Chalazae are a like manner found, both in the Subventaneous, and Fertile egge. That both the Male and Female, are the Efficients of Generation. EXERCIT. XXXIII. THe Physitians do rightly maintain against the Aristotelians, that both Sexes participate  the Efficient power; because that which is gene∣rated, is a thing compounded of them both: for it is mixt of them both, in the figure and similitude of the Body, and in the Species too; as sup∣pose it a thing mixt between a Partridge-Cock, and a Dunghil-Hen. And it is very consonant to reason, for a man to conceive, that those are the Efficient causes of a Conception, whose com-m∣ture that which is produced, doth represent and express.
And this is Aristotles opinion. In some creatures, saith he, it is apparent that, that which generates is Metaphys. l. 7. c. 8. such like, as that which is generated: and yet not the ame, not that very numerical thing, but of the same Species, as in natural productions. For a Man begets  man, unless something befal praeturnatural; as when  Horse begets a Mule, and the like. For that which is common to a Horse and an Ass, is not called Propin∣quissimum genus, the Next Kind: and yet they two may be commixed in one, for such is a Mule. And in the same place he saith; The Generant is sufficient to generate, and be the cause of the existence of the Spe∣cies in the matter: but such a Species being now in such particular flesh and Bones, is now several persons, is Callias, and Socrates are. Wherefore since such an entire forme, as namely of a Mule, is mixt of both; namely, Horse and Asse: the Horse alone is not sufficient to produce this form of a Mule in the Matter; but as the whole entire form is mixt, so another efficient cause must be conferred and joyned to it from the Asse. That therefore that doth produce a Mule mixed of both, must be it self adequate, and mixed too, if it be Univocal. As for example. This Man and that Woman, do beget this Socrates; not under the ca∣pacity of being both of them Homines, Men, and so are of one and the same species; but by reason, that this particular Man, and that particular Wo∣man, are of humane kind, composed of this and that particular flesh, and bones: of both which since socrates is a kind of Mixture, and is mingled of them both; that of which Socrates is made, must needs be as it were a compounded Univocal mixt ing; that is to say, the mixt Efficient of a mixt Effect. And therefore the Male and Female, are not generative apart, but as they are united in
Coition, and made, as it were, one entire Animals and thence from them both, as from one, the true efficient immediate cause of the Conception doth re∣sult, and is deduced. The Physitians also, while they, minding onely what befalls humane kind, give resolutions at large concerning Generation in general; and it seeming probable to them, that the Geniture flowing in Coition from both Parents, is the true Sperme or Seed, proportionable to the Seed of Plants; doe not without reason constitute that mixture which is the next efficient cause of the future Foetus, out of the mixture of the Seed of both Parents: and there∣fore affirme, that such a mixt body is conteined in the Womb presently upon Coition, and is the first Conception. But our precedent History makes it ap∣pear, that the thing is clean otherwise in an Egge (which is a true Conception.) Concerning the Matter of the Egge, contrary to Physitians and A∣ristotelians. EXERCIT. XXXIV. THat which Physitians deny in opposition to the Aristotelians, namely that the Blood is the First Matter of the Conception, doth evidently appear out of the Generation of the Egge. For there is no Blood at all conteined in the Womb of the Hen, either in Coition, or before, or after it:
Nor are the Rudiments of the Egge sanguine, but white. And many living Creatures conceive, in whose Genitals (if you open them nimbly) not one drop of Blood is to be seen. But while they contend, that the Mothers Blood is the Nutriment of the Foetus in the Womb, espe∣cially of the Partes Sanguineae, the bloody parts (as they call them) and that the Foetus at first, as if it were a part of the Mother, is sustained by her blood, and quickened by her spirits: in so much that the Heart beats not, and the Liver san∣guifies not; nor any part of the foetus doth exe∣cute any publick function; but all of them make Holy-day and lie idle; in this Experience it selfe confutes them. For the Chicken in the egge en∣joyes his own Blood, which is bred of the liquors contained within the egge; and his Heart hath its motion from the very beginning: and he borrow∣th nothing, either blood, or spirits, from the Hen, towards the Constitution either of the Sanguineous parts, or Plumes; as those that strictly observe it may plainly perceive. And I make no question, fully to demonstrate in my succeeding Observati∣ons, that the foetus of Viviparous creatures, while they are yet imprisoned in the Womb, are no way sustained by the Mothers blood, nor vegetated by her spirits, but do rejoice in their own Soules and indowments, (as the Chicken uses to do in the egg) and sate themselves from their owne stocke of Blood. But as for that which concerns the Matter of the foetus, arising from Male and Female, and that so magnified manner of Generation, so much coun∣tenanced by the confident Schools (namely, that the Conception is rendered prolifical from the com∣sture of the Genitures, and their mutual Action
and Passion) as also those other Heresies of their concerning the Seed of Females, and concerning the division of Parts into Spermatical, and Sangui∣neous; many, and those very remarkable and ex∣cellent observations, which shall be treated  hereafter, have compelled me to dissent from them. I shall at present say onely this, that I ex∣treamly wonder, how Physitians (especially such as are skilfull Anatomists) should prop up their o∣pinion upon two arguments, as most invincible  when those very arguments, if rightly understood  do make against them rather. As for Instance. From that Concussion, Solution and Profusion of Humour (which befalls Women many times with delight, in Coition) they conclude that all Women do emit a Semen in Coition, and that that Semen is necessary to Generation. Where∣as, to passe by this reply, namely, that the Female of all Animals, nay all Women have not such a Profusion; and that it is no way necessary that th Conception must be frustrate without it: (for  know many Women that are Mothers without it, and some also, which upon having it, were in∣deed much affected with enjoyment, but came much short of their former fruitfulnesse: Besides infinite and innumerable examples of Women, wh though they receive much satisfaction by their Husbands, do yet emit nothing, but do conceive how ever) But I most admire that those, who com this Emission necessary to Propágation, did not mind how that humour is ejected clean out, and lost for the most part neer the Clitoris, and out of the Secrets; but is seldom admitted into them and never into the Uterus, that so it may be come mixt with the Sperma of the Male; and that it also of an Ichorous, and Serous consistence,
is, and not so Compact and Unctuous as  Geniture, which the very touch denoteth. Now wherefore should that be excluded out of , which is of so great consequence within?  that humour, under pretence of departure, thrown out to the utmost approaches of the U∣, that so it may be recalled again with the ter bounty and favour? Another Argument they erect upon the Sperma∣tical Organs of Women; namely, the Testiculi, and  Spermatical preparing, and leading Vessels, which  supposed to conduce to the Generation of the . But for my part I wonder much, how they fan∣ that so elaborate, concocted, and quickening men, can arise from so imperfect and obscure , so that, that of theirs (when the controver∣sie concerning the preeminence and overruling wer is in debate; namely, whether the Males or eirs commands in chief, and which of the two  to be reputed the Efficient, or Agent, or the Mat∣, or Patient) should exceed the Males in power, , and generative ability; and should sub∣ject the Males seed under it, inforcing it to submit it self to supply the place of the Material Cause, notwithstanding it is digested by so quick & active heat, refined in such variety of Vessels, and dar∣ing it self with so much activity. But of these more hereafter. In the mean time it is most certain, that the hen-egge is generated by no such conjugal Profu∣: though the Mother after recreation (as one ished with delight) shakes her feathers for Ioy, nd as if she grew proud from the Boone she recei∣ved, composeth and rectifieth all her extravagant : like one that adored the deity for the
grand benediction of multiplying issues. Tha Pigeon (especially that kind of Pigeon which  transported hither out of Africa) expresseth won∣derful content from the enioyment of her Male, leaping, and spreading her taile, and sweeping the low earth with the bristles of it, and them combing and rectifying her Plumes with her Bill; as though she deemed nothing comparable to the blessing of fertility. We have said before, that the first matter of the Egge is not formed of Blood, as Aristotle thought; nor yet as the Physitians conjecture, out of the commixture of the Males and Females Geniture. But from whence we do derive it, is partly already shewen in our History, and shall be more largely explained hereafter, when we treat in generall of the matter which doth constitute every foe∣tus. How far the Henne is an Efficient Cause in the Generation of the Egge, according to Aristotle: and why the assistance of the Male is required. EXER. XXXV. WE have already proved the Cock and Henne to be the two Principles of Generation in re∣gard of the Egge, though we are otherwise p swaded of the manner how it comes to passe,
Aristotle and Physitians are. For we have made it manifest out of the generation of the Egge, that the Hen as well as the Cock is an efficient cause, and hath in her a principle from whence the mutation suceeds, and also a constituting faculty: though  Coition, neither the Cock doth confer matter to e Egge, nor doth any profusion of seed result om the Hen, by which the Egg should arise. It  therefore evident, that nature (amongst some Animals at least) did not therefore institute a di∣stinction of Sexes; that the one (as an Agent) should contribute the form, and the other (as the Patient) the matter, as Aristotle did conceive: nor that a semen should result from both in coition, that about of the mixture of them, a Conception, or Egg should be framed, as Physitians imagine. Now since these two opinions doe comprehend the whole Legend of Antiquity, concerning the causes and principles of Generation: it appears that all men were hitherto ignorant of the reason, doth why the female doth not generate alone by her selfe (as Plants doe) but requires the associ∣tion of the male: and also how the conception, or gge is procreated both by male and female thus enjoyned: and likewise in what either of them enduce to the work, and to what end and pur∣pose coition was instituted. Aristotle, contrary to his own universal Hypo∣stasis (namely, That the male is the Agent, and the female only for the matters sake) perceiving the egg  proceed from the Hen without any help of the ack at all, was inforced to subscribe, that the fe∣male also is an efficient cause: and that the Egge, hen it is excluded, doth conserve, nourish, and ment it selfe, and produce a foetus out of it : (as the egges, or spawn of fishes doe) and
therefore he concludes, that there is also a soule even in a subventaneous, barren egg. And how far forth the Female is an Efficient, and also a subven∣taneous egge informed by a soule, he attempts to explain, where he saith. Subventaneous eggs ad∣mit Generation as far as they may; but that they de gen. an. l. 3. c. 7. should be compleated to the very fecundity of an A∣nimal, is quite impossible; for to that a sensitive soule is required. But even females, and all things that live at all do obtain the vegetative faculty of the soul, as hath bin often repeated. And therefore this bar∣ren egg considered as the conception of a Plant, is com∣pleat, but considered as an Animals, it is incompleat. By which words he seems to consent, that the Ve∣getative soule is also in the very subventaneous egge, because that soule is in all living things; now an egge doth live. He also allowes the Hen a crea∣ting Prerogative, and a power of inducing a Ve∣getative soule: because all females have that pri∣viledge: and therefore a subventaneous egge con∣sidered under the capacity of a Plant, and living as that doth, is stiled a perfect conception, but un∣der the rank of Animals, an imperfect one. A if the male were no whit requisite to the being of the perfect conception or egge, but onely that, out of that egg an Animal might proceed: Not to the complement of the egge, in order to any perquisite relating to its own perfection (for the conceptions of plants themselves are in this sense compleat) but that it may be endowed with a Animal principle. So then, the Egg is made by the Hen, but is made prolifical by the Cock. Aristatle in the same place goes on: In all the Genealogy  Birds, there is a male and a female; so that a Hen may make her conception perfect, as a Plant, though is be unalterod by coition: but as an Animal, she can∣not
perfect it; nor can she impower it to produce any other thing out of it. Nor is it rendred as the fruit of a Plant simply, nor as of an Animal, by coition. He sreaks of a subventaneous egg: and addes further: But those eggs which are conceived by coition, and are  discovered to have obtained some portion of the White, they becom fruitful by virtue of that Cock who was first concerned in coition; for they are now furni∣shed with both Principles. Whereby he seems to confess, that the Female also is an Efficient in Generation, or hath a genera∣tive power; because every female hath a vegetative ule: now generation is a faculty of the vegeta∣tive soule. And upon this ground, when he pro∣pounds the difference between the male and fe∣male, he even there owns them to be Generative : for he saith, We call that animal the male, which begets or generates in another, and that the female, which generates in it self. And therefore according to Him, both doe Generate; and as have is in both a vegetative soul, so is there in both Generative power. But how these differ, hath been ved before in the History of the Egge. Name∣ the Hen, alone by her self, without any assist∣ance of the Cock, Generates a subventaneous egg, (as  do from themselves produce a fruit) but she  not produce a fortile egge, with out either  antecedent, or subsequent Coition of the Cock. the female doth generate, but it is only in some ; and the males coition is required, that that rative faculty should be perfected in the fe∣male: that so she may not only bring forth an , but such an egge that may produce a chicken.  for this defect in the females generation, the  seems to have been created (as shall here∣in appeare) that so what the female cannot
compleat alone, (namely the seed, or fertile egge) that the male should supply by coition; wherein he doth impart that power either to the Hen, or the Egge. A perfect Henne-egge hath two Colours. EXERCIT. XXXVI. ALl eggs therefore are not perfect eggs; but some are reputed imperfect, because they have not yet attained their just magnitude, which they afterwards doe receive abroad: And others, be∣because they are yet improlifical, and afterward doe borrow a prolifical power from without; as Fishes eggs, or the spawn of fishes. Other eggs al∣so, are by Aristotle counted imperfect, because they are of one colour onely; but those that are of two colours, perfect, as being constituted of a Yolk and White: which are conceived to be more di∣stinct, better concocted, and endowed with more heat. And therefore those that are called Ov Centenina, which Fabricius conceits to be onely constituted of the Reliques and Remainders of pag. 10. the White, are only of one colour, and rep imperfect, because of the defect of their heat, and their own imbecillity. But amongst all the egg that are, there is none more perfect then the Hen, which is still produced perfect, and adorned with
all its liquors and accoutrements, and of a conve∣nient and just magnitude. Now Aristotle gives this reason why it comes to De gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. pass that some Eggs are of two colours, and others of one only: because, saith He, in hotter Animals those things out of which the rudiments of Generation, and those out of which the Aliment is derived, are always distinct and apart: and of them one is white, and the other yellow. As if the Chicken took its life from the White, and were onely fed by the Yolk. And in the same place he saith. That part of it which is hot, doth more resemble the complexion of the parts that are to be made; but that which is the more ter∣rene part, affords onely supply to the body, and keeps at greater distance from it. And therefore in eggs that have two colours, the Animal assumes its begin∣ning from the White. For the Animal rudiment is in the White, and the nourishment is derived from the Yolk. Therefore we see his opinion is, that the foresaid Liquors are distinct, and that eggs are produced party-coloured. And these Assertions of his, are partly true, and partly false. For it is false, that the Chicken is made out of the White, and fed by the Yolk. For by our History of the Fabrick of the Chicken, both from the dissemination of the Umbilical Ves∣sels, and the distribution of their propagations, which without all question doe serve for the at∣traction of the Aliment, it is most manifest that both the constituting matter and the Aliment, are from the first original supplied both from the yolk and white; for some part of both these liquors doth melt and dissolve. And also the Macula, by whose first dilatation the Colliquamentum is made, which is also stiled by us the Oculus, or Eye of the
Egge, is plainly seen to be imprinted into the  of the Yolk. And yet for all this, the distinction of the egg into the yolk & white doth seem to be very necessa∣ry: because those two Liquors, as they are with∣out all doubt of a diverse nature, so doe they serve to a diverse use. And that is the reason why they are distinct in every perfect egg; one of them being the Aliment which is next at hand, and the other, that which is farther off: with the one the foetus is sustained at its first formation, with the other in succeeding time. For it is most unque∣stionable (as Fabricius affirmes truly, and we al∣so shall explain anon) that both the Yolk and White are the Aliment of the chicken, and th the White is first spent. Wherefore I agree with Aristotle against the Physitians, that the White is the most sincere, most concocted, and elaborate part of the Egge: and therefore as being the bet∣ter part, it encompasseth the whole circumference of the egge, which is yet in the Wombe, whilest the Yolke as the more terrestrial part doth reside in the Center. For the White seemes to containe  plenteous animal heat in it, and therefore to be the neerer and first nourishment. And so also upon the same account, the exteriour part of the White, seems to be more simple, and better con∣cocted, then the interiour. In that Physitians affirme, that the Yolke is the hotter part of the egge, and most nourishing, I conceive they understand it, in relation to us, as it is become our nourishment, not as if it doth sup∣ply more congruous aliment to the chicken in the Egge. And this appeares out of our History of the Fabrick of the Chicken: which doth first
upon and devoure the thinner part of the white, be∣fore the grosser: as if it were more proper diet, and did more easily submit to transmutation into the substance of the future foetus. And therefore the yolk seems to be a remoter and more differred en∣tertainment then the white; for all the white is quite and clean spent, before any notable invasion is made upon the yolk. Nay, the yolk is found in the Abdomen of the Chicken, even after his exclusi∣on, as if it were reserved for the Infant-chicken in∣stead of Milk. The two-coloured egges therefore are most per∣fect, as being more distinct and wrought up by a more vigorous heat. For since there ought to be treasured in the egge not onely the matter of the Chicken, but his first feeding too: that which is provided for a perfect animal, ought it self to be perfect too; and such is that egge which consists of two distinct complexioned parts: whereof the one is the former, and more simple, and therefore of gentler digestion; the other the latter, or more re∣mote, and therefore translated into the substance of the Chicken with more difficulty; (now the yolk and white are thus different amongst themselves) and therefore Perfect egges are Party-coloured, compounded of a white and yolk: as containing and storing up in them several provisions of hard∣er or more friendly digestion, according to the se∣veral age and ability of the Chicken.
How the Egge is supplied with its White. EXER. XXXVII. IT appears by our History that the primordia of the eggs in the Ovary are wondrous litle, resem∣bling small whelks, and lesse then the seed of Mil∣let, being full of a white watry moisture: and that these Papulae, or whelks do at length shoot up into yolks, and that those yolks are at last invested and cloathed with a white. Aristotle seemes to be of opinion, that the white is generated out of the yolk by way of Separation. Let us read his words: The Sex, saith he, is not the de gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. cause of the party-colours, as if the white did proceed from the Male, and the yolk from the Female; but both are derived from the female or Hen. But one is hot, and the other cold. And in those creatures that have good store of heat, they are distinguished from one another; but where that heat is fainter, they are not distinguish∣ed. And for that reason the conceptions of such Ani∣mals are of one onely colour, as is said. Now the Males seed onely doth constitute the egge: and therefore at first the conception of all Birds is white, and small, but in process of time, it is all yellow, because now a larger quantity of blood is admixed; and lastly, the heat a∣bating, the whiter part environs it round, as being a humor equally tempered on all sides. For the white part of the egge is naturally moist, containing in it an ani∣mal warmth, and therefore it is placed about the egge, and the yellow earthy part remains within. But Fabricius conceives, The White of the Egge to grow to the yolk by a juxt aposition meerly. For while, pag. 12.
saith he, the yolk rowleth through the second Uterus, and falls down by degrees, it doth by degrees gather to  a part of the White, which is purposely generated in the Uterus, that it may cleave to the yolk; untill the lke having now passed the intervening or middle ires, and arriving at the last of all; it is together with the White encompassed with the membranes also, and thou assumes a shell. He conceits therefore, that the egge attaines its increase in a twofold manner; partly by the Veines, as it is with the yolke, and partly by an additional accession or apposition, as it is with the White. And this perhaps did induce him to be of that judgement; namely, because the White being boyled hard, doth easily part and distinguish into kes, whereof the one lyes above the other. But his also doth befall the yolk not yet departed from the Ovary, if it be hard boyled as the former. And therefore being otherwise instructed by Experi∣ence, I rather join in opinion with Aristotle; for the White is not adjoined (as Fabricius would ave it) but bred also, and furnisht with the Chalazae, and distinguished by several membranes, and divided into two white liquors: and all this, by the same vegetative soul, by whose industry the Egge it self is distinguished into two liquors, (a yolk and a white.) For every part of the Egge is formed and constituted by the same faculty which frames the whole Egge. Nor is it true, that the yolk is first made, and then the white adjoyned to it. For, what wee see in the Ovary, is not the yolke of an egge, but rather some compound, comprehend∣ing both liquors mixed together. It resembles the yolk indeed in complexion, but the white in consi∣dence: for being boyled hard, it is not friable (as the yolk is) but concrete and glutinous, and consi∣sting of several flakes, as the White, and hath as it
were a white Papula, or whelk in the . Aristotle seems to erect this separation from  Ibid. diverse nature of the yolk and white. For, saith  If you cast diverse egges into a bason, or such like  sel, and prepare them over a Chafin-dish of coals in  sort, that the force of the fire be not nimbler the  distinction of the eggs; the same thing will befall all the heap of eggs, as happens to every particular eggs namely all the yolks will gather and assemble themselves into the middle, and the Whites get round about th. And this I have often experimented; and, what ever will, may try it: provided, he shake the y and whites together, and with a piece of butter  gest them temperately into a Cake, having min∣gled them between two dishes, placed over a Cha∣fin-dish of coales, or in an Oven; for he shall pl∣ly see the whites cover the yolks which are assem∣bled at the bottom. What the Cock and Henne do conferr to the Generation of the Egge. EXER. XXXVIII. BOth Cock and Hen are to be reputed the Chi∣kens Parents; for both of them are necessry principles of the Egge, and both alike Efficient causes. For the Egge it self is the Henns work, a the Fertility the Cocks. Both are therefore Instru∣ments of the plastick virtue, by whose meanes th species is continued to the world. But since in some Animal species (as if the
were a useless thing, and the Female alone did ffice to the perpetuity of the species) there are no Males to be found at all, but the whole race is fe∣male, as in some species there are Males onely, and no Females at all to be found; for they do all by an emission of something out of them into the d, the earth, or water, progenerate, and preserve their species: Nature seemes in these and the like creatures to have satisfied her selfe with one sex only, using that alone (as an instrument) for pro∣creation. And now again some other creatures have a seed provided for them, casually as it were, without any distinction of sex at all; namely those crea∣tures whose Birth is spontaneous. For as some things Arist. phys. l. 1. c. 1. are the productions of art, and the self same things are the issues of chance too, as Health, for one: So like∣wise some kinde of Animal seed is not simply pro∣duced from an univocal Agent (as a Man from a Man) but onely in some sort univocal; (namely in all those creatures whose extract and matter out of which they spring, is casual in relation to them, and yet undergoes a mutation of it selfe, as the seed doth) namely, Those Animals that are not produced by coition, but are born of their own ac∣cord, are produced from such an original as Insects have, which breed a worm. For as some Artificers de gen. an. l. 3. c. 9. work with their bare hands, but others again use instruments in all their operations; and the better sort and more excellent Arts do imploy instru∣ments of several figure and magnitude, to the exe∣cution of several, and especially of the more curi∣ous and subtile Operations: (for the more eminent and more laborious works, are made for the most part of several motions, and doe require several subordinate productions and ends; & in this thing,
as in all other, Art is Natures Ape, and Mimick) so in like manner Nature doth of necessity set a work more instruments, and those too of divers fa∣culties and abilities, in the production of the more perfect, and more excellent Animals. For the Sun, or the Heavens (or what ever else is understood to be a common and general Father in the producti∣on of living creatures) do produce some things by themselves, by chance, and as it were without im∣ploying any intermediate Instrument, by an equi∣vocal generation, and yet beget some onely by an univocal procreation: namely all those, that are begotten by some other of the same kinde, which doth contribute both Matter and Form to them. And thus in the Generation of the most perfect Ani∣mals, where these Principles are distinguished, and these seeds of the Animals are distinct: the Male and Female are the two necessary requisite Instru∣ments to the production. And in this manner is our Hen-egg produced from the Cock and Hen. The Henne generates in her self, and therefore communicates place, materialls, nourishment, and cherishing to the conception; but the Cock conveighs fecundity: For the Male, saith Aristotle, doth ever Gen. an. l. 2. c. 3. complete the generation, and causeth a sensitive soul to be introduced, and from an egge creates an Animal. And therefore proper Organs for both faculties are dispersed among the Cocks and Hens. Namely in the Hen, all the Genital parts are commodious for reception, and containing; and in the Cock for transferring and immission, or preparing of that thing which doth conveigh fecundity to the Henne, he being one that generates in another. Now, having made strict discovery, by Anato∣mical dissection, of the parts sacred to Generation, we well know, what both Male and Female doe
conferre to it. For the knowledge of the Instruments doth lead in a straight line, to their functions and uses. Some things worthy observation con∣cerning the Cock. EXERCIT. XXXIX. THe cock (as we have shewed you) is the Prima∣ry Efficient of the perfect or fertile egge, and the main cause of Generation. For were it not for the cock, a chicken could never spring from the Egge; nor the Egge it self have any being in many Oviparous creatures. And therefore we must make farther search concerning the Action and use of the cock, namely what advantage he brings to the egge, and the chicken, as well by Coition, as other of∣fices. It is evident that the cock (though, as I suppose, he wants a Yard) doth emit his Geniture, com∣monly called Seed, as may be collected from his Genital Parts; for the Testicles are furnished with it, and there is great abundance of it discoverable in the long and ample Leading Vessels. But whe∣ther it leap out, capering, and frothy by the acti∣vity of the spirits, and at several ejections (as in hotter Viviparous creatures) I am not yet able to resolve. But because I can finde no Vesicles con∣taining the Geniture, by which it should be fer∣mented, and dart forth, heightned by the spirits into a Spuma, or froth: and also finding no Yard
through whose narrower channel it being protru∣ded, it might leap, and result, verberating the Interiours of the Hen, especially seeing coition in Cocks so soon over; I rather believe, that there is onely a light tincture of seminal humour, such as doth onely moisten the Orifice of the Pudenda; and that the seed is speedily dislodged without a∣ny sprightly exilition: so that, what other Ani∣mals do ejaculate by several reverberations at one and the same Inition, Birds (which do not long insist upon venereal undertakings) do expedite by many repeated Coitions. For those creatures that dwell long in venereal offices, do make but feldom repetitions: and such, among Birds, are the Swan, and the Ostrich: Because the Cock there∣fore cannot stay long in his performances, he doth execute that at several returnes, which other creatures do at several impulses. And though he neither have Glans, nor Ponis, yet the extremity of the deferent Vessels growing turgent by spirits (in Coition) doth extuberate after the manner of a Glans, by which he doth compress the Orifice of the Uterus of the Henne, it being bared and expo∣sed by the apertion of the Fundament; and so be∣dewing it with genital moisture, he stands in no need of a Yard for the immission of his Geni∣ture. Now, we have shewed you, that the Cocks Seed is of so great vertue, that it doth render not the Uterus onely, but the Egge in the Uterus, the Pa∣pula in the Ovary, and lastly the whole Hen her self, and all the Rudiments of the Eggs, either al∣ready in being, or to be produced hereafter, fertile and Prolifical. And therefore Fabricius rightly observed, that store of Geniture was intrusted to the Testicles, and
deferent Vessels of the Cock: not that the Hen stands want of much of it to fructifie each single egge; at that one Cock may approve himself sufficient  his severall Concubines, and repeated perfor∣mances. Now the brevity and rectitude of the Cocks sper∣matical Vessels do conduce to the nimbler discharge of the Seed: for that which travels through long and perplexed Meanders, makes slower passage, and needs a more copious impulsive spirit to quick∣ its Exit. Amongst the Males, none more jovial, none more haughty, nor of stiffer garbe, nor more ef∣fectual in concocting his food, then the Cock, a great part of whose Aliment is transformed into eniture; and therefore Polygamy is convenient for him, as ten or twelve obedient Hens. For in some species of Animals, one single Male can treat boudance of Females, as we may see Stags, Bucks, and several Cattel: and there are others againe there the lusty Female is not satisfied by several Males; as the Bitch, and the Wolf; upon which ore Meretrices Lupae dicuntur, Prostitutes are cal∣led Wolves, and Brothel-houses Lupanaria. And gain some Creatures are more chast, and reserve, s it were, a Conjugal integrity: so that one Male keeps faith with one Female, and both pro∣d vertuously to propagate their kind. For ce Nature requires, that the Male should supply the defects of the Female in Generation, and that  alone is not sufficient to sustain, cherish, and defend her issue, the Male is added as a Consort o her, who should joyn in the task of genera∣ting, and nurturing the Young. Thus the Par∣tridges enjoy a Conjugal Life, and because their  cannot hatch so many egges at once, nor at∣tend
the education when the Young are excluded they are reported to build each of them a N. And so the cock-Pigeon takes his turnes of Incuba∣tion, and joynes in the erection and fabrick of hi nest, and likewise in laying in provision for he off-spring. And so in like manner you may dis∣cover many examples of a Conjugal life among bruit beasts, of which more hereafter. But those Males that serve many Females (a the cock) their Testicles are much lined with Se∣minal moisture, and they are provided with long and large deferent Vessels. And at that time, and age that the cluster in the Ovary begins to ripen and become mature, and stands now in need of Fructifying, that the Papulae may be perfected in¦to Egges, the cocks seed begins to encrease, and hi Testicles grow turgent and tumorous, and are also seated in the same place (namely neer the Dia∣phragma) into which they instil fertility. And this is evident in fishes, birds, and all other Ovipa∣rous creatures, whose males are all replenished with seed, at the same time, and place, whereat their females do conceive their egges. And therefore all those parts of the Hen which are designed to Generation, namely, the Ovary, In∣fundibulum, the process of the Womb, and the Womb it self, and the Privities: and also the scituation, fa∣brick, quantity, and Temper of all these, and what soever else relates thereto: they are all inservient, and handmaids either to the procreation of the Egge, or to its Augmentation, or else to Coition, and fertility received from the Male, or to the foetus: to which they conduce either necessarily and principally, or as a Causa sine qua non, or some way or other to the better being. For there is nothing made either vain or rash in
all the operations of Nature. So likewise all the Genital parts in the Cock are contrived for prepa∣ring or concealing, or else transmitting the geniture into the Hen. But such males as are so vigorous, that they can supply many females, these do much exceed heir females in their growth, and stature, as also in their naments, courage, and weapons; which is not so eminent in those that are conjugal and chaster. For a cock-Partridge, Crow, or Pigeon, are not so much superiour and different from their consorts, as the Cock is from the Hen, or the Stag from his Hindes. And therefore the Cock, as he is well appoint∣ed in his weapons, brave in his plumes, haughty, ambitious, valiant, and a famous Duellist; so doth he also abound in Seed, and is swift in his chamber-offices, and of so unbounded a luxury, that (except he have his Seraglio for his concubines) e will tire out his wives by frequent invitations, nd compressions, and (as we have observed in the Pheasant, the Turkey-cock, and others) will cruel∣ly handle them, with unseasonable advancings, and molestations. I have seen Hens sometimes so tired and torn by the insolency and incivility of the insatiate Cock, that all their backs have been deplumed, and they themselves by deep ex∣erations piercing to the bare bone, have mise∣rably expired.
Of the Henne. EXER. XL. THere are two first Causes and Instruments of Generation, the Male and Female. For the Hen seems to be the Author of the Egge, as the Cock of the Fertility: and therefore by the coition of these two, that which renders the egge fruitful, is tradu∣ced from the Male into the Female, or generated in the Female by that coition. But what that is, is no less difficult to be known then to what it is communicated: namely, whe∣ther to the whole Henne, or to its Uterus, or to the Eggs already made, or else to all the Egges not begun in the Ovary, or to be begun hereafter? For it is probable, according to our former discourse and also by Fabricius his experiment, that a  coitions, and the commerce of the Henne with the Cocke for a few dayes, doth sufficiently fructifie her, or her womb at lest, for a whole year together. And I my self, informed by experience, can parth affirm the same thing; namely, that the twentieth egge layed by the Hen (after her divorce from th Cocke) hath been fruitfull, and prolifical. That a from the geniture of the Male-fishes scattered in  water, a great family of eggs is endowed with the lifical virtue; and as in Bitches, and Sowes, and al∣so other Animals, some few coitions have satisfie to the fertility of several foetuses: (insomuch the some think it an approved Maxim, that in case Bitch be oftner compressed by the dog then th or four times, it will wrong her fertility, and make her births degenerate most into females)
also the Cock by some few familiarities with the Hen, doth not only render the egge now being in he Ovary, but the entire Ovary, and Hen her self prolifical (as hath been often repeated.) Nay, what s more then this, and admirable indeed; In a cer∣in part of Persia (saith Aristotle) if you cut up a Hist. an. l. 6. c. 37 -Mouse, you shall finde even the young ones within , that are females, to be great with young themselves: being made mothers before they are born: as if he male did not onely fructifie his female, but all he females also of which she labours; as our Cock oth not only render his henne fruitful, but all he eggs also that she is to lay. Now this Physitians do confidently deny, who me the conceptions of Animals to be produced by the mixed geniture of both Sexes. And there∣e Fabricius, though he pronounce the Cocks seed ver to enter, nor to have any possibility of en∣ance pag. 38. 39. into the hollow of the womb, (where either  egge is made, or increased) and though he inly saw, the egges now newly begun in the Ovary, to be made fertile by the same coition, as ell as those egges which were already made;  particle of which could be made by the seed of t Cock; yet he will needs have the Cocks seed s if its presence and continuance were absolute∣ necessary) to be locked up for a whole year to∣gether in the pouch of a prolifical Hen, and there to  reserved in a blinde chink. Which perswasi∣ we have formerly rejected, and that because t cavity is indifferently found as well in a Cock, in a Hen; and also for that we could never scover such a standing pool of Geniture, either that cavity, or any other cranny in a Hen: but soon as the Geniture hath delivered her message, d performed her trust, by imprinting a prolifical
virtue in the Hen, it either retires back again, or is dissolved, and rarified into air, and so vanish∣eth. And though Galen, and all Physitians with Arist. de gen. an. l. 2. c. 3. him, do strongly oppose this dissolution of the Genture, yet having thoroughly considered the fabrick of the genital part by Anatom cal administra∣tions, and having likewise pondered other most invincible arguments, they must necessarily ac∣knowledge, that the seed of the male, as it is deri∣ved from the Testicles by the leading vessels, and contained in the spermatical vessels, is not prolifi∣cal, unless by the fervency of Coition, and desire, it become aerial, and rarified into a spume. For (wit∣ness Aristotle) it is not the corpulency of the seed, or Ibid. its fire, that renders it prolifical, or any quality like to those, but the spirit which is inclosed in the seed and spumous body, and the nature which is in that spirit, being answerable and like in proportion to the Element or substance of the Stars. Wherefore, though wee should indulge Fabricius in his opinion, that the Seed is reserved in that pouch; yet notwithstand∣ing, after the prolifical effervency, or the spirit is resolved, it would grow useless, and improlifical. And from hence may Physitians take notice, that the geniture of the male is not therefore the archi∣tect of the foetus, because the first cenception assumes its body from it, but because it is spirituous, and boyling, as being inspired with a fertile spirit, and turgent like a thing possessed. For otherwise A∣verrhoes his fable, of the woman that conceived in a Bath, might have some title to true story. But of these things more in their proper place. As therefore the Egg is made by the Hen, so i it also very likely that all the first conceptions (a shall be shown hereafter) doe assume both their Matter and Form from the female; and that also
after the males geniture is immitted, and now for some time quite departed and vanished away. For the Cock doth not conferre any fertility to the Hen or Eggs, by the bare emission of his geniture; but onely so farre forth as that geniture is prolifical, and impowered with a plastical virtue; that is to say, spiritous, operative, and proportionable to the sub∣tence of the Stars. The male therefore is no more to be prized as the chief principle of the conception, and foetus, by reason he can concoct and emit seed, then a female, which can produce an egg without his help. But he therefore rather claims prero∣gative, in that he impowers his seed with spirit, and divine efficacy; and so, that in a moment it can perform its affaires, and conveigh fertility. For as we see things immediately set on fire, and in∣famed by a spark struck from a flint, or by a flash of Lightning from a cloud; so the geniture of the male doth immediately affect the female with the touch, and transferres fruitfulness unto her, which doth not onely virtuate the eggs, but the womb al∣so, and the Hen herself, and all in an instant: for to combustible substance is sooner set on fire by the approach of the flames, then the Hen is made pregnant by the coition of the Cock. But what it is that is transferred from him to her, we shall have occasion to discover in its order, then we shall determine the matter more perspi∣cuously and in general. In the mean time we must take notice, that if it be derived from the soul (for it is most likely that whatsoever is fruitfull, the same is also animate, and we have said before, that an Egg in Aristoiles opinion is indowed with a vegetative soul, as also all the seed of Plants) that soul (at least the vege∣tative) must of necessity be ex traduce, and derived
in a Prolificall Conception as after it) as it is in the Generation of the Chicken out of the Egge, and just in that manner as Plants do spring from seeds of their own kind. For it doth not appear that the Male is required, to the intent that hee should be as an Agent, Operatour, or Efficient per se, nor that the Female, is required that she should contribute the matter; but both Male and Female are to be esteemed in some sort the Operatour, and Parent: and the foetus is procreated a mixt simi∣litude, and resemblance, as if it proceeded from both mixt together. Nor is it true which Aristo∣tle often affirms, and Physitians take for granted, namely, that presently after Coition, there is some∣thing to be found of the foetus, or conception, (as the Heart, or the Tres Bullae, or some other Prin∣ciple part) or something at least in the cavity of the Womb, as some Coagulum, or Spermatical mixt substance, or the like. But on the contrary, in case the Female prove fertile, and pregnant, it happens that the eggs, and conception in the most, and most perfect creatures, is first begun long af∣ter coition. And that the Female also is prolifical, before any thing of the conception be at all con∣tained in the Womb, many indications do con∣spire to ascertain, as shall be afterwards discovered in the History of Viviparous Animals: as the en∣largement of the Breasts, and the turgid swelling of the Womb, by which and other Symptomes we may perceive an Alteration in the whole Bo∣dy. But as for the Hen, though she have for the most part the Rudiments of eggs in her before coition, which are afterwards by the Tread made prolificall, and therefore she then hath something in her pre∣senly upon coition, or treading: yet when it falls
out so with her, that like other creatures, she hath nothing at hand ready in her Ovary, or hath al∣ready layd all the egges she formerly had there; she being afterwards trod (though some time pass between and intervene) as if she were then both Principles her self alone, or did possess the power of both Sexes, doth after the manner of Plants generate egges by her self, and those too (I speak it knowingly) not subventaneous, but pro∣lifical. For if you take all the eggs from under a Hen that is now sitting, in case that very Hen was a fruitful Hen in former time (though she have now already layd all the eggs she hath, and have not so much as one remaining in her Ovary) she wil lay again, and those eggs shal be fructifying, prolifical eggs, having the principles of both Sexes in them. In what respect the Henne may be cal∣led the Primum Efficiens, the first or Chiefe Efficient. And also of her issue. EXERCIT. XLI. WE have already pronounced the Hen, to be an Efficient Cause of Generation, or natures Instrument in that employment; (but she is not ab∣solutely, and per se; but by commission, and by vertue of the Male rendered prolifical.) But as the Male is by Aristotle counted the first principle of
Generation, suo merito, upon his own score, because the first Motus or progress towards Generation pro∣ceeds from him; so the Hen also may in some re∣spect be esteemed the first cause of Generation; in∣somuch as the male by the approach and presence of the female, like one possessed, is inflamed to Ve∣nery. The female-Fish (saith Pliny) at the time of Lib. 9. c. 50. coition will pursue and follow the Male, punching his belly with her head: And again, about the time of bringing forth, the Male will do the like to the Female. I my self have sometimes seen the male Fishes fol∣low the female that was ready to spawn, (just as Doggs doe a salt-Bitch) all in troops, that they might sprinckle her eggs so soon as she had laid them, lacte suo, with their milkey substance, or seed. But that is most sensible in wanton and las∣civious females, which will stirre up Cupids slow and drowsie fires in their tame males, and instill a silent love into them. And hence it is, that the Dunghill-cock, so soon as ever he sees his own spouse whom he hath mis∣sed never so litle a while, or any other stranger-Henn, being presently arrested at Cupids suite, he mounts her. And likewise when he is Victor in fight, though he return wounded and wearied from the battel, yet he still delights to ravish his captives wives. And that he may kindle this de∣clining spark of lust, which now lyes expiring in his breast, into a vigorous flame, with several ge∣sticulations, incitements, and Love-scenes (while he often crows, assembles his Henns, and now ap∣proaching circuits about them, and trailes his stiffe wings at their feet) he enticeth his Females, as by a spell or enchantment, to sport with him. Now these are the Cocks projects and arts: but sometimes the coyness and morosity of the Hen
doth not a litle conduce to rouse and heighten the males sleepy heat, and languishing appetite, to quicken and encourage his performance. But of these provocations and allurements, so farre as they serve to promote conception, we shall speak more anon. For if you carefully ponder Natures works, you shall finde none of them made in vain, but all directed to some end, and for some good. Almost all females are pleased & delighted with the act of coition, and rejoyce at their great bellies, but many groan at their delivery. But the thing is quite contrary in Hens, which in coition com∣plain, and hang back; but in laying, though the Egge be very great in comparison of their own bulk and the streights of the Uterine Orifice, and the Egge brings no furtherance at all to his own release, (as the Issues of Viviparous animals do) yet she brings forth without any pain, and still rejoi∣ces as soon as she hath layd, and raising a loud laughter, invites in the Cock to share in her tri∣umphs. But though there are many rudiments of eggs, of different magnitude, and degree, in the Hens O∣vary, insomuch that some are augmented and come to maturity before others, yet they all seem to be fructified alike, and receive the prolifical stamp together, by the Cocks coition. And though a good space of time pass away (namely, thirty dayes or more) before the Com∣mon-hen or Partridge-hen disburden all the Egges in their Ovary, yet when ever the Hen sits upon them, they bring forth all their chickens almost to∣gether, at the set time (namely, in the compass of twenty, or two and twenty daies) and they are all likewise no less complete, then if they had all ta∣ken
the same rise and original at the same instant of coition (as the Bitches whelps do.) And being upon this contemplation, while I consider how small the prolifical ground-works of Eggs are, namely litle whelks, and exudations, less then the seeds of Millet; and meditating the sta∣ture, magnanimity, and furniture of the Cock who is born from thence; I cannot but admire, that Nature should intrust such great abilities to so slender beginnings: and observe, how the Omni∣potent Creator is pleased to manifest his greatness most, in the smallest originals. For the Hen, and the Cock, that haughty and magnificent Animal, springs from a small and al∣most invisible whelk. A vast Tree rises from a litle Acron. Nay, from the smallest bud and point of an Acorn, how doth the Aged Oak display her spreading armes? how lofty a crest doth she exalt to heaven? and how deep a root doth she send down to fathom the earth? It is indeed (saith Pliny) an incomprehensible miracle, that a substance Lib. 17. c. 10. which defies the axe, that presses, undaunted at the hu∣gest weights, that masts patient of the largest sails, and ramms unbattered by the shock of Towers, and Bullwarks, should proceed from so mean principles. But this is Natures power, this her ability. Now there is such a litle sprout in the seeds of all Plants, whose bare top of all no bigger then a point, if it be once pared away, all hope of generation pre∣sently dies, as if the entire plastical virtue that is to fashion and compose the whole Tree, did take up its abode in so small a point. And therefore the provident Ant, eating of this small particle before hand, doth safely treasure up the grains and seeds of corn in her barns that lye under ground, cun∣ningly,
providing by this meanes against the in∣convenience which she might suffer in their grow∣ing afresh. The Cypress-Tree (saith the same Pliny) beareth a seed exceedingly affected by the Ant; and this enlarges the miracle, that so inconsiderable an A∣nimal should devoure and destroy so vast a Tree in its crale. But of these also in general we shall speak more, when we shall shew that many Animals themselves, especially Insects, do germinate and spring from seeds and principles not to be discern∣ed even by the eye, by reason of their contract in∣visible dimensions, (like those atomes, that fly in the aire) which are scattered and dispersed up and down by the winds: all which are esteemed to be Spontaneous issues, or born of Putrefaction, because their seed is not any where seen. And this specu∣lation is useful to that Philosophy, which teacheth, that all things are made out of nothing; for be∣tween the Original, and the Complement of any Li∣ving creature, there is almost no commensurable proportion. Nor are we so much to admire, what it is in a Cock, that doth conserve and govern so perfect and noble a creature, and is the first cause of his existence, which we say is his soul: but farre more what it is in the egge, nay in the very whelk, which hath so grand an authority to produce so gallant an animal, and advance its own renown to so high a stretch of glory. Nor are we only to admire, how great the Artist is that doth assist and coope∣rate in so great a work; but rather the manner of conveighance, it being by the contagion of onely a momentany coition: namely, what the thing is that passeth from the Male to the Female, from the Female to the Egge, and from the Egge to the Foe∣tus? What it is, that is hoc Traducis, this Derived
essence, which cannot be perceived to be either re∣maining, or touching, nor any sensible contained thing; and yet doth operate with a vast discretion and providence, beyond all the bounds of Art: & which doth render the Egg prolifical, even when it selfe is fled and vanished, not because it now doth, or hath touched before; not fructifying on∣ly the perfect, and absolved eggs, but even the im∣perfect and intended only, when they are yet but whelks and pushes: nay the Henne her self before she have yet produced any whelks at all, and that so nimbly, as if the Almighty himself should say, Let there be a production, and strait there is one. Let Physitians therefore cease to wonder at what they do not finde, but with astonishment; name∣ly, at Contagious, Epidemical, and Pestilential Diseases, how they do foment and disperse their infection through the air, and propagate distem∣pers like to themselves in other bodies, and by a secret course, as it were, by a solemne generation tacitly multiply, and grow sometimes so destru∣ctive, that (if God would leave the reins in their own hands) they would spread a sweeping deso∣lation over Men, and Beasts: for greater things then these are the dayly results of the generation of Animals. For more, and abler operations are required to the Fabrick and erection of Living creatures, then to their dissolution, and plucking of them down: For those things that easily and nimbly perish, are slow and difficult in their rise and complement. Seneca (as he is wont) elegant∣ly Nat. quest. l. 3. c. 27. saith: How long a time is required to ripen the conception for the Birth! With how great care and tenderness is it trained when now it is an Infant! With what choice of aliment is it cherished to a Youth! and yet how obnoxious is this carkass at last! how lost
without any paines! An age builds Towers, which one hour levels with the ground. With great caution things continue, but perish at an easie rate. The Forrest which is growing long, one active spark and moment turns to cinders. Nay, not so much as a spark; for the con∣flagration of the vastest bodies, will put us onely to the expence of a Burning-glass, where the Sunne beames being assembled, and directed in a Cone, will raise a nimble flame to speed the mischief. So that nothing is difficult to Natures Royalty, which to the production of things is sparing of her power, and warily dispenseth it with a great deal of thrift, by insensible accessions; but she is quick to destroy, running in full speed. In the generation of things, the best, eternal, and omni∣potent God, or Natures deity, is evidently seen; but all mortal things finde out a thousand wayes to ruine, of their own accord. How the generation of the Chicken is procured out of the Egge. EXER. XLII. WE have thus farre considered the Egge, as the Fruit, and End: it remaines, that wee now treat of it, as the Seed, and Principle. Now pag. 28. we must enquire (saith Fabricius) how the generation of the Chicken follows out of the Egge; taking our rise from that Principle or Position of Aristotle and Ga∣len, and approved by all: namely, That all things that are made in this world, are produced of these three;
the Agents, the Instruments, and the Matter. But because in natural Productions, the Agent is not without, but either existent in the Matter, or In∣struments, he concludes, That we are to consider of the Agent, and Matter only. But because we are here to shew after what manner the Chicken is made out of the Egge, I con∣ceive it not useless, to demonstrate, how many se∣veral wayes one thing may be said to be made out of another: for by that means it will more clear∣ly and distinctly appear, how many several wayes generation doth proceed from an Egge, and what is to be resolved, concerning the Matter, Instru∣ments, and Efficient. Aristotle hath taught, that one thing is made out of another four manner of wayes: First, when we say the De gen. an. l. 1. c. 18. Night is made out of the Day, and a Man of a Boy; because this is after that. The second, when a Sta∣tue is made out of Brass, or a Bed-stead out of Wood, or whatsoever we affirm to be made of matter, that so a whole may result, from something that is formed, and in it. Thirdly, when of a Musical, a man unskilled in Musick, or of a Sound, a Sick man, or one contrary of another. Fourthly, as Epicharmus makes his exag∣geration: of Calumnies, Cursings; of Cursings, Con∣flict. All which are referred to the first beginning of the progress; for the Calumnies are a certain part of the whole Broile. Since therefore one thing may be made out of another so many wayes, it is apparent, that the Seed is in another, two of these wayes. For that which is begotten, is out of it, either as out of its matter, or as its first mover. For it is not barely, as this thing is af∣ter that, as Navigation after the Panathenaea, nor as one contrary out of another; for a contrary is begotten out of the corruption of a contrary, and there must needs be some subject matter, out of which, as out of a first
immanent thing it should be made. By which words Aristotle truly inferres, that the Seed proceeding from the male, is the efficient cause of the Foetus, or else the Instrumental; because it is no part of the Foetus, neither according to the First, nor third acceptation (namely, as this thing out of that, or as out of its contrary) nor is it the subject matter. But, as he saith in the same place, that which proceeds from the Male in coition, is not truly and properly called Seed, but Geniture rather, and doth differ from Seed properly so called. For that is called Geniture, which proceeding from the Gene∣rant, is that first cause which obtains the beginning of the generation; namely, in those creatures which Na∣ture hath designed to generation: but the Semen is that thing which takes its original from the coition of those two (namely, the Male and Female:) and such is the seed of all Plants, and of some Animals, in whom there is no distinction of Sex: as being that which is first mixt by the Male and Female, as it were a promi∣scuous conception; and such as we have formerly in our History declared the Egge to be, which is cal∣led both a Fruit and a Seed. For the Seed and the Fruit are distinct things, and differ ratione prio∣ris & posterioris, under the notion of that which is first, and that which is after; for the Fruit is that which proceeds from another, the Seed is that out of which another doth proceed; otherwise they were both the same. It remaines therefore that we enquire, how many of the foresaid wayes the Foetus doth proceed, not from the Geniture of the Male, but from the true Seed, or Egg, or Conception (which are truly the seeds of Animals.)
How many waies the Chicken may be said to be made out of the Egge. EXERCIT. XLIII. IT is therefore granted, that the Chicken is made out of a prolifical Egg, as out of its Matter, and as by its Efficient; and that the same Egge is both the Causes of the Chicken. For as it deduceth its origi∣nal from the Hen, and is esteemed the fruit, it is the Matter: but in as much as it containeth in it, throughout all its substance, a plastical, and proli∣fical virtue infused by the Male, it is called the Ef∣ficient of the Chicken. So that not onely (as Fa∣bricius would have it) these things are inseparably joyned together in one and the same Egge; name∣ly, the Agent, and the Instrument, but it is also ne∣cessary, that the same place should also containe Aliment, by which it should be nourished. So that in a prolifical Egge these four things are to be found together; namely, the Efficient, the Instru∣ment, the Matter, and the Aliment, as appears plain∣ly in our History. Wherefore we affirme, that the Chicken is made out of the prolifical Egge all the fore-said waies; namely, as out of its Matter, Efficient, and Instru∣ment: and also as a Man is made out of a Boy, and the Whole out of a Part: and also tanquam ex Ali∣mento, as a thing may be said to be made of its nu∣triment; and likewise as a contrary is made out of a contrary. For when by Incubation (by the Internal motive principle) some clear part is liquefied (which we call Ovi Oculum the Eggs-Eye) we say that very
thing is made tanquam ex contrario, as a contrary out of a contrary: as we suppose the Chyle to be made out of contraries by concoction; (namely, out of crude, unconcocted meats) and in the same sense, as we our selves are said to be nourished by contraries. Just in that manner is the Colliquamentum and the Oculus Ovi made of the White, and augmented: and in that man∣ner likewise is the Blood and the Vesicula pul∣sans (which are the first particles of the Chic∣ken) made, nourished and augmented, out of that white liquor, or Colliquamentum: nourished I say, the Nutriment being assimulated by concoction (as out of its contrary) by the power of the innate heat; for that which is crude and unconcocted, is contrary to that which is concocted and assimulated: as a Man unskilled in Musick is contrary to a Musi∣tian; and a Sick man, to a Sound. And when Blood is made out of the white Colli∣quamentum, or the Colliquamentum out of the Yolk or White, it is called the generation of the one, and the corruption of the other: there being an altera∣tion made from the contrary to the contrary, the same subject matter remaining still. For the pro∣ceeding form of the White being corrupted, the Colliquamentum ariseth: and from the privation of the form of the Colliquamentum, resulteth the form of Blood: in the same manner as nourishment is turned into the substance of that which is nouri∣shed. Therefore in this sort the Chicken is said to be made out of the egge, tanquam ex Contrario, as out of a Contrary. For the Chicken being nourished and increased in the Egg, both the Yolk and the White are corrupted and consumed, and afterwards all the substance of the Egg. It is therefore ma∣nifest
that the Chicken is made out of the Egg, as out of a contrary, namely, as out of Aliment: and also, tanquam exprivatione, & non ente, as out of a Privation and non Ens. For the first particle of the Chicken, (namely the Blood, or Punctum saliens) is made ex non sanguine, of that which is not blood, and altogether its contrary, the same subject Matter still remaining. The Chicken also is made out of the Egg, sicut vir ex puero, as a Man is made out of a Boy. For as out of Plants Seeds are made, out of Seeds, Blos∣somes, Sprouts, Stems, Flowers, and Fruits: so also out of an Egge, (which is the Hens Seed) is made the dilatation of the Macula, the Colliquamentum, the Blood and Heart, as the first particle of the fa∣tus (or fruit.) And that, tanquam ex nocte dies, as the Night is made out of the Day; the Sommer out of the Spring; and a Man out of a Boy: Where this thing, is after that. So that as the Fruit doth arise in the same Stem after the Flowers; so likewise, after the Egge the colliquamentum; and after that, as out of the Humor Primigenius, out of the radical first moisture, the Blood, after the Blood, and out of it, the chicken; as the Whole out of a Part. And again, as by Epicharmus his Exaggeration, ex ca∣lumniâ fiunt maledicta, & ex maledict is pugna, out of slander come cursings, and out of cursings figh∣ting. For the Blood together with the Punctum sa∣liens is first existent; and doth likewise seem to be a part of the chicken, and a kind of Efficient, or In∣strument of its Generation, inseparable from the A∣gent: (as Fabricius supposeth) Now, in what man∣ner the Egge may be called the Instrument and Ef∣ficient of Generation, is in part shewed already; and shall appear more at large hereafter. It is evident out of our History, that the Punctum
saliens and the Blood, (while they increase) do as∣semble the rest of the body and all the other mem∣bers of the chicken to themselves: as the Yolk in the Womb, descending from the Ovary, encompas∣seth it self with the White, and that by way of concoction, and Nutrition. Now all men conceive calor. innatus, aut calidum innatvm, the innate or primigenial Heat, or Spirit diffused through the whole, and the Soul in that Spirit, or the faculty of that Soul, to be the common Instrument of the Vegetable Operations. The egg therefore without all question hath its Operative soul, which is all in the whole, and all in every part; and containes a spirit, or Animal heat in it, which is the immediate instrument of that soul. If any man therefore ask, how a chicken is made out at the egge? We reply, after all those ways recited by Aristotle, or invented by any else, af∣ter the which, one thing may be made out of an∣other. Fabricius is mistaken concerning the Matter of the Generation of the Chicken out of the Egge. EXER. XLIV. AS I decreed with my self from the beginning, so I shal continue to take Fabricius along with pag. 28. me in my progress: and therefore we shall consi∣der with him of those three things, which he saith are to be inquired after in the Generation of the
chicken, namely, the Agent, the Matter, and the Aliment of the chicken. All which ought to be in an egge, concerning which he proposeth some doubts, together with the opinions of Authors, who are of another mind. The first doubt relates to the Matter and Aliment of the chicken. Indeed Hippocrates, Anaxagoras, Alcmaeon, Menander, and De Nat. pueri. all the ancient Philosophers, did conceive the Chicken to be born out of the Yolk, and nourished by the White. And Aristotle and Pliny, contrary Hist. an. l. 6 c. 3. and De gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. & 3. l. 10. c. 53. to that opinion, did believe, that the chicken did assume its body from the White, and its Aliment from the Yolk. But Fabricius for his own part, conceived neither Yolk nor White to be the Matter of the chicken: endeavouring to confute the for∣mer opinions, and to shew, that both Yolk and White did serve to nourish the Chicken. And this, besides other Arguments (which I conceive to be of less force) with this which is evincing enough, namely that the propagations of the Umbilical Ves∣sels (by which without doubt the chicken doth at∣tract his Aliment) are disseminated both into the Yolk and white, and that both those liquors (ac∣cordingly as the chicken encreases, and doth ex∣pend a greater stock of nourishment) are quite ex∣hausted. And hereupon Fabricius for confirmati∣on pag. 34. of his opinion, saith: There are three onely sub∣stances which do conduce to the fabrick of the egg, and the generation of the chicken, the White, the Yolk, and the Chalazae: the White and Yolk are the Chickens substance; therefore the Chalazae onely are the subject matter of the chicken. But that the most excellent Fabricius is in an error, we have demon∣strated before in our History. For after the chic∣ken is well nigh compleated, when his Head and Eyes are distinctly to be seen, the Chalazae are still
found in the Egg far remote from the Chicken, and still entire, being then depressed from the two ends of the egg to the sides, and do execute (as he also confesses) the office of Ligaments, to keep the Yolk in its true position within the White. Nor is that true neither, which Fabricius addes to justi∣fie his perswasion; namely, that the Chalazae are seated directly under the Obtuse Angle of the Egge. For after the first days Incubation the Liquors shift their stations; the Yolk is exalted, and the cha∣lazae are depressed from both ends, as hath been said. He is also deceived, when he saith that the cha∣lazae are parts of the Egge: for in truth, the egge is constituted onely by the Yolk, and the White; but the chalazae, as also the membranes, are onely certain litle Appendixes of the White, and nothing else but meerly the extremities of the membranes contorted and twisted, (as filaments or strings are twisted into a Rope) that so they may the better preserve the Liquors in their proper places, by a firmer tye. And therefore his Inference is infirme, when he saith: The chalazae are found to be in that part of the egg where the chicken is made, and therefore the chicken is made out of them. For even according to Fabricius himself, that can no wayes be: who confesses, that the chalazae are to be found in the two extremities of the egg, and yet denies, that the chicken is any where made, but onely in the Obtuse end of it: in which end truly, from the ve∣ry first setting out towards the Generation of the Chicken, there is no chalazae to be found at all. Nay, if you make tryal in a New-layd Egge, you shall find that the superiour chalaza is not directly seated under the Obtuse end, or the cavity thereof,
but inclining something to the side; nor on that side neither, where the cavity doth tend, but ra∣ther on the contrary side. Moreover, it hath been shewed before, that the scituation of the Liquors immediately upon Incubation is shifted, because the Oculus, or Eye of the egge being enlarged by the colliquamentum, is exalted to the cavity in the Ob∣tuse Angle, upon which the liquors and chalazae at each end do remove to the sides. For the Macu∣la or Speck, which before Incubation, was seated in the middest between both the extremities of the egge, now being inlarged into an Oculus, or Eye, is adjoyned to the cavity in the Obtuse end; and one of the chalazae is deposed from the Obtuse Angle, and the other is exalted (so much as the other is deposed) from the Acute Angle; (just as the Poles of the World are seated in an Oblique Hemisphere) and at the same time, the greatest part of the White, especially of the grosser part of it, doth sinck down to the Acute Angle. Nor is that true neither where he endeavors to in∣fer a probable argument to prove the chalazae to be the Matter of the Pullus, from the likeness & simili∣tude of their consistence, alleadging, that the cha∣lazae pag. 35. do represent the first formation of the Chic∣ken, by their figure and longitude, and have also as many twists or knots, as there are principle parts in the Chicken. Nor is that corpus Rubrum (which he also took for the Liver) or red substance in the chalazae, or any thing neer them, but in the middle of the col∣liquamentum candidum; and it is the rudiment of the Heart onely. Nor doth the example of the Tadpoles alleadged by him, square to his purpose, of which, saith he, you can onely discern their Head and Taile, that is, their Head and spine of the Back,
having neither fore-legs nor hinder-legs. And he pro∣ceeds, that whosoever seeth a Chalaza, and one of these conceptions, will think he sees one and the same body. Now I have made many dissections of these Tad∣poles, and have seen a pretty large Belly in them, and in that Belly Guts, and a Liver, and a Heart panting; and also I have discovered their Head and Eyes too. But that which Fabricius takes for their Head, is their round figure, from which they are called Gyrini; because their form or fi∣gure in gyrum vertitur, curles into a round. They have also a Taile by which they swim, but legs indeed they want. Yet about the Solstice, they lose or cast their Taile, having then hinder-legs, and fore-legs beginning to strut out. Now there is no∣thing in the first division of a Chicken into his Head and Spine, that any way resembles this; which should any way induce us to believe that the Chicken is made out of the Chalazae, in man∣ner of a Tadpole. To proceed farther in the confutation of this matter, the worth of Fabricius (a man so exceed∣ingly well skilled in Anatomy) forbids: nor in∣deed is there any great need, since the thing is so evident in our History. He at last concludes, that this his opinion is wondrous old, and was on foot in Aristotles dayes. But I rather think the opinion of Ulysses Aldrovandus to be old, by which it is thought, that the Chalazae are the Cocks Tred∣dle, out of which, and by which the chicken is pro∣created. But neither of these opinions is true: for that the Grandines, or Chalazae (the Italians call them Galladura, and our Country-men the Treddle) do either proceed from the Cock, or are his seed, is a
vulgar error, and an old Wifes tale, both hereto∣fore, and in our times. The Grandines (saith Aldrovandus) are the Cocks sperme, because no fertile Egge is without them. No nor infertile Egge neither; which he or knew not, or did not declare. And this Fabricius indeed ac∣knowledgeth; but while he denyeth the Cocks seed to enter into the womb, or to be any where found in the Egge; yet he still contends, that the Chalazae, before any other parts of the Egg, are chiefly stocked with fecundity from the power of the Males seed, and do contain a prolifical virtue; though he could not observe that there is no dif∣ference or distinction at all between the Chalazae of the barren & the fruitful egge. But seeing he hath granted, that the very rudiments of Egges in the Vitellary are as well fructified by the Cocks tread∣ing, as those Eggs which are encompassed with the white. I suppose the occasion of his so able a mans error was this: It was hitherto (as we have often said) the received opinion of all Philosophers and Physitians, that the Geniture of the Male, or Female, or of both together, was the subject matter in the generation of Animals: out of which residing in the Uterus (after coition) the Animals are generated (in like manner as Plants are made, and spring out of the seeds sowen in the ground:) nor was Ari∣stotle much distant from this opinion, who would needs have the menstruous blood to be the womans, which the Males geniture doth coagulate, and so constitute the conception. Now the fore-said Error being granted by all, (for an infallible principle) it is no great wonder, if afterwards (according to every mans particular conjecture) many false opinions do creep in. For
they are quite beside their mark, who conceive that after coition some kinde of substance or matter doth remain, fit and convenient for the producti∣on of the foetus, or first conception; or that any thing else is formed in the cavity of the womb, which may be of like use with the seed which is sowen in the bowels of the earth. For it is most certain, that in the Uterus of a Hen (and the same thing shall be afterwards evidenced of all females whatsoever) upon coition, nothing is to be discovered, more then was there before. And therefore it is clear that Fabricius is out, when he saith, As a Viviparous animal is incorpora∣ted of a litle quantity of seminal matter, but that which pag. 35. sustaineth him afterward is in a great aboundance: so also the litle Chalazae are sufficient for the genera∣tion of the Chicken; but all the other parts conteined in the Egge, serve onely for his nourishment. By which words he declares, that he conceived such a kinde of substance was at hand in the Egge, for constituting the model of the foetus: lest hee should seem to recede any thing from the defini∣tion of an Egge, delivered by Aristotle; namely, An Egge is that thing, out of part of which an Animal is produced, and the remainder of which becomes the Hist. an. l. 3. c. 8. de gen. an. l. 2. c. 1. nourishment for it when it is produced. And this therefore seemed an invincible Argu∣ment to Fabricius; Since there are three onely parts in the Egge; namely, the White, the Yolk, and the Chalazae: and the two first do only administer nutri∣ment to the Chicken; it must needs be that the Cha∣lazae only are the matter, out of which the Chicken is constituted. Thus then it fell out, that this able Anatomist (while he sought in the Egge some convenient matter, out of which to constitute the Chicken) be∣ing
benighted by a vulgar Heresie, lost his way. And this inconvenience doth likewise befall ma∣ny men more, who forsaking that light, which the frequent dissection of bodies, and the familiar con∣verse with Natures selfe would help them to, doe yet persist to make discoveries out of their owne conjectures, or some conceived probable argu∣ments, or the Authority of former Writers; when they themselves ought to look into the matter, and assent to it by their own sense. No wonder therefore that infinite errours, which were deliver∣ed over by common consent from the first dawn∣ing of Antiquity, are handed down even to our times: and that so by that means, men otherwise very ingenious, are egregiously deluded; because they conceive it plentifull satisfaction of minde to them, that they finde it in Books, and have their memories well loaded with sage sentences. For they that are thus Philosophers extraduce, by de∣scent and derivation, are just as wise as their owne Libraries. To conclude therefore, there is in an Egge (as we have often said) no distinct part, or disposed matter, out of which the foetus may be formed and fashioned: but as in the seeds of Plants, there is a litle point or budding shot out; so is there in an Egge, a small Cicatrice, or Macula, which being in∣spired with plastical endowments, enlarges it self into the Oculus or Colliquamentum, out of which, and in which, the primordia of the Chicken (namely the Blood and Punctum saliens) are ingen∣dered, nourished, and augmented, till they become a complete Chicken. Nor is Aristotles definition of an Egge true, where he will have it to be that, out of part of which the Chicken is made, and nourished by the rest; unless you understand it thus: An Egg
is that, out of part of which a Chicken is framed, not as out of its Matter, but as Vir ex Puero, a Man is made out of a Boy: or thus; An Egge is a perfect concepti∣on, out of which the Chicken is said partly to be made, and partly to be nourished: or lastly thus; An Egge is that thing, whose liquors do serve both for the Mat∣ter, de gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. and Nourishment of the parts. And in this sense Aristotle teacheth, That the matter of the foetus in wo∣men is menstruous Blood, which (while it is poured in∣to the womb by the veines) Nature emploies it to ano∣ther use; namely, to the use of Generation, that such another creature may be made, as it would have been; for it is already such in potentiâ, in possibility, as the bodies from whence it was separated; that is, the Mothers. What the Matter of the Chicken is, and how the Chicken is formed in the Egge. EXERCIT. XLV. SInce therefore the truth cannot, as I suppose, be attained out of the opinions of other men, (whether they be confirmed by either their naked authority, or probable argumentations) unless wary experience be imployed in the discovery: we shal declare to you out of Natures own Volum, and clear Observations, what the Matter of the Foe∣tus is, and how it is formed thence. I have declared that one thing is made out of another (as out of its Matter) two several wayes, and that as well in artificial, as natural Producti∣ons, but especially in the Generation of Animals.
The First is, when one thing is made of ano∣ther thing that is pre-existent; and thus a Bed∣stead is made out of Timber, and a Statue out of a Rock, where the whole Matter of the future fa∣brick was existent and in being, before it was re∣duced into the subsequent shape, or any tittle of the design begun. But the other way is, when the matter is both made, and receiveth its form at the same time. As therefore Artificial productions are perfected two several waies; one, when the Artifi∣cer cuts and divides the matter which is provided to his hands, and so by paring away the super∣fluous parts, doth leave an Image remaining be∣hinde, as the Statuary doth: the other, when the Potter formes the like Image of Clay, by adding more stuff, or augmenting, and so fashioning it, so that at one and the same time, he provides, pre∣pares, fits, and applies his materials: (and in this way an Image or Figure may be rather said to be made, then fashioned) so likewise in the Generation of Animals; some are formed and transfigured, out of matter already concocted and grown; and all the parts are made and distinguished together per metamorphosin, by a metamorphosis, so that a complete Animal is the result of that Generation: but some again, having one part made before an∣other, are afterwards nourished, augmented, and formed out of the same matter; that is, they have parts, whereof some are before, and some after o∣ther, and at the same time, are both for∣med, and grow. Now the Fabrick or con∣stitution of these, proceeds from some one part, as from its original, and by the help of that, the other members are produced, and these we say are made per Epigenesin, by a post-generati∣on, or after-production; that is to say, by de∣grees,
part after part; and this is more properly called a Generation, then the former. After the former way doth the generation of In∣sects proceed, as when by a Metamorphosis a Worm is made of an Egge; or as when out of a putri∣fying matter (the moisture drying, or the dry part growing moist) the primordia or rudiments are generated, out of which (as out of a Canker∣worm now grown to its just magnitude, or out of the worm called Aurelia) by a Metamorphosis ari∣seth a Butter-flie, or common Flie in its just mag∣nitude or stature, being nothing augmented since its first birth. But the more perfect Animals which have blood, are made by an Epigenesis, or superad∣dition of parts, and do grow, and attain their just stature or , after they are born. In those o∣ther, Casus seu Fortuna, Chance or Fortune, seem∣eth chiefly to promote the generation; in which the form ariseth ex potentiâ materiae prae-existentis, out of the power or potentiality of the pre-exi∣stent matter; and the matter is rather the first cause of the Generation, then any external Efficient. And hence it is, that these kinde of Animals are more imperfect, and do less continue their kinde, or are less durable, then Terrestrial or Aquatile creatures that have Blood, which attain a Perpetui∣ty from an Univocal principle: (that is, from the same Species) the chief cause whereof we ascribe to Nature, and the Vegetative Virtue. Some Animals therefore suâ sponte nascuntur, are born of their own accord, out of a Matter digest∣ed of it self, or else casually, as Aristotle seems to assert: Whose Matter is capable of mutation of it self, undergoing that mutation by Chance, which seed Metaphys. l. 7. c. 9. doth, in the generation of other Animals. And the same thing falls out in the generation of Animals,
as in Art: for some things are accomplished by Art, and those very things, by chance too; as Health: and other things againe are never produced with∣out Art, as a House. Bees, Waspes, Butterflies, and all those crea∣tures, that are generated out of a Worm by a Me∣tamorphosis, are said to be Casu orta, creatures bred by chance, and therefore things not preserving their kind: but a Lyon, or a Cock, are never made by chance, or of their own accord, but have their existence from Nature, or a more divine operative faculty; at whose hands they rather require, that it produce a Species like to themselves, then supply a fit Matter. In Generation by Metamorphosis, creatures seem to be fashioned like things wrought off with a Mould, or the Print of a Seale; where the whole Matter is transformed. But an Animal produced by Epigenesis, attracts, prepares, concocts, and ap∣plies the Matter at the same time, and is at the same time formed, and Augmented. In those the Plastical vertue divides the same fimilar Matter, and being divided, disposes, and reduces it into members; out of a similar Matter making a dissi∣milar; or out of a similar subject Matter, dissimilar Organs. But in these, while it produces diverse parts, and those parts diversly disposed, one af∣ter another; it requires and makes a diverse Mat∣ter, and that Matter diversly disposed, or quali∣fied, such as may be convenient to the production of different parts. For which cause we conceive, that the Perfect Egge is constituted and made up of several parts. It therefore is clear by our History, that the ge∣neration of the Chicken out of the Egge, proceeds rather per Epigenesin, quam per Metamorphosin, by
an Epigenesis, then by a Metamorphosis; and that all its parts are not constituted at once, but suc∣cessively, & in Order; and that while it is augment∣ed it is also formed, & while it is formed, it is also augmented; as likewise that some parts are super∣added to others, and distinguished from others; and that the beginning, increase, and perfection of it do proceed by way of growth, till at the last the Foetus doth result. For the forming Faculty of the Chicken, doth rather acquire, and temper its own Matter, then find its Matter ready temper∣ed, and fitted to its hand; and the Chicken seems more to be framed, and increased by his own self, then by any other. And as all things are increased or nourished by the same things, out of which they are made; so likewise the Chicken is in all likely∣hood made by the same thing, (be it the Soule, or some faculty of the Soul) by which he is preserved, and sustained. For the same Efficient and Preser∣ver, is found both in the egg & in the Chicken; and out of the same Matter of which it doth constitute the first particle or rudiments of the Chicken, it nourisheth, augmenteth, and superaddeth all the other parts. Lastly, in Generation by Metamorpho∣sis, the whole is distributed and distinguished in∣to parts; but by Epigenesis the whole is constitu∣ted, and made of parts, by a certain order and succession. Wherefore Fabricius did erroniously seek after the Matter of the Chicken, (as if it were some di∣stinct part of the egge,) which went to the imbo∣dying of the Chicken) as though the Generation of the Chicken were effected by a Metamorphosis, or transfiguration of some collected lump or mass, and that all parts of the body, at least the Principal parts were wrought off at a heat, or (as
himself speaks) did arise and were corporated out of the same Matter: and not by Epigenesis, in which an order is observed according to the dig∣nity, and worth, and use of the Parts; where first a small foundation is laid, which at the same time while it doth increase, grows distinct, and formed, and so attains all its parts by degrees, ac∣cording to their proper order, which are superge∣nerated, and born to it. For as the litle top or point which jets forth or protuberateth from the Acorne, taking heat and encreasing, multiplies into a Root, Wood, Sap, Bark, Shoots, Tendrels, Boughs, Blossoms, and Fruits, and at last ariseth into a compleat Tree: such is the progress of the Chicken in the Egge; the Cicatri∣cula or small speck, which is in the foundation of the future Pile, increases in Oculum, into an Eye, and at the same instant is distinguished into a Colliquamentum, or dissolved substance, in whose Center is born the Punctum sanguineum pulsans, the Bloody panting point, together with the Ramificati∣ons of the Veins: from these doth by and by result the Nebula, or litle cloudy Substance, and first concrete Matter of the future Body, which also as it grows, is divided, and distinguished into parts, but not all at once, but such as give place and el∣dership to one another. To conclude therefore, in the Generation of those Animals, which are produced by Epigenesis, (as the Chicken in the Egge is) we are not to enquire a particular or distinct matter, out of which the productions should be imbodyed, different from that out of which they are nourished and increa∣sed: for it is nourished and encreased by the same matter, whereof it is made, and so on the othe hand, the Pullus in the Egge is constituted out of
the same matter, by which it is susteined and aug∣mented. And potentiâ animal, an Animal in poten∣tiâ, is one and the same thing, with Alibile and Augmentativum, a creature fedde, and augmented in potentiâ, (as we shall shew hereafter) and do dif∣fer onely ipso esse formally, (as Aristotle saith) but otherwise are the very same. For, for as much as this particular thing is, and is converti∣ble into substance, Nutritivum est, it is Nutritive: and for as much as it is quantum, indued with quantity, it is Augmentativum, Augmentative: for as much as it is substituted in the room of a sub∣stance that is lost, Nutrimentum appellatur, it is cal∣led Nutriment: for as much as it is added to a substance already in being, Incrementum dicitur, it is called Growth. And the same thing is Materia, the Matter in the Generation; Alimentum, the Suste∣nance in the Nutrition, and Incrementum, the In∣crease in the Augmentation of the Chicken. But that is formally and simply said to be generated, whereof no part was existent before, but that to be nourished and grow which was, and had an ex∣istence or being before. That part of the Foetus which is first made, is said to be begotten or born: that which is substituted or superadded to it, is said to be annate, aggenerate, or born to it. There is in al things the same generation, and transmutati∣on from the same into the same: which is perform∣ed in respect of a part, by Nutrition and Augmenta∣tion, but in respect of the Whole by Generation: else it is the very same in both. For from whence the first existent matter proceeds, from thence al∣so doth Nutriment and Growth accrew unto it. And it shall also appear by that which shall be delivered hereafter, that all Parts of Bodies are nou∣rished
by the same Nutritive substance diversly transformed or altered. For as all Plants do in∣differently spring, grow, and are susteined from the same Common Nutriment, diversly varied and digested (whether it be Dew, or the juice and moi∣sture of the ground) so likewise out of the same Liquors of the Egge (namely, the White and Yolk) the whole Chicken, and all its parts are procreat∣ed and encreased. We will then also explaine, what Animals are begotten by a Metamorphosis: and what kind of pre-existent matter that of the Insects is, which spring from a Worme, out of which, all the parts are together constituted and concorporated, and at last a perfect Animal born, by Transmutation onely: as also what Animals have any order and degrees in their production, and have their Parts produced successively: and what kind of creatures they are which are first borne imperfect, but after∣wards shoot up, and attain to perfection, as all those that are produced out of an Egge. These, as they are together made, and aug∣mented, growing, and transformed; and are by a proposed method and order distinguished into parts; so have they no immediate pre-existent Mat∣ter (such as is usually designed them; namely, the commixture of the feminine and masculine seed, or the Menstruous Blood, or some litle portion of the egge) out of which the foetus should assume his bo∣dy; but so soon as ever the Matter is made and provided, it grows also, and takes some shape; so soon as there is a Nutriment, there is a creature to be nourished by it. And this Generation is rather by Epigenesis (as a Man is out of a Boy) that is, the fabrick and stru∣cture of the body is out of the Punctum saliens, as
out of its foundation: as out of the Keel the Ship is built: and rather as the Potter forms an Image, without any pre-existent Matter; then out of any subject matter: as the Carpenter forms a Bench out of Boards: and the Statuary a Statue of Marble. For out of the same matter whence the first particle of the Chicken, or its least atome arises, thence also doth the whole Chicken proceed: whence the first small drop of Blood, thence also is the whole stream or current of it generated in the egg: whatsoever gives a consistence or being to the members or organical parts of the body, doth also afford the same to all the similar parts likewise; as, to the Skin, the Flesh, Veins, Membranes, Nerves, Car∣tilages, and Bones. For that very part which was soft and fleshy, at first, is afterward upon its increase, made a Nerve, Ligament, Tendon, by the same A∣liment; that which was onely a Membrane, be∣comes a Coat; and that which was a Gristle, is af∣terwards advanced into a Skin or Bone; and this by the same similar matter variously altered. For a similar mixt body (which is commonly concei∣ved to be framed out of the Elements) is not made of the Elements first subsisting apart by themselves, and then afterwards compounded, united, and altered, but out of this particular mixt body be∣ing altered, another mixt body is born and pro∣duced, that is, Of the Colliquamentum is the blood made, of the blood the bulk of the body; which bulk at first doth appear similar, and like the Spermati∣cal Gluten, or clammy substance; but from it the parts are delineated by an obscure indiscernable division at first, but afterwards become organical and distinct. Those similar parts, I say, do not arise from the dissimilar, and heterogeneous Elements, united to∣gether,
but are framed and discriminated by Ge∣nerations out of a similar substance, and so be∣come dissimilar. As if by the Omnipotents com∣mand, or fiat, the whole Chicken were crea∣ted. As thus: let there be a similar White lump, and let that lump or mass be divided into parts, and increased; and while it is increased, let there be a secretion and delineation of the parts; and let this part be harder, thicker, and whiter; and that softer, and well coloured; And it was so. For thus doth the structure of the Chicken in the Egge proceed daily; out of one and the same matter are all its limbs and utensils made, nourished, and aug∣mented. From the Spine first do the Ribs grow out, and the Bones are distinguished from the Flesh, by their most white slender Lines: three Bullae are discernable in the Head, which are all fraught with a Crystalline Water, being the Rudiments of the braine, After-braine, and (as by a sprinckled black streak is implyed) of one of the Eyes: The substance which at first resembleth coagulated milk, becomes at last gristly, spinous, and bony: and that which at first was white, and gelly-ish: passeth at length into a blushing flesh, and Parenchyma. That which was formerly most transparent and pure Water, is transformed anon into the braine, After∣braine, and eyes. For there is a far greater, and diviner mystery in Generation, then a bare assem∣bling, altering, and compounding of Parts: for the Whole is made and discovered before its parts; the Mixt body before the Elements. But of this more hereafter; when also its Causes, and Principles come to be assigned.
Of the Efficient Cause of the Genera∣tion of the Chicken, and Foetus. EXER. XLVI. THus far of the Matter, out of which the Chic∣ken springs in the Egge: it remaines now that we enquire a little with Fabricius, concerning the Efficient cause of the Chicken. But because it is a perplext business, and Authors do no where more cavil and contend; and Aristotle himself is won∣derful intricate in explaining it; and also many doubts, not to be despised, do interpose; I con∣ceive it worth the while, (as we have done in making search after the Matter) in the first place to set down, how many ways a thing may be said to be Efficient, or Effective: that so it may more certainly and distinctly appear, what is to be enquired after under the name of Efficient; as al∣so what is to be resolved concerning the opinion of Authors about this matter: and that it may likewise appear out of our own observations, what is to be truely and properly called an Effi∣cient. Aristotle defines an Efficient cause, to be that from whence the first beginning of Mutation or Rest proceeds; Metaph. l. 3. c. 2. & Phys. l. 2. c. 28. as an Adviser; a Father; and simply, he that doth a thing, of the thing that is done; that which is the transmutor, of that which is transmuted. Where∣upon many and sundry kinds of causes, from whence a motion or mutation doth proceed, are brought and amassed in the Generation of Ani∣mals: sometimes an accident, or quality is assigned
the Efficient, and so the animal heat, and forming faculty are alledged, as the Efficient. Sometimes an external substance before existent, in which the pla∣stical power, and forming faculty resides; as the fa∣ther, or the seed of that creature by whose efficacy the Chicken is procreated of the egge. Sometimes some internal substance existent by it self; as the spirit, or Calidum innatum. And sometimes some other substance; as the Form, or Nature, or Soul, or some Vegetative part of the Soul: which kinde of principle, we have said, is in the Egge. Moreover, because some things from which mutation doth proceed, are neerer causes of it, and some more remote: thereupon sometimes media, the things between the first efficient, and the last ef∣fect, and also the Instruments are counted Effici∣ents: as also subordinate ends, or the principles of subsequent things, are ranked amongst efficient causes; and hereupon is it, that some parts are cal∣led Genital parts; as the Heart, from which Ari∣stotle affirms the other parts to proceed, as is clear also by our History, I say the Heart, or at lest the rudiment of the Heart; namely, the Vesicula, and Punctum saliens, doth erect and set up the rest of the Body, as a future habitation for it self: and when it is built, takes possession, enlivens, and swayes it, and fortifies it with the superaddition of the Ribs, and Breast-bone, as with a Bulwark: and becomes, as it were, a Tutelar God, the first chamber that en∣tertaines the soule, the first receptacle of the primi∣genial heat, and the Vestal animal-fire; the source and fountain of all the Faculties, and the only so∣lace in Afflications. Again, since the Efficient is so called, in order to the Effect; seeing by Epigenesis some parts are af∣ter other in order, and divers also spring from
those that are before them: it is therefore proba∣ble, that as the Effects, so the Efficients are also di∣verse; which produce diverse works, from which also diverse mutations do proceed. So Physitians, in the Physiological part of Physick, do constitute some Instruments of Chylification, some of Sanguifi∣cation, and some of Generation: and some Anato∣mists, an Ossifical, Carnifical, and a Nervifical fa∣culty; which they depute to make the Bones, the Flesh, and the Nerves. But in the Generation of the Chicken, the efficient causes must needs differ, by reason of the several a∣ctions relating to it, which differ very much; which, though they may seem Efficientes per accidens, con∣tingent Efficients of Generation, yet are they neces∣sarily required, since nothing could be done with∣out their associat ayd. For while they remove ex∣ternal Impediments, or do cherish, or awaken the conception, and de potentiâ in actum deducunt, raise it from possibility into actual being, they are justly stiled efficients. And in this Rowle, the Incubation of the Hen, the temper and warmth of the Place, and Air, the Spring-time, and the approach of the Sun by the Zodiack, may be well listed: as also the preparing causes, which cause the Yolk to ascend, the Macula to be dilated, and the resolution, or melting of the humours in the Egge, may be mu∣stered amongst efficients. And then the Generative and Architectonical fa∣culties, which Fabricius calls parts, are to be numbred with the efficient causes; as, the Im∣mutatrix, Concoctrix, Formatrix, & Auctrix, the Altering, Concocting, Forming, and Aug∣menting faculty; as also those causes that are efficients in the Accidents relating to the Chicken, as that, by which the Chicken is either a Cock
or a Henne, resembling the He or Shee-parent: and that in relation to the form of the Cock which was concerned in the former, or latter coition: whence it comes to pass that the Chicken is an ani∣mal, and that an entire one, and not dismembered, sturdy, and sound, not diseased, and crasie, but a long liver; and retaining the Species, or degene∣rating from it; or proves a Monster, or of a mixt race. Lastly, since in treating of the efficient cause of the foetus, we discover the notable structure of it, and the actions, functions, uses, and benefits of all the parts and members, and with what prudence, skill, and judgment, by how divine an inspirati∣on all things are managed, and artificially com∣posed for the advantage of Life: we must not on∣ly amuse our selves in inquiring, which is the Ef∣ficient, Architect, and Projector, but also adore, and admire the Omnipotent Author and Preserver of so great a Fabrick (as justly merits the title of a Mi∣crocosme.) We also enquire, when, and whence it proceedeth; and where this divine Vicar, and Vice-Roy of the deity, which is analogous to the substance of Stars, and neer allyed to Art, and In∣tellect, takes up its residence, and keeps its Court. It is apparent therefore by what hath been said, that it is a difficult thing to enumerate all the ef∣ficient causes of the Pullus: and we must needs re∣ferre the fuller disquisition of the thing to a gene∣ral consideration; nor is it possible to treat fully and profitably of those things which agree to all in general, out of the single generation of the Chic∣ken (without a clearer light borrowed by experi∣ence from other Animals.) And that the rather, because Aristotle himself hath recounted so many various efficient principles of Animals: For some∣times
he ordaines Meta∣phys. 1. 2. & 4. 1. the Male the chief efficient cause, as in whom the Ratio pulli, the Reason or ground of the Made Chicken consists: according to that, Meta. 7. 10. all things are made by the same Univocal. Sometimes, De par. an. 1. 1. the Males seed: or De gen. an. 1. 20. the Nature of the Male ejecting seed. Sometimes, Ibid. l. 2. c. 3. that which is in the seed, causing seed to be fruitfull; namely, the Spirit, and the nature in that Spirit, answerable in proportion to the substance of the Starres. Else where, l. 5. c. 3. heat, l. 4. c. 2. moderate heat, l. 4. c. 4. a certain proporti∣onable degree of heat, De par. an. 2. 2. the heat in the Blood; and in some places, the heat of the Ambient Aire. Like∣wise De gen. an. 4. 2. the Winds, the Sun, the Heavens, Jupi∣ter, the Soul, and in general, Nature, which is the Principle of Motion and Rest. And so by the same rule, Any of the Stoicks, who thought the Soul to be fire, may decree fire the efficient cause of Ani∣mals; because fire doth nourish and augment it self, and seems in some sort to live at its own dis∣pose De gen. & corrup. l. 2. c. 30. and liberty: though not our destructive cu∣linary fire, but the Natural, Celestial, Vegetative, De gen. an. l. 2. c. c. Generating, and Healthy fire, which the Heathen worshipped by the name of Jupiter, whom they called the Father of Men and Things; not his lame Brother Vulcan, (whose ayd and benefit we not∣withstanding daily use in several employments to our great advantage) but the divine, Animal Spi∣rit, the Author of Living creatures. And therefore Aristotle saith, That this question concerning the Efficient is very dubious; namely, Whether it be an extrinsecal thing, or something insert∣ed in the Geniture or Seed: and Whether it be a part of the soul, or the soul, or something which hath a soul. Wherefore that we may deliver and rid our selves of the maze and labyrinth of the manifold Efficient causes, in this disquisition of the Efficient
of the Chicken, we have need of Ariadnes Clew, woven and cunningly wrought of the Observati∣ons of almost all Creatures living. And therefore it is to be deferred to a more general Inquest. In the mean time, we shall recount those things, which relating to the particular generation of the Chicken out of the egge, do manifestly appear, or are strangers to the common perswasion, or else do require any further search. How the Efficient cause of the Chicken doth operate, according to Aristotle. EXERCIT. XLVII. ALl men generally confess the Male to be the primary efficient cause in Generation; as in whom the Species or Form resides: And they far∣ther affirm, that his Geniture being emitted in coi∣tion doth cause both the being, and fertility of the Egge. But how the seed of the Cock doth produce the chicken out of the Egge, neither the Antient nor Modern Philosophers and Physitians have sufficiently explained, nor yet solved the question proposed by Aristotle. Nay Aristotle himself hath not done it. He saith, The Male doth not conduce to the Quan∣tity, but the Quality; and is Principium Motûs, the De gen. an l. 1. c. 20. Principle of Mutation; but the Female contributes the matter. And a while after: Every Male doth not emit seed, nor is it any part of the Foetus, in those that do emit it: As nothing which passeth from the Car∣penter
contributes to the matter of the Wood; nor is there any part of the Carpenters art in that which is made, but the form and species doth ex∣ist in the matter per motum ab illo, by the motion or mutation which proceeds from him. Now the soule in which the form and knowledge is, moves the hands, or other members, by the motion of a certain quality; which motion is either diverse, in such as make a di∣verse thing, or the same in such as make the same. But the hands and instruments move the matter. So the Nature of the Male which emitteth seed, imployes that seed, as an Instrument, and having motion actually in it, as in the productions of Art the Instruments are mo∣ved; for in them, in some sort, the motion of Art is im∣planted. By which words he seems to imply, that Gene∣ration is made by the motion of a certain Quality. As in Art, though the first cause (namely ratio o∣peris, the reason or ground of the work) be in the soul of the Artist; yet afterward the work is effe∣cted by the motion of the hands, or other Instru∣ments; and though the first cause be removed (as in automatis, things that seem to move of them∣selves) yet is it in some sort said to move that, which at present it doth not touch, but hath touched formerly, so long as the motion goes on in the Instruments. And in the following Book he hath these words: The seed of the Male when now it hath access Lib. 2. c. 4. into the womb of the Female, it doth coagulate, and cause a consistence in the purest part of the excrement (meaning the menstruous blood residing in the womb) and doth transmute the matter which lies rea∣dy in the womb by such a motion or mutation, that at last, though the seed vanish after the motion is perform∣ed, some part of the foetus is existent, and that an ani∣mate
part (as the heart) which now doth augment and dispose it self, as a Son who is free from his Father, and hath taken a house of his own. It is necessary therefore that there be some principle by which after∣wards the order of the members may be delineated, and all things disposed, which pertain to the absolution and complement of the Animal; and from which growth and motion may arrive to the rest of the parts, and be the author of all the similar and dissimilar parts, and of their last aliment. For that which is now an Ani∣mal, doth increase; but the last aliment of the Animal is blood, or something proportionable to blood, whose vessels and receptacles are the Veines. Now the prin∣ciple or original of the veines is the Heart. But the Veines like Roots extend even to the womb, by which the Foetus draweth his aliment. The Heart also being the beginning of the whole nature, and also the containing End, ought to be made first, as being a genital part of its own nature; which must needs be the first, as the o∣riginal of the rest, and of the whole Animal, and of Sense: in whose heat (because all the parts are in the matter potentially) since the principle of motion did a∣bide, that which follows afterwards, is stirred up by it, as in those self-moving miracles; and the parts are moved, not shifting their places, but altering in soft∣ness, hardness, heat, and other distinctions of similar parts, being now actually made, which were potentially before. This is Aristotles opinion almost word for word, by which he conceives the foetus to be made of seed by motion; though it do not at present continue touching it, but hath touched it former∣ly: a nice opinion, and of a fine thread; and accor∣ding to those things which are discovered in the order of the generation of the parts, not improba∣ble. For the heart, together with the ramifications
of the Veins, is discerned first; as being an animate principle, in which both sense and motion reside; and being also like a free Son, and a Genital part, by which the order of the member is delineated, and all things conducing to the accomplishment of an Animal, are disposed, and having all those attri∣butes which Aristotle bestowes upon it. But it seems impossible that the heart should be made in the egge by the males seed; since that seed is neither in the egge, nor doth touch, nor ever did touch it: because it neither enters the womb (where the egge is made) as Fabricius confesseth, nor is a∣ny way attracted by it; and besides this, the mo∣thers blood is not in the egge neither, nor any other prepared matter, out of which the males seed might form this first genital part, the author of all the rest. Nor yet presently upon coition (while the seed as yet remaines within, and is tangent) doth any particle of the chicken exist, but many dayes after, upon Incubation. And it is likewise impro∣bable too, that in fishes, where the males geniture only toucheth the egge on the outside, but doth not enter into it, that the geniture should have any more operation and power upon it, (since it is meerly an external Agent) then the Cocks seed hath upon the Hennes egges which are now per∣fectly formed. Again, since presently after coition there is no track of the egge extant, but that it is afterwards generated by the Henne by her self, and that proli∣fical too, when now the Cocks seed is clean gone and vanished; it is unlikely that the foetus should be made by that seed in that egge, by one single motion, or by successive motions. Nor do prolifical eggs differ from improlifical, and subventaneons in this, that the former contain the
Cocks seed (as Aldrovandus would have it;) nor is there found any thing done or coagulated in the egge by the seed of the male, or any sensible alte∣ration made, (for there is no sensible difference at all between a prolifical, and an addle egge) and yet a prolifical, which is conceived a long time after coition, contains in it the power of both Sexes, and the capacity of being made, and of making a chic∣ken: as if it had deduced its original from the co∣ition of both Sexes, and their consent and conspi∣ring together in one, as Aristotle would have it; De gen. an. l. 1 c. 18. who being pressed by that argument, (as we have declared before concerning the generation of the egge) did constitute a soul in the egge; which if it be there, must without scruple be the principle and efficient, of all those things which are natural∣ly met with in the egge. For it is most certaine, What thing soever at last it prove which doth procreate the chicken out of the egge, (in whose fa∣brick so much skill, so divine contrivance and providence is required; fitting eyes for sight, the bill for reception of the meat, the feet for walking, the wings for flight, and all the other Utensils for some emploiment or other) that it is either a soul, or else something more worthy and excellent then a soul, working by wisdom and providence. And by the generation of the chicken it is also manifest, that whatsoever be the principium vitae, the first cause of life, and vegetation, was first of all in the heart. Wherefore, if it be the soul of the Chicken, it is plain that it also was in the Punctum saliens, and in the Blood; because we discover mo∣tion & sense there: for it moves and dances like an Animal; so that if the soule do exist in the Punctum saliens, building, nourishing, and enlarging the rest of the body, (as we have shewed in our History)
Then it flowes from the Heart as from the Spring∣head into the whole body. Likewise if the Egge be therefore Prolifical be∣cause de gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. it hath a soul, or (as Aristotle would have it) a part of the Vegetative soul; it is plaine, that the Punctum saliens, and the Genital animate part, doe proceed from the Soul of the egge; (for nothing is the Author of it self) and that the soul is derived from the egge into the Punctum saliens, by and by into the Heart, and at length into the Chic∣ken. Adde to these, if the egge have a prolifical vertue, and Vegetative soul, by which it erects a Pullus; and do owe them (as it is plain it doth, and all men confess it) to the seed of the Cock; it is then certain that this Seed is Animate: For so Aristotle: Whe∣ther the seed have a soul or no; there is the same reason Ibid. l. 2. c. 1. to be given for it as for the Parts. For no soul can be in any thing but in that whose soul it is; nor can there be any part which is not partaker of the soul: unless it be an aequivocal part, as the eye of a dead man. That therefore the seed hath a soul, and a being in potentiâ, is clear. It therefore follows out of what hath been said, that the Male is the Primary Efficient, in which Ratio, & forma, the Reason and Form is; which Efficient begets a prolifical seed, or Geniture rather, and that Geniture endowed with a Vegetative soul, (with which also its other parts are endowed) he doth transmit into the female. This Geniture be∣ing transmitted, it moveth the Matter in the Hen, that so an Animate egge may be produced; by which means the first particle of the Chicken is a∣nimated, and afterwards the whole Chicken. So that according to Aristotle, either the same soul is conveied by a Metempsychosis, from the Cock into
his Geniture, from his Geniture into the substance of the Hen, from thence into the egge, and from the egge into the Chicken; or else is raised up in the subsequent by the precedent things, namely by the Male, in his proper seed; by the seed, in the egg: and at last by the egge, in the Chicken, tanquam lu∣men de lumine, as light derived from light. The Efficient therefore which is sought for in the egge, from whence the Chicken is born, is a soul; and the soul of the Egge: for according to Aristotle, the soul is onely in that thing, whose soule it is. But it is manifest that the Seed of the Male is not the Efficient of the Chicken, neither an Instru∣ment, by whose motion the Chicken might be for∣med, (as Aristotle would have it) nor as an A∣nimate substance, as if the soul were its soul. For in the egge there is no seed at all, either now touching it, or that ever did touch it, (and it is impossible that that should move, which doth not touch; Ibid. or that any thing should be affected by that, which doth not move it) and therefore the seeds soul ought not to be said to be in it. And yet though the soul be the Efficient in the Egge, yet it doth not appear to be derived rather from the Cock, or his seed, then from the Hen. Nor is it transferred by a Metempsychosis, or cer∣tain translation of the soul from the Cock and his seed, into the egge, and thence into the Chicken? For how can it be translated into the Egges that are yet to come, and to be conceived after Coiti∣on? Unless some Animate Seed do lurke in the Hen all the while; or else the soul onely without seed be translated, that so it may be afterwards infused into the Egge when the Egg shall be made. But neither of these is true. For the seed is
no where found in the Hen: nor is it possible that the Hen should after Coition possess two souls; namely, her own, and the soul of the future eggs, and Chickens: for the soul is never said to be, but in that whose soul it is: much lesse can one, or more souls lye lurking in the Hen, that so they may at∣tend the future eggs and chickens which are to be born in their order. We have deduced these passages out of Aristotle, that from them it might appear, how the Cocks seed doth, according to him, produce the Chicken out of the Egge, that so some light might be af∣forded to this perplext disquisition. But seeing they do not explaine how this business is accom∣plished, nor yet salve his own objections; we are still sticking in the same mire, and involved in the same doubts, (concerning the Efficient cause of the Foetus, in the Generation of Animals) nay so far are we from receiving any clear satisfacti∣on, that we are rather more perplext, and to seek, then we were before. And therefore no wonder this excellent Philosopher was in the streights concerning this matter, and did therefore range together so many several sorts of efficient causes of Animals, and sometims betake himself to ex∣amples drawn from Automata, things seeming to move of themselves, sometimes to coagulatedmat∣ter, sometimes to Art, Instruments, and Motion; sometimes to the soul in the egge, and in the seed of the Male, (to illustrate the thing) and where he seems to be positive and settle upon some de∣termination, concerning what it may be, that should render the Seed, (be it of Plants, or Ani∣mals) fertile; he renounces Heat and Fire, as im∣proper Agents; nor doth he admit any such like faculty; nor can he find out any thing in the seed
it self, which should be fit for the undertaking; but is compelled to admit of a certain Incorpore∣al extrinsecal thing, which should (like Art, or the Minde) form the foetus by wisedom and provi∣dence, and ordain and institute all things relating to it, to some end and purpose, and to its better subsistence. He takes, I say, sanctuary, in an ob∣scure and ignote thing; namely, in a spirit contai∣ned in the seed and frothy substance, and a certain nature in that spirit answerable in proportion to the substance of the Stars. But what that should be, he no where reveals. Fabricius his Opinion concerning the Efficient cause of the Chicken is confuted. EXERCIT. XLVIII. SInce I have proposed Aristotle, the chiefest of the old Philosophers, and Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente, an eminent Anatomist amongst the Modern, to be my Leaders, that from them I might chiefly be enlightened concerning the generation of Animals, and since I cannot better my self by Ari∣stotle, I have resolved to set upon Fabricius, to see what account he can give of it. Now he attempts to give resolution to three doubts arising in the case: namely, First, What is the Efficient of the Chicken? and that he concludes to be the Males seed. 2. How this appears in the egg to be so, and by what means the Cocks seed doth
rinder the egge fertile? Lastly, In what Order are the parts of the Chicken procreated? As for the first, it appears out of our Observati∣ons, that the Cock and his seed are indeed the Effici∣cient cause of Generation, but not the adaequate cause; but that the Henne also comes in for a share. In this place therefore we must chiefly enquire, how the Cocks seed doth fructifie the Egge, and raise a Chicken out of it, which would else be subventa∣neous, and improlifical. But let us give ear to Fabricius: Those creatures, pag. 38. saith he, that are produced out of an egge, are differ∣ent from those which are born out of seed; in this, that Oviparous creatures have a matter, out of which the Chicken is corporated, distinct and separate from the Agent: but Viviparous creatures have both the ma∣terial and efficient cause adjoyned, and concorporated together. For the Agent in Oviparous creatures, is the seed of the Cock in the feathered kind, which neither is, nor can be in the Egge: but the matter out of which the Chicken is corporated, is the Chalaza. These two are much distant one from another; for the Chalaza is in the Yolk now formed, and fallen into the second U∣terus, and is adjoyned intimately to the egge: on the contrary, the Cocks seed remains neer the fundament, and is removed from the Chalaza by a large chasme, and yet by its irradiating faculty it fructifies both the Uterus, and all the egge. But in a Viviparous animal, the seed is both the Matter, and the Efficient too, both being contracted into one body. He seems to have introduced this difference be∣tween Oviparous and Viviparous Animals; that so he might countenance the opinion of Physitians concerning the Generation of Man, or at least not subvert it; who conceive that the seeds of both
Sexes, ejected together in coition are mingled, and according as the one prevailes over the other, so the one approves it self the Efficient, and the other submits it self to become the Matter; so that they both conspiring together, do constitute the conception in Viviparous Animals. But when he had observed, that neither Seed nor Blood is attracted by means of coition into the womb of the Hen, nor contained there, and could not believe, that any thing emitted from the cock in coition, could possibly arrive so farre, nor could finde any thing in the Egge, that is adjoined to the males seed, he was enforced to doubt, how the seed (which is no where present with, nor mingled a∣mongst the feminine geniture, nor is adjoined to it, nor doth so much as touch it at all) should con∣stitute the Chicken, or fructifie the Egge? especi∣ally when he had before delivered, that from some premised coitions, all the eggs that were to be layed that year, were made prolifical. For how could it chuse but seem impossible, that from the seed of the cock received in the Spring (but now departed, lost, and consumed) the posthume eggs (layed possi∣bly in Summer or Autumne) should be rendered fruitfull, and produce chickens? That he might rid his hands of this grand diffi∣cultie, he coined the fore-said distinction; and to ratifie his opinion, he adds three farther Asserti∣ons: First, that though the cocks seed were neither in the Egge, nor at any time in the Womb, nor adjoined to the material cause, (as it is in Vivipa∣rous Animals) yet it continues for a whole year in the hen. Secondly, to reserve this seed in, he in∣vents a dark perforation, neer the door of the Womb, wherein the cock should deposite his seed, and in which (as in a pouch) it should be conclu∣ded;
that thence all the eggs might receive their fertility. Lastly, though the seed in that pouch, neither touch the womb, the egge, nor the Ovary, that by that means it might fructifie the egge, or raise a Chicken out of it; yet, he saith, that it gains addresses into the very egge, by the insinua∣tion, or irradiation of a certain spiritual substance in it, and by those arts doth fructifie the Chalazae, and so model a Chicken. And yet by that assertion lie seems to confirme Aristotles opinion (who as∣sures us that the female contributes the matter, and the male the efficiency to generation) which is con∣trary to the Physitians position concerning the commixture of seeds: for whose sake he seems to have introduced his fore-said distinction between Oviparous, and Viviparous Animals. And that this his opinion may seem more probable, he recites what changes and alterations the seed reserved in the Testicles and seminary Vesicles, not yet emitted, doth procure in Animals. But to take no notice that all this makes litle to his purpose: (for the question in chief is not, How the Cocks seed doth render the egge fertile? but rather, How it doth frame and erect a Chicken out of the Egge?) all those things which he hath conjured up to guard his opinion, seem for the most part false, or very suspicious; as appears by our Observations delivered in this History. For nei∣ther is that blinde perforation in the root of the rump (which he calls the purse, or pouch) destined to cubbard up the Cocks seed, nor is there (as we have said) any seed at all found in it: but it is an empty unprovided thing both in the Cock, and Henne. But what he would have by his spiritual sub∣stance, and irradiation, he is yet to acquaint us, as
also what substance hee understands that to be, which he affirms, doth by its virtue vivifie the egg, Whether a corporeal, or formal substance, which should proceed from the irradiation of the seed, (which lies at roost in the pouch) and (which is chiefly required) should fashion the Chicken out of the egge. To conclude, in my minde, he saith no more in substance then this: It makes the Chicken, because it irradiates the Egge; and forms it, because it vivi∣fies it: and so he labours to reveal and illustrate the obscure manner of formation, by one more obscure then it self. For the same scruple returns entire; namely, how the Cocks seed, a meer non∣tangent, an external efficient, and disjoyned by place, remaining in the pouch, can fashion the in∣teriour parts (that is, the Heart, Liver, Lungs, and Guts, &c.) in the egge out of the Chalazae, by Irra∣diation? Unless he will have it sitting in its chair of State, like the Creator of all, only by this word of comman, Fiant, Let all things be so; (namely the Bones for Support, the Muscles for Motion, the Organs for Sense; the Members for Acti∣on, the Intrals for Concoction, and the like) and so order, and by its beams or influence constitute all things to their proper end, with providence, wis∣dom, and art. For neither doth Fabricius expound the manner, nor yet demonstrate the seed to be of such force and virtue, that (without coming neer) it can effect all this; especially since an egge can, by Incubation of a stranger fowle, or any other fo∣stering warmth; as in dung, in a matt, or an oven, though never so remote from the pouch of its own mother-hen, be quickened, and produce a foetus. The same difficulty therefore lyes still upon our hands; namely, How the Cocks seed is the Efficient
cause of the Chicken? nor is it any whit salved by the influence of this spiritual substance. For though we should grant, that the seed is reserved in the purse, and that by a Metamorphosis, and Irra∣diation, it did corporate the chicken out of the Cha∣lazae: yet the scruple would stick no less by us; namely, How the Intrals of the Chicken are model∣led. But these things are long since confuted by us. Wherefore, when we are in quest of the efficient cause of the Chicken, we must look for it in the Egge, and not dormant in a pouch; and for such a one, which, though the egg now grown stale, were distant many miles from the Hen, and laid under an other Hen (as a Turkey-hen, or African-hen) to be hatched; or (as in Aegypt) under warm sand, or dung, or in an Oven proper for the purpose, would still raise up a chicken, of the same species, and very like the Cock and Hen that were its natu∣ral parents; or else (in case the Cock were of a dif∣ferent kinde) a mungrel of-spring, of a mixt spe∣cies, and resemblance. Wherefore the knot remains to be united, which neither Aristotle nor Fabricius have loosened; namely, How the seed of the Male, or Cock, doth produce the chicken out of the egge, or is to be na∣med the Efficient cause of the chicken, especially, since it is neither present, tangent, nor adjoined to the Egge? And though almost all men con∣clude, that the Male, and its seed are the Efficient cause of the Foetus; no man yet hath suffici∣ently declared, how it can be done, especially in our Hen-egg.
The Efficient cause of the Chicken, is hard to be found out. EXER. XLIX. THe disquisition of the Efficient is exceeding difficult; (as we have said) and that the rather, because so many names are attributed to it. Whereupon Aristotle doth recount very many effi∣cient causes of Animals: And many controversies are risen amongst authors; chiefly, between Phy∣sitians and Aristotelians, who contend very earnest∣ly about it; endeavouring by different opinions to explain both the Efficient cause, and the man∣ner of its Efficiency. And indeed the Omnipotent Creator, doth in none of his works more manifestly reveale the presence of his Deity, then in the Fabrick and Structure of Animals. And though it be a known thing, sub∣scribed by all, that the foetus assumes its original and birth from the Male and Female, and conse∣quently that the Egge is produced by the Cock and Henne, and the Chicken out of the Egge: yet neither the Schools of Physitians, nor Aristo∣tles discerning Brain, have disclosed the manner, how the Cock and its seed, doth mint and coine the Chicken out of the Egge. For it is evident e∣nough, by what we have delivered, concerning the Generation of Oviparous Animals, and others, that neither the Opinion of Physitians, deducing Generation from the mixture of the Seeds of both Sexes, nor Aristotles neither, establishing the seed of the Male for the Efficient, and the Menstruous Blood for the material Cause, are to be embraced:
because that neither in Coition, nor presently up∣on Coition, any thing doth part from the Female into the Cavity of the Uterus; out of which, as out of the Matter, any thing relating to the Foetus should be suddenly produced: nor doth the Ge∣niture of the Male (whether it be animate it self, or an animate Instrument) enter into the Womb, or is attracted thither, or any where else reser∣ved in the Female, but doth either vanish, or retract: nor is there any thing else to be found in the Uterus presently after Coition, which issu∣ing either from the Male or Female, may be fan∣sied to be the Matter or Original of the future Foe∣tus. Nor is the Cocks seed surviving in Fabricius his Pouch, or any where else in the Henne; that thence, either by the irradiation and influence of spiritual substance, or by contact the egge is made, or a Chicken out of the Egge. Nor doth the Hen contribute any other seed, then the Papulae, the Yolk, and the Egge. And therefore the contem∣plation is rendered more intricate by our Obser∣vations; because by them all those suppositions, upon which both the other opinions were sup∣ported, are thrown down to the ground. But especially, when we shall anon demonstrate, that all Animals are alike generated out of an Egge; and that in Coition (whether of Viviparous, Brutes, or Men) no Seed or Blood, proceeding from ei∣ther Male or Female, is entertained in the Hollow of the Womb, or drawn up thither before Coition, or in Coition, or after Coition is found in the Womb, which may be conceived to be the Matter Efficient, or Principle of the future Foetus. Daniel Sennertus, a late learned Man, and a careful Inquirer into Nature, having first ballanced other mens opinions, attempts at last to resolve
the business; concluding that the Soul is in the Seed, and that it is the very same Soul with that, which afterwards informs the Infant: so that he makes no scruple to affirm that the Rational soul of man, is present in his Seed: and that therefore the Egge possesses the Soul of the Chicken: and that the soul is conveied with the Seed into the Womb of the Female: and from that seed of both Sexes conjoyned (as one flame to another) but not mix∣ed (for mixture, saith he, respects things of di∣verse Species) but indowed with a soul, a perfect Animal doth result. And therefore, saith he, the Seed of both Sexes is required, both to the consti∣tution of an Infant, and of an egge. And thus, (like one that had subdued all difficulties) He conceives, he hath delivered a certain and per∣spicuous Truth. But, granting that there is a Soul in the egge, and that soul united and made up of the souls of the Pa∣rents, and sometimes proceeding from Parents of of several kinds, as from a Mare and an Ass, from a Dunghil-Hen and a Cock-Pheasant; and that it is not Mixed, but United; and that the Chicken (after the manner of the Seed of Vegetables) is made by that efficient soul, being afterwards pre∣served by it, all its life long: so that it be coun∣ted absurd to affirm, that the foetus is cherished by one soul out of the Uterus, or egge; and by ano∣ther in the Uterus or egge: suppose, I say, we grant all this (though it be invalid, and doubtful) yet our History of the Generation out of the Egge, doth utterly subvert, and confute as false the very foun∣dation and basis upon which all his doctrine leans, and relies: Which is this, That the egge is con∣stituted of the Seed of Cock and Hen: or, that the seed is transmitted from both into the Uterus: or
that the foetus, or any part of it is formed of the seed so entertained by the womb, or cast into it: or, that the seed of the Cock (as an Ef∣ficient cause, or Operatour) is any where reserved in the Hen, which (as he conceives) draws matter and nutriment from her into the Womb, to support the foetus which it hath made. For the conditions which he himself according to Aristotle reputes necessary, will be found wanting: namely, that the foetus ought to be made of that which actually is in being, and doth pre-exist: and that the Chic∣ken is nourished by that which is present with it, and in the same place where it self is first consti∣tuted: As also, that it should be made by that which doth operate being immediately conjoyned to it; and ought to be the same thing, by which the chicken is preserved, and augmented all its life-time. For the cocks seed (whether Animate, or Inanimate, it matters nothing) is not at all in the Egge, not in the Uterus, present, and conjoy∣ned; nor in the matter whence the chicken is fra∣med, as neither in the Chicken it self now begun, that so it may either frame, or perfect it. He miscarries likewise, when he goes about to illustrate his opinion concerning the Animal seed, by allusion to that of Plants, and Mast: because he did not understand the difference alledged by Aristotle, between the Geniture proceedings by coi∣tion, and the first conception made out of both Sexes; nor did observe that an egge might be first conceived in the Cluster of the Vitellary (without the translation of any Geniture from Male and Fe∣male into the Uterus.) Nor did he apprehend that the Uterus, even for some time after Coition, is quite void of any matter at all, either transmit∣ted from the Parents, or made by Coition, or oc∣casioned
any other way. Nor had he read, or at least observed Fabricius his experiment; namely, that after some Coitions of the Cock, the Hen may be so fructified, that from that time for the whole succeeding year she may lay all Prolifical Egges: though she have not in the interim conversed with the cock, whereby each particular egge might re∣ceive fecundity; nor yet retained so long the seed she formerly received. This is agreed upon by universal consent; that all Animals whatsoever, which arise from Male and Female, are generated by the coition of both Sexes; and so begotten as it were per contagium aliquod, by a kind of contagion. In like manner as Physitians observe, that contagious diseases (as the Leprosie, the Pox, the Plague, and Pthisick) do propagate their infection, and beget themselves in bodies yet sound and untoucht, meerly by an extrinsecal contact; nay sometimes onely by the breath, and per , by inquination; and that at a distance, through an inanimate medium, and that medium no way sensibly altered. So that, that which had the first touch, begets an Univocal like it self, not as touching at this instant, nor yet now actually in being, nor as present, or con∣joined, but meerly because it once hath touch∣ed. Of so great operation and energy is Contagi∣on. And perhaps the same thing obtains in the Generation of Animals. For Fishes egges, which acquire their growth abroad at their own dispose, without any Male-seed, (and therefore do with∣out all doubt live without it) being besprinkled with the Males prolifical milkey substance, and on∣ly tinctured from without, do generate fishes. Tis not, I say, an intromission, or intimate reception of the masculine seed into each particular egge,
which sets it a work about the fabrick of bodies, or introduces the soul, but a bare contact. Where∣upon Aristotle calls lac maris, the Males milk, or Hist. an. l. 6. c. 13. genital seed cast into water, sometimes genital, and propagating liquor: and sometimes Vital Ve∣nom. For saith he, The Masculine fish sprinckles the egges with genital seed, and those egges which that Vitale Virus, Vital or quickning Venom touches, out of them are born fishes. It being therefore laid down as an undoubted principle, that the foetus is made by Contagion, there will a weighty doubt arise; namely, how bare Contagion can be the author of so great a work? and how the parents can by that generate issues like themselves; or the males seed produce an Univocal like that creature from which it proceeded? since after contact it bids a∣dieu, and is no longer in being, or touching, or present at all, but clean corrupted, and a Non-ens. How, say I, can a Non-ens act? or a Non-tangens erect a fabrick like it self? or that which is dead it self, impart a life to another thing, and meerly upon this account, that the time was when it did touch. For Aristotles argumentation seems false, or de gen. an. l. 1. c. 6. lame at least, where he contends: That Generation cannot be without an Agent and a Patient: and those things cannot act and suffer, which do not mutually touch each other: but those things do mutually touch, which having each their particular magnitude and place apart, have their extremities meeting one another. But since the case is plain, that Contagion (where the things touch not, nor have their extremities kissing one another) can destroy living creatures, what should hinder, but that it should be as pow∣erful, to conduce to the life and generation of ani∣mals.?
The Efficient in an Egge, by a plasti∣cal vertue (because the male did but onely touch, though he now be far from touching, and have no extremity reached out towards it) doth frame and set up a foetus in its own species and resem∣blance. And this author of fecundity, this peir∣cing power is translated through so many mediums or instruments, that one cannot pattern it, neither by that mutation procured by instruments (as in the productions of Art) nor by Aristotles Automa∣ta, nor our Clocks or Watches; nor by the instance of a King in his own dominions, where his com∣mand is every where a law; nor can you ratifie this our doctrine, by introducing a soul into the seed or geniture. And hereupon many controversies, and pro∣blemes are started concerning the attractive pow∣er of the Load-stone and Jet: concerning Sympathy, and Antipathy, concerning Poyson, and the con∣tagion of pestilential diseases: concerning Alexi∣pharmacal Medicines, and such as cure or kill from an occult (or rather ignote) quality and propriety: all which seem to execute their pleasures without any touching. And chiefly this. What is there in generation, that by a momentany touch (nay not touching at all, unlesse through the sides of many mediums) can orderly constitute the parts of the Chicken by an Epigenesis, and produce an Univo∣cal creature, and its own like? and for no other reason, but because it touched heretofore. How, I say, can that which is not present, and did one∣ly touch outwardly, constitute, orderly dispose and limne all the members of the Chicken, in an egg which is now exposed to the wide world, and of∣tentimes transported a great way off. For nothing can make and generate it selfe into anothers like∣ness.
What the Efficient cause of Animals is; and what its Conditions. EXERCIT. L. THat therefore we may in some proportion dive into the knowledge of the efficient cause, (so far forth as concerns our present contempla∣tion) we must take notice first of the Instruments or Mediums which pertain to the efficient or for∣ming cause: and into this rank is the Male and Female for to be reduced, likewise the Geniture, and the egg, and its first rudiment. For some males (and females too) are barren, or unfruitful. And like∣wise the males geniture is sometimes more, and sometimes less fertile: for the Semen Virile as it is barely conteined in the Seminal Vesicles (except it be rarified into froth by the spirits, and force∣ably leap out) is unfruitful. And this too, possi∣bly is not always successful. Nor are the Papulae, or Yolks bred in the Cluster of the Ovary, or the Egges conteined in the Womb, all presently fruit∣full. Now I call that fruitful, which (except some im∣pediment happen from without) will attaine its designed end, by the efficient power implanted in it, and compass that, for whose sake it is ordai∣ned. So that Cock is reputed fertile, who causes his Hens to lay oftner, and more constantly, and also renders their egges generative. So likewise that Hen is fruitful, which is use∣ful in laying egges, and hath a good retention in order to the prolifical vertue imparted to her from
the Cock. So the Cluster of the Papulae, and Ovary it self are counted fertile, when they are well fraught with store of rudiments and foundations of egges, and those mature. Likewise that egge is fertile, which is farthest from being subventaneous or addle, and doth less faile in producing a Chicken, howsoever you dis∣pose of it, either to Incubation, or any other foste∣ring-heat. Therefore such an efficient of the Chicken is re∣quired, as may impart virtue to all these, by which they may be fructified, and obtain an effi∣cient power; for the same thing, or at least some∣thing proportionable to it, is in them all, be∣stowing fecundity upon them. And the Inquiry is the same, namely, what it is in the Egge, that ren∣ders it fertile: what in the Ovary, and what in the Papula; likewise what in the female, and last∣ly in the seed and Cock himself, &c. What in the Blood, and Punctum saliens, or first genital particle, from whence afterwards the rise, fabrick, and order of all the other parts is derived: as also, what is it in the Chicken it self, from whence it grows sturdy and active, attains its youth and maturity, lives a healthy life, and a long. Nor is that inquiry unlike this, which de∣mands, what both male, and female (Cock and Hen) confer to the fertile egge; or what it is which proceeds from both, towards the perfection and si∣militude of the chicken; as whether the egge, con∣ception, matter, and nutriment proceed from the female, and the Operative virtue from the male; whe∣ther a certain contagion sent forth by coition, or cre∣ated by it, or received from it, remaining in the Hen or Egges, work upon the matter of the egge; or attract a nutriment from the Hen, concocting
and distributing it, to the encrease of the egge, and afterwards to the production of the chicken: Or lastly, whether all that which relates to the form, soul, and fecundity, do proceed from the male; but from the female, whatever relates to the matter, constitution, place, and sustenance. For in animals (whose Sexes are distinct) it is so contrived, that because the female cannot alone generate, nourish, & protect the foetus, the male is joined as yoke-fel∣low in the task (as the Superior, and more emi∣nent progenitor) to supply her failings; and so to correct the infirmity of the Subventaneous eggs, and inspire them with fertility. For as a chicken born of an egge, is indebted to that egge for his body, soul, and principal or genital part: So is the egge for all it has, to the Henne; and the Henne also for her fecundity to the Cock. But whether the male be the first and principal cause of the progeny, or whether the male and the female are intermediate and Instrumental causes set awork by nature, or the first and Supreme Genitor, we have here an occasion offered to enquire; and it is a very worthy and necessary one, because all perfect science depends upon the knowledge of all causes: and therefore to the plenary comprehen∣sion of Generation, we must ascend from the last and lowest efficient to the very first and most su∣preme, and know them all. But as for the first and highest Efficient of the chicken, we shall determine what that is after∣wards, (when we treat of the Efficient of all other Animals) but what kind of one it is, we will here declare. The first condition, or qualification, of the first and primary Efficient properly so called, is, that
it be the first & principal fructifier, from whence all intermediate causes assume their derived fecundity. For instance, the chicken is derived from the Punctum saliens in the egg, not only in regard of its bulk, but also, and that chiefly in regard of its soul; the Pun∣ctum saliens, or Heart is derived from the egg, the egg from the Hens, and the Hens fertility from the Cock. Another requisite or condition of the primary Ef∣ficient is desumed ex opere facto, from the production it self, viz. the Chicken: because that is the prime ef∣ficient, in which the reason of the effect doth chiefly appear. But because every Generative efficient doth generate its like, and the issue is of a mixt nature; the first efficient must needs be mixt too. Now I therefore pronounce their issue to be of a mixt nature, because, the mixture of both parents is refulgent in it, both in the figure and lineaments of the body, and all its parts; as in complexion or colors, moles or spots, diseases, and other accidents of the bo∣dy. Likewise in the soul and actions, and functions (as in like manners, docility, gate, and voice) such a kinde of temperature is discoverable. For as we say that a similar mixt body is made of the Elements, because their virtues, heat, cold, moisture, and sccity, are found compounded in the same similar body: so likewise the paternal and maternal handy-work may be tracked and pointed out both in the body, soul, and other accidents of the Chicken: (which fol∣low the temperature, or happen unto it) for in∣stance; In a Mule, the soul, body, manners, and voice of both parents; (viz. of the Mare, and the Ass) are apparent. So also in those Chickens which are the Ofspring of the dunghill-hen, and Cock-Pheasant: and in that mungrel Curre, which is produced by the sodomie of a Wolf and a Bitch. Since therefore the Chicken resembles both pa∣rents,
and is a mixt Effect: the generant primary cause (which it resembles) must needs be mixt likewise. Therefore that which frames the Chicken in the Egge is a mixt nature (as being united, or compounded of both) and the work of both pa∣rents. And if any contagion do arise or remain in the female upon coition, (in which they two are mixt, and become as it were one Animal) that al∣so will be of a mixt nature or power, by which the egge shall afterwards become fertile, and at∣chieve a plastical virtue, which is an Agent of a mixt nature, or a mixt efficient-Instrument, produ∣cing a Chicken of a mixt nature also. The contagion, I say; because Aristotles perswa∣sion is altogether refractory to experience her self: namely, where he saith, that some part of the Foetus is instantly made upon coition. Nor is that true neither, which some of the Moderns averre, namely, that the soul of the future chicken is in the egge: for that is no whit the chickens soul, which is in no part of the chickens body. Nor can the soul be said either to be begotten, or left behind presently upon coition: for otherwise there should be two souls in a Woman with child. Therefore till it be determined what the efficient of the egge is, which is of a mixt nature, and ought to remaine present upon coition: give me leave to call it con∣tagium, Contact, or contagion. But where the contagion lurks in the female after coition, and how it is communicated and derived to the egge, requires a more exact Disquisition: and we will afterwards fall upon it, when we treat generally of the conception of females. It shall suf∣fice, in the mean time to have taken notice, that it must needs be the fate of the first efficient (in which the reason of the future off-spring doth a∣bide)
that, since its off-spring is mixt, to be of a mixt nature it selfe; and either to proceed from both Parents, or from something which makes use of both (as animate Instruments, cooperative, and mixt, and moulded into one by coition.) The third condition of the Primary Efficient is, that either it impart motion successively to all its in∣termediate instruments, or else employ them other∣wise, but that it selfe be subservient to none: whence a doubt arises, whether the Cock be the Primary Efficient in the Generation of the chicken, or have any before, or superior to him. For all genera¦tion seems to be derived from Heaven, and issue from the motion of the Sun, and Moon. But we wil be positive in this matter, when we have first declared, what an instrument, or the instrumental efficient cause is, and how divided. Now Instrumental Efficients are of diverse kinds; some, according to Aristotle, are factiva, Making, and some, activa, Doing; some do not operate, but when they are conjoyned with a prior efficient, as the hand, foot, and genital parts; others operate, disjoined, as the Geniture and the Egge: some Instruments have not motion or action, but what is given them by the first Efficient; others have pro∣per internal principles of their own, to which na∣ture affords no motion in generation, but yet em∣ploys their faculties, and sets them the rule, and law of their performances; as the Cook employes fire, and the Physitian herbs, and the vertues of medicines to cures. Sennertus, to maintain his conceipt, concerning the soul in the Seed, and the formative faculty in the Egge, affirms, that not onely the Egge, but the Cocks seed also, is indowed with the soul of the fu∣ture Chicken, and is not the Instrumental Agent, but
the principal; absolutely denying that any sepa∣rate Efficient, is Instrumental: but pronouncing, that onely that is to be reckoned an Instrument in propriety of speech, which is conjoined with the pri∣mary efficient: and that, that onely is an Instru∣mental efficient, which hath no other motion, or action, then that which is immitted, or continu∣ally and successively received from the primary ef∣ficient, by whose power it acts. And upon that account, he rejects the instance concerning things cast or hurled, which receiving their force from the thing that doth hurle, do yet notwithstanding move, even when they are separated from it. As if the Sword and Speare were to be counted Instru∣ments of War, but not Arrows, and Bullets. Hee also rejects the instance drawn from a Republick, and denies that the Magistrates, Counsellors, or Officers of a Common-wealth, are the Instruments of a Nation: And yet Aristotle reckons a Counsellor for Polit. l. 1. c. 4. an Efficient, and calls on Officer an Instrument, in plain termes. He likewise decries the instance of the Automata, and many other things, that so he may ratifie the seed (or egge) to be Animals, and not an Instrumental, but a Principal Agent. And yet (as if he were enforced by the truth) he laies down such conditions for a Principal Agent, as do absolutely prove contrary to his own fore-menti∣oned opinion. Whatsoever produceth a work, or ef∣fect more noble then it selfe; or else an effect lake to it selfe, is not an Efficient, but an Instrumental cause. Which being granted, who will not conclude, that Seed and an Egge, are Instruments? Since a chicken is an effect nobler then the egge, and nei∣ther like an Egge, nor Seed. Wherefore, when this most Learned Man denies the Seed or Egge, to be an Instrument, because they are separated from
the Primary Agent, he stands upon a false bottom. For since the first generant produceth its off-spring by several mediums, whether any of those mediums be conjoined to it, as the Hand to the Artist; or whether it be separated from it, as the Arrow shot from the Bow; yet both are called Instruments. From these recited Conditions of the Instrumen∣tal cause, it may seem to insue, that the cock, or at least the cock with the hen, are the Primary ef∣ficients in the Generation of the chicken: for the chicken is like them; nor can it be thought to be more noble then its Efficients or Parents. I shall therefore adde one condition more to the Prima∣ry efficient, by which perhaps it may appear that the Male is not the Primary, but the Instrumentall cause; namely, that it is required of the Primary efficient in the fabrick of the Chicken, that he em∣ploy Skill, Providence, Wisdome, Goodness, and Understanding, far above the capacity of our rati∣onal soules; as that, in which the Reason or Idea of the future work, ought to consist, and which ought likewise to act for some destinated end, dis∣posing and perfecting all parts, forming the smallest and most inconsiderable appendixes of the Chicken for some use, and employment: not pro∣viding onely for the structure of the creature, but for its wellfare, ornament, and defence. Now the male, or his seed, either in, or after coition, is not so qualified, that Art, Understan∣ding, and Providence, may be attributed to it. Which things being pondered, the Male seems to be an Instrumental efficient, as well as his seed, and the Hen likewise as well as the Egge she laies. And therefore we must take our flight to a more Primary, Superior, and more excellent cause; to which we may justly attribute Providence, Understanding,
Art, and Goodness; and such a one as is as much superiour to its effects and Workmanship, as an Architect is better then a Barn he sets up; a Prince then his Officers, or an Artist, then his owne hands. And therefore both Male and Female are but In∣strumental efficients, subservient to the high Creator, or Protogenitor. And in this sense it is truly said, that the Sun, and Man, beget an Animal, because the Spring and Autumn do insue upon the Ap∣proaching and Receding Sun, at which times com∣monly, the generation and corruption of Animals happen. So the chiefest of Philosophers. The first De Gen. & Corr. l. 2. c. 10. Movers motion is not the cause of generation and corruption, but the motion of the Oblique circle: for that is continual, and hath also two Motions: for if generation and corruption were to be always continual, it were necessary that something should be always mo∣ved, least those mutations should fail; but yet it must have two motions, least one onely of the two mutations should succeed. The cause therefore of the continuity is the motion of the Universe, but the declivity it selfe is the cause of the Approach, and the Recesses. For it comes to pass, that He, (namely the Sun) is some∣times neerer, and sometimes farther from the earth. And when the Interval is inequal, the motion must be inequal too. If then he therefore generate because he approaches neerer: and cause corruption, because he remotes and recedeth farther from the earth: Then it follows that if he often do generate, it is because he often approacheth: and if he often cause corruption, it is because he often recedeth. For contraries have contrary causes. And therefore in the Spring all things flourish and grow; (namely, from the Approach of the Sun, who is the Common Father, and Parent: or
at least the immediate and Common Instrument in Generation imployed by the high Creator) and that not Vegetables onely, but Animals too: nor they onely which are Spontaneous issues, but those also which are generated by Male and Female. As if at the approach of this noble Planet, soft Venus did descend from the Skie, with Cupid and the Graces entertained for her Retinue, inciting and provoking all living things, by their Allegeance to Love, to propagate their kind. Or (as it is in the Fable) as if Saturne did then become an Eunuch, and threw his masculine evidences into the Sea, to raise a Foam, which might give birth to Venus: For in the Generation of Animals, Superat tener omnibus humor; A gentle dew doth moisten all (as the Poet hath it) and the genital parts doe foam and strut with Seed. And therefore the cock and Hen are chiefly fruit∣full in Spring, as if the Sun, or Heavens, Nature, the Soul of the Universe, or the Omnipotent Deity (for these are Synonoma's) were a Superiour and Diviner cause of Generation then they. So, Sol & homo generant hominem; The Sun, and Man beget a Man (that is to say) the Sun by Man as its Instru∣ment. And so, the Creator of all things, and the cock, beget an egge, and out of an egge a chicken: namely, by the constant approach and recesse of the Sun: who according to the will, and decree of the Almighty, is emploied in the generation of all things. We conclude therefore that the male (though he be a Primary and more excellent efficient then the female) is only an Instrumental Efficient: and doth himselfe, no less then the Female, owe his fecundity, or generative Virtue to the Sun his Cre∣ditour: and therefore the artifice and providence
(which we discover in his workmanship) doth not proceed from him, but God. For the Male uses neither counsel, nor understanding in generati∣on: nor doe Men generate by any part of their reasonable soule, but by a faculty of their vegeta∣tive: which is not inrouled amongst the primary, and more devine powers of the soule, but the meanest, and basest. Since therefore in the structure of a chicken, Art and Providence are no less visible, then in the Fa∣brick of Man himselfe, and the creation of the U∣niverse: we must needs acknowledge, that in the generation of Man, there is an Efficient cause more excellent then man himselfe: or else that the ve∣getative faculty, or that part of the soule, which raiseth this pile of man, and doth conserve it, is much more divine and excellent, and doth more personate the Image of God, then the Rational part it selfe: whose worth and dignity we more cry up, then all the faculties of the soule beside; though she were Regent and Empress of the rest, and held them all as Tributaries to her. Or at least wee must confess, that there is neither prudence, nor skill, nor understanding in the workes of Nature, but they seem such onely to our apprehensions, who iudge of the divine productions of nature, by our owne Arts, and Faculties, (or copies drawne by our own fancies) as if the active principles of Nature did so produce their effects, as we do our artificial issues: namely by consultation, and rules desumed from the Minde and Intellect. But Na∣ture, which is the Principle of Motion and Rest, in all those things wherein she is: and the vege∣tative soule, which is the primary Efficient cause of every generation, doe move and act by no acqui∣red faculty (as we doe) which may be distinguish∣ed
by the name of Art, or Providence, but work by a certain Destiny, and Mandat according to rule, after the same manner, and constraint, as light things fly up, and heavy press downwards. The Vegetative faculty of Parents doth generate, and the seed arrives at last at the forme of the foetus, after the same manner as the Spider spreads her Net, the Bees and Ants build their Cottages, and furnish their store-houses for future exigences, Birds compile their Nests, hatch, and protect their young: namely, Naturally, and by their Mother∣wit, not by any discursive providence, discipline, or consultation. For that which is in us the Principle of Artificial operations, & is called Art, Understand∣ing, or Prudence: is in those naturall effects, Nature, (which is , her own Tutor, and taught by no man) and what is acquired, and a purchase in us, is in them inbred, and a Birth∣right. And therefore they who look back to Art, are incompetent and partial Judges of natu∣ral things: for we are rather to judge of the con∣trary, and compare artificial productions to their Sampler in Nature. For all Arts are attained by an imitation and personating of Nature; and our Reason, or Intellect is derived from the divine un∣derstanding, exercised in its works. And when it is rooted in us by a compleat habit, like ano∣ther adventitious acquired soul, reflecting a resem∣blance of the highest and divinest Agent, it produ∣ceth like effects and operations. Wherefore (in my opinion) he is the right and pious Philosopher, who deduceth the generations of all things from that eternal and Omnipotent Deity, upon whose pleasure the Universe dependeth. Nor do I think we ought to contend, by what notion we call, or adore this first Agent, (to whom all
the names of veneration are most due) whether that of Deus, or Natura naturans, or Anima mun∣di. For all men understand him to be that Begin∣ning and End of all things, which is Omnipotent, and everlasting, the Author and Creator of all things, preserving, and perpetuating the fluxibility of mortall creatures, by the several vicissitudes of generations: which being every where present, is no less assistant to the particular operations of natural things, then of the whole Universe; that so he may propagate all Animals by his Deity, Providence, Art, and divine Understan∣ding. Whereof some are spontaneous births, with∣out any Univocal efficient; some born by the asso∣ciat operations of male and female, some from one Sex onely; others by other intermediate Instru∣ments, which Instruments are sometimes fewer, sometimes more, sometimes univocal, and some∣times equivocal, and ex accidenti casual. But all natural bodies whatever are both the pro∣ductions, and Instruments of that Great God; and are either onely natural, as Heat, Spirit, the tepidi∣ty or warmth of the Air, or Putrefaction, &c. or ani∣mate also; for he makes use in some sort of the motions, faculties, and souls of animals themselves, in order to the perfection of the Universe, and pro∣creation of Animals. It appears therefore in some proportion, what the males contribution is towards generation; namely, the cock brings that same virtue to the egg, by which of a subventaneous it becomes a fertile one, as vegetable Fruits borrow from the Summer heat to ripen themselves, and fructifie their seeds; and which induceth fertility into spontaneous produ∣ctions, by which from worms they become a Can∣ker-worm, and from a Canker-worm, they be∣come the worm called Aurelia, and from an Aure∣lia,
Butterflies, common Flies, and Bees, &c. And in this manner the Sun by his access to the earth, is the Beginning of the motion and transmu∣tation in the Increase of Fruits; and the End also, when he becomes the author of the fertility of their Seeds. And as in the early Spring he is the primary efficient of Leaves, Blossoms, and Fruits, so is he the last compleater of the maturity and fecundity of the Seed in the strength of Summer. For confirma∣tion of which, amongst many other observations, I shall insert this one: There are some amongst us who manure their Orange-trees with a great deal of care and husbandry; so that the Oranges which the first year grew to the bigness of the top of ones thumb, are the next Summer mature and complete, save onely that they have no kernels, or seeds. While my thoughts were bent upon this contem∣plation, I fanfied these Oranges to be a Specimen of the Subventaneous eggs, which are produced by the Hen, without the Cocks assistance, having all the sensible appearances or requisites of fruitful eggs, bating onely the fecundity, or propagating seed. As if the same thing were conferred by the Cock upon a subventaneous egg, to make it fruitful, which the Sun contributes in hotter climats, whereby the fruit of their trees are produced with kernels. And as if the English Summer were no farther usefull to some fruit, then the simple Hen to the Egge, and were onely like the female, an impotent progeni∣tress: which Summer in other Countries, where they enjoy a greater bounty from the Suns pre∣sence, were a masculine Summer, and did complete her productions. This, by the by, that by the eggs example it might appear, what qualifications are required to a primary efficient in the generation of Animals.
For it is clear, that there is in an egg an operator (and also in every conception, and rudiment) which is not only infused into it from the fentale, but is first communicated from the male by the gemture in coition, but yet first of all contributed to the Male, from the Heavens, the Sun, or the Almighty Creator. It is likewise manifest, that this Operator or Agent, which is existent in the egge, and in e∣very seed, is so inspired with power from the Pa∣rents, that it fashions the chicken to the like∣ness of the Parents, not of it self; and that a mixt likeness too, as proceeding from them both united in coition: and since all things are trans∣acted with an admirable providence and wisdom, the presence of the divine Deity is clearly implyed. But of this we shall more largely treat else∣where, when we shall endeavour to shew, what re∣maines in the Female presently after coition, and where it abideth: and likewise (because nothing at all is discoverable in the cavity of the womb af∣ter coition) what that prolifical contagion, or first conception is? Whether it be any corporeal thing, any where reserved in the female, or something incorporeal? And whether the conception of the womb be like the conception of the Brain, and so Fecundity be attained, as Science is? (for there are arguments not wanting to prove it) and as Motion, and Animal operations, do take their rise from the conception of the Brain (which we call the desire, or appetite) so whether do Natural motions likewise, and the Operations of the Vegetative faculty (especi∣ally Generation) depend upon the conception of the womb? Again, how that prolifical contagion is of a mixt nature, and transferred from the Male into the Female, and from her into the Egge? And lastly, how the contagion, or infection of all preter∣natural
diseases, and distempers do spread, and propagate insensibly. Of the Order of Generation, and first, of the first Genital Particle. EXER. LI. WHat that is which is produced in the Female immediately upon coition, or doth remain in her, which we hitherto do comprise under the name of contagion, by which, as by Infection, the female is rendered fruitfull by the male, and after∣wards doth generate a foetus of her own accord, shall be said in its place, where we shall make a stricter disquisition and examination of that mat∣ter. In the mean time, we shall signifie to you, all such things as do openly display themselves in the order of the production of the parts, and are worth the Observation. And first of all, because it is plain that the chic∣ken is built by Epigenesis, or the additament of parts budding one out of another, we will disco∣ver what part is first founded before all its compa∣ny, and what is observable concerning it, and the manner of its generation. That which Aristotle affirms concerning the ge∣neration de gen. an. l. 2. c. 1. of perfect animals, is an undoubted truth, and most apparent in an egge; namely, that all the parts are not framed together, but one after ano∣ther in order; & that the first in being is that geni∣tal
particle; by virtue of which afterwards (as from their original) all the rest of the parts do a∣rise. As we see in the seeds of Plants (as Beans and Acorns) a budding, or protuberant point, which is the foundation of the future Tree. And this particle is like a Son set free, and dwelling Ibid. c. 1. in a mannour of his own, and a principle subsisting of himself; whence afterwards the order of the parts is delineated, and all things ordered and regulated which conduce to the complement of the Animal. For since, no part is its own parent, but when it is once begotten, doth provide for it self: therefore that part must of necessity be first made, which doth contain the principle of encrease (for be they Plants or Animals, they have all that in them which contains a power of vegetation and sustaining;) and distinguisheth also and form∣eth Ib. c. 4. all the other parts in their due order and rank: therefore the Soul is primarily in that primo∣genit particle; which Soul is the fountain and au∣thor of Sense, Motion, and Life of the whole. That therefore is the principal particle, from which the vital spirit, and native heat do descend into all the rest; in which the Physitians calidum Innatum sive implantatum, innate or implanted warm substance, doth first display it self; and the domestick hous∣hold-God or lasting fire inhabits; from whence Life floweth into the Body in general, and each particu∣lar part; from whence Nutrition, Ayde, Growth, and Comfort derive their streames: Lastly, where Life first ariseth to the born, and setts to the dying creature. These indeed are all true of the first genital part, and do evidently appear in the generation of the chicken; and therefore, as I conceive, being mo∣ved thereunto by sundry Observations, the opinion of some Physitians, whose Philosophy is ill founded,
is to be rejected (whereby they decree that the three principal and eldest parts, the Brain, the Heart, and the Liver, do together spring out of the small bladders or bubbles) so neither can I assent to A∣ristotle himself, who concludes that the Heart is this first genital and animate particle. For the truth is, I am perswaded that this Prerogative is onely due to the Blood: for the blood is it which is first seen in Generation. And that not onely in an Egg, but in every Foetus, and animal conception whatso∣ever: As shall plainly appear anon. There appears, I say, from the beginning, Pun∣ctum Rubrum saliens, Vesicula pulsans, Fibraeque inde deductae, the Red capering Point, the Panting Ve∣sicle, and the Fibers deduced thence, which con∣tain blood. And so farre as I could possibly dis∣cern by accurate Inspection, the Blood is formed before the Punctum saliens, and is endowed with vital heat, before it moves by pulse; and in it, and from it doth the pulsation begin. For I have found it true by sundry experiments both in an egge, and elsewhere, that the blood is it, in which (so long as the vital heat is not quite extinct) resideth the pos∣sibility of reviving. And since the Vesicula pulsans, and the Fibres containing blood which are derived from it, are seen before any other parts; I conceive it conso∣nant to reason, that the blood is made before his re∣ceptacles; that is to say, the thing contained, be∣fore the thing containing; for the latter is made to be serviceable to the former. And therefore it is most probable, That the Veines, and Fibres, and then the Vesicle, and after it the Heart, as being Instruments destined to receive and house the blood, are erected for the transmission, and distribution of it, and that the blood is the primary particle of the body.
And this is manifest by many Observations; but chiefly, in that some living creatures (and such too as have blood) live a good while without any pulse at all; and some become like Anchorites all the Winter long, and yet survive, though their Hearts within them do respite all their motions, and their Lungs make Holy-day, and forbear respi∣ration; like those persons, who in a Syncope, Lipo∣thymia, or Hysterical passions, lie half-dead without the motion of the Pulse. Being therefore ascertained out of those things which I have observed in an Egge, and the dissection of Animals while they were alive, I conclude (a∣gainst Aristotle) that the blood is the first Genital particle, and that the Heart is its Instrument de∣signed for its Circulation. For the Hearts business or function is the propulsation or driving forth of the blood, as appeares in all Animals that have blood: and the office of the Vesicula pulsans is the very same, (in the generation of the Chicken) which I have shewed to many persons, in the first conce∣ptions of Animals, (as well as in an Egge) when it hath been less then a Spark, panting, and in its motion, drawing it self together, and so squeez∣ing out the blood contained in it, and by relaxing it self again, receiving and entertaining blood a∣fresh. And hence the prerogative and antiquity of the blood appeares, seeing that the Pulse proceedeth from it. For there being two parts of Pulsation; (Distention, and Contraction, or Systole, and Diasto∣le) and the first of these motions is Distention, it is manifest that that action proceeds from the blood; but the Contraction is made by the Vesicula pulsans in an Egge, (as by the Heart in a Chicken) by its proper fibres; as by an Organ destined to that use.
And it is also certain, that the said Vesicula, as also the Auricula cordis, the deaf-eare of the Heart, af∣terwards (from whom the Pulsation first begins) are incited to the constrictive motion, by the blood distending them. The Diastole, or Dilatation, is made by the blood boyling or swelling by the spi∣rits within it: And so Aristotles Opinion concern∣ing the pulsation of the Heart, (namely, that it is made by a kinde of Ebullition) is in some sort true. For as in Milk set upon the fire, and in Beere, we see dayly a Fermentation, working, or Intume∣scence; so is it in the pulse of the Heart, in which the blood, as by a kinde of fermentation working up, is distended, and then ebbs, or falls down a∣gaine: and that which befalls them per accidens, from an external agent (namely, an adventitious heat) that is accomplished in the blood, by its own internal heat, or innate spirit; and is also regulated by the soul in a natural way, and for the preserva∣tion of living creatures. The Pulse therefore is performed by a twofold Agent; namely, the Distention or Dilatation pro∣ceeds from the Blood; and the Constriction, from the membrane of the vesicula in the Egge; (but in the Foetus when it is born, from the Deaf-eares, and Ventricles of the Heart) and by the mutual perfor∣mance of this alternate and interchanging motion, the blood is driven round the whole body, and so our lives continued. Nor is the Blood therefore onely to be called the Primigenial and principal part, because that in, and from it the fountain of motion and pulsation is derived; but also, because the Animal heat, or vital spirit is first radicated and implanted, and the soul takes up her first mansion in it. For whereso∣ever the immediate and principal Instrument of the
vegetative faculty is first found, there in probabi∣lity the soul first resides, and takes her Beginning; as being inseparable from the spirit, and the cali∣dum innatum. For however in Artificial Operations (as Fabri∣cius rightly admonisheth) the Artificer and the In∣struments pag. 28. are separated; yet in the works of Nature they are conjoyned, and one and the same: so the Sto∣mack is both the Author, and the Instrument of chylifi∣cation. So in like manner, the Soul with the Spi∣rit (her Instrument) is immediately conjoyned: and therefore be it in what part it will, that heat and motion first begin, there also the Life doth first arise, and last expire; and out of question, the most intimate domestick Deities, and Soul it selfe, are there enshrined. Life therefore consists in the blood, (as we read in Holy Scripture) because in it the Life and Soule Levit. 17. 11. & 14. do first dawn, and last set. For I have experimen∣ted in the dissection of many live Animals, that when the body was now a dying, and breathing done, the Heart continued its pulse a while, and kept up life in it. And when the Heart hath now gi∣ven over, you shall discern a motion yet surviving in the Auriculae, or Deaf-eares; and though the o∣ther faile, yet the Right will still be stirring; and when that submits to Fate too, yet you shall per∣ceive a kinde of undulation, or waving to and fro, and obscure trepidation, or palpitation in the cham∣pion-blood, proclaiming that he gave the last blow. And any man may plainly see, that the blood re∣taines heat, (that deriver of Life and Palsation) when all the other parts are chilled, and cold: which heat when it is quite extinct, as the blood is then no longer sanguis, sed cruor, Blood, but Gore; so now no longer hope of returning back to lise.
But, both in an Egge, and in gasping Animals, af∣ter all pulsation is expunged, if you apply a gen∣tle warmth either to the Punctum saliens, or the right Auricle of the Heart, you shall presently see the motion, pulsation, and life set on foot again by the Blood; except he have quite fore-gone all his innate heat, and vital spirit. By all which it is most evident, that the blood is the Genital Part, the fountain of Life, Primum vivens, & ultimum moriens, the First-born, and the Longest Liver, and the chief Palace and Court of the soul: in which (as in its Spring-head) the heat doth first and chiefly flow, and flourish: and from which all the other parts of the Body de∣rive their life and influent warmth. For that heat streaming with the blood, doth sprinckle, che∣rish, and preserve the whole: as we have hereto∣fore demonstrated in our Booke, de Motu sangui∣nis. And therefore Blood is found in every particle of the Body, nor can you find footing for the point of a needle, or the edge of your naile, where you shall not immediately start the blood: as if, were it not for the blood, the body would enjoy no heat, nor life. Therefore the blood being never so lit∣tle concentrated and fixt, (Hippocrates calls it, ) as it is in Swouning, frights, extream cold weather, and the approach of the Paroxysme or fit of an Ague, you shall presently behold, the whole body freeze, and grow stiff, and languish in a pale and livid complexion: but the blood being summoned back, by applied Fomen∣tations, exercise, or affections of the Mind, (as Joy, or Anger) how nimbly do all parts recover their Heat, Floridnesse, Vigour and Beauty. And hereupon the ruddy sanguine parts alone,
are called the Hot parts, as the Flesh; but the white and bloodless parts, as the Nerves and Liga∣ments, the Cold. And as Sanguineous Animals exceed the bloodless; so even in the parts, those that are more liberally indowed with Blood, are counted the Eminent parts. And the Liver, Spleen, Reins, Lungs, and Heart it self (if you strain all the blood out of them, for whose sake they are chiefly called Viscera) they presently grow pale, and wan, and are to be registered amongst the col∣der parts. The Heart himselfe, I say, doth by the Coronary Arteries receive the Blood, its influent heat and life, both which it enjoyes upon no other account, then the meer bounty of the Blood. Nor can the Liver proceed in its publick office, without the in∣fluence of blood and heat from the Coeliacal Artery. For there is no where any affluence of heat, with∣out an Influence or influx of blood by the Arteries. And therefore in the first Confirmation of all the parts, before they put themselves into publick un∣dertakings, they are to be discovered pale, and blood-lesse: hereupon the old Physitians and Ana∣tomists supposed them to be spermatical parts, and this speech was wont to obtain amongst them, that in Generation, Aliquot in Lacte dies absumun∣tur, some daies are spent in the Milk, that is about the Constitution of the white; Spermatical parts. The very substance of the Liver it self, the Lungs, and the Heart, at their first appearance are excee∣ding white. Nay the Cone of the Heart, and the walls or sides of its Ventricles, are even then white, when the Auriculae are full, and dyed with Scarlet-blood, and the Coronary Vein looks ruddy. So likewise the Parenchyma of the Liver is it selfe white, when the branches and propagations of its
Veins are blushing with blood: nor doth it execute its publick office, untill it be throughly drenched with blood. And lastly, the blood doth so surround, and peirce into the whole body, and impart heat and life to all its parts, that the soul may justly be coun∣ted resident in it, and for his sake, Tota in tota & tota in qualibet parte, to be all in all, and all in e∣very part, (as the old saying is.) But it is so far from truth (which yet Aristotle and all Physitians affirm) that the Liver, or Heart is the Author of the Blood: that the contrary, out of the fabrick of the chicken in the egge, is most ma∣nifest: namely, the Blood rather is the Author of the Heart, and Liver. And this also Physitians be∣fore they are aware seem to acknowledge, while they conclude that the Parenchyma of the Liver is a certain affusion, or conflux of Blood: as if it were nothing else but blood congealed. Now it must have a being before it can be affused, or coagula∣ted: and that it is so, experience her self openly displayes; for blood appears in the egg, before there be any track or Rudiment of any such thing as the Body, or any of the Viscera. And yet no blood can come thither from the Mother to the Fa∣tus, (as people commonly phansie in Viviparous productions.) The Liver of Fishes is alwaies whitish, though their Veins are purpled, and dark. And our Hens the better they are crammed, so much the more do their Livers impair, and grow pallid. Green∣sickness Virgins that are Cachectical, as the habit of their bodies is pale, so is their Liver: an evident signe of the penury and dearth of Blood. There∣fore the Liver borrows his heat and complexion from the blood, and not the blood from him.
Hence it is plaine, that blood is the prime geni∣tal Part, whence the soul primarily results, and out of which the primary animate part of the Foe∣tus, which is the fountain of all the rest, both si∣milar, and dissimilar is derived, which by that means attain their Vital heat, and become subser∣vient to it: And the Heart is erected for this end and purpose onely, that it may by continual pul∣sation (to which the Veins and Arteries are mini∣sterial and subservient) entertain this blood, and spout it out again up and down through the whole body. All which is the clearer discovered by this, that the Heart hath not a pulsation in all Animals, nor yet at all times; when yet the blood, or some∣thing proportionable to blood is never wanting in any. Of the Blood, as it is the Prin∣cipal Part. EXER. LII. IT is therefore evident, even to the Eye, that the blood is the Primigenial, and so the Genital part: & that all those attributes recited in the precedent Chapter are consistent with it: namely, that it is the builder and preserver of the body and prin∣cipal part wherein the soul hath her Session. For (as we newly said) before any particle of the bo∣dy appear, the blood is born, and groweth, having a palpitation (as Aristotle saith) within the Veins mo∣ving De hist. an. l. 3. c. 19.
to and fro with a Pulse, and is above all the hu∣mours dispersed through the whole body. And so long as life doth last, the Blood alone is Animate, and hot. Moreover, by his various motions, in celerity, or slowness; vehemence, or feebleness, &c. He plainly discovers his resentment of the affronts which a∣ny thing casts upon him, and the friendships of such as cherish him. We therefore conclude, the blood lives and is nourished of it selfe, no way de∣pending upon any other part of the body, as elder or worthier then it self. But whether the whole body depend upon it, as being postgenit, adjoi∣ned, and a kind of appendix or retainer to it, is not the business of this place. I shall only adde, what Aristotle confesses, Truly the nature of the blood De part. an. l. 2. c. 4. is the cause, why very many things befal Animals, both in order to their manners and sense. So that hence we may perceive the Causes not of life onely in general, (for you can never discover any other Ca∣lidum innatum aut influens, innate or influent heat which may be the immediate instrument of the soul, besides the Blood) but also of longer or shor∣ter life, or sleep, and wakefulness, of Wit and Strength &c. For by its tenuity (saith Aristotle in the same place) and cleanness or purity, creatures are wiser, and have quicker senses: and likewise are either more timorous, or couragious, angry and furious: accor∣ding as their blood is more dilute and thin, or more compact and grosse by fibres. Nor is blood the Author of life onely, but accor∣ding to its several discriminations, it is the cause of health, or diseases. And Poysons themselves, which assault us from without, (as poisoned darts or bullets) did they not infect the blood, would do us no prejudice. So that our life, and wellfare is derived unto us from the same spring. If the Hist. an. l. 3. c. 9.
blood be over liquid, saith Aristotle, men grow sick; for it degenerates into so serous a gore, that some have swet Blood. If too much of it stream out, they die. For by want of blood, all the parts do not onely lan∣guish presently, but the Animal it self soon ex∣pires. I conceive it inconvenient to set down Ex∣periments to confirm this, because they require a peculiar Tract. I perceive that the wonderful Cir∣culation of the blood, first found out by me, is con∣sented to almost by all: and that no man hath hitherto made any objection to it, greatly worth a confutation: Wherefore if I shall subjoine the causes, and benefits of that Circulation, and lay open some other secrets of the blood, as, how much it conduceth to the happiness of the creature, as also to both soul, and body, that so men may be cautious to preserve their blood pure and clean, by commodious diet, I conceive I shall perform an of∣fice, not more new, then useful, and acceptable to Philosophers, and Physitians: nor will this opinion seem so improbable and absurd to any, as once to Aristotle; namely, That the Blood, like a Tutelar De Anima. l. 1. c. 2. Deity, is the very soul in the body, as Critias of old, and others thought, supposing sense to be the chiefest property of the soul, and that sense to be in her by the nature of the Blood. Now some concluded it to be the soul, because it hath a power of moving by its owne nature: As Thales, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Alc∣maeon, and others. But that both sense and motion are in the Blood, De hist. an. l. 1. c. 19. & de part. an. l. 2. c. 3. is conspicuous by many tokens, though Aristotle denied it. For if he himself compelled by the truth of the thing it self, did confess, that there was a soul in an egge, though the egge were addle: and that in the Geniture and Blood was found a divine substance, proportionably answering to the Matter of
the Stars, and that it was the Creators Vice-Roy: If some of the Moderns say, that the seed of Ani∣mals ejected in Coition is animate, Why should we not upon as good reason say, that there is a soul in the Blood? and seeing it is the first begotten, first moved, & first nourished, why should we doubt to affirm, that the soul is first raised, & kindled out of it? Blood is that, wherein the Vegetal and sen∣sative operations first shine forth: in which the pri∣mary and immediate officer of the soul, is bred; which is the common tye of soul and body; and in which, as in her Chariot, the soul visits and scatter∣eth influence upon all the parts of the body. Besides, since the contemplation of Geniture is (as we have seen already) so difficult, (namely, how the fabrick of the body should be built by it, with providence, art, and divine understanding) why should we not by the same right, admire the excellent nature of blood, and harbour as worthy thoughts concerning it, as seed? especially see∣ing the Geniture it self (as appears by the egge) is made of the blood; and all the whole body (as from its Genital part) seems not onely to desume its first Foundation, but Preservation also, from it. Thus much by the way concerning this matter, being to treat more fully and exactly of it else∣where. Nor do I conceive it worth the trouble, to dispute here, whether the definition of a part in its proper acceptation agree to blood? which some deny upon these grounds chiefly, because it hath not sense, and because it flowes and insinuates in∣to all the parts of the body, to cater convenient dyet for them. But I have found many things a∣bout the manner of Generation, by which being convinced, I shall establish the contrary to those things, (which Philosophers & Physitians common∣ly
affirm, or deny.) At present I will onely say, that in case we should consent that the blood hath not sense, yet it cannot be thence inferred, that it is no part of the sensitive body, and that the chifest too. For neither the Braine, nor the Spi∣nal Marrow, or the Crystalline, or Glassie humour of the Eye have any sense, and yet all Philosophers and Physitians do to this day with one consent, al∣low them to be parts of the body. But Aristotle did number it amongst the similar parts, and Hippo∣crates also; for while he constitutes the Animal body, out of conteining, and conteined parts, and impetum facientibus, spirits, he did necessarily own the blood amongst the conteined parts. But of this more at large, when we enquire what a part is, and how many several acceptati∣ons there are of it. In the mean time, we will not conceale this Admirable Experiment (by which it shall appear that the most principal member of all, namely, the very Heart it self, may seem to be insensible.) A Noble young Gentleman, Son and Heire to the honorable the Vice-Count of Mountgomery in Ire∣land, when he was a childe, had a strange mishapp by an unexpected fall, causing a Fracture in the Ribs on the left side: the Bruise was brought to a Suppuration, whereby a great quantity of putrified matter was voided out, and this putrefaction gush∣ed out for a long while together out of the wide wound. I deliver it from his own mouth, and the testimony of other creditable persons, who were eye-witnesses. This person of Honour, about the eighteenth, or nineteenth year of his Age, having been a Traveller in Italy and France, arrived at last at London: having all this time a very wide gap open in his Breast, so that you might see and touch
his Lungs (as it was believed.) Which, when it came to the late King Charles his ear, being related as a miracle, He presently sent me to the Young Gentleman, to inform Him, how the matter stood. Well, what happened? When I came neer him, and saw him a sprightly Youth, with a good com∣plexion, and habit of body, I supposed, some body or other had framed an untruth. But having sa∣luted him, as the manner is, and declared unto him the Cause of my Visit, by the Kings Command, he discovered all to me, and opened the void part of his left side, taking off that small plate, which he wore to defend it against any blow or outward injury. Where I presently beheld a vast hole in his breast, into which I could easily put my three Fore-fingers, and my Thumb; and at the first en∣trance I perceived a certain fleshy part sticking out, which was driven in and out by a reciprocal moti∣on, whereupon I gently handled it in my hand. Being now amazed at the novelty of the thing, I search it again and again, and having diligently enough enquired into all, it was evident, that that old and vast Ulcer (for want of the help of a skil∣full Physitian) was miraculously healed, and skin∣ned over with a membrane on the Inside, and guarded with flesh all about the brimmes or mar∣gent of it. But that fleshy substance (which at the first sight I conceived to be proud flesh, and every body else took to be a lobe of the Lungs) by its pulse, and the differences or rythme thereof, or the time which it kept, (and laying one hand upon his wrest, and the other upon his heart) and also by comparing and considering his Respirations, I concluded it to be no part of the Lungs, but the Cone or Substance of the Heart; which an excre∣scent fungous Substance (as is usual in soul Ulcers)
had fenced outwardly like a Sconce. The Young Gentlemans Man did by dayly warm injections deliver that fleshy accretion from the filth & pol∣lutions which grew about it, and so clapt on the Plate: which was no sooner done, but his Master was well, and ready for any journey or exercise, li∣ving a pleasant, and secure life. Therefore, instead of an Account of the Business, I brought the Young Gentleman himself to our late King, that he might see, and handle this strange and singular Accident with his own Senses; name∣ly, the Heart and its Ventricles in their own pulsa∣tion, in a young, and sprigtly Gentleman, with∣out offense to him: Whereupon the King himself consented with me, That the Heart is deprived of the Sense of Feeling. For the Party perceived not that we touched him at all, but meerly by see∣ing us, or by the sensation of the outward skin. We likewise took notice of the motion of his Heart; namely, that in the Diastole it was drawn in and retracted, and in the Systole came forth, and was thrust out; and that the Systole was made in the heart, when the Diastole was sensible in the wrest; and also that the proper motion of the heart is the Systole; and lastly, that the heart then beats upon the breast, and is a litle prominent, when it is lift∣ed upwards and contracted into it self. Nor is that other Controversie (namely, whe∣ther the Blood do onely serve to nourish the Body) to be much insisted upon in this place. Aristotle indeed doth in several places contend, that the blood is Alimentum ultimum, the last Aliment, and with him the whole School of Physitians give suf∣frage. And yet many things hard to be unfold∣ed, and of bad coherence, will ensue upon that o∣pinion. For, when Physitians treat of the Blood in
stotle, did constitute the blood out of parts and dif∣ferences in some manner alike. Physitians indeed do onely take notice of humane blood, and of that as it spins into a Sawcer in Phlebotomy, and so coagulates. Aristotle contemplates the blood of all creatures in general, or that which beareth an Analogy with blood. But laying aside all cavil, and omitting the inconveniences which do pur∣sue their opinion, I shall briefly touch upon those things, which they both consent in, and are plainly discovered by sense it self, and are more pertinent to our business: intending else∣where to examine them at large. Though (as I have informed you) the blood is called a part of the body, and that the primigenial and principal part; yet if it be considered in the whole lump (as it is in the Veins) nothing hin∣ders, why we may not say, that it conteins Ali∣ment, concocts it, and doth apply it to all parts: and that being one and the same thing, yet in that acceptation it may be said, both to feed, and to be fed, as also to be both the material and effici∣ent cause of the Body: and naturally to have that very constitution, which Aristotle conceived to be necessary in the primigenial part; namely, that the blood is partly of a similar, and partly of a dis∣similar constitution. For, saith he, Since for sen∣ses sake it is necessarily ordered, that there should be similar members in Animals; and since both the power of sensation, motion, and nutrition, are all comprehend∣ed in the same member, (namely the Primogenit) it is necessary that that member (which conteins such principles in it) should both be simple, that it may be capable of all sensible objects; and also dissimilar, that it may move, and act. Wherefore, he goes on, in the race of creatures that have blood, the Heart is coun∣ted
such a member: but in the bloodless, that member which is proportionable to the Heart. Now if by the Heart he understand that parti∣cle which is first seen in the Egge; namely, the Blood, together with its receptacles (the Vesiculae pulsantes, and the Veins) as one and the same Or∣gan; I then conceive he speaks most true: for the Blood as it is discovered in the Egge and the Vesi∣cula, is partly similar, and partly dissimilar. But if he understand it otherwise, that which is seen in the egge, will easily confute him: for the substance of the Heart, being considered without the Blood (namely, its Cones, and the Walls or partitions of its Ventricles) is generated long after: and con∣tinues so long white, without any irrigation of blood upon it, untill the Heart be fashioned into an Organical form, such as may spout the blood through the whole body. Nor doth the Heart, then, appear of a similar or simple constitution (as is fit for a Primogenit part to do) but fibrous, fleshey, and musculous: and indeed (as Hippocrates would have it) a plain Muscle, or Instrument of motion. But, the blood, (as it is first seen, and as it beats being yet comprehended in the Vesicula,) is plainly of that constitution, which Aristotle judgeth necessa∣ry to a Principal part. For the blood, while it is in its natural constitution in the body, is altoge∣ther similar. But so soon as it is dislodged, and out of its receptacles, and puts of its native heat; it presently degenerates into several parts, as some dissimilar thing. But if the blood were naturally designed onely to the nourishing of the body, it would be onely of a similar constitution; like the Chyle, or White of an egge; or at least it would be a mixt body, being compounded of the foresaid parts or juyces,
and yet truly one: as those other juyces; name∣ly, the Choler and Phlegme, which after death, e∣ven when they are taken out of their habitations, remain the same, as when they were seen in the live body: but are not so soon changed. Wherefore, what Aristotle attributes to a Prin∣cipal part, that very same thing is proper to blood. For blood, as it is a Natural body, being an He∣terogeneous, or Dissimilar substance, is compoun∣ded of those parts, or juyces. But as it lives, and it the chief Animal part, compounded of a body and soul. But when that soul, by reason of the expiration of the native heat, doth vanish, and its native substance is presently corrupted, and is dissolved into those parts, of which it was former∣ly made: namely, first into a Watry Blood, next into Red, and White parts: and the Red parts, which are uppermost, are most florid: but those that sinck downwards grow dark, and black. Now some of the parts also are fibrous, and thicker, as being the tye, and connexion of the rest; others are ichorous and serous, upon which the coagulated lump useth to float. And into this Serum almost all the blood degenerates. Now these parts are not in the live blood, but onely when it is now corrupted and dissolved by death. Besides the recited parts, there is seen in hotter and stronger Animals, as in Horses, Oxen, and Men also of a more lively constitution, another part of blood, which when the blood is let out and gru∣mefieth, seating it selfe in the upper part of the redder blood, doth condense, and plainly resemble a Gelly made of Harts-horn, or kind of Mucilage, or thicker white of an egge. The vulgar count it the Phlegme, and Aristotle the crude and unconcocted part of the blood.
I have observed this part, to differ, as well, from the serous, (upon which the coagulated gore useth to swim) as from the other parts, as like∣wise from the Urine, which is dreined by the Kidnies from the blood. Nor is it to be thought the cruder and colder part of the blood, but the more spirital, as I suppose, and that by two experiments; First, because it swimmes above the florid and brighter part of the blood, (which is vulgarly conceived to be the Arterial blood) as be∣ing hotter, and fuller of spirits then it, and upon the disgregation of the blood, obtaines the upper place. Also in breathing a Veine, this sort of blood (where of there is plenty in persons of a hot tempe∣rature, that are strong and fleshy) it darts it self out in a longer stream, and more vehemency (as if it spirted out of a Syringe) & hereupon we count it hotter, and more spirital: as that geniture is counted most fertile & fraught with spirits, which leaps farthest and most forcibly. And that this gelly doth much differ from that ichorous and watry substance, which (as being colder then the rest) sinketh down to the bottom of the sawcer, is evident for two reasons: for the watry and washy part is more crude and inconcocted, then that it may be wrought up into perfect blood. But the gelly, which is thicker and more fibrous, swimming above the lump of blood, appeareth more concocted and elaborate then it. And therefore in the solution or partition of the blood, this gelly keeps aloof, the whey or sanies lowest, but the lump and red parts (as well the brighter as the darker) possess the middle region. Now is it most certain, that not onely that part, but all the blood, nay the very flesh it self (as
may be observed in Bodyes hanged in Chains) may may be corrupted into ichorous whey. As being re∣solved into that substance, of which they were first compounded: so Salt is resolved into Lie, from whence it first sprung. So likewise in every Ca∣chexie, the blood that is let, abounds with plenty of Serum: so that sometimes there scarce appears any grumous part at all, but all the blood seems to be one entire washy gore; as we finde in that kinde of Dropsie called Anasarca: and it is also natural in creatures that are bloodless. Likewise, if you breath a veine immediately af∣ter you have eat and drank, (before the second concoction be finished, and the Serum descended through the Kidnies) or upon the first approach of a fit of an Ague, you shall finde the blood to be washy, inconcocted, and mingled with much whey. But on the contrary, if upon an empty Sto∣mack, or discharge of the Urine, or a large Sweat, you open a Veine, you shall finde the blood thick (as being quite destitute of Serum) and be∣ing almost all condensed into a lump. And as when the blood growes raw and crude, you shall perceive but very litle of this gelly float∣ing a top. So if you poure out the Serum separa∣ted from the lump or mass, and let it simper upon a gentle fire, you shall soon see it changed into this gelly: which is a manifest signe, that that washy or serous substance, which is now divided from the rest of the blood, is perhaps some matter of the Urine, but not the Urine it self, though in colour and consistence it look like it. For the U∣rine being boyled, is not thickned into a fibrous Gelly, but rather into a Lie: but this washy or se∣rous part being a while gently heated, condenseth into a gelly like that above: as on the contrary,
that uago, or gelly, degenerating into more cru∣dity by corruption, is dissolved into Serum. And thus farre have I brought this part of the blood (which is my own Observation) upon the Stage; of which (and the other parts of blood, which are apparent to sense, and allowed by the authority of Aristotle, and Physitians) I shall more copiously discourse hereafter. In this place, not to digress farther, I conceive the blood to be taken (with Aristotle) not as it is De gen. an. l. 2. c. 3. simply understood, and called Cruor, but as it is a living part of an Animal body. For so Aristotle: The blood is hot in such a sense, as if we could call hot water by one onely word, and not as a subject receiving heat into it. For heat is in the essence of the blood; as whiteness, in a white man. But when blood is made hot by any distemper, or passion of the Minde, it is not then calidus perse, hot, by its own heat. And thus we may say of that which is moist, or dry. Wherefore, partly a hot, and partly a moist substance is in the na∣ture of such kinde of things; but if you divide them, they then grow cold, and congeale; and such is blood. Blood therefore as it is a living part of the Body, is of a doubtfull nature, and falls under a two fold consideration. And therefore materialiter & per se, it is called nutriment; but formaliter, as it is endued with heat, and spirits, (which are the im∣mediate instruments of the Soul) and with the Soul it self: it is to be counted the Bodies Genius, and Conserver, the Principal, Primogenit, and Genital part. And as a Prolifical egg is the Matter, Instru∣ment, and Efficient cause of the Chicken, and as all Physitians count the geniture of both Sexes mingled in the womb after coition, both for the material and efficient of the Foetus; so, upon a better right, may we affirm, That the Blood is both the Matter and
Preserver of the Body, and not the bare Aliment. For it is a known thing in Creatures that are star∣ved by hunger, and Men also that dye of Consumpti∣ons, that a great quantity of blood remains in their Veins even after death. And also Young men that are in their growth, and Old men that are decli∣ning, have a proportionable quantity of blood; namely, according to the increase, or diminution of their Flesh. So that the blood is a part, and not the nutriment onely of the Body. For if that were the onely use of it, no man would be starved, so long as any drop of the blood remains in the veins, as the flame of a Lamp doth not expire, so long as any oyle at all remains to support it. But while I affirm the soul to reside first, and principally in the blood, I would not have any man hastily to conclude from hence, that all Blood-letting is dangerous, or hurtfull; or believe with the Vulgar, that as much of blood, so much of life is taken away, because Holy-writ placeth the life in the blood. For dayly experience shewes, that Letting blood is a safe cure for several Diseases, and the chiefest of Universal Remedies: because the default, or superfluity of the blood is the semi∣nary of most distempers; and a seasonable evacua∣tion of it, doth often rescue men from most de∣sperate maladies, and Death it self. For look how much blood is according to Art taken away, so many years are added to the Age. Nature her self was our Tutor here, whom Phy∣sitians transcribe: for She, of her own accord, doth many times vanquish the most mortal Infirmities by a plentifull and critical evacuation, either at the Nose, Haemorrhoids, or by menstruous Purgations. And therefore young people, who feed high, and live idlely, unless about the eighteenth or twentieth
yeare of their age (at which time the stock of blood encreases, together with the bulk of their bodies) they be disburdened of the load and oppression of their blood, either by a spontaneous release at the Nose, or Inferiour parts, or by breathing a Vein, they are dangerously set upon by Feavers, Small-pox, Head-aches, and other more grievous Distempers and Symptomes. Alluding to which, the Farriers, do begin almost all Cures of Beasts with Letting blood. What Observations are to be collected from the Ramifications of the Umbilical veines in the Egge. EXERCIT. LIII. WE see the Blood is made in the Egge and Conception before any thing else; and neere upon that time, doe its Receptacles, that is, the Veines, and Vesicula pulsans appear. And there∣fore if we admit the Punctum saliens, together with the blood and veines, as one and the same Organi∣cal part, visible in the first dawning of the Foetus, to stand for the Heart (whose Parenchyma doth af∣terwards, in the formation of the Foetus, grow to the Vesicula;) it is clear then, that the Heart under this acceptation (namely, as an Organ compound∣ed of a Parenchyma, Ventricles, Deaf-ears, Vessels, and Blood) is truly (according to Aristotles owne
minde) the principal and primary part of the body: and yet its first and chief part is blood; and that not onely in order of Nature, but of Generation too. The parts next in Generation to the blood, are the Veines: for the blood must needs be kept in vessels. And therefore (as Aristotle observed) there are found two venal Channels neer upon the very be∣ginnings of all, which do afterwards (as we have taught in our History) constitute the Umbilical vessels. From their Scituation therefore and Ramifica∣tion, some things come to be observed. The First is, that all the Veins and Arteries arise from the heart; for they are as so many retainers belonging to the Heart, or as certain parts of it. If therefore you diligently observe a (humane or any other) foetus new born, and cutting in sunder the Vena Cava between the right Auricle of the Heart, and the Diaphragma, if you mark it as it looks down∣wards, you shall discover three Holes, whereof the greatest and hinde-most tending towards the Spine of the back, is the Hole of the descending Vena Cava; the fore-most, and lesser, is carried into the Root and Trunk of the Umbilical vessels; the third, and the lest of all, passeth into the Liver, and is the Fountain and Trunk of all the branches dissemi∣nated into the Gibbous part of the Liver. By which it is evident, that the veins do not (as some would have it) proceed from the Liver, as from their Ori∣ginal, but from the Heart: unless they will ob∣stinately affirm, that the Trunk and body of a vein arises from some litle branch of the vein, and not the branches from the Trunk. Moreover, since the fore-said vessels in the Egg, are alike disseminated into the Yolk and White
(after the manner as Plants work in their Roots into the Ground) it appears, that both their liquours are the nutriment of the Foetus, and that that nou∣rishment is by these Vessels conveyed unto it: and that against Aristotle, who every where affirmes, that the Chicken assumes nourishment by the Navel, De hist. an. l. 2. c. 3. De gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. & 3. onely from the Yolk, but is made of the White. The White indeed is first spent, and the Yolke, though late, doth yet at last become the Nutriment, and supplies the place of Milk when the Chicken is now hatcht: to the intent, that Nature might af∣ford to Oviparous creatures such an aliment as she holds out to Viviparous by the Breasts, or Udder. Hereupon it falls out, that when all the White is exhausted, the Yolk continues almost entire, even when the Chicken is consummate, and complete; nay, even after his Exclusion. Aristotle, indeed, ten dayes after the Chickens ex∣clusion, found some remainder of the Yolk in the Chicken: but I have observed even after six weeks time, some part of it fastned to the Guts in the Chickens belly. Yet upon the reception of the Yolk into the Ab∣domen of the Chicken, (which while the Foetus is forming, and growing, doth not abate so much as the White, but continues almost entire, when both the Whites are now quite wasted) and also upon the Observation at the Distribution of the Veines through the substance of the Yolk: all which being collected into one Trunk, do pass into the Vena Porta, and do carry part of the Yolk thither, to receive a further concoction in the Liver; upon these, I say, and such like grounds, I cannot but acknowledge with Aristotle, that the Yolk doth nourish the Chicken, and hath some analogie to Milke.
The Yolk doth not remain entire after the Con∣summation of the Foetus, for a portion of it is dis∣solved in the first conformation of the Chicken; and it likewise doth admit the propagations of the Veines (as well as the White) by which after it is now prepared, it becomes the Nutriment of the Foetus: yet certain it is, that the greatest part of it doth survive the wasted white, and that surviving part is entertained into the belly of the Chicken; and being attracted by the small branches of the Vena Porta, is at last conveyed into the Liver. It is therefore a clear case, that the Chicken newly hatched, (while it is yet weak and tender) is nourished by the yolk. And as while he remain∣ed within the Egge, he was partly fed by the yolke, and partly by the whites, but chiefly by the hospi∣tality of the whites, which as they are in greater quantity, so are they sooner exhausted: so in like manner, when he is now hatched, (at which time all his aliment passeth through his Liver, and there receives a farther preparation) he is nourished partly by the yolk attracted from the Guts, and partly by the Chyle, which the several propagati∣ons of the Meseraick Veines suck into themselves; when there is in the yolk onely one propagation of the Vena Porta distributed into it, and a litle onely of the yolk remaining. For Nature, as Nurses, be∣ing about to wean their Infants by degrees, gives them other meats sometimes, that so they may the better endure the decay of the milk: so the Chic∣ken is trained by degrees, from meat of easier con∣coction, to harder (as from the Yolk, to the Chyle.) Therefore what we see of the propagation of the Veines in the Egge, is done upon exceeding good grounds. For as soon as the Chicken begins first to be modelled, the Veines are then extended only in∣to
the Colliquamentum; by which the blood being fed and grown, adjoyns the rest of the body to him∣self, to be brought up with him. Afterwards, the veines reach into the thinner white, from whence the Chicken receiveth his sustenance, (while he yet resembleth a Gelly, or Mucilage, and a Maggot) af∣terwards they spread into the thicker White, and a∣non into the Yolk, that by that also it may be entertained; and being as yet but tender, it is fed in part by the yolk (as by milke) hoarded up in the abdomen, and in part by food provided and prepa∣red by the Hen, till it be able to seek abroad for nourishment convenient, and can digest it. So that through the whole series of Generation, Nature hath most prudently considered of various Ali∣ment proportionable to the various abilities of the Digestive faculty of the future Foetus. For while it is yet feeble, she hath provided it milder diet, and solider meats for its stronger capacity: and when it is now hearty enough, and can away with courser cates, it is served with commons an∣swerable to it. And hereupon I conceive, that per∣fect eggs are not onely party-coloured, but also fur∣nished with a double White. And what we have found out by Experience, De gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. seems also to agree with Aristotles opinion, where he saith, That Part of it which is hotter, comes neerer the form designed to the institution of the members, but that which is earthier, yeelds matter to frame the body, and is more unlike. As in party-coloured eggs, the ani∣mal assumes the Rudiments of its generation from the White, (for the animals beginning is in the hot part) and its aliment from the yolk. Therefore in hotter ani∣mals, those two are reserved apart; namely, that from whence they take the beginning of their being, and that
from whence they derive their aliment, and one of them is white, and the other yellow. It appeares by what hath been said, that the Chicken (and the same thing shall afterwards be demonstrated of all conceptions) as he results, or is framed from the implanted principle, or soul of the egge, so he also obtaines his nourishment from the Egge too: wherefore he hath no need of a mother, as the Plants have of the Earth. And it is no truer of him, that he is nourished by his mothers blood, or lives by her spirits; and so his own heart lies fallow and idle the while, then that he moves and perceives by his mothers organs, or is enlivened and takes growth from her soul. But the case is plain, and all men acknowledge, that the Foetus is fed by the Umbilical Vessels; and that the Venal branches disseminated into the White and Yolk, do hence derive sustenance, which they im∣part to the Foetus. It is likewise clear, that when the Chicken is now hatcht, or excluded, he is supplyed with provisions, partly from the Yolk, and partly from the Chyle; and that they both pass into the Liver by the same Vena Porta, though by several branches of it. It is also clear, (to speak by the way) that the Chyle which nourisheth all living creatures, is trans∣ported by the Meseraick Veins out of the Guts; and that there is no need to search out new wayes (namely the Venae Lacteae) or to fansie any other passage in grown bodies, besides what we finde in the Egge and Chicken. But as for the Inconveni∣ences of that invention, we shall elsewhere disco∣ver them. Lastly, by the constitution of the Umbilical Ves∣sels in the Egge, (whereof we have declared some
to be Veines, and some Arteries) we may tollect a Circulation of the Blood, (such as we have long since demonstrated in our Book, de Motu Sanguin is in Animalibus) and that for vegetation, nutrition, and augmentation sake: and therefore the Umbilical Vessels are disseminated into both the Liquors, that they may lead sustenance from them to the foetus; and the Arteries are derived thither too, that by a plentifull affluence of heat they may concoct, dis∣solve, and render the aliment usefull to nutrition. And hence it comes to pass, that wheresoever the veines (and under that name the Arteries also are here comprehended) do arrive to the substance of the White or Yolk, those parts seem to be dis∣solved, and put on a different look or appearance from the rest. For so soon as ever the branches of the Veines shoot forth, the superiour or exteriour part of the White (into which they are inserted) grows transparent, and melts into a Colliquntion; but the inferiour part remaining still thick, and compact, is confined to the Lower angle of the Egge. So likewise there seem to be two parts (a superiour and an inferiour) of the Yolk, which do as much differ from one another, as melted from unmelted wax; namely, that part which hath entertained Veines into it, from the other which is yet desti∣tute. Hence also we are acquainted with the Exordi∣um, and first inherent principle of the Egge. For it is clear, that the Cicatricula or Speck, is the prin∣cipal particle of the Egge, to which all the rest are to be referred, and to which (if to any part before another) whatsoever it be, which makes the Egge prolifical, is to be imputed, as also the first onset to∣wards the generation of the Chicken. And there∣fore (as we have shewed) presently after the Incu∣bation
of the Hen, the Cicatricula is first of all di∣lated, enlarged, and makes a Colliquation; where∣in forthwith the blood moves, the veines are scat∣tered, and the operations and effects of the native heat, do by the help of the formative Operatour, be∣tray themselves; and by how much the deeper the small Filaments of these veines do take rooting, by so much the wider is the Empire of the Vital fa∣culty advanced, and the Majesty of the Vegetal Soul revealed. For indeed every Effect is a cleare testimony of its Efficient. In a word, upon the Cicatricula (wherein the first twy-light of native heat doth dawn) the whole Generation doth depend: Upon the Heart, the whole Chicken, and upon the Umbilical Vessels, all the Membranes involving the Foetus (which we call the Secundine) do rely. Wherefore we conclude, that the parts of the Foetus are in subordination one to the other, and do first borrow life from the Heart. Of the Order of parts in the Genera∣ration out of an Egge, accord∣ing to Fabricius. EXERCITATION LIV. IT being now resolved, which is to be esteemed the first part, namely the Blood, with its Rece∣ptacles, the Heart, Veins, and Arteries; it now fol∣lows, that we discover in what order all the parts of the Body are generated.
Fabricius (whose steps we trace in the Generati∣on of the Pullus) ere he proceed to the order of the Parts, doth first recite the actions discovered in an Egge, and by whose assistance the Parts are formed; repeating also in order their Faculties: as if out of them the order also of the Generation of the Parts may be more clearly discovered. There are three actions, saith he, which appear first in an Egge upon which the Hen sits: the first is, the Generation of the Chicken; the second, its Growth; the third, its Nu∣trition. The first, that is, the Generation, is the pro∣per action of the Egge; the second and third (name∣ly accretion and nutrition) do for the greatest part come to a height out of the egge; yet they are begun in the egge, and perfected there too. Which actions, as they flow from three faculties, (the Generative, Aug∣mentative, & Nutritive) so three Effects do ensue upon them: For from generation do all the parts of the Chic∣ken result; from accretion and nutrition, Growth, and Increase: treating first of the Generation of the Chic∣ken, we may discover, that by the help of Generation the parts of the Chicken (which were not before) are produced, and so the Egge is transformed into the body of the Chicken. Now while any part doth commigrate into another, it must needs pass through a commutation of its own proper essence; (for otherwise it must conti∣nue the same thing still) and also must be fashioned in∣to a figure, scite, and magnitude convenient and con∣sistent with its nature: and in these two things is the Procreation of a substance absolved, namely, Commu∣tation, and Conformation; therefore the Immutative and Formative faculties, are the causes of these functi∣ons: Whereof the One hath produced each particular part of the body, just as we see it, out of the Chalaza of the Egge; the Other conferred the figure, scite, and composition convenient for all the several uses of it.
The first of these Faculties, which is the Immutative or Alterative faculty, is wholly natural, and doth act with∣out any knowledge at all; and taking to it self, the hot, the cold, the moist, and the dry parts, it alters the whole subance of the Chalaza throughout, and by al∣tering, it doth change it into the parts of the Chicken; that is to say, into Flesh, Bones, Gristles, Ligaments, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, and into all the other similar and simple parts of the Animal, or Chicken: and the Cocks seed doth by its proper ingenit heat and spirit, ge∣nerate, create, and produce them out of the Egge (that is, the Chalaza) by Alteration and Commutation; imparting to every one of them its proper substance, and the proprieties belonging to that substance. The Other faculty which is called Formative, and which makes the similar parts dissimilar (bestowing their beauty up∣on them, from convenient figure, just dimension, proper scite, and competent number) being much more noble then the former, and full of incomparable wisdom, doth not act Naturally, but by Election or Choice, Knowledg, and Understanding. For truly this Formative faculty seems to be stored with most exact knowledg, and prae∣vision, both of the future Action, and also of the Use of every particular Part, and Organ. And thus of the first Action of the Egge, which is the generation of the Chicken, to whose celebration, both the seed of the Cock, as Agent, and Fructifier, and the Chalaza, is required, as the subject Matter. Next comes Accreti∣on, which is done by Nutrition; whose Faculties are the Attractive, the Retentive, the Digestive, and Ex∣pulsive faculties: and lastly, the Faculty of Apposition, Agglutination, and Assimulation. But as for this distribution of the Actions, I conceive it neither to be right, nor useful, nor pertinent in this place. Not Right; because those actions, which he seems to hold to be distinct, in
their species, and time; namely that the parts should be first made similar, by the Immutative faculty; after that, formed, and made Organi∣call by the formative; and then augmented by the augmentative) do no where appear so in the Ge∣neration of the Chicken; for the parts are all ge∣nerated, distinguished, and augmented together. For though it be otherwise in the Generation of those Animals which are framed by a Metamor∣phosis; where all the parts are transformed, and lineated out of a pre-existent matter, which is large enough, and prepared before hand, (as when out of a Worme is made a Butterfly, and out of another Worme a Silk-Worme) yet in Generati∣on by Epigenesis, the business is much otherwise, nor is the proceeding there, as it is in Nutrition, which is performed by the divers actions of diverse parts, joining their confederate forces and helps together: namely, where the Aliment is first at∣tracted and retained; then concocted, then distri∣buted, and at last agglutinated. Nor is the simi∣lar constitution produced by the Alterative facul∣ty, without all kind of providence (as Fabricius would have it) And the Organical, by the Forma∣tive, which imployes knowledge and providence in her undertakings. For Generation and Accre∣tion, are not made without Nutrition, nor Nu∣trition, or Augmentation, without Generation. For to Nourish, is to substitute into the place of that which is lost, as much, and such as is lost: namely, Flesh, or Nerves, into the roome of that Flesh, and those Nerves, which are impared. And what is this other, then to make Flesh, or Nerves? So likewise Accretion is not without Generation: For all Natural bodies, are Augmented, by a new ac∣cession of those parts, of which they did consist
before: and that according to all dimensions: So that they at once do grow, are distinguished, and organized together, And now, to Generate a Chicken, is nothing else, but to constitute all its parts, members and organs: which though they are made in order, and some are post-genit, or later productions then others (as the lesse principal parts, compared with the more principal) yet while the organs themselves are di∣stinguished, their generation doth not proceed in such order, that the similar parts must be first made, and the organical be afterwards compounded out of them: as if the compounding parts were first to exist, and then the Composition to be raised out of them. For though the Head of the Chic∣ken, and the rest of its Trunck, or corporature (being first of a similar constitution) do resemble a Mucus, or a soft glewey substance: out of which afterwards all the parts are framed in their order: yet by the same operation, and the same Opera∣tour, they are together made and augmented: and as that substance resembling glew doth grow, so are the parts distinguished. Namely, they are Generated, Altered, and formed at once: they are at once similar and dissimilar: and from a small similar, is a great organ made. In the same manner as out of the straw, the spike, reeds, and graines do arise, and are distinguished: and as the Trees, when they shoot forth their young buds, do out of them, expand and produce flow∣ers, leaves, fruit, and at last, seed. And this we have learnt out of those things which are conspicuous in an egge, by diligent ob∣servation of them. For by the effects, the acti∣ons, or operations are perceived; by the opera∣tions, the faculties, and by them, the Operatour
or Efficient. Wherefore in the Generation of the Chicken, the actions or faculties of the Generant (which Fabricius recites; namely, the Immutative and Formative) do not differ Specie, nor yet se∣cundum prius & posterius, but (as Aristotle useth to speak) ipso esse, and ratione solum: not as it befals the actions of the nutritive faculty, after the birth, (to wit, Attraction, Concoction, Distribution, and Apposition) which performe their duties in several places, and at several times. For other∣wise the Generative faculty her self, should be in∣forced also to use diverse instruments to perform her several operations. Wherefore Fabricius affirms amisse, that the Im∣mutative Faculty doth operate by the qualities of the Elements, namely, Heat, Cold, Moisture, and Dryness: (as being its instruments) but that the formative works without them, and after a more divine manner: as if (forsooth) she did finish her task, with meditation, choise, and providence. For had he looked deeper into the thing, he would have seen, that the Formative, as well as the Alte∣rative faculty makes use of hot, cold, moist, and dry, (as her instruments) & would have deprehen∣ded as much divinity and skill, in Nutrition and Immutation, as in the operations of the Formative faculty her self. For nature hath instituted all those faculties for some end; and doth every where work with providence, and understanding. Whatsoever it is which makes the seed of Plants fruitful, and doth exercise a plastick virtue in it: and that which in an egge executes the office of a most skilful Workeman, doth produce and build the parts, and by Calefying Refrigerating, Moist∣ning, Drying, Concocting, Condensing, Hard∣ning, Softning, Dissolving, both Fashion, and
Augment them; doth also distinguish them, by Figure, Scite, Constitution, Temperature, Number, and Order: disposing and compleating all things, with like providence, election, and understand∣ing, (no lesse in the alteration, then nutrition, augmentation, and formation of them.) I say the Concocting, and Immutative; the Nutritive, and Augmenting faculties; (which Fabricius would have to busie themselves onely about Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, without all knowledge) do operate with as much artifice, and as much to a designed end, as the Formative fa∣culty: which he affirms, to possess the knowledge and fore-sight of the future action, and use of every particular part, and Organ. As the Art of Physick, the Bakers and the Cooks slight (which set on work, the hot, cold, moist, and dry, and such like natural Instruments) doe no less require the exercise of reason, then Me∣chanical Trades, which either work with their own hand, (as the Smith, the Statuaries, and the Potters) or other artificial instruments. But as in the greater world, we say, Jovis omnia plena, All things are full of the Deity, so also in the lit∣tle edifice of a Chicken, and all its actions and operations, Digitus Dei, the Finger of God, or the God of Nature, doth reveal himself. Therefore if it be lawful for us to judge of the faculties by the operations; the Vegetal Ope∣rations do rather seem to be executed by Art, E∣lection, and Providence; then the very actions of the Rational soul, and the Mind, though in a most perfect man, the top and pinnacle of whose Knowledge and Understanding, consists chiefly (according to Apollos verdit) in this, ut no seat se ip∣sum, that he know himself. A more sublime, and
diviner Artificer therefore (then man is) seems to make and preserve man: and a nobler Agent then a Cock, doth produce a Chicken out of the Egge. For we acknowledge our Omnipotent God, and most high Creator, to be every where present in the stru∣cture of all creatures living; and to point himself out by his Workes; whose Instruments the Cock and Hen are in the Generation of the Chicken. For it is most apparent, that in the Generation of the Chicken out of the egge, all things are set up and formed, with a most singular providence, divine wisdom, and an admirable, and Incomprehensible Ar∣tifice. Nor can these Attributes appertain to any, but to the Omnipotent Maker of all things, under what name soever we cloud and veil him: whether it be, Mens divina, the divine Mind, with Aristotle, or Anima mundi, the soul of the Universe, with Plato; or with others, Natura Naturans, Nature of Na∣ture her self; or else Saturnus, or Jupiter, with the Heathen; or rather, as befits us, the Creatour, and Father of all things in Heaven, and Earth: upon whom all Animals, and their births depend: and at whose Beck, or Mandat, all things are crea∣ted, and begotten. Moreover (as I have observed) this distribution of the Actions, or faculties of the Soul (which Fabri∣cius doth premise to the order of Generation of the parts) as I apprehend it to be faulty, so also I conceive it to be unprofitable and inconvenient, or impertinent to our business. For we doe not attain to the knowledge of the Effect, by the knowledge of the actions or faculties, but rather on the contrary, from the Effects we ascend to the Faculties; for the effects or workes are notiora nobis, more known unto us, then the faculties
from whence they spring: and the parts (which we see made already) are more intelligible in Ge∣neration, then the actions which framed them. Nor do those things which are to be considered and determined in the general observation of all Animals, fall properly within the compass of the particular generation of the Chicken out of the Egge. But of them more hereafter. In the mean time, we shall proceed to the Or∣der of the Generation of the parts. It remaines, saith Fabricius, that we consider and contemplate in what Order, that is, which part is made first, and which after in the Egge. In prosecution whereof there are two foundations to be laid: one in respect of the body: the other in relation to the incorporeal substance, as, the Nature or Soul. I call that (saith he) the Cor∣poreal foundation, which depends upon, and flowes from the Nature of the body: and whereof an instance is easily deduced from things made by art: For, as e∣very edifice doth first require a foundation, upon which the whole frame is to be laid and supported: whence the walls are set up, which do sustaine the Floors and Roofe: and then the Houshold-stuff, and other furniture are introduced; so doth nature proceed in the Fabrick of Animals. For first she laies the Bones as the foundation, that all the parts of the Body may grow to, hang, upon, and be established by them. Which bones are first made under another capacity. For since Bones take their first rise from a most soft and membranous substance, and doe afterwards attaine their induration; therefore much time must be allotted to the Generation of the Bones, that so they may become the hardest parts; and hereupon they are begotten first. And for this reason Galen did not compare the structure of an Animal to every kind of building, but chiefly to that of a Ship. For, saith he, as the foun∣dation
and original of the Ship is the Keel, from which the sides, or planks imbowed, and placed at a distance one from the other (like a Hurdle) are set up on both sides, that so the whole frame of the Ship may be after∣wards finished out of the Keel, as a convenient foun∣dation; So in the fabrick of an Animal, Nature first stretcheth out the Chine bone, with the Ribbes drawn round it, as the Keel, and congruous principle, where∣on she foundeth and finisheth the whole Pile. But Experience doth abundantly confute this phansie: for it is evident, that the Bones are ra∣ther made last of all. For the Bones of the Limbs, the Skull and Teeth, are not made before the Brain, the Muscles, and fleshey parts; but even after the nativity, in the tender, and (otherwise) perfect foetus, they are onely Gristles, and Membranes, and afterwards in tract of time arrive to the solidity of Bones, as doth appear by Infants Skulls, and the Ribbes and Joints of Embryo's. And though it be true, that the first platforme of the body appears like a Bent or incurved Keel, yet is it of a soft, mucous, and glutinous consi∣stence, no way resembling either the Nature, Constitution, or Office of a Bone. As also the small Globous bodies which are its appendixes (de∣signed for the parts of the Head) have no solidity at all in them, but are onely Vesicles stuffed with clear water, which are afterward transformed into the Braine, After-braine, and Eyes; and are at last fenced with the Skull, namely, after the Bill, and Clawes have attained solidity, and obdu∣ration. Wherefore this Contemplation of Fabricius is a sleepy, and injurious one; He not considering what really is done by nature in the order of Ge∣neration, but rather what nature according to his
phansie, ought to have done; as if Nature did imitate Art, and Art were not rather Natures Ape. Which comming into his head, himself afterwards saith, Satius fuerit dicere, &c. It is a more dilibe∣rate pag. 44. assertion to say, that Art was Natures Scholar, and wrought by her Copy: because as Galen every where pronounceth, Nature is of more Antiquity, and wiser in her productions then Art. And though the bones are the foundation of the whole body, without which it can nor stand nor move: yet it is sufficient for them, if they are made together with those parts, which do rely upon them. For where the things which are to be upheld are not in being, the Props are provid∣ed to no purpose. But nature doth nothing rash∣ly; nor constitutes parts, before there is use of them. But all Animals attaine their parts, so soon as action and usefulness is required of them. And therefore this first foundation of Fabricius his laying, countenanced by his own observations in the Egge, and Galens simile, is clean demolish∣ed. He seems to come neerer the Mark, when hee saith, The other foundation of producing the parts in order, is desumed from Nature, that is, the soul; which is Queen Regent of the animal body. For since there are two degrees of the soul, the Vegetal and Sensative; and the Vegetal is, tempore & naturâ prior, first both in time and nature, because it is common to the very Plants; doubtless the Instruments subservient to the Vegetal, are first to be made and fitted, before those that attend the sensitive and motive faculties: especially the more principal ones, and where the Queen keeps Court. Now these are chiefly two, the Liver, and the Heart: the Liver as the throne of the Vegetal or Nutritive: and the Heart as that Minister of State,
who by his heat and warmth, doth enliven and com∣pleat both the Vegetal, and other Faculties, and there∣fore holds a strong league and confederacy with the Ve∣getal. Wherefore if after three dayes Incubation, you discern in that part of the egge where the Chicken is bred, the heart panting, (as Aristotle also testifieth) muse not at it, but conclude that the heart relates to the vegetal Faculty, and is therefore the first begotten. Now it is also consonant to Reason, that the Liver also should be Twinne to the Heart, and born with it, but doth not appear, because he wants a palpitation, which the Heart hath. For even Aristotle himself saith, That the Liver and the Heart are constituted in the body up∣on like grounds; so that if there be a Heart, there must be a Liver too. If therefore the Liver and Heart are first begotten, it also followes, that the other Organs that are menial servants relating to these two, should be begotten together with them; as, the Lungs for the Heart; and for the Liver, almost all the parts which are contained in the Lower Belly. But all this is very wide from that order and progress which we see in the Egge. Nor is it true, that the Liver is born together with the Heart: nor will that shift serve his turn, where he pre∣tends, Latere Jecur, quia non palpitat, that the Li∣ver lyeth concealed, because it is not exposed by palpitation. For the Eyes, the Vena Cava, and the Carina, the Keel, are discerned even from the very first, yet have they no palpitation. What impedi∣ment then to barre the Liver and Lungs (if they are then in being) from being seen? Nay, he him∣self, in his Figure or Table, representing the fourth day, hath described a small Point in the midst, and yet he hath not signified any palpitation belonging to it; nor did he own it for the Heart, but sup∣posed it to be the first rudiment of the body: where∣fore
he speaks onely out of conjecture, and pre∣entertained opinion, when he proclaims the Princi∣pality of the Liver: as other men have also done, (namely, Aldrovandus, and Parisanus) who casu∣ally lighting upon two Points, and could not dis∣cover a Pulse in both, at one and the same time, conceived the one to be the Heart, and the other the Liver. As if the Liver had any pulse at all; but those two Points are the two Vesiculae Pul∣santes, returning answer to each other in alternate contractions; as hath been noted in our History. Wherefore, either Fabricius is deceived, or doth deceive, where he saith, Presently in the first pro∣gress of generation, the Liver, Heart, Veines, Arteries, Lungs, and all the parts contained in the lower belly; likewise the Keel, that is, the Head, with the Eyes, and the whole Spine and Chest, are born and framed. For the Heart, Veins, and Arteries, are perfectly distin∣guished, for some time, before the Keel; and the Carina, or Keel, before the Eyes; and the Eyes, the Bill, and Sides, before the Members contained in the lower belly: and also the Stomack, and Guts, before the Liver, or Lungs, are discerned. And that order is observed in generation, which we shall presently describe. He is likewise deceived, when he decrees the Ve∣getal part to have a being both in time and nature before the sensitive and the motive. For that which is first in Nature, is for the most part after, in the order of Generation. In time, indeed, the Vegetal part is before, because the sensitive soule cannot be without it. For it cannot actually exist in the body without Organs, it being Actus corporis Organici, the Act of the Organical bo∣dy: but the sensitive and motive Organs, are the workmanship of the vegetative; and the sensitive
soul (before it actually exist) is tanquam Trigonus in Tetragono, like a Triangle in a Quadrangle. But Nature first intends that which is most principal and noble; and therefore the Vegetal faculty is af∣ter in the order of Nature, as being subservient to the sensitive, and motive Faculty. Of the Order of Parts in Genera∣tion, according to Aristotle. EXER. LV. THat which relates to the order of Generation, according to Aristotle, is thus: When the Con∣ception De gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. is ordained, it proceeds as Seeds do. For Seeds also have a first Principle in themselves; which being first contained in potentiâ, when by and by it is seve∣red, it sends forth a bud, and a root, whereby it at∣tracts aliment; for it requires growth. So in some sort in a conception, where the parts are all in potentiâ, the Principle is chiefly active. This Principle in an Egge (analogous to the blossom of Plants) we with Fabricius call Macula, a Speck, or Cicatricula, a small Cicatrice: which we have avouched to be the principal particle, in which all the other parts are in potentiâ, & whence afterwards they arise in their order. For in it is contained that thing (be it what it will) which renders the Egge prolifical; and there is the first effect of the vegetal heat, and operation of the Forming faculty first discovered. Macula isthaec, that Speck (as hath been shewed) is presently dilated after incubation, and divided
into Circles; in whose Center a small white Point (like the Cicatricula, in the ball of the Eye) doth display it self: where by and by the Punctum ru∣brum, the Red point, is discovered panting, with the capillary branches of Veines containing blood; and that presently, so soon as ever the Colliquamentum by us mentioned, is framed of that Macula. Wherefore Aristotle proceeds; The Heart is first actually discerned; and that not onely discoverable to Ibid. sense, but according to reason. For since that which is begotten is now disjoyned from both parents, it ought to demean, govern, and dispose of it self, as a Son set free by his Father, and seated apart. And therefore a Principle, and that an Intrinsecal one, must needs be had, by which afterwards the order of the Parts is to be prescribed, and all things relating to the complement of the Animal, managed, and disposed. For if it were Extrinsecal at any time, and afterwards began to en∣ter in, you would not only be in suspense, and question when it went in, but conclude, that since each part is distinguished, it was necessary that part should subsist, out of which both growth and motion is conferred upon the other parts. In another place he saith, The first Principle is a part of the whole, and not any separate thing, which is contained apart from it. For, saith he, when the Animal is now generated, is that Princi∣ple corrupted, or doth it remain? Now nothing seems to be in, which is not a part of the whole, be it Plant, or Animal. And that it should be corrupted, when it hath been at the expence of making all, or some of the parts, is very absurd; for what shall make the remainder? Wherefore (he proceeds) who side with Democritus, saying, That the exteriour parts of the Animal are first made, and then the interiour: as if they were to build a wodden or stony Animal, do not say well; for such a creature as that hath no Principle in it self. But all A∣nimals
have, and contain one within them. Where∣upon the Heart is first seen in all Animals, in which there is blood; for that is the Principle of the similar, and dissimilar parts. Now that thing which requires Aliment, ought already to have received that prin∣ciple of an Animal, and constituted Foetus. Which words do plainly declare, that Aristotle did conclude of an Order in the Generation of A∣nimals, and of a Principal part, namely, the Heart, which (like a Son at liberty) is the first animate, and primogenit part of the Animal, contained, and abiding in it: whence not onely the method of the parts is set down, but the Animal it self, pre∣served, and relyes upon it, receiving continual life and sustenance; and that thence, whatsoever is necessary to the perfection of the Animal, is de∣rived. For, (as Seneca saith) in the Seed is the whole Nat. quest. l. 3. c. 19. accompt of the future Man comprehended. And the In∣fant yet unborn hath a Standard and Commission for a Beard, and a Gray-head. For the dimension of his body, and ensuing yeares, are already deciphered in a small, mysterious character. Now whether the Heart be the Primigenial part, or no, we have determined above. To wit, if Ari∣stotles speech be understood of that part, which (in the Anatomy of Living creatures) is seen by the eye to be before the rest, (that is, of the Punctum saliens, together with the Veines streaming with blood) we cheerfully embrace his judgement. For we believe, that the Blood, together with the Vessels, and Instruments; namely, the Umbilical Veines, (by which, as by Roots, the Nutriment is attracted) and Vesiculae pulsantes (to whom it is distributed for the life and growth of the parts) is constituted before any other. For (as Aristotle saith) the matter by which any thing is augmented,
and out of which it is first made, is one and the same. But they are much abused, who conceive, that the diverse parts of the Body are sustained with a diverse aliment. As though Nutrition were nothing but a bare choice, and attraction of aliment: and that no concoction, assimilation, apposition, and trans∣mutation, were required of the particular parts which are to be nourished: which was the opini∣on of Anaxagoras of old. Lucret. l. 1. Principium Rerum qui dixit Homoeomeriam; Ossa videlicet è pauxillis atque minutis Ossibus; sic & de pauxillis atque minutis Visceribus, Viscus gigni: sanguenque creari, Sanguinis inter se multis coeuntibu' guttis. Who said, that Things from their Like∣parts begin; That Bones from less, and fewer Bones do spring; And Intrals rise from Intrals, Blood from Blood, Where the Confederate drops make up the Flood. But Aristotle most truly saith: Distinction of parts is not, as some suppose, upon that ground, that Like is In the place be∣fore cit∣ed. of its own nature tending to its Like: for besides ma∣ny other difficulties which beset that opinion, it will fol∣low, that every similar part must be ordained apart by it self: as for instance; Bones by themselves, Nerves, and Flesh by themselves, in case that opinion be admit∣ted. But, indeed, the Nutriment of all parts is common and similar, as the Yolk in the Egge; and not heterogeneous, and compounded of diverse parts. And therefore what we have said concern∣ing
the matter out of which the Parts are made: we pronounce the same of the matter out of which they are augmented; namely, that the parts do as∣sume their Nourishment out of that matter, in which all the Parts are in potentiâ, but none actu. As out of the same Showre all kinds of Plants take growth, because that moisture, which was be∣fore like in potentiâ to them all, is now made like them actu, being transformed into their substance; And is also bitter in Rue, sharp in the Mustard, and sweet in Licorise; and so in the rest. He goes on, to explain what Parts are generated before others; and that with a reason not much unlike Fabricius his Fundamentum secundum, his se∣cond ground or foundation, saying, Id cujus cau∣sâ, & quod ejus causâ, differunt; & alterum genera∣tione, alterum essentiâ prius est; namely, the End is first in Nature and Essence, in respect of that thing which is made for the Ends sake; but That which is made for the Ends sake, must needs be first in Generation. And by that Argument Fabricius rightly inferrs, that those Parts which are subser∣vient to the Vegetative soul, are all made before those which are instrumental to the sensative, be∣cause that is subordinate to this. After this, he subjoines the differences of such things as are made for any End; namely, that some things are instituted for some End by nature, because the End doth ensue upon them: but some, because they are Instruments which the End makes use of: and those he calls Genitalia, but these, Instrumentalia. For the End, saith he, in some things is after, and in some, before those things which are their causes. For the Generant himself, and that which he imployes in Generation, must needs exist before that which is generated by them.
And therefore the Parts subservient to the Vegeta∣tive soul, are before those which are retained by Sense, and Motion. But the Parts dedicated to Motion and the Senses, are after the sensitive and motive Faculties; as being instrumental, and made use of by the sensitive and motive Faculty. For by Natures Law, no Parts or Instruments are made and constituted, before there be imployment for them, and a faculty be ready at hand, to set them to work. So neither the Eye, nor the Instruments of Motion are set up, till the Brain is built, or the faculty be already provided, which is to See, or Move. In like manner, because the Vesiculae pulsantes do (as Instruments) minister to the motion of the Blood; and likewise the whole Frame and Fabrick of the Heart (as we have evidenced in our Book de Motu Sanguinis) is Instrumental; (namely, that the Blood may be continually hurried round the Body in a Circle) the Blood seems to have a being both in Order of Nature and Generation before the Heart; which he imployes as an Instrument, having be∣gotten it also, and doth persist to nourish, and con∣vey heat, spirits, & life unto it by the Coronal Artery. But how this General Rule of Aristotle concern∣ing the prae-ordering of the Parts, doth appear to be true by Anatomical Observation, we shall declare hereafter. In the mean time, we will enquire, af∣ter what manner he himself doth sufficiently de∣duce the Causes of Priority, as I may so say, in Ge∣neration, according to this Rule. After the Principle (namely the Heart) are the Interiour parts begotten, before the exteriour; the su∣periour, before the inferiour: for the inferiour are for the superiours sakes, as being their instrument: after the pattern observed in Plants, which shoot forth their Roots, before their Branches.
But Nature doth not use that method in Gene∣ration; nor is the instance alwayes true; for in Beanes, Ciches, and other Pulse, also in Acornes or Mast, and Corne, it is apparent that at the same time, the Stalk shootes upward from the same Bud, and the Roots downward. Likewise Onions, and other bulbous plants, do germinate upwards before they fix downwards. But he adjoines another cause of this order; to wit, Nature makes nothing superfluous, nor nothing in vaine, whence it appears, that nothing is made by her, either before or after another, otherwise then need requires. Namely, those parts are first genera∣ted, whose uses and functions are first required: some also are sooner begun, because they call for more time to perfect them, that so they may be ready for the birth, together with others that are forwarder then they. As the Cook being to pro∣vide a feast, where some provisions (by reason of their solidity) aske a slower fire, and longer time to prepare them, he laies them down to the fire first: but to those that are sooner dispatched, and are dressed with a gentler heat, he applyeth him∣selfe last: and such also as are to be served up in the first course, he makes ready first, but those in the second, last. So likewise nature, in the ge∣neration of Animals, is late ere she delineate the moist, soft, and fleshey parts, (as being quickly cooked, and reduced into shape) but for the hard and more solid (as the bones) because they exact a large Evaporation, and Exsiccation, and their matter continues long indigested, to them she ad∣dresses her selfe first of all. For in the Braine also, saith he, the same falls out, namely, that at first it is very moist, and great in quantity: but anon, the hu∣midity evaporating, and being concocted, it growes
more solid, and so the quantity of the Head, and Eyes, do abate. In the beginning therefore, the Head seems very bigge (in comparison of all the rest of the bo∣dy, which it much exceeds in bulke) by reason of the Braine: and the eyes very large, by reason of the humour conteined in them. But yet the eyes are per∣fected last; because even the Braine it selfe is long ere it grow to a consistence. For it is long ere it get the mastery, and drein the water, and especially in a Man. For the Sinciput is last confirmed of all the Bones; for that bone is yet soft, even when the Child is born into the World. He also proceeds to another reason; namely, that the parts are framed of different materials. The more noble parts, (saith he) and those that par∣ticipate the worthiest principles, are constituted of the concocted, purest, and chiefest aliment: the other ne∣cessary parts, made for their sakes, are fashioned out of the baser matter, the reliques, and dregs. For Nature, like a prudent Master of a Family, loseth nothing, out of which he can make any advantage, but so manages the matter in his house, that his Children may fare best, his Servants harder then they, and the scraps or refuse thrown to the Dogs. As therefore, In∣cremento jam addito, mens advena facit haec, that is, (as I interpret it) a prudent man grown to years of discretion, disposes thus of his Charge; So in the framing of things, Nature (by an inbred wisdome and prudence) formes the flesh, and substance of the instruments of sense, out of the most refined mat∣ter, but the Bones, Nerves, Hair, Nailes, Hoofes, and the like, out of the Dregs, (that is the refuse, re∣mainders, or fragments) And therefore these are made last, when nature hath now good store of course materials. And after this, he distinguisheth of two sorts of Aliment; one of Nutrition, the other of Aug∣mentation.
That of Nutrition, saith he, doth sup∣ply a being to the whole, and all the parts, that of augmentation procureth an accession to the magni∣tude. According to what we finde in the Egge; where the White (as the more refined Aliment) relates to the first Nutrition of the Chicken; the Yolk to its augmentation. And the thinner White (as hath been shewed) conduceth to the formation of the First, and nobler Parts; but the Courser, and the Yolk, to the augmentation of the Nobler, and formation of the more Ignoble. For, he saith, the Nerves are framed as the Bones, out of the seminal and nutritive excrement. But the Nailes, Haire, Spurres, and all like these, are formed out of augmen∣tative, and adventitious meats; which the Foetus both receives from the Mother, and also doth provide of it selfe. And after this he at last gives the rea∣son, why Man (since other Animals are provided with their Garments, and Weapons at Natures price) should be borne naked, and unarmed; namely, that those kind of parts are constituted of the excrementitious parts, and reliques, but the materials of Men are purer, in which there is very litle terrene, or crude excrement to be found. And thus far have we made use of Aristotle, con∣cerning the Order of Generation: where all seems to be bottomed upon one foundation; namely, Natures Perfection; which in all her Workman∣ship, hath nothing short, nor nothing superflu∣ous, but always disposeth matters for the best. And therefore no parts had been precedent or sub∣sequent to one another, if it had been more ad∣vantagious to have formed them altogether; which is to be understood of Her, as often as she acts free∣ly, and by choice. For sometimes she acts other∣wise,
being as it were under constraint, and put beside her purpose; which happens, when either by defect of matter, or superfluity thereof, or by the default of her instruments, or some outward impediments, she is hindered in her work, and frustrated of her aime, or end. And hence it comes to pass sometimes, that the final parts are gene∣rated before the Instrumental: I call those final parts, which employ others, (as their instruments.) And because some parts are Genital parts, which Nature sets to work about the Generation of other parts, or else to remove some Obstructi∣ons in her proceedings, which in case they con∣tinue, the Generation may be retarded: and o∣thers are under another capacity: therefore it comes to pass, that according to the disposition of the matter, and other requisites, the parts are diversly made some after other, and some of them are in hand before, but are not finished till after∣wards: some are begun and finished before others are begun, and others are as soon begun as their fellows, but finished after them. And therefore in the generation of some Animals, the same order is not always observed, but it is much different and various; and in some no order at all: but all the parts are begun, and finished at a heat: namely by a Metamorphosis, as we shewed. And lastly, hence it happens that the Primogenit part is such, that in it is concluded both the Beginning, and the End; as well that for whose sake all are made (namely the soul) as also that which is its cause in chief, and Genital part. The Heart therefore (or, ac∣cording to my perswasion, the Blood) is the first throne of the Soul; the fountain of life; the Ve∣stal fire; the Genital warmth; and the very Ca∣lidum Innatum; the first Efficient of all his mini∣string
parts, having atcheived the soul for his end, which commands them all as her leige-peo∣ple. The Heart I say, (as Aristotle will have it) is he, for whose sake the whole Fabrick and Fa∣mily of the parts are provided, and who also is the Fountain, and Father of them all. Of the Order of Parts in Generation, as it appears by our Observations. EXER. LVI. THat we may at last propose our own opinion of the Order of Parts, as we have collected it out of several Observations of our own; we in∣tend to distinguish the whole work of Generation (in all Animals whatsoever) into two Fabricks. Whereof the first is that of the Egge; namely, of the Conception, and Seed, or of that, whatso∣ever it is, which (in Spontaneous productions) an∣swereth in proportion to Seed; whether we un∣derstand it under the notion of Calidum nativum coeleste in humido primigenio, the Innate celestial substance, in the Primigenial moist, with Ferne∣lius, or with Aristotle, of Calor Vitalis in humors comprehensus, the vital heat concluded in moi∣sture. For the Conception in Viviparous Ani∣mals (as we have said) is answerable to the Seed and Fruit of Plants; as also the Egge, in Ovipa∣rous; in Spontaneous productions, the Worme, or some Bulla teeming by the Vital heat of the con∣teined moisture. In all which the same thing is
comprehended, which may truly call them Seeds; namely, out of which, and by which (as the mat∣ter, and Efficient, and pre-existent Organ) every Animal is first made and borne. The Other Fabrick is of the Foetus, born out of the Seed, or Conception. For the Matter, and the Final, and Efficient causes, and the Instru∣ments necessary to the worke, must first be, before any part of the Production can begin. The Fabrick of the Egge we have already seen: but that of the Foetus (so far as we could discover out of dissections) is perfected (especially in the more perfect race of Animals, and such as have blood) chiefly by four degrees, or processions: which according to the several times of generati∣on, we shall reduce into as many Orders; de∣monstrating withall that the same thing which is discerned in the Egge, is alike in every concepti∣on and seed. The First progress is of the Primogenit, and Genital part, namely of the blood, with its re∣ceptacles, or if you will have it so, of the Heart and his Veins. Now this part is first begotten, chiefly for two reasons, both because it is the principal part, which makes use of all the rest, as its Instruments; and for whose sake the other parts seem to be produ∣ced: as also, because it is the Chiefe Genital part, the Fountain and Author of the rest; The part in which is concluded both the Beginning and End of Generation; the same being Pater & Rex, Parent, and Sovereign. In the Generation of these Parts, (which is deter∣mined in the Egge the Fourth day) though I could not observe any Order; because all its par∣ticles (Blood, Veins, and Vesicula pulsans) appear
at once; yet I believe (as I said) that the blood is in it, before the Pulse: and that it also in Natures Law, is before it receptacles, the Veins: for the substance and structure of the Heart (namely the one with its Ventricles and Auricles) as it is ge∣nerated long after with the other Intrals, so ought it to be registered in their Classis, which is the Third. In this structure, the veines are conspicuous be∣fore the Arteries, at least, as farre as we could ob∣serve. The Second Journal, which sets out after the fourth day, discovers a certain Concrementum, or coagulated substance, which I call Vermiculum, seu Galbam, the litle Worm, or Magot; (for it seems to enjoy the life and obscure motion of a Galba) and this, as it congeals into a gelly, is divided into two parts; whereof the upper and the larger is con∣globated, and distinguished into three Vesicles; namely, that of the Brain, After-brain, and one of the Eyes: but the lesser, carinam referens, resembling the Keel of a Ship, is superinduced upon the Vena Cava, and is extended according to its length. In the structure of the Head, the Eyes are first discerned, and anon a white spot starts up for the Bill, and the filme drying about, it becomes pro∣tected by a membrane. At this time also the adumbration, or rough draft of the rest of the Body seems to succeed; where first upon the Carina the sides or plancks, as it were, of a Boat seem to arise; being at first of a similar consistence, but afterwards by most white streaks they are signified to be the lines of the Ribs. After this, the members of Motion, namely, the Wings and Legs do appear: and at last the Keel, and Limbs born by a kinde of Superfoetation, are
distinguished into Muscles, Bones, and Joints. Those two first mishapen materials of the Head and Body, do together appear, and are together distinguished: but afterwards, when they tend towards growth and perfection, the body gets the start, and is much sooner grown and shaped; so that the Head which did at first out-strip the whole body beside, in bulk and magnitude, is now very much short of it. And this is likewise natu∣ral to humane productions. The like Disparity is between the Body it selfe & the Limbs; for in an Infant (from that time that the Embryo exceeds not the length of the Nail of the litle Finger, till he be encreased to the stature of a Frog, or a Mouse) his Arms are so short, that if you stretch out his fingers over his breast, to their farthest extent, they will not be able to touch one another; and his thighs are so short, that be∣ing reflected upon his Abdomen, they will hardly reach to his Navel. Nay, in Children lately born, the proportion of the bulk of the Body is a pretty deal larger then that of the Limbs, untill they are able to stand, and go. And therefore Infants are first Dwarfs, and crawle like beasts, & attempt to move on, though upon all four: but go upright they cannot, till the prolixity of their Legs and Thighs exceed the longi∣tude of the rest of the Body. And hence is it, that their first venture to foot it, represents them a prone kinde of Cattell, which can scarce exalt themselves to the erection of a Cock. And therefore amongst grown persons, the long slimme Fellows, (whose Thighs, but especially their Shanks, are longer then ordinary) can stand, walk, run, or vault longer, and at more ease, then square, and well trussed men.
In this second Process, several actions of the For∣mative faculty pursuing one another, may be ob∣served; (as in the Automata, or engines that go of themselves; where the fore-going wheel sets his fol∣lower upon motion too) and all the parts spring from the same gelly, and similar substance. Not as De gen. an, l. 2. c. 4. some Natural Philosophers expound it, who say, that Like is hurried unto its like: but we must say, That the parts are moved not by changing their station, but remaining where they were, and altering in softness, hardness, complexion, and those other differences of si∣milar parts; being now made those things Actu, which they were before in Potentiâ: that is, the Limbs, the Spine, and the rest of the Body, are altogether for∣med and encreased, are together described, and complexioned: also the Bones, Flesh, Nerves, and Gristles, which were all similar at first in the same members, and of one kinde of substance, in progress of Time are plainly distinct; and being conjoined, make up Organical Parts, by whose mutual conne∣xion and continuity the whole body is compiled. So in the Head, the membrane growing every where light, the Brain arrives to its consistence, the Eyes are polished out of a fluid instable moisture. Nature doth feed and enlarge all the Parts, out of the self same Nutriment, whereof the first did frame them, (not as many will have it, out of a diverse one, and such as is like to every particle) namely, by augmenting her same gelly, or worm: and like a potter, first she divides her materials, and she allots to the Trunk, the Head, and the Limbs, every one their share or cantlin: as Painters do, who first draw the Lineaments, and then lay on the Colours: and as a Ship Carpenter, first layes the Keel for a foundation, and then sets up the Ribs, and Breast-bone, or Deck: and as he builds a boat, so
doth Nature the Trunk of the Body, and hasp on the Joints. And in her work, she begins all the si∣milary part out of the same Primitive gelly, or glu∣tinous mass, (namely, the Bones, Gristles, Flesh, Nerves, &c.) For at first there appears nothing of the Bones, but a kinde of filaments, or threddy fi∣bres; which afterwards become nervous, anon Gristles, after that, like thorns, and at last down right Bones. So likewise the thicker Membrane in∣vesting the Brain, proceeds first to be gristly, and afterwards into a Skull: while the thin Membrane doth improve into a Coat, or Pericranium, and Flesh. And in the same Order the Flesh, and Nerves, out of a yeilding gelly, do concoct and strengthen, into Muscles, Tendons, and Ligaments: The braine, and after-braine, from a thin Water, coagulate into a Callous Curd; for the braine of Infants, before the bones of the Synciput are confir∣med, appears soft and fluid, and hath no more coherence, then coagulated Milk. The third Process is of the Intrals; whose gene∣ration is discovered in the Chicken, after the de∣lineation of the body; (namely about the sixth or seventh day) and neer upon the same time, they all appear, that is, the Liver, Lungs, Kidnies, the Cone of the Heart and its ventricles, and also the Guts. But their first original is from the Veines, and are bred growing to them, (like Wens to the barke of Trees) and at first they appear white, blood∣less, and like a gelly; and so continue till they are ripe for publick imployment. The Guts with the Stomack seem at first like white threads, wa∣ved or contorted, extended through the longi∣tude of the belly: and together with them the Fa∣brick of the Mouth is discovered; from which to the Fundament in a continued procession, the top
is united and linked to the bottom: the Genitals al∣so are about this time visible. Yet hitherto the Bowels and Guts are not shut up within the hollow of the body, but being fastned as it were to the Veines hang forth: and thus doth even the Heart himself. For the trunk of the body hitherto resembles a Skiff without a deck, or a House without a roof; as being hitherto no way covered over by the anteriour parts; namely, the Breast, and Abdomen. But so soon as the Sternum, or breast-bone is fra∣med, the Heart enters into the breast, as into a ha∣bitation of his own setting up, and furnished pur∣posely for him; and being now retired, like the Genius of the place, he undertakes the patronage of the whole Mansion; and there dwells, with his servants the Lungs. After this, the Heart and Sto∣mack retreat too; & at last the Guts shrowd them∣selves in the Belly. So that in a Hen-egge after the tenth day of Incubation, the Heart admits no spectators without dissection. About this time the top of the Bill, and the Claws break forth, being all exceeding white; and now a chylous matter is visible in the Stomack, and a kind of Excrement in the Guts; and the Li∣ver being now begun hath the Gall, which ap∣pears green adjoined to it. By which it appears, that a different Concoction, and Preparation of the Aliment is now made, (whereof these are the Excrements, from that which is performed by the Propagations of the Umbilical Vessels: so that a just doubt may hence arise, how Choler (the Ex∣crement of the Second Concoction) can be sepa∣rated from the rest of the Humours by the Livers help, when it is it self in being at the same time with the Liver.
The Interiour parts are Universally generated, after the Order proposed: for in all Animals (which I ever diffected) they are framed after the same Manner, and Order: and especially in the more perfect, in Four-footed Beasts, and so in Man himself; In whom the Heart, Liver, Lungs, Spleen, and Guts, appear framed, and augmented in the Second, Third, and Fourth Moneths, at which times they are white, as also the whole Body. And hereupon the first days are not impro∣perly called in lacte dies, the Dayes in the Milk; for the Bowels, and all the other parts appeare spermatical, except onely the Veines, and chiefly those of the Navel. The Umbilical Arteries are, I conceive, framed after their Name-sakes, the Veines; because they are scarce to be found in the first moneths, and take their Original from the Branches which descend to the Thighes: And therefore, I conceive, they are not constituted before that part of the body, (from whence they are derived.) But the Umbili∣cal Veines are conspicuous long before any part of the Body is in hand. What I have now delivered, hath been ratified out of many dissections of humane Embryo's of (al∣most) all sizes: for I have observed them from the bigness of a Tad-pole, till they became of the longitude of seven or eight fingers breadth, and so upwards to the Birth. And especially in the se∣cond, third, and fourth moneths; at which times the greatest Alterations befall them, and the progress of Generation is most evident. Therefore, in a humane Embryo of two moneths old, those very things which we have related in the second Process, do appear begun. For in the first moneth I conceive there is litle or nothing of the
foetus extant in the womb; at least I never found a∣ny thing. But that moneth expiring, I have fre∣quently seen a conception cast out (like to that which Hippocrates relates to have fallen from the Minstrell) of the bigness of a Pheasants, or Pigeons egge, and it was of an Oval figure, just like an Egg with the Shell pilled off; but the thicker mem∣brane (called Chorion) encompassing it, was plai∣stered on the out side, as it were, with a mucous sub∣stance, (especially in the obtuser end) but within it was slippery, being full of clear and stiff water, con∣taining nothing else at all. In the second moneth, I have often seen such a kinde of Egg (but larger) ejected upon indications of Abortment, namely the Lochia ichorosa; and it hath been sometimes entire, and sometimes broken, covered over with clotted blood. Within, it was smooth and slippery, the blood adhering without, and its form was like the other. In some of these eject∣ments I have found a foetus, in other, none. That foetus hath been of the length of the nail of the litle finger, but the shape was like a litle frog, save onely that the head was great, and the leggs extremly short: just like the Tadpoles in June, which when their limbs begin to shoot out, they loose their tail, and put on the shape of Frogs. All its substance was white, and so soft and gellyish, that unless it were cast into clear water, you could not hold it in your hand. The face was like that of other A∣nimals, as of a Dog, or Cat, without lips, and a wide mouth from one care to the other. Divers Women, whose Conception (like an addle Egge) is fruitless, and without a Foetus, do suffer abortion the third moneth. I have often dissected an abortion of that age (being of the bigness of a Goose-egg) wherein was a foetus, distinct in all its
parts; though their form was rough, and un∣shapen, The Head, Eyes, and Limbs appeared, but the Muscles were confused: having no bones, but in their places, certain Lineaments, and softer Gristles, as it were; the substance of the Heart was most white, having two Ventricles of equal magni∣tude and thicknesse, and a double Cone, like two small Twin-kernels of a Nut; the Liver was won∣drous litle, and also white. All this time, name∣ly, for three moneths space Vix quicquam Placen∣tae, sive hepatis Uterini, scarce any thing of the Af∣ter-burden is to be seen. In all these kinde of Conceptions (as many as I have seen) I still found the ambient membrane fraught with a vast quantity of watry substance: in which the floating Embryo is so exceeding small, compared with the place where his abode is, and hath withall so long and winding a Navel; that those waters ought not upon any tearms to bee thought the sweat, or Urine of the Embryo; but more probably, his nutriment, provided by nature (like the Colliquamentum in the Egge.) For I could finde no indication to induce me to believe, that that conception, or Egge had any connexion to the Womb: onely the outward superficies of the obtuser end, looked something more wrinckled and thick; like the first intention of a future placen∣ta. Moreover those Conceptions appeared to mee, like certain egges, which were onely to be har∣boured within the Womb, but to be nourished (like the Henne-egge) by their owne projection, or in∣dustry. Now in the fourth moneth, you would admire how much the Foetus is improved; for by this, it is encreased from a Thumb-length to a Span: and
all his members appear distinct, and have a tin∣cture of Blood; the Muscles of the Limbs, and the Bones are now apparent; and also the Rudiments of the Nailes; and the Embryo begins to bestirre himself soundly. Yet the Head is still very bigge; and the Face without Lips, Cheeks, or Nose: the chasm of the Mouth is very large, whose space is half supplied by the Tongue; the Eyes small, and without Lids; the middle part of the Fore-head, and all the upper-part of the Head is covered with a Membrane, which is not as yet cartilaginous, so far is it from being Boney: but the hinder part of the Head is something hard, and Cartilaginous, implying that the Skull beginnes to grow so∣lid. The Genitals likewise did appear, but the Testi∣cles were seated within the Abdomen (where in fe∣males the Uterus resideth) the Scrotum remaining empty. The Feminine parts were imperfect, and the Uterus with its litle Tubuli, did represent for∣mam bicornem, the two horned shape of the Uterus of a Lamb. And now the Placenta was enlarged, and af∣fixed to the Womb; comprehending almost halfe the Conception; appearing to my eye like a Tumor, or fleshey excrescence of the Womb: its Gibbous part did stick so fast, even throughout its whole extent, to the Womb, which was now grown thicker. In∣to this Placenta the litle Umbilical branches (like slender rootes into the Earth) did insinuate them∣selves: and by its mediation the Conception was now first tyed to the Womb. The large and fluid Braine resembled Cheese-Curd, and was embroidered with larger Veines. The two Ventricles of the Heart, both of the same magnitude, and their walls equally thick. In the
Region of the Breast within the Ribs, I saw three hollow places, and those not much unlike each other: the lowest of which, the Lungs having Blood in them, and of like complexion with the Liver and Kidnies, did inhabit: the middle was possessed by the Heart and Pericardium: but the upper was filled with that large Glandule which we call Thymus, the Sweet-Bread. In the Stomack was Chyle, of like substance to that in which the Embryo swims: There was also a coagulated substance which was white, like to those white curded pollutions which the Midwife washeth off from the Infant (especially from the foulds of the Skin) so soon as it is borne. In the superiour Intestines was Excrement, or some part of the Chyle, in the inferiour a litle dark excrement. In the Bladder was Urine found: and Gall in the Vesicle designed for its reception. Intestinum Ca∣cum, the blind Gut (just as it is in grown persons) like an empty superfluous appendix of the Colon; and nothing like what it is in other Animals, (as the Hogge, the Horse, and the Hare) in which it is like a Second Stomack. The Omentum, or Kell, did like a Caule, or thin transparent cloud, lye floa∣ting upon the Guts. The Reines at this time are not formed into a gibbous figure, as it is when men are grown, but are moulded of several gobbets (as you see in a Calfe, and in a Sturgeon) as if to every sprig or divaricati∣on of the Ureters, there were a gobbet or Teat, out of which their Orifices did draine the Urine. Up∣on the Kidnies there are the two Glandules (which Eustachius first found out) wherin store of blood lies; and their Vein, which Anatomist call Adipose, seems not much less then the Emulgent it self. The Liver, and Spleen, are equally full of blood (ac∣cording
to their several proportions.) And here we must observe by the way, that in every Humane Foetus that is lively and well, perfect Milk is found; wherewith chiefly the Glandule Thymus, or the Sweet-bread is stored. It is also found in the Pancreas, and almost all along the Mesentery, in certain Venae Lacteae as it were, and the Glandules placed between the divarications of the Meseraicke Veins. Nay sometimes it may be milked out at the breasts of New-borne Infants, and sometimes also it starts out of it self: which some Midwives say, doth make for the Infants Health. And that it may plainly appear, that the wa∣ter (which is so plenteous in the Conception) is no excrement discharged by the Embryo, as either his Sweat, or Urine; it is lesse (in proportion) neer the birth (when the foetus is now more grown, and upon that account doth accumulate more excrement, because he requires more nourishment) then in the first moneths of pregnation. And more∣over, at that time his bladder is full, and distended with Urine. And to say truth, that passage, (which Anatomists call the Urachus) which should (as they phansie) convey the Urine from the blad∣der, through the Navel, could never yet be found out: but I have often seen the bladder, pressed or griped with the hand, discharge the Urine out at the Yard, but never at the Urachus. And let this suffice, concerning what we have observed in a humane Foetus, so farre forth as it relates to the knowledge of the Order of the Parts. In the Fourth and last Process, the parts of meaner rank and condition are formed: such as do not simply relate to the very being, and pre∣servation of the Animal, but onely ad tutelam, to
its safe-guard against forreign injuries: or ad or∣natum, vel pugnam, to its Ornament, or for De∣fence. For that kind of Safe-guard or Defence, the ut∣most part (namely the Skin) is chiefly constituted, and all that proceeds out of it, as the Scarfe∣skin, the Haire, Wool, Plumes, Scales, Shells, Clans, Hoofs, and the like. And indeed it is a prudent contrivance of Nature (who never makes any thing indiscreetly,) to beget those parts last of all, whereof she hath no use till after nativity. And therefore the Chicken is borne with down onely on him, and not Feathers (as other Birds are, who are presently fitted for flight) because by wandring to and fro, he earns his sustenance with the industry of his Legs, rather then his Wings: And so again young Ducklins, and Gos∣lins, who prey in the water, have their Plumes, and Wings later perfected then their Legs: which is clean contrary in young Swallows, which, because they are to fly about to glean up a living, are soo∣ner versed in flight, then walking. Now the Down starts up in the Chicken after the Fourteenth day, when the Foetus is now com∣pleat, and provided with all his parts. But in many of them, at their first nativity, it lookes like dark spots or points; and after that the Feathers sprout up like Grasse in the Field, and at last ex∣patiate, and cloath the body round, protecting it from the inclemency of the Aire. The Feathers differ from Quills, in form, use, and place of Production. For Chickens are Fea∣thered ere they have Quills: for Quills spring on∣ly in their Wings, and Rump; and stick deeper in the bottome of the flesh, or the very Periostium it self, and are useful to motion: but the Feathers
rise out of the superficies of the Skinn, and serve for protection. Nailes, Hair, Hornes, and the like, saith Aristo∣tle, De gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. are bred out of the Flesh, in so much that they change colour with the Flesh: for the white, and black, and diverse coloured, are made so, according to the different complexion of the Skin. But in our Chicken, all this is clean otherwise, for what various co∣lour soever the Feathers be of, the Skin beneath them is of one onely. And many times one and the same Feather is diversly painted and disco∣loured, for the pomp and beauty of the Fowle. Likewise in the Humane Foetus, the Cutis and all the skinny parts are last perfected. And there∣fore at the beginning, there are neither Lips, nor Cheeks, nor Ears, nor Eye-lids, nor Nose to be seen: and that line wherby the upper-lip is united into one, doth close the last of all. The Humane production is also borne naked and unarmed; as one whom Nature had intended for a sociable, political, and peaceable creature: and to be ruled more by reason, then constrained by force. And therefore she hath furnished him with Hands, and Understanding, that having provi∣ded properties, he might cloath, and defend him∣self. For those Animals whom Nature hath made strong, she hath also armed with weapons agree∣able to their strength: but where she hath denied strength, she hath bestowed wit, and cunning, and an admirable dexterity to evade affronts. The Ornaments, as the Tuft upon the Head, the Comb, the Gills and the like, wherewith the haughty Animals swagger, are for the most part imparted to the male, more then the female: as also all weapons too, as Teeth, Hornes, and Spurs, &c. which appoints them for the Battail. And they are then
compleatest in the male, about that time when the female is in her prime, and provoked to leave an Heir behind her. For they are yet to come in the younger Animals, and in the aged they wither, and decline (as uselesse.) Our Dunghil-Cock (that famous Champion) so soon as he is strong, and ripe for generation, is provided of his Spurs, Comb, and Plumes; by which he becomes amiable in the fight of his Con∣cubines: and combats other Cocks not from any vaine Itch of Ostentation, but to perpetuate his own Linage, that so he that is best able to protect himself and his Charge, may have the prerogative to propagate the Species. For all those Animals which are well appointed with armes, and more Martial creatures then the rest, do ground their quarrels, either upon the Rescue of their Young, or their title to their habitations, or their husban∣dry for their provisions, but in chief, upon Rival∣ship in their Loves (and that, for posterities sake) and being subdued, as they lay by their pomp, and disdainful demeanour, so they surrender their claim to their Wives; and with dejected spirits languish out their days; while the Victor fleshed with the conquest, riots in the injoyment of the Captives Females. Nor is this their bravery any ascititious Ward∣robe, or some few daies Pageantry, or Masquing∣stuff, but a lasting one, and Natures liberal Dow∣ry, which delights not onely in the Embroidery of Animals (and chiefly of Birds) but hath imploi∣ed her Pencil upon Flowers, and Plants, adorning them with wonderful Art and variety of colours.
Certain Paradoxes, and Problemes to be considered of, concerning this Subject. EXEECIT. LVII. THus far have we spoken concerning the Order of Generation: by which the difference be∣tween those creatures which are produced by a Metamorphosis, and those which are borne by an Epigenesis, hath been discovered: as also, be∣tween those that spring from a Worme, and those that arise from an Egge: for these are bodied out of one part of the prepared matter, and fed with the other; But they take up the whole matter in their frame, or Constitution: these are together aug∣mented and formed; they are augmented first, and from a Canker-Worme grow into an Aurelia, and are afterwards formed and made consummate A∣nimals, as Butterflies, Silk-wormes, and such like Animals. And therefore Aristotle (as Fabricius observes) as he constitutes a kind of twofold nature of the egge, and a kind of twofold Egge in these creatures; so he laies down a twofold action, and a twofold Animal produced by it. For (saith he) out of the first egges, which are the first rudiments of the Generation, a Worm constantly doth proceed: namely, out of the Egges of Files, Ants, Bees, Silk-wormes, &c. in which a certain fluid matter is conteined, and out of all that fluid matter is the Worme made. But out of the se∣cond Egges, which are layed by the Worm himselfe, the Butterflie is born, and proceeds; that is, a Vo∣latile
Animal, which is concluded in a kind of Shell, Skin, little bag, or egge, and when that bag is broken it departs thence as Aristotle delivereth concerning the Locusts egges. Lastly these are perfected by a succession of parts; but they (namely, such as are generated by a Metamorphosis) are made intire at once. And in the same manner, are both Sponta∣neous productions generated, which obtain their first matter, and first extraction from putrefaction, filth, dew, excrements, or out of the parts of Plants, or Animals; as also those issues which proceed from the seed of Univocal Animals. For it is com∣mon to all Animals, to desume their Original from seed, or an egge: whether that seed proceed from other Animals of the same species, or happen there casually from some thing else. For as it some∣times befalls in Art, so also in Nature; namely, that the same things are sometimes casuall, which at other times are effected by Art: as Aristotle doth instance in Health, so in like manner is the Gene∣ration of any Animals; (as far as they proceed from Seed) whether their seed be casuall, or else proceed from an Univocal Agent of the same kind. For even in casuall seed, there is a motive principle of Generation, which can generate out of it self, and by it self: and the same thing is found in it, as in Univocal Animals; namely, a power to form a living creature. But of this more at large here∣after. Now some Paradoxes do here arise to be exa∣mined. For since the Macula is dilated, the Colli∣quamentum concocted, and prepared, and many o∣ther things (not without great providence) orde∣red, towards the formation, and growth of the Chicken, before any particle of the Chicken appear; what should hinder the Innate beat, and vegetative
soul of the Chicken to be existent before the Chicken it self? For what can produce the effects and o∣perations of Life, but that which is the cause and efficient of those Effects and Operations; namely, the heat, and faculty of the Vegetal soul? And therefore the soul doth not seem to be Actus corporis Organici vitam habentis in potentiâ, the Act of an Organical body, which hath life in it in potentiâ: for we con∣ceive the form of the Chicken to be such an Act. Now in what can we imagine the form, or soul of the Chicken to be, but in the Chicken it self? un∣less we allow the forms to be separate, or grant a Metempsychôsis. But this is most manifest, where the same Ani∣mal lives by a succession of forms; (as Aristotle speaks) as for example, Out of a Canker-worm, an Au∣relia, and then a Butterfly. For the same Efficient, Nutritive, and Preserving principle, must needs be in each of these: unless we will place one soul in the Boy, another in the Young man, and a third in the Old: or affirm, that the Canker-worm, and that worm which becomes a Silk-worm, also the Silk-worm, and the Butterfly, have the same form, of which matter Aristotle hath accurately written, and whereof more largely hereafter. Again, it seems a Paradox, that the blood should be made, and move, and be endowed with Vital spirits, before any sanguifying, or Motive Organs are constituted at all. Nor is it less new and unheard of, that there should be Sense and Motion in the Foetus, before his brain is made; for the Foetus moves, contracts, and extends himself, when there is nothing yet appears for a brain, but clear water. Besides, the body is nourished and encreased, be∣fore the Organs dedicated to Concoction (namely
the Stomack and Liver) are formed. And likewise Sanguification (which is the second Concoction) is performed before the first, (which is by the Sto∣mack) and called Chylification. The Excrements of the first and second Conco∣ction (namely in the Guts, and the two bladders, of Urine one, the other of Gall) are coetaneous to the concocting Instruments themselves. Lastly, there is a Minde, Providence, and Understanding, not one∣ly in the Vegetal part of the soul, but even before the soul it self; procuring, disposing, and order∣ing all things, and artificially molding the future foetus to a resemblance with his parents, even from the very first original; and all this, to advance the being, and well being of the Foetus. Concerning which Resemblance, we may en∣quire, what should be the cause why the Foetus sometimes resembles the Father, sometimes the Mother, and sometimes also the Progenitors, and those either of the Father or Mothers side? And this the rather, since upon one single coition, and at the same moment of time, many Egges are fru∣ctified together. This also is a wonderful thing, that the Virtues, and Vices, the Diseases, the Marks, the Moles or Spots should be transferred to Posteri∣ty: and that into some onely of the Progeny, and not unto all. In the race of Cocks, some are of a generous spirit, and born to battle; who will dye rather then turn their backs upon their Adversa∣ries: and yet their Nephews, unless they proceed of like parents, do by degrees forfeit their galan∣try; according to that saying, Fortes creantur for∣tibus. In many other Animals (and especially in Man) the Bravery of the Succession, or Family is observable: and many of the Indowments both of body and soul are derived down to it ex traduce.
This I have often admired, that when the Issue hath obtained a mixt fabrick or composition from both Parents, and that in all other parts of the body, yet it hath not been so in the Genitals; but that it commonly proves either Male, or Female, and very seldom an Hermaphrodite. Lastly, many things are in the foetus ere they ap∣pear at all; and some things are begun with the first, but perfected with the last: as the Eyes, Ge∣nitals, and Bill. And hence there arise debates concerning the pre-eminence, or dignity of the Parts; in which the Wits of such as are curious in these cases, may imploy themselves. As, Whether the Heart bestow life and vigour upon the blood, or the blood rather upon the Heart? Whether the blood be made for the bodyes sake, as the Matter, Nutriment, and In∣strument; or else the body, and all its parts for the blood, and the soul which doth first and principally reside in it? Likewise, Whether the Ventricles, or Auricles of the Heart are most honourable? For we finde that the Auricles have life and pulse first, and do expire last. And farther, Whether the left Ventricle of the Heart, which is deeper in a Man, and is fenced with a thicker and more carnous wall, and is conceived to be the fountain of the Spirts, be the more excellent, hotter, more fraught with Spirits, and livelyer of the two: or the Right, which doth last languish and subscribe to Death, containing a large quantity of blood: and where the Dying mans blood doth last congeal, and is de∣prived of life and spirit? and whether also the Umbilical Vessels do transport the blood (as to their fountain) and whence also they derive their ex∣traction? Now these things do result out of the Observa∣tion
of the Order of the Generation of the Parts, as also other things which may be hence deduced, and do not a litle clash against the Physiology com∣monly approved. Namely, (when we plainly see that there is both Sense & Motion, before the brain is begotten) it is evident that all Sense and Motion is not derived from the brain: for it appeares by our History, that Sense and Motion do clearly dis∣cover themselves in the first small drop of blood in the Egge, before any particle of the body is framed. And likewise, the first platform or constitution (which we call gelly) is laid before any part is dis∣cerned; and when the brain is now nothing but a clear water: which first rudiment of the Body, if it be lightly pricked, will, like a Worm or Magot, obscurely move, and contract it self: which is a plain testimony of its sense. There are also other Arguments deduced from Sense and Motion, by which we may conclude (with Aristotle) That the Heart, and not (with Physiti∣ans) that the Brain is the first Principle. Those Motions and Actions, which Physitians call Natural, because they proceed whether we will or no; and we cannot moderate, accelerate, retard, or refrain them at our own pleasure: & which there∣fore are Independent in regard of the brain; yet even they are not performed without all sense, but do imply sense, as by which they are excited, pro∣voked, and altered. For we conceive, that in the Heart it self, its Palpitation, Trembling, Fainting, Sowning, and all the changes in the pulse, either in magnitude, celerity, order, rhythme, or the like, do proceed from morbifical causes indisposing it, and offensive to its sense. For whatsoever by diversity of motions makes warre against those things that enrage and molest it, must needs be indowed with sense.
The Stomack and Guts provoked by injurious humours, do raise a Nauseating, Belching, Rumbling, Vomiting, and Flux; and as it is beyond our power, either to raise or lay these combustions, so are we to seek for any such sense retaining to the brain, which should excite those parts to such Ex∣pressions. It is very strange, that upon the Infusion of Anti∣mony taken in a Vomit, though we neither distin∣guish it by taste, nor finde any disgust in it, either swallowing it down, or in returning it back a∣gain; yet there passeth a censure upon it by the Stomack, which discerns between what is usefull and prejudicial, and so provokes to Vomit. Nay, the Flesh it self doth easily distinguish a poisonous wound from one that is not poisonous; and thereupon contracts it self, and condenseth; upon which enflamed tumours arise: as we may see in the stingings of the Bee, the Gnat, and the Spider. I my selfe once, for experiment sake, pricked my hand with a needle; and presently rubbing the same needle upon a Spiders tooth, I pricked my hand in another place, so that I my self could not distinguish between the two pricks. But there was something in my Skin that did distinguish; for in that place where the poisoned prick fell, it present∣ly contracted it self into a pimple, and presently grew red, hot, and inflamed; as if it fortified it self, and stood upon its guard, to oppose, and sub∣due the malice of the Venom. The Offences undergone by the Matrix, as its Contorsion, Descension, Falling down, Rising, Suffoca∣tion, and other Maladies and Provocations, do no whit depend upon the Brain, or Common sense; nor yet can they be conceived to befall it insensibly. For that which is plainly void of Sense, cannot
seem any way to be porovked, or heightened into any motion, or action. Nor have we any other signs to distinguish an animate and sensitive creature, from a dead and senseless one, then by its motion provo∣ked from some offensive object, which doth al∣waies follow, and argue Sense. But of this more at large, when we treat of the Actions and Use of the Brain. But the Reverence due to the Antients, and Antiquity her self, doth advise us to uphold their doctrines, so farre as they are true. Nor can it beseem us rashly to reject, and discountenance their Labours, and Decrees, whose light hath been our direction to the Shrines of Philosophy; wherefore I conceive we ought to think thus. We perceive we have Five Senses, by which we give judgement upon outward things; but be∣cause it is not the same sense, by which we per∣ceive, and by which we perceive our own percepti∣on; (for we see with our Eyes, but we do not by them know we see) but by another sense, which em∣ployes another sensitive Organ (namely, the In∣ternal Common sense) by which we give judgement upon all those things which we perceive by our external Organs, and so distinguish white from sweet, and hard: This common Sensorium, or Or∣gan of Sense (whither all Species are conveyed from the outward Organs) is plainly the Head; which, together with all his Nerves, and outward Organs adjoined to them, is understood to be the adequate Organ of Sensation. And it is like the Sensitive Root, from which several Fibers result; whereof one sees, another hears, a third toucheth, and the other smell, and taste. Yet as there are certain Actions and Motions, whose Regiment or Jurisdiction relates not to the Brain, and they therefore are called Natural:
so also must we conclude, that there is a certain sense of Touching, which is not conveyed to the Common sense, or any way communicated to the brain; and therefore in that kinde of sense, we do not perceive our sensation: but just like men whose understand∣ing is perverted, or else are distracted by some vio∣lent Passion, insomuch that they are insensible of all pain, and takes no notice of any thing that meets their senses: So we must conceive it to be in this sense, which we therefore distinguish from Ani∣mal sense. Having observed such a kinde of sense in the Zoophyta, or Plant-Animals (as the Sensitive Plant, Sponges, and the like.) Wherefore, as many Animals have both Sense and Motion, without the Common sense, or a brain; as the Worms in the Guts, also those Worms which turn into Silk-worms, and the like, so also do some actions befall the Embryo, and us also without any assistance from the brain, and a kinde of sensation doth proceed, without sense. And as Physitians teach, that Natural Actions differ from Animal; so upon like reason, the Natural Touch seems to differ from the Animal sense of Touching, and con∣stitute a distinct species of Feeling: so that the one is communicated to the Common sense, or brain, and the other not. Moreover, it is one thing for a Muscle to be mo∣ved or contracted, and another thing for it to per∣form an Action, at distinct regulated contractions and relaxations; as to go forward, or receive any thing in the hands. Doubtless, the Muscles, or Motory Organs, in the Cynical distortion, or Convulsion pro∣ceeding from some cause that disturbs them, are no otherwise moved, then a Cock or Hen, which when the Head is quite chopped off, is disturbed with many convulsive motions of the Leggs and Wings: but
such as are altogether confused, and disordered, because the sway of the brain is dethroned, and the common sense deposed, under whose Government formerly, those motions were regulated by rhythm and harmony, either to walking, or flight. We conceive therefore, that it ought to be said, That all Natural Motions proceed from the power of the Heart, and are as his Retinue: but the Spontaneous, and such as perfect any Action, (which Physitians call animal) are not produced but by the brain and common sense controuling them. For as by this common sense, we perceive our own Sensa∣tion, so also we perceive our own motion; and that whether it be regular, or perverse. We have a clear Instance of both these motions in Respiration; for the Lungs (as the Heart) are con∣tinually moved up and down by a natural motion, and also provoked to cough, and frequent Agita∣tion; but produce or shape a voice, or sing they cannot, without help, and commission from com∣mon sense. But these things are to be more fully handled, when we shall fix our contemplation upon the A∣ction and Use of the Brain, and the Consideration of the Soul. But thus much hath been delivered by the way, that we may delare our desire and in∣clination to pay our Masters the respect we owe them.
Of the Nutrition of the Chicken in the Egge. EXERCIT. LVIII. HOw much the Authority of the Ancients is not rashly to be rejected, appears even in this: It was of old an opinion much prized (which yet many at this day disclame as erroneous; and Fabri∣cius decryes it as a meer delusion, and fond per∣swasion) that the Embryo did suck, in its mothers De form. foet. p. 19. or 134. l. de carn. & de nat. puer. Womb: and it had Democritus, Epicurus, and Hip∣pocrates himself for its Abbettors. And Hippocra∣tes doth establish his opinion chiefly upon two ar∣guments; For, saith he, unless it had sucked, how could it deposit any excrements: or know how to suck so soon as it is born. Now in other cases they use to subscribe to eve∣ry word pronounced by this so famous, and an∣cient Oracle, and his  was warrant e∣nough: but here (because he delivers things disso∣nant to what is commonly received, Fabricius doth not only renounce his bare assertion, but stands out in defiance against his proofes. Therefore I ap∣peal to the judgement of the most skilful Anato∣mists, and most learned Physitians, whether our Observations concerning the Generation of Animals, do not onely cast a probability, but inforce the necessity of this opinion of Hippocrates. All in general acknowledge, that the Foetus while he abides in the Womb doth wallow in a∣bundance of Water, (which Liquor, we, in the Hi∣story of the Egge, stile the Colliquamentum, and the
Moderns say that Water is the Sweat and Urine of the Foetus; affording this advantage, that the Foetus floating in it (while the Mother runs, leaps, or uses any other violent motion) doth not easi∣ly offend the Womb, nor is himself wronged by allision against the bones seated there round about him, or some outward blowes; and the rather, for that at this time, his body is but tender, and infirme. Fabricius adjoines other benefits arising from pag. 137. these Waters; namely, Their moistning and lubrify∣ing all the passages round about, and rendering the neck of the Matrix capable of the largest dilatation; and all these commodities, saith he, do no less arise from that thick white Excrement, answerable to that of the third concoction, which is Unciuous, Oily, and Fat, and neglected by the Ancients. Which it also per∣formeth, least the Sweat which may sometimes trans∣pire, sharp, and saltish, should erode the tender In∣fants body. I willingly acknowledge the several benefits as∣signed to this water, by all Writers; namely, that the tender Foetus in order to his indemnity from any suddain, and violent motions of his Mother, is thus securely nestled in alis vespertilionum, in the Bats Wings, as they call them, and moated round with store of water, so that he cannot easily, by every (though violent) motion dash himselfe a∣gainst his Mothers sides; (because of those tyes which fasten him on every side) at least this cir∣cumambient liquor being equally poised in the midst doth protect him from all outward harme. But my own Observations, as they do in many other matters, so also in this enforce me to be of a contrary opinion to Fabricius: for I am most certain, that the said liquor, is not the Sweat of
the Foetus. Nor can I believe, that that water doth perform those offices in the birth, which he com∣memorates: and much lesse, that it is so sharp and Briney, that the foetus must stand in need of an oily unctuous fence to secure him from it, es∣pecially that foetus, which is either cloathed with Wool, Hair, or Feathers. For this liquor is of a good savour, and like a kind of watry Milk; and there∣fore, almost all Viviparous Animals, so soon as they have brought their Young into the world, fall abord and eat it up, and lick their new born issues clean, greedily swallowing the humour which they receive in, when they will not so much as touch the excrements of their foetus. Fabricius conceived this water to be sharp, and salt, because he thought it to be the sweat. But what injury, I pray, can the sweat do to the foetus now cloathed in feathers? if at least he ever saw such a creature as a sweating Chicken. And I suppose he will not say, that the use of that water in an egge, is by its moisture and lubricity to expedite the Chickens birth. For the dryer and older the shell is, by so much the frailer, and brit∣ler it becomes. Lastly, were it the Chickens sweat, it would most abound neer the Exclusion; for the larger the Chicken is, and the more Aliment he takes in, so much the more sweat must he necessa∣rily create. But a litle before his Exclusion (about the ninteenth or twentieth day) there is none of this kind of humour discernable; whereby, he should have rather reputed it an Aliment, then an Excrement: (had he rightly considered the mat∣ter) especially, seeing he allows the Chicken in the Egge, the use of Respiration, Voice, and Crying, which, were he begirt with water, could not have been.
Nor are these Waters of any great use, to the Expedition, or Lubricity of the Delivery (as experi∣enced Midwives know full well) though Fabrici∣us would have it otherwise. For the neighbour Parts are about that time, (without any profusi∣on of those Waters, mellow and relaxed by a cer∣tain maturity of their owne: especially, those which may be an obstruction to the work: name∣ly, the Ossa pubis, & Coccygis; about which the chiefest care of the Midwife is exercised in further∣ing the delivery: for she is less solicitous, to a∣noint the fleshey parts, least they rend in sunder, then in putting back the Coccyx; which if she cannot effect with her own hand, she calls in the Man-Midwife to procure her purpose by the Spe∣culum matricis; which instrument by its triple sides, whereof one is applyed to the Coccyx, the other two to the Ossa pubis, doth distend those parts by force. For the Infant now just at his Birth, while hee turnes himself, and precipitates his Head down∣ward, doth relax and open the orifice of the Womb: but if in his descent he light upon the top of the Bone, there he sticks; and hardly gets forth, and that not without danger, to himself, and his Mother too. Now it is evidently natures in∣tent, to mollifie and relax those parts. For, if the Midwife do discover the Orifice of the Matrix become soft and loose, she laies it down for an infallible sign of the approaching delivery, though the Waters are not yet broken. Nay (I speak what I know by Experience) in case any thing remaine after the delivery, which ought to be discharged, or if at any other time there be any thing in the Womb, which it indeavours to be rid of, the Ori∣fice doth not onely descend, but is also soft and
relaxed: but if after the delivery, that Orifice be reti∣red into its place, and be perceived to be grown something hard, it is an evident sign that all is wel. And by the like Experience, I pronounce, the Ossa pubis to be often loosened one from another in delivery, their cartilaginous connexion being mollified, and all the Region of the Lower Belly mi∣raculously dilated; and this not by the profusion of the Watry substance, but of their own accord, as ripe fruits use to revolt or open, to make room for the Exclusion of their seeds. But how much the Coccyx may retard the delivery, is clear in four∣footed beasts, that have Tailes; for they can neither bring forth young, nor disload the excrements of the Guts, unless they remove their Taile; which if you depress with your hand, you hinder the passage of the Excrement. Moreover, that is accounted the most Natural Delivery, when the Foetus and Secundines with the Watry substance (that is, the Entire Egge) get forth together. For if the Secundines be entire, and the waters not broken, the circumjacent parts are more distended, & dilated by the Throwes, namely, by the distention of the Membranes, whereupon, the foetus works his release with less struggling; though the Mothers paines be the greater. In which conditi∣on, we know how the Woman in Labour is much relieved from the intollerable torment caused by distention, upon the breaking of the Membranes, (whether it be done by Midwives nailes, or by a pair of Scissors) the Waters by that means being set a float. And the skilful Midwives know very well, that in case all the Waters be come away, before the natural opening of the Womb, the Woman with Child, continueth the longer in Labour, and her Travail
is the harder; which would yet be contrary, in case those precedent Waters (as Fabricius would have it) did so much conduce to the mollifying, and Lubricity of the parts. Besides that this humour, which we call the Colliquamentum, is not the sweat of the foetus, is e∣vident, both in the Egge and other Animals; for it is in being, before any part of the foetus is con∣stituted, or any rudiment of him extant. Nay so soon as he is discernable, and is yet but gelly, and very small, so great a quantity of Water is to be seen, that it is utterly impossible, so in∣considerable a bulk should afford such plenty of Excrement. Adde to this, that the fibres of the Umbilical ves∣sels are scattered and terminated in the membrane conteining this Water, as in the Yolk and White of the Egge: to give evidence clearly (if you con∣sider the thing, as it truely is) that this humour, is rather to be conceived the Aliment, then the Ex∣crement. Wherefore Hippocrates his opinion seems to me more probable then that of Fabricius, and other Anatomists, who count this Liquor the Sweat, and Prejudice of the foetus. For I believe that this Colliquamentum, or Water wherein the foetus swims, doth serve for his sustenance; and that the thin∣ner & purer part of it, being imbibed by the Um∣bilical Vessels, do constitute and supply the primoge∣nit parts: and the rest, like Milk, being by sucti∣on conveyed into the Stomack and there concocted or chylified, and afterwards attracted by the O∣rifices of the Meseraick Veins, doth nourish and en∣large the tender Embryo. And to fortifie my per∣swasion, I shall lay down some arguments, that prevaile with me.
So soon as the foetus attains any perfection, he presently stirres his Limbs, and proceeds to make tryal of those actions, to which his Instruments of motion are designed. Now we see the Chicken in the Egge, open his mouth amidst this Water; whereby he must needs swallow it down. For it is most certain, that whatsoever is gone beyond the roote of the Tongue, and is arrived at the top of the Gul∣let, no creature can return (but by Vomition) whereupon the Farriers, which administer medi∣cinal Potions, Boles, or Pills, to Cattel, taking them by the tongue cast it in beyond the protuberance of the Tongue, just at the Root, that so they cannot avoid the swallowing. And if any of us, convey a Pill so far as the root of the tongue, he shall find himself necessitated to swallow it down, unless a Vomit meet, and repel it. Wherefore since the Embryo wallowing in the fore-said liquor, doth o∣pen his mouth; it follows likewise that it must enter in; and since he moves his other muscles, why should we doubt, but that he imployes the Instrument of his throat likewise, and so imbibes the humour. Moreover it is certain, that in the Craw of the Chicken (and the like is also found in the Stomack of all Embryo's) there is seen a substance most like in colour, tast, and consistence to the said liquor; which being a while digested in the Stomack, re∣sembles coagulated Milk; and we have also found it like to Chyle, in the upper Gut, the lower Guts being then stuft with Excrements. So also in the foetus of Viviparous creatures, the thicker Guts are full of such an Excrement as that, wherewith they do abound all the while they are sed with Milk. Also in Sheep and other beasts which divide the Hoof, the dried dung is manifest∣ly to be seen.
About the seventeenth day, I have evidently found excrement in a Chicken, neer the fundament; and have also seen it, when it hath been dischar∣ged into the Secundines, a litle before the exclusi∣on. And Volcherus Coiter, a diligent and skilful Anatomist, records the same observation. Why then should we scruple to say, that the foetus in the Womb doth suck; and that a Chyle is made there; when we have both the apparent principle, and rejectments of it. Besides, at that time when we see both the blad∣ders, one full of Gall, and the other of Urine (both which are excrements of the second concoction) why may we not conclude that Chylifaction, which is the first concoction, went before it. The Embryo therfore sucks, and receives nutri∣ment in at the Mouth. And this you shall soon dis∣cry, if so soon as ever he is borne, you put your finger into his mouth. Which according to Hippo∣crates, would not be, had he not sucked before in the Womb. For we see young Children make essays, and attempt upon all performances: name∣ly, moving their Limbs, crawling along, and in∣deavouring to speak: all which they attain at last with dexterity, by long practice, and education. But so soon as ever they are born, nay before they are born, they will suck. For we have found by experience, that while they yet stick fast in the Birth, before they can either cry or breath, they will seize upon the finger extended to them, and suck it. Nay, A New-born Child is more exact at sucking, then a grown body, or himself either if he discon∣tinue it but a few days. For the Infant doth not compress the Nipple, and suck at the rate that we do by gulping down: but as if he would devour
the Nipple, he still draws it into his mouth, and by the aid of his tongue, and palate, he sucks the milk, as if he chewed it; with farre more earnestness, and slight, then a grown body. Wherefore he seems to be good at it of old, and to have practised it in the womb; for we see how soon he unlearns it by discontinuance. By these and other Observations it is probable, that the Chicken is fed two waies in the Egge, namely, both by the Umbilical, and the Meseraick Veiues: by the former, he attracts well digested aliment, whereby the Blood, and primogenit parts are constituted, and encreased; by the other, Chyle, which conduces to the fabrick, and augmentation of the other parts. Now, perhaps the reason may seem obscure, wherefore the same Agent should out of the same Matter proceed to a diverse manner of Nutrition: (when Nature doth nothing in vain) yet we will endeavour to discover the reason. That Part which is attracted by the Umbilical Veines, is the purer and sincerer part: But the re∣maining Colliquamentum wherein the Foetus floats, is a kind of crude milk, without cream, deprived of its purer part. The more pure part therefore stands in no need of farther concoction, as the other doth, which therefore is received into the Stomack, and there chylified. The thin, and crude milk, such as is found in the breast presently after delivery, is like this. For the dissolved White of an Egg, and the crude and watry milk in the breast or udder, are of the self same colour, taste, and consistence. Also the first milk given, is serous, and watry; and Wo∣men in Childe-bed do milk a kinde of water out of their breasts, before the milk is concocted, and perfectly white.
And therefore the Colliquamentum found in the Chickens crop is a kinde of crude Milk; and the very same afterwards found in the Gisard, is con∣cocted, white, and coagulated. So likewise in Vivi∣parous Animals, before their milk is digested in their breast, it looks like a kinde of Dew, or Colli∣quamentum; and so on the contrary, the Colliqua∣mentum, after it is concocted in the Stomack, puts on the likeness of Milk. Whence it comes to pass, according to Aristotles opinion, that the first and most principal parts are fashioned out of the finer and purer materials: but of the courser, (by a new concoction in the Stomack) refined, the mean∣er and inferiour sort of parts are made: so that Nature like a kinde, indulgent mother, would rather abound with Supernumeraries, then be scan∣ted in Necessaries. Or rather, we must affirm it consonant to reason, that the foetus now grown more perfect in himself, should also be sustained after a more perfect manner (viz. by the Mouth) and attract his aliment more refined, and rendered more devoid of dreggs, by the two precedent Concoctions; (As being thereby cleansed from two several sorts of Excrements.) At first, indeed, be∣ing sustained by the Umbilical Vessels, he lives like a Plant supplyed by its root; and hereupon his bo∣dy looks indigested, white, and imperfect; and like a Plant, he remaines fixt, and immoveable. But so soon as he enjoyes the same aliment more elabo∣rate, as now inspired with a diviner spirit, and tri∣umphing in a higher pitch of Vegetation, the for∣mer Gelly is transformed into flesh, the Organs of motion are distinct, the spirits are enricht, and he himself begins to move: and now no longer is cherished like a Plant by his roots, but lives the life of an Animal, and is nourished at the Mouth.
Of the Uses of the whole Egge. EXER: LIX. HAving declared those mutations, and several proceedings, which are required in a Hen-egg, in order to the production of the Chicken; Fabri∣cius proceeds to discourse of the uses of the whole Egge, and of its Parts: and this not onely in a Hen-egge, but in all other kindes of Eggs. Where he also demands, Why some Eggs are heterogeneous, and compounded of diverse parts; and others are homogeneous, and similar? such as the Eggs of In∣sects are, and of those creatures, which are consti∣tuted out of the whole Egge, (by a Metamorphosis) and not generated out of one part of the egge, and nourished by the other, as the Chicken is. But my business is not to treat of all Eggs in ge∣neral (as not having in this Tract delivered their history) but onely of Hen-eggs, and the benefits or advantages arising from their parts: all which ought to tend to that, to which the Action of the whole is directed; which Fabricius truly obser∣veth, pag. 50. to be nothing else but the Generation and Augmentation of the Chicken. And amongst those things which relate to the Whole Egge, Fabricius doth recount the Figure, Quantity, and Number of the Egges. The Figure of the Egge, saith he, is round, that the whole bulk of the Chicken might be contained in the lesser space; for l. 10. de us. Part. which cause God made the Universe Round, to compre∣hend all things: and for the same cause, this Figure, saith Galen, appeared alwayes most lovely, and con∣venient to Nature. Besides, in that it hath no angle
exposed to outward injuries; it is therefore esteemed the safest figure, and most convenient for the Exclusion of the Chicken. Now Fabricius upon this ground, ought to have assigned the reason, why Hen-egges are not spherical (as the fry, or eggs of fishes, worms, and froggs are) but acuminated and oblong. What impediment is there which hinders them from this perfect figure? Therefore, in my judgement, the figure of the egge hath no influence at all up∣on the Generation of the Chicken, but is meerly ac∣cidental; which I the rather conceive, because there are so many several varieties of figures, even in the Hen-eggs only. For the figure differs ac∣cording to the diversity of the Uterus, in which (as in a Mould) it receives its form. Aristotle, indeed, saith, That oblong eggs produce Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. Hens, but the rounder, Cocks: But I have never yet observed any such thing. And Pliny affirmes the clean contrary: The rounder sort of eggs, saith he, l. 10. c. 52. exclude Hens, and the rest, Cocks. And, to say truth, if there were any certainty to be collected hence, some Hens would ever generate Cocks, and other, Hens: for some do lay eggs which are alwayes of one and the same figure, that is, ever oblong, or e∣ver round. And the oblong would rather exclude Plin. ibid. Cocks, because they are the more perfect, and better concocted; and therefore Horace esteemed them to be more pleasant then the round. The Reasons alledged by Fabricius for the fi∣gures of the Eggs, we willingly pass by, because they are invalid. As for the Magnitude of the Egge, that indeed doth seem to conduce to the largeness of the fa∣tus, which is thence to be generated; for your great Hens lay fairer eggs. And yet the Crocodile layes egges no bigger then Goose-eggs: no living crea∣ture Id. l. 8. c. 25
spreading into so large a bulk from so small an Ori∣ginal. It is also probable, that the largeness of the Egge, and the plenty of the liquours contained in it, do conduce something to the fecundity of the Egge: for the very small eggs (called Centenina) are all of them addle. The Number of Eggs affords the same benefit, as plenty of Conceptions do in Viviparous creatures; that is, they are useful to the continuation of the species. For Nature doth commonly bestow a plenteous issue upon those Animals which are weak, and ly∣able to the insolences of other Creatures: recom∣pensing the shortness of their lives, with the number of their ofspring. Nature, saith Pliny, hath bequeathed this legacy to the Race of Birds, that the l. 10. c. 52. more fearfull amongst them, should be more fruitfull, then the more valiant. For since all Generation is de∣signed by Nature for Perpetuity sake, it befalls those Animals more frequently, which are shorter li∣ved, and obnoxious to outward injuries, that so their species may not decay. Hereupon, Birds of Prey, which excell in strength, and thence main∣tain their lives the longer, and remain in more se∣curity, do seldom lay above two eggs. Indeed, the Pigeon, Turtle, and Ring-dove, hatch but two egges at once; but the frequency makes satisfaction for the paucity, for they hatch ten times a year. So that they Generate Much, though not Many.
Of the Benefits or Uses of the Yolk and White. EXERCITATION LX. AN Egge, saith Fabricius, properly so called, is pag. 47. compounded of several parts, because it is the Or∣gan or Instrument of the Generant; and Galen af∣firms, That every Organ consists of several parts. Which gives an occasion of doubt, whether every egge be not Heterogeneous, seeing every egge is an Organ. And indeed, every egge seems to be consti∣tuted out of several parts, even the very eggs of In∣sects, and Fishes: for they all consist of Membranes, Coverings, and Muniments: and the Matter also contained in them, is not altogether destitute of a dissimilar constitution. Fabricius doth also farther conclude truly, with Galen, That some parts of the Egge are the chief In∣struments of Action; others, such Instruments as the Action cannot be performed without them; others, as conducing to the better performance of the Action; and lastly, others, as usefull to the safety and preservation of all the rest. But he is deceived, where he saith; If we speak of the chiefe Action of all, which is the Ge∣neration of the Chicken, the chief cause thereof is the Seed, and the Chalaza; for these two are the prime cause of the generation of the chicken: the Seed be∣ing the Efficient cause, and the Chalaza the material onely. For, as Aristotle affirms, he must of necessi∣ty acknowledge, that the Generant must be within the Egg. But he denies the Cocks seed to be with∣in the Egge. Nor is he less mistaken concerning the Material
cause, out of which the Chicken is made by the ar∣tifice of the seed. For it is neither made of both the Chalazae, nor yet of any one of them, as hath been discovered in our History. Nor is the Generation of the Chicken accomplished by a Metamorphosis, or delineation and division of the Chalazae, but by in Epigenesis, as we have explained. Nor is the Chalaza principally fructified by the seed, but the Cicatricula rather, or the Eggs-eye, as we call it: out of which being enlarged, the colliquamentum doth result: and afterward in the colliquamentum, and out of it, the Blood, Veines, Vesiculae pulsantes, and the whole Body is at last constituted. And upon his own confession, the seed of the Cock doth not so much as pass into the womb of the Hen at all: and yet notwithstanding it doth fructifie, not only the Eggs already formed, but those also that shall be formed hereafter. To the Eggs second Action (which is the Nutriti∣on, and Augmentation of the Chicken) Fabricius calls in the White and Yolk. The Quantity of the yolk and white, saith he, is proportioned to the better per∣formance of the former action, as also to the absolution and just encrease of the chicken. The Egg-shell, and Membranes, are constituted for the safeguard of the whole, and also of the action of the Egg. But the veins, and arteries, which do convey the aliment, are such as without them the encrease and nutrition could not pro∣ceed. But yet he leaves us in suspense, not knowing whether he mean the Umbilical Vessels of the foetus it self, or the veines and arteries of the mother, as those instruments by which the egg is augmented. And yet upon as good ground, both the Uterus, and the Incubation it self, may be reduced into this classis.
Come we then to the Liquors of the Egge, name∣ly the Yolk and White, for these are, rather then the other parts, instituted for the sake of the foetus, and also in them the second action of the Egge is most remarkable. Hen-eggs are of two colours, and constituted of two liquors, which are fenced by distinct mem∣branes, and kept apart the one from the other: and likewise, since they are distinguished by a two∣fold propagation of Umbilical Vessels (whereof the one passeth to the Yolk, the other to the White) they themselves are in all probability of a dif∣ferent nature, and therefore of a diverse use and advantage. The Yolk and White of Eggs, saith Ari∣stotle, do obtain a contrary nature; not onely in regard Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. of Heat, but Power: for the Yolk is condensed by cold, but the White is not onely not condensed thereby, but liquified the more. So on the contrary, the White is condensed by fire, but the Yolk is not condensed by it, but continues soft, unless it be very much burned: And is more condensed, and dryed by being sodden, then rosted. The Yolk being now warmed by Incubation, becomes more moist; for it resembles melted wax, or dissolved fat: whereupon also it fills a larger room then before. For by degrees, as the foetus is enlarged, the White is consumed and thic∣kened: but the Yolk on the contrary, when the foetus is now compleat, seems to have lost litle or no∣thing of its dimensions, but seems only to be more liquid and moist, even when the belly of the foetus begins now to be covered over with the Abdomen. And Aristotle gives the reason of this differences De gen. an. l. 3. 5, 2. Because a Bird cannot compleat her of spring within  own bowels, she produceth the Aliment also together i the Egg. For in Viviparous creatures the nourishment of the foetus, which is called milk, is provided in a di∣stinct
part of the body; namely, in the Breasts. But Nature hath implanted this aliment in the Eggs of Birds: but yet contrary to the Opinion of most men, and the Assertion of Alcmaeon Crotoniates; for the White is not the Milk of the Egge, but the Yolk. For as the foetus of Viviparous Animals, adhering hi∣therto to their parent (as the Plant doth to the ground) attract their first aliment from her womb: but after their birth, being then seated without the Uterus, they suck milk from the breast, and so encrease: so the Chicken findes something proportionable to both these aliments in the Egge it self: for as the Uterus of Viviparous Animals is within the parents themselves; so on the contrary, in Oviparous, the parents themselves may be said to be within their Uterus. For an egg it as it were an exposed womb; wherein there is a substance concluded, as the Representative, and Substitute or Vicar of the Breasts. For the Chic∣ken in the egg is first nourished by the White, which being exhausted, it is afterwards sustained by the Yolk, as by Milk. And therefore the Navel or Um∣bilical propagation, which is derived into the White, when the white is spent, doth fade, and break off before the Chicken is hatcht, leaving no track or relique remaining, but quite vanisheth, before the Lower belly is shut up in the Abdomen (when yet in the race of Viviparous Animals the Navel-string con∣tinues still:) But as for that other propagation of the Umbilical Vessels, which is disseminated into the yolk (when the abdomen is now drawn over the guts) it is, together with the yolk it self, laid up in the belly, & thence attracts nutriment for the tender foe∣tus; till the bill, being now confirmed, & hardned, is able to pick up, and break its meat into pieces, & the Stomack, or Gisard, be fortified to digest it: As
the production of Viviparous Animals is sustained with milk from the Dug, till it be provided of teeth, by which it may chew and grind its food. For the Yolk is instead of Milk to the Chicken: and there∣fore a Hen-egge (being to supply the office both of the Womb and Breast or Udder) is furnished with a party coloured juice, namely the Yolk and White. And as for these two distinct Liquors all men li∣ving do admit them; But I, as I lately told you, have discovered even two distinct Whites in an egg, divided by two distinct Membranes, the superior White comprehending another within it; just as the Yolk is comprehended by the White. And these two Whites are of a different nature: being reser∣ved in a distinct place, and conteined or conclu∣ded in a distinct Membrane, and therefore design∣ed to a distinct use and intent. And yet both are designed to Nutrition: but the exteriour is first devoured, as having the propagations of the Umbilical Vessels (which are derived to the Whites) first disseminated into it, before they pass into the other White which is thicker then it: just as those very propagations do first assault both the Whites, ere they set upon the Yolk which is incompassed by them, and which is reserved for the last nou∣rishment of the foetus. But of this more hereafter, when we come to ex∣plain the manner, how the foetus of Viviparous Ani∣mals is formed, & augmented in the Womb, and al∣so to demonstrate, that every foetus what ever doth derive its original from an Egge; and is susteined by a twofold Albugineous Aliment in the Uterus. For one of these is thinner, and conteined within the Egge (or Conception) it self: the other is at∣tracted and drawn by the Umbilical Vessels from the Cotyledones, or Orifices of the Vessels dissemina∣ted
into the After-birth, and the Womb. That sub∣stance is conteined in the Conception it self, doth resemble the thinner White, both in colour, and consistence, for it is glewy, liquid, and pellucid, and very like that substance, which we call the Colli∣quamentum in the Egg, and in this the foetus swims, & is fed by it at the mouth. But that which the foetus attracts by the aid of his Umbilical Vessels from the Placenta or After-burden, is more thick and mu∣cous, and very like to the thicker White of the egge. By which it plainly appears, that the foetus is no more susteined in the Womb by his mothers blood, then the sucking Child is afterwards nou∣rished by it, or the Chicken in the egge: but is fed by an Albugineous Matter, which is concocted in the Placenta or Cake of the Womb; and doth resem∣ble the White of an Egge. Nor is the contemplation of that divine provi∣dence lesse profitable, then wonderful; by which nature both in the Generation and Growth of the foetus (as taking into her consideration their age, and abilities) provides a convenient aliment for each of them, accommodating meats of more easie to some, and of more difficult digestion to others. For as the foetus attains a greater strength and ability to digest; so is a grosser and tougher aliment provided for him. And this may be ob∣served even in the diverse kind of Milk in Animals: for when the Infant is new born, the Mothers Milk is thinner, and of more facile digestion; but in process of time, and the strength of the foetus be∣ing now improved, it growes thicker and more coagulated. And therefore those choice and de∣licate Dames, which do not suckle their Infants themselves, are injurious to their Childrens wel∣fare; for since mercenary Nurses are for the most
part of a ranker constitution, then they: and so have older Milk, and more coagulated, and con∣sequently of harder digestion; it often falls out, that the Infants which are born of such Mothers cannot away with the Milk of such Nurses (especi∣ally about the time of breeding their Teeth) but by reason of crudities, or corrupted Milk, are tor∣mented with Feavers, Loosness, Vomitings, Paines in the Guts, Coughs, and Epilepsies, and the like. That which Fabricius affirms, and indeavours to strengthen with certain arguments: namely, that the Chalazae are the subject matter of the pag. 34. Chicken, we have formerly disproved in our Hi∣story, and have withal made it appear, that the substance and first lineaments of the chicken are laied, while the Chalazae are intire, and unalter∣ed: as likewise in a distinct place of the Egge. Nor is it true that the chalazae (which he con∣ceivs the cocks seed doth fructifie) do supply the office pag. 54. of seed, that so the chicken might be made out of them. Neither do the chalazae so represent the seed, in co∣lour, substance, or propriety of body (as he would pag. 57. have it) or so resemble the picture of a chicken in an egge that is boiled, that we ought of right to conceive all the spermatical parts to be thence extracted. But we are rather to conceive that the colliquamentum mentioned by us, or the thinner part of the white resolved, and concocted, doth put on the nature of seed, and supply its place, as our eyes may evi∣dence. And therefore that contemplation of this reve∣rend sage is too supie, where he saith: Since the pag. 54. whole substance of the Animal is constituted of two dif∣ferent, and contrary bodies; namely, hot, and cold, (all the red and sanguineous parts being hot, as the Liver, Heart, Spleen, Reins, Lungs, and in short all
the fleshy, and musculous parts: and on the contrary, all the White and Bloodless, as the Ligaments, Nerves, Bones, Gristles; and all the Membranous parts, as the Stomack, Guts, Womb, the Pericardium, or Purse of the Heart and the like, are cold) these two diverse kind of parts, do, without question, require a diverse, and yet a like Aliment to sustein them; if that positi∣on be true, namely, ex iisdem nutrimur, ex qui∣bus constamus, we are nourished by the same substan∣ces, out of the which we are made. Therefore of right, do the Spermatical cold, and white parts, require a white and cold Aliment; but the Sanguineous, the red, and hot parts, require a red and hot sustenance. And therefore of good right is the White of the Egg, which is cold and bloodless, deputed to nourish the cold; white, and bloodless parts; but the Yolk, as being a hot, red, and sanguineous Liquor, substituted to the hot, and sanguineous. For by this means all the parts of the Animal, may cater and procure for themselves a convenient and familiar nutriment. For we do by no means consent, that the diverse parts of the egge, are ordeined to nourish the diverse parts of the chicken, having formerly shewed, that the Heart, Lungs, Reins, Liver, Muscles, Ligaments, and all the parts of the whole body, do appear white and bloodless at the first. And upon this argument of Fabricius, it would insue, that the Heart, Lungs, Liver, Spleen, &c. are not Spermatical parts, or constituted out of the Seed: (which he will upon no terms consent to) because they also are afterwards fed, and in∣creased by Blood; for all things are made, and nourished by one and the same thing; because nu∣trition is onely a substitution of a like substance into the room of that which is lost. Nor will it less distract him to make answer,
how (when the white is now clean exhausted) the cold, and white parts (namely, the Ligaments, Bones, Brain, Spinal-Marrow, &c.) are likewise nourished, and inlarged by the Yolk, the Yolk be∣ing no less a disproportionated aliment to these, then the White is to the hot, red, and sanguineous parts. Nay, according to the fore-cited opinion, the hot, and sanguineous parts are to be the post-ge∣nit parts, or born last: that is, the Flesh after the Bones; the Liver, and the Lungs after the Liga∣ments and Guts: and the cold parts of the body are to be upon the Forge all the while the White is consuming; and after them the hot, when the Yolk begins to decline and wash it self away to supply their growth: so that all the parts could not possiby arise out of the same Whites. But all these matters are confuted by ocular experi∣ment. To confirm this: the Egges, or Spawn of Carti∣lagineous Fishes (namely, the Ray, the Fork-fish, and the Dog-fish) are partly coloured, and have a well complexioned Yolk; and yet all the parts of those very fishes (even the Parenchyma of the Li∣ver it self) appears white, cold, and bloodless. And on the contrary, I have seen a race of Hens and Cocks, which are of a large stature, their feathers blackish, their flesh full of blood, and their Liver more ruddy then ordinary; and yet their egges, even the fertile ones, have exceeding pale Yolks, of no deeper a yellow then the straw of ripe Barly. Fabricius in the subsequent words, seems to re∣tract his former speeches: saying, But one thing is pag. 55. very wonderful both in the Yolk and White; that nei∣ther of them being blood, yet they are so neer of kin to blood, that they are but little different from it, and
a small matter keeps them from being, very blood it selfe: and therefore a little paines, and a slender con∣coction sufficeth to convert them into blood. And this is the reason why we alwaies discover those Veins and Arteries which are propagated into the membranes of the Yolk and White to be full of blood; and yet the Yolk and White abide still in their own nature: but so soon as either of the two is attracted into the Vessels, it presently transforms into blood; so neer allyed are they to blood. Now if it is most certain, that blood is no less conteined in those propagations of the Veins which are disseminated into the White, then in those that are derived into the Yolk: and each of these Liquors is so neerly related to blood, that a very smal matter will procure their transmigra∣tion into it; who will deny, that the blood, and con∣sequently all the Sanguineous parts are as well nourished and inlarged by the White, as by the Yolk. Hereupon Fabricius provides for his retreat: saying, Though all this be true, yet we are to conceive, Ibid. that this substance, which is attracted from the Yolk and White by the Veins, is blood in that maner only, as Chyle is in the Meseraick Veins; in which there is no∣thing discoverable but meer blood; whereas the Chyle hath onely received the shadow of blood, and is to be compleated in the Liver; so that substance attracted by the Veins out of the Yolk and White, presently puts in the shadow and resemblance of blood, &c. Well, be it so: yet though he lurk in this shadow, he doth not salve the doubt, which is, why the Blood, and sanguineous parts may not, for the fore-cited rea∣sons, be as well nourished by the White as the Yolk. If he had said, that the hotter parts, are rather
nourished by that blood (or Aliment conteined in the blood, which is proportionable to the Chyle) which is attracted out of the Yolk, then out of the White: and so on the contrary, that the cold parts are supplied rather by that Nutriment which the Veins transport from the White, then from the Yolk, I should not have much opposed him. The main thing that disturbs him in this busi∣ness, is this, how the Blood can be made in the Egge; or what Artificer can transform the two Liquors into blood, when there is yet no Liver in Being? For he could not say that the blood in the Egge is derived from the Mothers blood. But saith, This blood is rather wrought in the Veins then in the Liver: but it becomes a bone, a gristle, or flesh, &c. in the parts themselves, where it is exactly concocted, and assimulated, without any farther addition at all; not signifying by whom the blood which is in the Veins dispersed both into the Yolk and White, is concocted, elaborated, and made per∣fect, when as yet no Liver at all is extant, or any particle of the body, that might concoct or com∣pleat it. And when he had formerly said, that the cold parts are nourished by the White, the hot by the Yolk; not mindful of his assertion, he here concludes the quite contrary, viz. that the same blood doth transmigrate into bones, gristles, flesh, and other parts. But he lets that grand difficulty, which so much disouiets the Physitians minds, glide by in silence, without taking any knowledge of it: namely, how the Liver can be the Original and Author of the blood: seeing that blood is not onely found in the egge, before any one of the bowels are fra∣med at all: but Physitians themselves do teach,
that all the substance or Parenchyma of the bowels themselves, are meerly so many affusions; or con∣fluxes of blood. Is the Effect, the Author of its own Efficient? If the Parenchyma of the Liver is made of blood, how can the Liver be the cause of blood? And the insuing passages are of the same batch, where he saith: There is also another use of the White, when it is now segregated from the Yolk: namely, that the foetus may swimme in it, and so be susteined, lest tending downwards by his own weight, hee might in∣cline to one part rather then another, and so drawing the Vessels along with him, might break them in sun∣der: and to this use the purity and tenacity of the White do conduce. For if the foetus should take up his residence in the Yolk, he would easily descend down in∣to the bottome, and so disorder and break the Yolk also. A very weak construction this! For what doth the purity of the White availe to the sustentation of the Chicken? Or how can the White which is more thin, better support the Chicken, then the Yolk which is thicker and more gross then it? Or what danger is there, that the Chicken should fall down? Since the egge in Incubation lies al∣ways side-long, so that there is no fear of ascent, or falling down. True it is, indeed, that not on∣ly the Chicken, but every foetus whatsoever (while it is forming) doth swim: but that innatation is in the Colliquamentum spoken of by us, and not in the Yolk or White: and we have rendered the rea∣son thereof elsewhere. Aristotle (saith he) Writes, that when the Chic∣ken is conceived, the Yolk ascends to the Obtuse An∣gle of the Egge, and the reason is, because the Chic∣ken is formed out of the Chalaza, which adhereth to the Yolk; whereupon it behooves the Yolk, which is
placed in the middle to mount up to the larger part of the Egge; that so the Chicken may be there made, where there is a natural cavity, very necessary to the welfare of the Chicken. But the Chalaza is more fastened to the White, then to the Yolk. But the reason of that ascent of the Yolk is this; the Macula or litle cicatrice which appears in the coat of the Yolk, is by reason of the spirituous colliquamentum which is bred in it, dilated; and thereupon requiring more roome, doth tend to∣wards the Obtuse Angle of the Egge: and so like∣wise that portion of the Yolk and White which is melted, is distended, and being now grown more concocted and spirituous, doth swimme upon the other parts that remaine crude: as those parts of water which are warmed in any vessels, arise from the bottome up to the top: an experiment approved by all Physitians, who holding the Uri∣nal conteining a thick and troubled Urine in warm water, do perceive the upper part thereof, to clear and grow transparent first. This follow∣ing Instance will explain the matter. There is a device known to most men, which is intended ra∣ther for a jocular bable to gaze upon and laugh at, then for any useful implement; namely, a cer∣tain Glass-globe, which is almost filled up with clear water, wherein several Glass-balls which are fraught with nothing but Air, do swim upon the surface of that water, which by reason of their levity do support several figures (of quivered Cu∣pids, armed Centaures, Chariots of the Sun, and the like) which else would all sink down to the bottom. So in like manner, this Oculus pulli, this Eye of the Chicken as I terme it, or first Colliqua∣tion, being dilated by the heat of the Sitting-Hen, and the Genital vertue in the Egge, and so made
lighter, ascends to the top, and draws up the Yolk to which it adheres together with it. Here∣upon the thicker White gives place to it, and the Chalazae retire to the sides of the Egge, because the Cicatricula, which was formerly fituate in the side of the egge, now mounteth directly up∣ward. Of the Uses of the other parts of the Egge. EXER. LXI. THe Shell is hard and thick, that so it may fence the Liquors, and the Chicken which dwells in them, from outward injuries. But yet it is brittle, and especially in the Obtuse end, and neer the time of the exclusion of the Chicken, lest it might obstruct the Chickens Exit. This Shell is also po∣rous, for while an egge (especially a new-laid one) is in roasting before the fire, it doth breath out a kind of sweat, trickling down, as it were, drop by drop. Now these pores are useful for Ventilation, as also for the more easie penetration of the heat which results from the Sitting Hen; and likewise that the Chicken may attract aire from without: for as we have said before, the chic∣ken doth, without all question, both breath, and cry before his exclusion. The Membranes serve to contein the Liquors, and therefore they are as many in number, as the liquors are. And the Colliquamentum also, so soon
as it is in being, is presently invested in its owne proper tunicle: as Aristotle did imply in these words. A membrane also, variegated with sangui∣neous Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3. fibres, doth now incompass the white Liquor, &c. But now when the exclusion of the Pullus is at hand, and the White and Colliquamentum are exhausted, all the Membranes (excepting onely that which embraceth the Yolk) are dried away, and vanish: but that membrane is together with the Yolk drawn into the Peritonaeum, and concluded in the lower Belly. Now of these membranes, two are com∣mon to the whole egg, which they do immediat∣ly comprehend next under the Shell; but the o∣ther are proper membranes, relating to the White, the Yolk, and the Colliquamentum: but they all of them serve to the preservation, and distinction of those parts which they embrace. Of the two Common coats, the exteriour which doth stick to the Shell, is the tighter, that so it may not suffer violence by the neighbourhood of the Shell, but the interiour is smooth and soft, that so it may not prejudice the Liquors, as the Meninges or mem∣branes called dura and pia mater, do defend the Braine, from the roughness of the Scull. The in∣teriour, and proper membranes do, (as I have said) embrace, and distinguish the Liquors: whereup∣on they are very thinne, transparent and fraile. Fabricius doth indeed highly extoll the Chala∣zae, (as those parts out of which he conceived the Chicken was framed) but as for the Macula, or litle Cicatrice, which is bred adhering to the tuni∣cle of the yolk; he concludes it to be a useless thing, esteeming it to be no more then a bare re∣lique or remainder of the stalk broken off from the Vitellary, or superiour Uterus of the Hen. For (according to his perswasion) the yolk did former∣ly
attract its sustenance through that stalk, or the Vessels passing through it; but the yolk being now no longer nourished by the Hen, but disjoined from the Ovary, there still continues a sign or track of the former conjunction, and the benefits recei∣ved thereby. But I on the contrary apprehend, that there is no other use of the Chalazae, beyond that which I formerly observed; namely, that they should be as the Poles of that Microcosme, and the ends or connexions of all the membranes wound up toge∣ther, whereby the liquors are not onely continued each in their proper places, but also retain a just and convenient position in relation to one ano∣ther. But as for the fore-said Macula, I am certain, that it is of the greatest concern and consequence of all; as being the chief Center of the Egg, where∣in the Innate heat hovers and lurks, and out of which, as out of the first spark, the soul her self is lighted; and lastly, for whose sake, all the li∣quors, and their respective coverings are constitu∣ted, and made. Heretofore, indeed, I was of Fabricius his mind, deeming this litle Cicatrice to be nothing else but the remainder or track of the stalk broken of; but afterwards, upon more accurate observation, I dis∣covered, that the stalk, whereunto the yolk is an∣nexed, is not inserted into any litle cranny or ca∣vity of the yolk (as it is with the stalks of Apples, and Plumms) and that so some track or print of the connexion or dependance which the yolk once had upon the Ovary, should continue in it; but that the stalk, before it arrives to the Yolk from the Cluster, is all the way dilated into a round, (like a litle trumpet) that so it may encompass
the horizon, or the circle of the Yolk, which di∣vides it into two parts; (as the Tunica Amphible∣stroides, or tunicle which resembleth a litle round Casting-Net, doth the Egg) so that the superiour part of the Yolk, or Hemisphere, which looketh towards the Cluster, is quite free from any con∣tact or coherence of the stalk, & yet the fore-men∣tioned Macula, or litle Cicatrice, is seated upon the superiour part of that litle cup, or portion of the membrane of the Yolk; (something inclining to∣wards the side) so that this Macula can upon no terms be said to be the print of the stalk broken off from the Yolk. But of how great importance this macula is in the generation of the Chicken, hath already been discovered in our History. It now remains, that following the stepps of Fabricius, who was formerly my Tutor, and is now my Guide, I should declare the uses of that Cavi∣ty which is in the obtuse part of the Egge. Fabricius recounts several conveniences arising from it, according to its several magnitude: which I shall declare in short, saying, It contains aire in it, and is therefore commodious to the Ventilation of the Egge, to the Respiration, Transpiration, and Refrigeration, and lastly to the Vociferation of the Chicken. Whereupon, that Cavity is at the first very litle, afterwards greater, and at last greatest of all, according as the several recited uses do require. And thus farre have we discoursed, concern∣ing the Generation of the Egge and Chicken, and the Uses of all the parts of the Egge; according to which discourse, we are to conclude and give judgment concerning all kinds of Oviparous pro∣ductions. We are now to declare the manner of the Generation of Viviparous animals, according to
the example and pattern of the Generation of some one Viviparous Animal which is perfectly known, and discovered, by us. That an Egg is the Common Original of all Animals. EXER. LXII. ANimals, saith Aristotle, have this in common to∣gether with Plants; that some do spring out of Hist. an. l. 1. c. 1. seed, and some of their own accord: for as Plants do either arise from the seed of other Plants, or else spring up of their own accord, having attained some princi∣ple fit for their production: and some of them do at∣tract aliment to themselves out of the earth, and some again are bred in other plants: so some Animals are generated by the cognation or affinity of their form; and some of their own accord, no seed at all proceeding which is of kin to them: whereof some are generated out of putrefied earth or plants, (as several Insects) o∣thers are begotten in Animals themselves, and out of the excrements of their parts. But this is common to all those (whether they be generated of their own accord, or else in other Animals, or out of the putrefaction of their parts, or their excrements) namely, to arise out of some principle fit for that purpose, and by some efficient contained in that principle: so that All living creatures must of ne∣cessity have a principle out of which, and by which they are begotten. Give me leave to call this principle, Primordium vegetale, the vegetal principle;
namely, some corporeal substance, having life in it in potentiâ, or something subsisting of it selfe, which is apt to be transformed into a vegetative form, by some internal principle acting in it: Name∣ly, such a principle as the Egge, and the seed of Plants is: such is the conception of Viviparous Ani∣mals, and the Worm of Insects, as Aristotle calls it: the principles of divers Animals being also diverse, according to the diversitie of which principles, the manner of the generation of Animals is diverse likewise: and yet they all consent and agree in this, that they spring from a vegetal principle, as out of a matter indowed with an efficient or pro∣ductive virtue; but differ, in that this principle doth either result casually, or of its own accord, or else proceed from something pre-existent, (as the fruit thereof.) Whereupon those Animals are called sponte nascentia, spontaneous productions, these à parentibus genita, ofsprings derived from their parents. They are also distinguished from their manner of Birth; for some of them are Ovi∣parous, others Viviparous: to which Aristotle ad∣deth Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5. Vermiparous. But if we may distinguish them, as they fall under sense, there are onely two Spe∣cies or sorts of productions; namely, these: all A∣nimals do either produce an Animal Actu, actual∣ly; or potentiâ, potentially. Those Animals which produce an Animal actu, are called Viviparous; and those that produce an Animal in potentiâ, Ovipa∣rous. For every principle which is only alive in po∣tentiâ, we (with Fabricius) do conceive, ought to be called Ovum, an Egge: and as for that principle which Aristotle calls Vermis, a Worm, we do not at all distinguish it ab Ovo, from an Egg; and that because it looks like one to the eye, and also be∣cause that indistinction seems consonant to rea∣son.
For that Vegetal Principle, which is alive in potentiâ, is also an Animal in potentiâ. Nor is that distinction which Aristotle puts between an Egge, and a Worm, to be allowed of; for he calls that an Egge, ex cujus parte fit Animal, out of part of which an Animal is made: quod autem totum mu∣tatur, Gen. an. l. 3. c. 7. Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5. nec ex parte ejus Animal gignitur, est Vermis: and that a Worm, which is wholly transformed, and doth not produce an Animal out of some part of it only. But now these two do both agree in this, that they are productions not yet alive, but Animals onely in potentiâ; and therefore are both Eggs. And Aristotle himself calls the very same things Hist. an. l. 5. c. 29. Ibid. c. 30. Worms in one place, and Eggs in another: And treating of Locusts, saith, There eggs are corrupted in Autumn, when it is wet weather: and (speaking of Grashoppers) When the litle worm, saith he, grow∣eth in the ground, it becomes Tettigometra, a Grass∣hopper-matrix: and a litle after, The females taste the sweeter after coition; for they have white egges. Nay, in that very place, where he had raised a di∣stinction between a Worm and an Egge, hee adds; Gen. an. l. 3. c. 9. But all this kinde of litle worms, when it hath attained the end of its magnitude, is made a kinde of Egge; for their shell doth harden, and so long they continue with∣out motion: which is apparent in the worms of Bees, and Wasps, and also in the Canker-worm. And in∣deed every body may see, that the first rudiments of Spiders, Silkworms, and other Insects, are to be no less ranked in the classis and scale of Eggs, then the spawn, or Egges of Fishes which have softer shells, or of Fishes which have no shells at all, and almost of all sort of fishes whatsoever: which Spawn of theirs is not actually an animate body, but yet Animals are begotten out of them. Since
therefore those creatures which do produce actu Animal, a Creature actually alive, are called Vi∣viparous: doubtless, those Animals which do bring forth a creature which is alive in potentiâ, must be called Oviparous Animals, or else they cannot be comprehended under any Common notion; especi∣ally, seeing such Productions are vegetal Rudi∣ments, proportionable to the seeds of Plants, such as an egge also is allowed to be. We must therefore conclude, that all Animals are either Viviparous, or Oviparous. But because there are several species of Oviparous Animals, therefore the difference of Eggs is also several. For any kinde of Rudiment is not a com∣petent Recipient of every kinde of animal form. Though therefore Eggs in a large or general ac∣ceptation do not differ, yet since some are perfect, and some imperfect, they are justly distinguished. Perfect Eggs we call those, which are perfected in the Uterus, and obtain there a requisite magni∣tude, before they are layed: as the Eggs of Fowle. But those we call Imperfect, which are excluded ere they are ripe, and have not yet attained their just bulk, but do expect that abroad, after they are layed; as the Spawn or Eggs of Fishes, that have a softer shell, and of Fishes which have none at all; and likewise the Rudiments of Insects (which Ari∣stotle calls Worms) are to be listed in this rank: as also the Rudiments of those Creatures which are spontaneous productions. Moreover, though some kindes of perfect Egges are party-coloured, as being compounded of a yolk and white; yet some of them are only of one single colour, as constituted of a white alone: so also amongst imperfect Eggs, others are properly so called, as out of which a perfect Animal is pro∣duced,
as out of the Egges of Fishes: and others improperly, from whence an imperfect Animal proceeds; namely, a Worm, or Canker-worm; which is a kinde of Medium between a perfect, and an imperfect Egge: which in respect or compari∣son of its own egge, or Rudiment from whence it sprung, is an Animal indowed with Sense and Mo∣tion, and doth nourish it self; but in comparison of a Flye, or Butterflie, whose rudiment is in po∣tentiâ, it is to be counted no better then a crawling-egge, sustaining it selfe: like to a Canker-worm, which having now attained its perfect magni∣tude, is transformed into an Aurelia, or perfect Egge; and now ceasing to move any longer, like a very Egge indeed, is an Animal in potentiâ. In like manner, though there are some Eggs, out of whose whole and entire substance (by a Meta∣morphosis, or Transformation) a perfect Animal is formed, which is not fed by any remaining por∣tion of the Egge, but instantly seeks out for its maintenance abroad: and other Eggs, out of part of which a Foetus is constituted, and nourish∣ed by the remainder; though (I say) there are so many several sorts and diversities of Eggs, yet nothing stands in the way, to forbid those to be called Eggs, which Aristotle stiles Worms, (if we may give judgement upon things, according as they discover themselves to our sense and reason) since they are all Vegetal principles, not actually Animals, but in potentiâ, & the true seeds of Animals, proportionable to the seeds of Plants; as we have long since demonstrated in a Hen-egg. All Ani∣mals therefore, are Viviparous, or Oviparous; be∣cause they either produce an Animal actually a∣live, or else an Egge, or Rudiment, which is an Animal, not actu, but in potentiâ.
The Generation therefore of all Oviparous Ani∣mals may be reduced to the example of Hen-eggs, or at least be easily deduced from thence: because the same things which are related in their history, may be discovered in the rest of Viviparous crea∣tures. But hereafter, when we treat of the Generation of Insects, and of Spontaneous productions, we shall discover how each of them are either differenced amongst themselves, or do else agree. For since every generation is a path-way to the attaining of the form of every Animal: according as Animals are either like, or unlike one another, so that their parts do neither specifically, nor generical∣ly agree; so likewise is it usuall in their Genera∣tions. For Nature, who is a Perfect Operatrix, and consonant to her self in her Operations, doth de∣sign Parts that are alike, to Operations and Fun∣ctions that are alike and agree; and so likewise to the attainment of the same form, and the same end, she treads the same steps, and persists alwaies in the same method in the Generation of Animals. Hereupon, in every perfect party-coloured egge of any fowle whatever (which is compounded of a Yolk and White, and fenced with a Shell) as we have still observed the same parts, as are in a Hen-egg, so have we ever found the same order and method of generating, and constituting the foetus (as in a Hen-egg.) And the self same things may also be observed in the Eggs of Serpents, and all Oviparous four-footed Animals, as the Tortoise, Froggs, and Li∣zards; as from whose perfect and party-coloured egges, the foetus is framed and produced, the same way, as in others of the like kinde. But how Spi∣ders, and the softer Shell-fish, as Lobsters, and Shrimps, and the race of Fishes that have scales and
no shells, as the Cuttle-fish and the Calamire do get out of their Eggs, or Spawn; as also how Worms, and Catterpillars do first creep out of the Eggs of Insects, out of which, at length retreating into the worm or vermine called Aurelia, (as into other new eggs again) at last a common Flie, or Butter∣flie is generated; how these Creatures, I say, doe differ in their Generation out of Eggs, from the brood arising out of Hen-eggs, shall be declared in its due place. Lastly, though all party-coloured egges are not generated and fructified the same way; but some become prolifical by the Coition of a Male and Fe∣male, and others by other meanes, as the egges or frie of Fishes; and though there be also a differ∣ence in the manner of the growth of Egges, inso∣much as some are nourished and encreased within their parents bowels, and others abroad: yet no∣thing hinders, why a foetus may not be produced out of any egge whatsoever, (in case it be a perfect egge) as well as out of a Hen-egge. Wherefore, the History wherein we have already unfolded the ge∣neration of a Hen-egge, is satisfactory and full e∣nough for the knowledge of the Generation of all other Oviparous creatures beside; as likewise to the knowledge of all those things which doe thence ensue, by way of Corollary, or Dedu∣ction.
Of the Generation of Vivi∣parous Animals. EXER. LXIII. THus farre have we proceeded in the Generati∣on of Oviparous Animals; it follows, that we now produce our Observations, concerning the other species of Viviparous productions: wherein we have found very many things which are alto∣gether the same with those which occurre in the Egge; which we have reduced hither to be con∣sulted, and come last to be delivered. Which, though they are paradoxical, and run counter to the common received tenets, yet are they, if my judgment fail me not, entirely consonant to the Truth. Amongst Viviparous Animals, Man is the chief, and most perfect of all: next him (that we may proceed from such as are more known) are ranked those creatures that are more sociable & obvious: (whereof some are solidipeda, whole-hoofed; as the Horse, and Ass: some are Bisulca, cloven foot∣ed; as the Oxe, the Goat, the Sheep, the Hogg, and the Deer: others fissipeda, sive digitatis pedibus, Creatures whose feet are distinguished into Toes; as the Dog, the Cat, the Cony, the Mouse, and the like; out of the manner of whose generation, we may conclude concerning the generation of all o∣ther Viviparous Animals. Wherefore, (as we have done in the History of the Egge, so) we shall single out some one kinde of these, as an Exemplar or Representative of all the rest; which, as being most known to us, will give light to the rest, and
become a platform, to which all the other may be reduced, by way of Analogy. I have already given you the reason, why I have drawn out documents concerning all other Egges, from the Egges of Hens: namely because those are cheap, and every mans purchase; and upon that score we our selves had the advantage to make the more diligent disquisition, and o∣thers also have the better opportunity to experi∣ment the truth of our doctrine. But there is more difficulty in the search into the Generation of Viviparous Animals: for we are almost quite debarred of dissecting the humane U∣terus: and to make any inquiry concerning this matter, in Horses, Oxen, Goats, and other Cattel, cannot be without a great deal of paines and ex∣pense. But those who are desirous to make tryal, whether we deliver truth, or not, may assay the business, in Doggs, Conies, Cats, and the like. Fabricius ab Aquapendente, as if every Viviparous conception were a kind of egge, begins his Tract with that; (as being the general exemplar of Generation) giving this amongst other, as the chief ground of his proceedings; namely, because the contemplation of the egge, is of the largest extent: De form. Ovi & Pulli, c. 1. for the greatest part of Animals, saith he, is genera∣ted out of Egges. But we in the entrance of these our Observations, have concluded that all Ani∣mals are in some sort produced out of an Egg: For the foetus of Viviparous creatures is produced after the same manner and order out of a pre-existent conception, as the Chicken is formed and consti∣tuted out of an Egge: There being one and the same species of generation in them all, and the ex∣ordium or first principle of them all is either called an egge, or at lest something answerable and pro∣portionable
to it. For an Egge is an exposed con∣ception from which a Chicken is produced; but a conception is an egge retained within, untill the foetus have attained its just bulk, and magnitude: in other matters it squares with an egge: for they both are Vegetal rudiments, and also Animals in po∣tentiâ. Wherefore the same Theorems, and Corolla∣ries, (though contrary to the received perswasion) which we have already inferred in the History of the Egge, are most true: Likewise of the genera∣tion of all kind of Animals. For it is a confessed and plain thing, that all foetuses, even humane ones also, are procreated out of some conception, (or certain ground-work.) And this is also as true: that that thing which is called Primordium, the first rudiment in spontaneous productions, semen, the seed in Plants, and Ovum the Egge, in Oviparous (as being that corporeal substance, out of which moving and operating by an intrinsecal principle, that which is produced is either a Plant or an A∣nimal:) that same thing in the Generation of Vi∣viparous Animals is conceptus primus; the first Con∣ception: and this is approved to be true both by sense and reason. What we have formerly affirmed of the egge, namely, that it is the sperme and seed of Animals, proportionable to the seed of Plants: the same do we now pronounce of the conception, which is the reall seed of Animals, and therefore also called An Egge. For that is true seed according to Aristotle, De gon. an. l. 1. c. 18. which takes its Original from two Animals joined in coition; and obtaines the virtue or power from both Sexes; such is the seed of all Plants, and of some Animals which know no distinction of Sexes: as it were that which is first mixed from. Male and Fe∣male, being a kind of promiscuous conception, or Ani∣mal:
for these creatures have that in themselves alone, which is required of both Sexes: namely, a fit mat∣ter to feed the foetus, and also a plastical, or forma∣tive, and operative vertue able to produce it. So in like manner, the conception is the fruit of the Male, and Female joined in coition, and also the seed of the future foetus; wherefore it differeth not from an egg. But that, which proceeding from the Generant, is the cause which first obtains the principle of Generation Ibid. (viz. the Efficient) ought to be called the Geniture, but not the seed (as it is miscalled by the common people, and Philosophers too at this day) because it hath not in it that thing which is required of two in coition, neither is it proportionable to the Seed of Plants. But whatsoever doth possess the foresaid condition, and is answerable to the Seed of Plants, that also doth deserve to be called an Egge, and a Conception. Also the definition of an Egge, delivered by A∣ristotle doth fully square to it: saying, An Egge is Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5. that thing in perfect productions of part whereof an Animal is made, and susteined by the remainder, af∣ter it is made. Now the same things agree to a Conception, as shall afterwards appear by the dissection of Viviparous Animals, our Eyes them∣selves being witnesses thereunto. Besides, as a Chicken is hatched out of an Egg, by the fostering heat of the Sitting Hen, or some other ascititious hospitable patronage, so also the Foetus is produced out of the conception in the egge, by the soft and most natural warmth of the parent. In a word: that which Oviparous Animals afford by Incubation, or gathering under their Wings and Breast; that is exhibited by Viviparous, by the
Womb, and neerest, or inward embraces. And then, concerning that which relates to procreati∣on, the foetus is produced out of the Conception, in the selfe same manner, and order, as the Chic∣ken out of the Egg; With this onely difference, that in an egge, whatsoever relates to the Consti∣tution and Nutrition of the Chicken, is at once conteined in it: but the conception (after the foe∣tus is now formed out of it) doth attract more nourishment out of his Parents Womb; whereup∣on the nourishment increases with the foetus. More∣over the Egge is quite emptied, when the Chic∣ken is grown; and the Aliment which was in it consumed, nor doth the Chicken attract any more sustenance from the Hen: but the Oviparous Foetus doth still finde out fresh supplies, and su∣steineth it self by Milk. Now the Eggs, or Spawn of Fishes are suppor∣ted by food procured from without; the Egges of Insects also, whether they have shells or not, have their provisions from abroad, nor are they lesse eggs for that, either really, or nominally: so in like manner the Conception deserves the title of an Egge, though it be susteined by a various kind of Aliment from without. Why some Animals are Oviparous, and all do not produce their Foetus alive, Fabricius offers this reason: namely, because egges (if they were de∣tained in the Uterus till the Pullus were hatched) would by their weight prejudice the flight of Birds. And also in Serpents, or creeping things the multitude of egges would be an impediment to their winding motions. Nor is there compass enough in the narrow circuit of the Snailes shell, to afford room to the number & increase of eggs. So likewise the Fishes bellies are too scanty to
contein their numerous Fry, should they grow within them. And therefore these several crea∣tures are inforced to exclude their births, ere they arrive to perfection. So that it seems most natu∣ral for an Animal, to contein and cherish its con∣ception within it self, untill the foetus be quite perfected: but nature is sometimes constrained to expose her issues immature, and imperfect, and to compleat them with provisions sought for from without. For as much therefore as concerns procreation, All kind of Animals are generated after the same manner out of an Egge-like Rudiment: (which we call Egg-like, not that every Rudiment of an A∣nimal doth resemble an Egge in Figure, but in Nature and Consistence) For in all their respe∣ctive Generations this they have in common, name∣ly, that a certain Vegetal principle is pre-existent (of like nature to an Egge, and answering in proportion to the Seed of Plants) out of which the foetus is produced. And this Egg or Egg-like substance is in them all, possessing the nature and conditions required in an Egg: which conditions also the seeds of Plants have common to them, as well as Animals. And for that cause the princi∣ples of any kind of Animals, are called their Fruits, and Seeds, and so likewise the Seeds of all Plants may in a manner be called Egges, and Concepti∣ons. And to this purpose Aristotle speaks, saying: De gen. an. l. 3. c. 9. Those creatures which bring forth an Animal from within themselves, have something formed in them up∣on the first conception like unto an egge: for they have an humour conteined in a thin coat, such as that in an egge when the shell is pilled off. Whereupon those de∣pravations of conceptions which fall out about that
time, fluxus vocant, the people call, Fluxes, or mis∣carryings. Those Fluxes are chiefly observable in Women, when they miscarry in the first or second moneth: and such I have often seen discharged about those times: and such a one also Hippocrates reports to have been discharged, and fallen from the Minstrel. The first Conception, or Rudiment therefore of all Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7. Animals is in the Uterus: which according to A∣ristotle, is liks an egg covered over with a membrane when the shell is pilled off. And this shall appear more clearly by what shall be said hereafter. In the interim we conclude with the Philosopher: All Animals, whether they be swimming, walking, or flying Animals; and whether they be born in the form of an Animal, or of an Egge: are all generated after the same manner. The History of the Generation of Hinds and Does, is layed down as the Example of all other Animals: together with the reason of our so doing. EXERCIT. LXIV. OUr late Sovereign King Charls, so soon as he became a Man, was wont for Recreation, and Health sake, to hunt almost every week, especi∣ally
the Buck and Doe; no Prince in Europe having greater store either wandring at liberty in the Woods, or Forrests, or inclosed and kept up in Parkes and Chaces. In the three summer moneths, the Buck and Stagge, being then fat and in season, were his game, and the Doe and Hind in the Au∣tumne, and Winter, so long as the three season∣able moneths continued. Hereupon (for the Rut∣ting time, when the Females are lusty, and admit the Males, whereby they conceive and bear their young) I had a daily oportunity of dissecting them, and of making inspection and observation of all their parts; which liberty I chiefly made use of in order to the Genital parts. We shall therefore disclose the Generation of all Viviparous Animals, out of the History of the Hind and Doe, as being the most commodious Exem∣plar: treating thereof after the same manner as we have already handled the Generation of all O∣viparous productions, out of the History of the Hen-Egge. And this not from any peculiar design of my own, or for the same causes for which I did prefer the Hen-Egge to all other: but because by the favour and bounty of my Royal Master (whose Physitian I was, and who was himself much de∣lighted in this kind of curiosity, being many times pleased to be an eye witness, and to assert my new inventions) I had great store of his Deere at my devotion, and frequent opportunity and license to dissect and search into them. I intend therefore to set before you the History of Hinds and Does, composed out of my sundry observ ations for many years together, whereby I my self am chiefly versed in them, and from whence also something may be infallibly con∣cluded concerning the Generation of other Vivipa∣rous
Animals: which History, whilest we faith∣fully compile, we shall also insert all those obser∣vable Occurrences, which we have either casually met withall, or else attained by intended disse∣ctions in other Animals; namely, such as are clo∣ven-footed, whole-hoofed, and those which have their feet distinguished into toes, as likewise in Man him∣self: declaring the series, or order of the Forma∣tion of the Foetus, according to the several pro∣ceedings which Nature her selfe doth observe therein. Of the Uterus of Hindes and Does. EXER. LXV. BEing about to treat of the Formation and Ge∣neration of the Hinde and Doe, we must first discourse concerning the place wherein those acti∣ons are performed, namely the Uterus; (as we have already done in the History of the Hen) that so those things which ensue, may be more easily and rightly understood. For in this very thing. History hath the precedence of Romance and Fable; namely, in that she describes events with their just circumstance of set times and places, and so guides us unto knowledge by a surer way. But that we may the better conceive the Deere's Uterus, we shall explain both the internal, and ex∣ternal fabrick thereof, taking our pattern from the womb of Women. For Man, who is the most con∣summate or complete Animal of all other, as he hath obtained all other parts more perfect then
they, so are his Genital parts also. And therefore the Uterine parts are most distinct in a Woman, and to us (by reason of the special industry of Anatomists about this Part) better known. Now in the Uterus of Hinds, & Does, many things do occurr which you may discover to be the same in the womb of a Woman; but yet some things do differ. In the external orifice, are neither the labra, nor the Clitoris, nor the Nymphae; but onely two Orifices (whereof one is the Orifice of the Bladder, adjoined to the Share-bone; the other of the Pri∣vity, seated between the fundament and the Urmary cavity.) The membranous Cuticle (like to that which we have noted in a Henne) tending down∣wards from the fundament, doth cover the veil, and supply the office of the Nymphae & labia of the Pri∣vity, in order to its defence from outward inju∣ries: this veile is something retracted in a Woman in coition, or at lest forced to retreat by the en∣trance of the Yard into the Orifice of the Privity. The Suture or connexion of the Share-bones be∣ing divided in Hindes, or Does, and the leggs laid wide open, the Bladder of Urine, and Vagina Uteri, or Privity wherein the Yard of the Male is enter∣tained, as also the neck of the Womb, and its scitu∣ation, are presently discovered, together with the ligaments whereby it is fastened, as likewise the Veines, Arteries, and Testieles, as they call them: also the Horns of the Womb, even in these creatures, are more remarkable then the other parts of it. But as for the preparing, and the leading, or eja∣culatory vessels, there are no such things to be found here; nor (as farre as I know) in any other Fe∣male whatsoever: And Anatomists (who suppose that the Female doth emit a seed in coition) make too industrious an enquiry after them; for they
are not at all in some; and in those in whom they are, they are never found in the same manner, or agreeing. Wherefore it comes neerest to truth, which also (as I have observed) the greater part of Women acknowledg; namely, that they do not emit any seed in coition. And though the more sa∣lacious do discharge a certain moisture in coition, yet I neither approve it to be fruitfull seed, nor necessarily conducing to conception; for very ma∣ny do conceive without any such effusion at all: (and some also without any pleasure) but of these more elsewhere. The Privity, or Vagina Uteri, which is extended from the outward Orifice of the secret parts, to the inward Orifice of the Womb, is in a Doe, as in a Wo∣man, seated between the Bladder of Urine, and the Rectum intestinum, or Right Gut, and is corre∣spondent to the Yard of the male in form, large∣ness, and longitude. And being dissected, is disco∣vered to be furrowed with oblong wrinckles and rugosities, and also made glibb and slippery with a stiffe moysture. In its bottom, you may per∣ceive a more narrow and closed Orifice, which is the beginning of the neck of the Uterus, through which, whatsoever is driven out from the cavity of the Womb, doth make its passage. And this is that Orifice, which Physitians affirm to be so close∣ly compressed, sealed up, and concluded in a Vir∣gin, and Woman with child, that it will not ad∣mit the point of the finest Needle, or Probe. After this follows the Neck, or Process of the Womb, which is a much longer and rounder pas∣sage in them, then in Women; and in its whole ex∣tension, from the bottom of the Privity to the Womb it self, is much more fibrous, thick, and nervous, then theirs. And if you make incision into this
Neck, according to its longitude, you shall dis∣cover not only its exteriour ingress, which is con∣spicuous in the bottom of the Privity, so exactly to connive, and cling together, that the air it self though driven by ones breath, cannot arrive at the cavity of the Womb; but also five alike streights more ranked in order, blocked up against the access of any outward approacher, and stick∣ing firmly together by a glewy mucilage: just as the most compact and narrow orifice of a Wo∣mans Uterus is locked up by a yellow glutinous substance. And such narrow streights as these, are discernable in the neck of the Sheeps, Cowes, and Goats womb, all which are close locked up, and forbid any admittance (which Fabricius also ob∣served.) But these five Recesses are most distin∣guishable in a Hinde, and a Doe, appearing like so many several ports or orifices of the Uterus tyed up, and sealed fast, which you may justly esteem as so many Barracadoes opposed to the admission of any thing whatsoever. So carefull doth Nature seem to have been, that in case any insolent in∣truder should have forced the first gate, yet his rudeness should be foiled by the next, making like provision in the other Avenues, that so no∣thing might infinuate it self into the womb. And yet for all this a Probe being put in from the Ca∣vity of the Uterus outwards, doth with ease pass through all these ports, and finde a way out. For it was convenient that a passage should be affor∣ded to the discharge of Flatulencies, Menstruous Blood, and other Humours; but all entrance de∣barred to the entertainment of outward things, though they be never so litle (as to the air itself, or the Seed.) This Uterine Orifice is alike blocked up in all
other Animals, as it is in Women; whose womb we have known so closed sometimes, that their Cour∣ses, Purgations after delivery, and other humours, have for want of free disburdening, excited most terrible Hysterical affections, insomuch that I have been fain to invent an instrument proper to this inconvenience, whereby the orifice of the womb be∣ing opened, the imprisoned superfluities might be released, and the recited casualties subdued; as also that injections might finde a reception in the cavity of the womb, by which I have sometimes cured the internal Ulcers of the Matrix, and also Barrenness it self. The Cavity of the Uterus in Hindes and Does, is exceeding small, as the substance of the Uterus is very litle both in magnitude and thickness. For the womb in those creatures, is only as a Porch, or Fore-Gate, in the Cavity whereof lyeth an open way both on the right, and left hand, which lead∣eth to the Horns of the Womb. For those parts are different in almost all other Animals which have Blood, from what they are in Women; in whom the chief part of the womb, is the Body thereof: but the Neck, and the Hornes, (as being onely Appendixes) are scarce discernable. For the Neck is short, & the Horns litle, like round & long processes, extended upwards from the bot∣tom of the womb, like two Trumpets; the Anato∣mists commonly conceiving them to be the Ejacu∣latory vessels. But in the Hinde and Doe, as in all other Viviparous Animals which have blood (ex∣cept only Women, she-Apes, and those Female Ani∣mals that are whole-hoofed) the chief part for Gene∣ration is not the Womb, but the Horns thereof. For in Women, and whole-hoofed Beasts, the place of Conception is the Womb, but in other Animals, the
Conception is accomplished in the Horns of the Womb. And therefore Authors generally call those Horns by the name of Uterus, the Womb, saying, that the Womb in some Animals is bipartite, and in some not; understanding thereby the places of Conception, which are the Horns of the wombe, wherein almost all Viviparous Animals, praesertine multipara, especially those that bring forth several young ones at a birth, doe conceive: and unto which also all the Uterine veins & arteries are con∣ducted, and the other Genital parts are subservient. Wherefore give us leave also, in the History of those Animals, to use promiscuously the name of Uterus or Womb, and of Horns of the womb, for the same thing. In a Woman, as we have said, the two Trumpets neer the process of the Neck of the womb, which are perforated into the cavity thereof, are not com∣monly reputed proportionable to the Horns, but are conceited by some Anatomists to be Vasa Sper∣matica, Spermatical Vessels; by others, Spiramen∣ta Uteri, the Pores of the Uterus; by a third sort, Vasa semen deferentia, aut reservantia, Leading Vessels, or Vessels reserving the Seed in them. As if they were a certain kinde of Seminal vesicles; when, in truth, they are answerable in proportion to the Horns of the womb of other Animals; as ap∣pears clearly, by their scituation, connexion, largeness, perforation, form, and function: for as other Animals do alwaies conceive in the Horns, so a Woman also is sometimes found to bear her Foetus in Cornu sive Tubâ, in the Horn or Trumpet Anthrop. l. 2. c. 34. of the womb, as the most learned Riolanus reports by the observation of other men, and I have seen with my own eyes. Those Horns do terminate in the Common Cavity,
which (like a Porch or Threshold) is seated before them both; and is in Deer proportionable to the Womans uterus, as the trumpets of the Womans womb, are proportionable to the Horns of the Deers womb. But their denomination they assume from their figure; for as the Horns of a Ram or Goat are large at bottom, jutting out before, and again reflected backward; so also these Horns of the womb (in Hindes and Does) at their original are large and ample, and lessening by degrees as they look upwards, are at last retorted towards the Spine of the Back. And as those other Horns are inequal, knotty, and wrinkled in their fore∣part, but behinde appear smooth and even; so the Horns of the Deers womb, are below wrinckled, and gathered, by reason of certain cells or rings bunching out, in manner like the Gut Colon: but above (where they respect the Spine) they are smooth and even, and recurved, as if they were ty∣ed back by a kinde of fillet-like ligament, and so by degrees grow slender as Horns do. If you take an empty gut (such a one as puddings are made in) keeping it contract, wrinckled, and streightned, by a tape or fillet which binds it all along on one side, you shall see it curled and distinguished into litle cells or windings (after the fashion of the Colick Gut.) And such is the fabrick of the Horns of the womb of a Hinde, or a Doe. In other Females the case is different, for they either have larger cells, or none at all. And in these Horns of Hinds and Does also, though there be several cells or windings, yet are not all of equal magnitude, but the first is much larger then any of the rest, and in it chiefly the Conception is contained. And as in a Woman, the womb, and its trumpets (or Horns) with the rest of its appurtenances, are
tyed fast to the Share-bones, the Back, & the neigh∣bour Parts, by the mediation of a broad and car∣nous Membrane, (as by a pendulous band or tye) which Anatomists do stile Vespertilionum alas, the Batts wings; because the Uterus hanging in this manner, doth resemble a Bat with its wings spread abroad: so also in Hindes, and Does, the two Horns of the womb, together with the Testicles, and all the Vessels of the Uterus, are by a thick membrane fastened to the circumjacent Parts, (but especial∣ly to the Back) which membrane performs the same office to the Uterine Parts, as the Meseutery doth to the Guts, and that which we call the Meso∣metrion doth to the Uterus of the Hen. For as by the Mesentery the Meseraick Veins and Arteries are derived to the Guts; so are the Uterine Vessels disseminated through the fore-said membrane: in which also certain small Bladders and Glandules are on both sides discovered, which Glandules A∣natomists commonly call the Testicles. The substance of the Horns of the Hindes and Does wombs is cuticular or skinny, or else a fleshy skin or coat (like that of the Guts) besprinckled with certain slender Veins. This coat you may, as Anatomists use to do, divide into several coats, ob∣serving the several scituation of the fibers, which serve to several functions, namely to Retention, and Expulsion. For I have many times seen those Horns moving just like Earth-worms; in the same manner as any man may perceive the Guts, in an Animal newly killed, and the abdomen or cover∣ing of the lower belly laid open, stirring to and fro, in a kinde of waving motion, whereby (as if they were close begirt and bound in by some small narrow ring, or pressed and squeezed be∣tween ones fingers) they crowd down and depress
the Chyle & Excrement towards the inferior Guts. All the Uterine Veins do here (as in a woman) assume their original from the Hollow vein, neer the Emulgents: but the Arteries (which they also do partake as well as Women) do arise from the Branches of the Great Artery, which pass into the Thighes: and as in a woman great with child, the Uterine Vessels which contain blood, are more and greater then in the rest of her body; so is it also with Hindes and Does which are with Fawn. But the Arteries (contrary to that Which we see in the rest of the body) are much more numerous for their proportion then the Veines; and being blown in∣to, they will distend, & fill their neighbour veins, but the veins being in the same manner blown in∣to, will never do so much for them. And this al∣so I see taken notice of by the learned Riolanus, and it is a prevalent argument for the Circulation of the Blood, which was my Invention; for it doth clearly evince a passage from the Arteries into the Veins, but no retreat from the Veins into the Ar∣teries again: & there are likewise more Arteries then Veins, because the foetus requires great store of sustenance to supply his growth, the remain∣der whereof fewer Veins are sufficient to return. There are also Testicles discernable in these also, as they are in Sheep, Goat, and all Animals which cleave the hoofe; but such Testicles as resemble the Prostatae, or seed Glandules, and the Kennels of the Mesentery (whose office is to secure the divarications of the Veins, and retain a moi∣sture in them whereby to keep the parts glib) ra∣ther then things designed to the concoction of Prolifical seed, and the Reservation or treasuring it up till it be fit for profusion in the time of Coi∣tion. And this is my opinion of them, both for
sundry reasons elsewhere alledged: as chiefly, because that at the time of coition (when the males Testicles are swelled with seed, and full of seminal juice) the Horns of the womb indeed are in Hindes and Does, and all other Viviparous Animals (where∣in they reside) much altered: but the Testicles, as they call them, (like things utterly unconcerned in the matter of Generation) do neither swell, nor differ any way from the constitution they were of (either before, or after coition) affording no testimony at all of their use either in respect of Coition, or Generation. It is a wonderfull thing to see how great a quantity of geniture doth abound in the Testicles, and much distended Seminal Vessels of the very masculine Moles, and Mice, about the time of their coition (which we have also formerly observed in the Dunghill-Cock) and how vast an alteration is espyed in the Genitals of both Sexes; and yet these Glandulae, or litle Kernels (which men con∣ceive to be the Testicles of the Females) do still re∣serve their wonted appearance, without any vari∣ation at all. What we have hitherto observed, concerning the Womb and the Horns thereof in Hindes and Does, doth for the most part relate also to other Viviparous Animals, though they differ in a Wo∣man; because she conceives in her womb, but all the rest in the Horns of the womb, except the Mare, and the she-Ass; and even they also, though they seem to bear their Conception in the womb, yet that place of Conception doth more resemble the nature and constitution of a Horn, then of a Womb: for that place is not bipartite, but some∣thing more oblong,, and different from a womb, both in scituation, connexion, fabrick, and sub∣stance,
and ought rather to be compared to the su∣periour Uterus, or process of the womb of the Hen, (wherein the Egge groweth, and is encompassed with the White) then to the womb of a Woman. Of the Coition of the Hinds and Does. EXER: LXVI. THe History of the Womb of Hinds and Does, is such as hath been shewed. Wherein we have briefly declared those things which did seem ne∣cessary to Generation, namely, the place of Con∣ception, and those parts which are ordeined there∣unto. It remaines that we now treat of the Action and Function of this place, namely of Coition and Conception. Hinds and Does do admit their Males at one on∣ly set time of the year; that is about the midst of September, after the Feast of the Holy Cross, and they bring forth after the middest of June, neer the Feast of Saint John Baptist. So that they goe nine moneths, not eight, as Pliny would have it: L. 8. c. 32. for they calve or bring forth, with us at lest, the nineth moneth after their first Rutting. At Rutting time the males assemble themselves amongst the females, but at other times they feed apart: and the elder Deere (as the Staggs) do as∣sociate with their own Sex, and the Hinds and Does keep company and feed among the other Hinds and Does, together with the younger sort of Ducks, and Fawns. About a whole moneth their
Rutting time continues, which doth begin later, if the season be dry, but if it be moist and rainey, sooner. And therefore in Spain (as I am infor∣med) they seldom rut before the Calends of October, because moist weather comes not on there til then. But in England their Rutting time seldom lasts be∣yond the middest of October. At that time their lust enrages them so, that they will assault or Doggs or Men, when at other times they are shie and timorous, and suffer them∣selves to be chased and put to flight upon the alarme of the least barking curre that is. Every Male Deer knowes all his Females, and will not indure any one of them to straggle, but will pursue and bring her back to his Herd: and being now grown very jealous of them, he fre∣quently surveyes them, and rangeth them toge∣ther. And if perhaps a stranger Doe intrude a∣mong them, he is not very passionate in her ex∣pulsion, but affords her a fair departure: but if another Male Deere address himself to this Herd, he bids him a speedy defiance, and charges him with his Head. The Hind and Doe are numbered amongst the chaster rank of Animals; because they do not wil∣lingly admit Coition (for the Stagge and Buck, like the Bull, do celebrate their Coition with violence) and unless they be over-mastered, or tyred out with assaults, they shun the act. And this seemes to be the cause of the assembling themselves to∣gether in a Herd to their own proper mates, and chiefly to those that are the elder Deere, and are best headed: for if a forraigner attempt their cha∣stity, they presently fly to their own Herd and consort, for sanctuary, as the refuge of their af∣frighted modesty.
If a young Batchelour Buck finde a Doe strag∣gling alone, he presently pursues, and having ti∣red her by his chasing, he takes advantage of her inability for resistance, and so enjoyes her by force. All the Male Deer provide themselves a Rutting place at some distance from the Herd, by digging up trenches, or standing behind some convenient rise of ground, whither they constrain their Fe∣males to appear. She that is now about the act of Rutting, placeth her hinder feet in the furrow or trench provided for the purpose, and (if occasion be) inclining her body doth something depress her Hanches; by which means the Stag or Buck may at one inition (as Bulls do) pressing her for∣ward, finish his affaires. The Elder, and abler Stags, and Bucks have a larger Herd of Hinds and Does, then the juniour and infirmer Deer: some assemble to themselves ten, some fifteen. Our Keepers say, that the Fe∣males are sated at the second coition, or third at the most, and she, so soon as she conceives, admits the male no more. The Male when he hath fructified all his Fe∣males, his lust cooleth; and having impared both his audacity, and his flesh, quits his Herd, straggles alone, and feeds greedily to repaire his broken strength, making no farther assault upon any Fe∣male all that year. When the Buck growes first ripe for Rutting, the Hair about his Throat and Neck growes black; as also doth the extremity of his prepuce, which doth putrifie likewise, and stink extreamly. The Does and Hinds are but very seldome com∣pressed, and that too in the night time onely, and in obscure places, such as are purposely made
choice of by the Males for that performance. If the Stags or Bucks chance to contest (which is usu∣all) then the conquered his Females are all made the Victors purchase. Of the Constitution or Alteration of the Uterus of the Hind and Doe in the moneth September. EXERCIT. LXVII. WE now come to the Alteration of the Geni∣ral parts of the Hind, and Doe, after Rutting time, and also to the conception it self. In September, when the Hinds and Does first Rut∣ting time is now arrived, their Uterus (I mean the Hornes of the Uterus, or the place wherein they conceive) is become more fleshy, and thick, and likewise more soft and tender. In the cavity of each of the Horns of the womb (in that part which resembleth a wrinckled fillet; namely, where it reflects towards the spine of the Back) five Carun∣cles, or soft Warts, or Nipples, do jet out, being placed in order: whereof the first is the biggest of all, and the rest as they lie in order, are still one less then the other; just as these Horns themselves do lessen by degrees from the bottom upwards, to the very top. Some of these Caruncles do grow out as broad as the middle finger, (appearing like a kinde of a luxuriant, fungous, fleshy substance) being paler or whiter then some, and more ruddy then others.
About the six and twentieth, or eight and twen∣tieth day of September (as likewise afterwards in October) the Uterus is grown thicker; and the ca∣runcles being now more tumid, do resemble the Nipples of Womens Breasts: so that you would believe they were designed to yeeld Milk. Their top or uppermost part being cut away (for I divi∣ded the outward superficies from them, to discover their interiour constitution) I beheld them com∣pacted and formed out of an innumerable com∣pany of white points, as out of so many bristles set up stiff and erect, by a certain mucous viscidi∣ty or glewy substance, and pinching them hard from the roots upward, between my fore finger and my thumb, I squeezed out of each of those white points a small drop of blood. Whereupon by a more strict enquiry, I discovered them to be nothing else, but the Capillary productions of so ma∣ny slender Arteries. At Rutting time therefore, the Uterine Vessels (especially the Arteries) are discovered to be more in number, and more conspicuous then at other times: Though (as I have noted before) those that are called the Testicles, are neither more large, nor more full then they were before, nor any thing changed from their pristine constitution. The Cavity of the Uterus (that is, of the Hornes of the Uterus) and interiour superficies thereof (which you may call the wall of the litle Cells) presents it selfe exceeding soft and glibbe to the touch, like to the interiour concameration of the Ventricles of the Braine, or the flesh of the Nut of the Yard, which is within the Prepuce. But in that Cavity, I could never discover any Sperme ejected from the Male Deere, nor any other thing which relates to the conception, (though I have made
most accurate dissection through all the entire moneths of September and October.) And yet the Male Deere did go to rut daily, and I dissected a great number of Does. And this is the result of many years experience. I have seen indeed in some the Caruncles so neer∣ly seated the one to the other, as if they had made one continued protuberance out of all the five uni∣ted together. And when upon frequent experi∣ment, I never met with any other thing within the Cavity of the Uterus, I began at first to consi∣der, whether the masculine seed could by any means (namely either by way of Injection, or At∣traction) insinuate itself into the seat of Concep∣tion? and at last my many repeated observations did ratifie this conclusion, namely, that no part or portion of the seed doth ever enter into those receptacles. What befalls them in the moneth of October. EXERCIT. LXVIII. HAving made several dissections in the month of October, as well before the expiration of the Rutting time, as after: I could never finde any seed, or blood, or the track of any other thing whatsoever, in the cavity of the Uterus. Onely the Womb or Uterus was grown larger and thicker, and the Caruncles more tumid and florid then be∣fore, and out of them upon a close constriction
or pinching them between the fingers, some small drops of blood did issue out, as a watery kinde of milk is expressed out of the nipples of the breasts of such as are with Childe, about the fourth moneth of their pregnation. In the Uterus of one, or two, which was exceedingly impated and extenuated contrary to the course of Nature, I found indeed a kinde of a green, ichorous putrified substance, like to impostumated matter, filling the cavity there∣of; whereas those very Does were in all other points sound, and something fat, no less then their fellowes which I diffected at the same time. About the End of October, and the Beginning of November, when the Rutting time is now conclu∣ded, and the Females and Males part company: the Uterus began to seem of a lesser bulk (in some sooner, and in others later) and the wall or sides of the inner cavity appeared to tumefie, as if it were puffed up; for in those places where of late the litle Cells were, there did now round gobbets extuberate inwards, filling almost the whole ca∣pacity: so that the sides now seemed to touch one another, and glewed as it were together, leaving no space vacant between them. For as licorish Boyes (while they plunder the honey-combs, that they may greedily devour the honey) have their Lips so stung by the Bees, that they swell and grow tumerous, and so streighten the gap of their Mouths; in the same manner doth the interiour superficies of the Does Uterus become turgid, and a most soft and pulpous substance (like that of the Braine) doth fill the cavity, and involve the Ca∣runcles in it. And as for the Caruncles themselves, they are no bigger then they were before, but on∣ly appear something paler, and as it were madera∣ted or stewed in warm water, as the Nurses nipples
look presently after the Childe hath had the breast. But I could not squeeze out any blood from them, as before. This interiour superficies of the Uterus being thus swolne; it is at that time so tender and smooth, as nothing can be more. It resembles the softness of the brain it self, and when you touch it, did not your own eyes give evidence to that touch, you would not believe your fingers vere upon it. The cavity of the Womb being laied open immediately after the killing of the Deere, I have often discovered a slow waving motion, (such a one as is seen in the bottom of a creeping Snailes belly) as if the Womb were Animal in Ani∣mali, one living creature in another; and had a peculiar independent motion of its own. Such a kind of motion as this, I have (as I mentioned but now) often observed in the inte∣stines of creatures dissected alive: & the same may be experimented both by the testimony of the sight and touch, in live Dogs and Conies, though you dis∣sect them not. I have likewise observed the same kind of motion, in the Testicles and Scrotum of the Males; and I have known some Women, whom such palpitations have deluded with the hopes of be∣ing with Child. But whether in Hysterical affecti∣ons (such as are the Ascent, descent, & contortion of the Uterus) the Womb of Women move and stir by such a kind of agitation; as whether the Braine also in its conceptions be in like manner moved to and fro, as the discovery is very difficult, so is it vorthy the attempt. A little while after the foresaid Extuberance of the interiour coat of the Uterus begins to shrink, and lessen: and in some, (but that is rare,) a certain purulent matter doth stick to the fides, (in
manner of sweat) such as is visible in wounds, and ulcers, when they are said to be Concocted, and cast forth a white, smooth, and equall matter. When I first discovered this kind of substance, I was in suspence, whether I should conceit it to be the seed of the Male, or some concocted substance a∣rising from it. But because I did observe this mat∣ter but seldom, and in few onely, and also seeing twenty days were now past, since any commerce with the male had been celebrated, and likewise for as much as this substance was not thick, clam∣my, or froathy, (as seed is) but more friable and purulent, inclining to yellow, I concluded that it arrived thither casually rather, or else procee∣ded from over much sweat, the Deere being new∣ly quite spent in the chace: and so in a Rheume falling down into the Nose, the thinner portion of the Catarrh being thickened into a mucous sub∣stance, puts on a yellow complexion. This alteration in the Womb when I had often discovered to His Majesties sight (as the first assay towards impregnation) and having likewise plain∣ly shewed that all this while no portion of seed, or conception either was to be found in the Womb; and when the King himself had communicated the same as a very wonderful thing to diverse of his followers, a great debate at length arose: The Keepers and the Huntsmen concluded, first, that this did imply, that their conception would be late that year, & thereupon accused the drougth; but afterwards when they understood that the rut∣ting time was past, and gone; and that I stood stiffly upon that, they peremptorily did affirm, that I was first mistaken my selfe, and so had drawn the King into my error; and that it could not possibly be, but that something at lest of the
Conception must needs appear in the Uterus: un∣till at last, being confuted by their own eyes, they sate down in a gaze and gave it over for granted. But all the Kings Physitians persisted stiffly, that it could no waies be, that a conception should go forward unless the males seed did remain in the womb, and that there should be nothing at all re∣siding in the Vterus after a fruitfull and effectu∣all Coition; this they ranked amongst their . Now that this experiment which is of so great concern might appear the more evident to poste∣rity; His Majestie for tryal-sake (because they have all the same time and manner of concepti∣on) did at the beginning of October separate about a dozen Does from the society of the Buck, and lock them up in the Course neer Hampton Court. Now lest any one might affirm that doubt∣lessly these did continue the seed bestowed upon them in Coition (their time of Rutting being then not past) I dissected diverse of them, and disco∣vered no seed at all residing in their Vterus: and yet those whom I dissected not, did conceive by the virtue of their former Coition (as by Contagion) and did Fawn at their appointed time. In Bitches, Conies, and several other Animals, I have certainly discovered, that nothing after Coi∣tion is to be found in their Vterus, for many daies together. In so much that I am very well ascer∣tained that in Viviparous, (as well as in Oviparous creatures) the Foetus doth neither proceed from the Seed of Male and Female emitted in Coi∣tion, nor yet from any commixture of that seed, (as the Physitians will have it) nor yet out of the Menstruous blood, as Aristotle conceits; and like∣wise that there is not any thing of the conception
necessarily in being, presently after Coition. And hence it follows, that it is not true, that in a pro∣lifical coition, any matter is ready at hand in the Vterus, which matter or substance, the Masculine seed should concoct, coagulate and fashion, or re∣duce into an actual generation, or by drying its outward Superficies, Form, and After-birth to wrap it in. For nothing at all is to be found in the Womb for many days together, even to the twelfth of November. It is also evident, that all Females, in the Act of coition, do not effund a seed into the Vterus; for neither in Hinds, or Does, or several other Vivi∣parous Animals, is there any track or signe of ei∣ther Seed, or Menstruous blood. But what it may be, which flowes from some salacious Women in Coiti∣on, as well as from Men, which procures plea∣sure to them, and a kind of resolution of their Spirits; as also whether it do necessarily conduce to the Conception; likewise whether it do proceed from the Testicles, or whether it bee seed, and whe∣ther prolifical or not, we have elsewhere discovered. And while I am in this discourse, let the inge∣nious bear with me, (if being mindful of my great wrongs) I let slip a sigh or two, grounded upon this my misfortune: namely, that while I did at∣tend upon our late Sovereign in these late distra∣ctions, and more then Civil Wars; (and that not by the Parliaments bare permission, but com∣mand) some rapacious hand or other not onely spoiled me of all my Goods; but also (which I most lament) have bereft me of my Notes, which cost me many years industry. By which meant, many observations (especially those concerning) the Generation of Insects) are lost and imberelled to the prejudice (I may boldly say it) of the Com∣mon-wealth of Learning.
What things happen in the Uterus of Deere in November. EXER. LXIX. ABout the twelfth or fourteenth day of Novem∣ber there is something, which is then first of all to be found in the Cavity of the Womb of the Deere, conducing to the future foetus, and this I truly avouch, and of many years Experience. I remember indeed, that in the year of our Lord 1653, these signs or rudiments of conception did appear sooner, because it was a cloudy, and wet season. In Hinds also, which go to Rut six or seven days before the Does, I have still discovered some track of the future conception, about the eighth or nineth day of November. But what that is, and how it doth begin, I shall now declare. A litle before any thing at all is to be seen, the substance of the Vterus, or Hornes appear lesser, then when the females first went to Rut; and the white Caruncles are more flaggy (as I informed you before;) and the protuberance of the inward that doth a litle abate, growing more wrinckled, and moist. For about the time aforesaid, some certain mucous filaments (like the Spiders threads) are led from the last or upper angle of the Hornes of the Vterus, through the midst of both the Horns, and also through the cavity of the Womb, which being joined together, do resemble a membra∣ns or filmy coat, or empty wallet. And as that implication or web of vessels called Pleocus Choroides,  led through the Ventricles of the Brain, so this
litle oblong sack, or wallet is spun over all the space of both the Horns, and the intermediate cavity of the womb. In which dissemination, insinuating it self into the rugosities of the flagging membrane, it doth insert slender fibres between the fore-men∣tioned round extuberances or nipples; after the same manner as the membrane called Fia Mater doth work it self into the convolutions of the braine. A day or two being now over, this wallet is fil∣led with a watry, white, stiff, albugineous sub∣stance, and being stuffed with that moisture, doth resemble a long pudding, sticking or cleaving a litle to the conteining sides of the Vterus by its ex∣teriour glutinosity; and yet so, that it may be easily separated from them: for being taken in the narrow part of the Vterus (where it is tied to it as it passeth along) it may be brought away entire from both the Hornes, if it be warily hand∣led. This Conception now grown, and taken out, is of the figure of a wallet, or double pudding: being besmeared on the outside with a kind of purulent filth; but within it is glibbe, conteining in it a stiff moisture, much like to the more liquid White of an Egge. Now this is the first Conception of Hindi and Does. And seeing the nature and condition of an Egge, together with the definition is applicable thereto, for Aristotle defines an Egge, to be that thing out of part whereof an Animal is begotten, and Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5. & de gen. an. l. 2. c. 1. de gen. an. l. 3. c. 9. the remainder is the food of that Animal which is be∣gotten: and likewise, seeing it is the ground-work or rudiment of the future foetus, it is therefore al∣so called Ovum Animalium, the Animals Egge, According to that of Aristotle. Those creatures which beget an Animal within themselves, have upon
the first conception something formed in them in man∣ner of an egge. For a moist substance is contained in a Membrane, just as if you should pill off the shell from the Egge: whereupon the depravations of these concepti∣ons are called fluxes. This Conception therefore, as we said before of an Egge, is a true sperme, or seed, embracing in it self the virtue of both Sexes, and proportionable to the seed of Plants. Aristotle therefore describing the first Conceptions of Women, Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7. saith they are, as it were, an Egg covered over with a Membrane, but the shell taken off: such as Hippocra∣tes records to have dropt from the Minstrel, and such as I have often seen fallen from Women in the second Moneth, which was of the bigness of a Pige∣ egge, without any foetus at all in it: and some∣times about the bulk of a Pheasants, or Hens egg: and at this time the floating Embryo is of the lon∣gitude of the naile of the Litle-finger. But the Membrane involving the Conception, hath not yet attained any After-burden to which it may be fastened, nor is it fastened to the womb it self; but onely at its obtuser and upper end, as if it were uck with moss or down; it presents to our view the first designs and rudiments of the After-burden, or Cake of the Womb: but the inner superficies be∣ing smooth and glib, is divaricated with the seve∣ral propagations of the Umbilical Vessels. At the third Moneth, this Egge exceeds a Goose-Egge in magnitude, and infolds within it an Embryo of the length of two transverse fingers. At the fourth Moneth, it is larger then the Egge of an Ostrich. And thus much I have diligently observed in Abortions, having made several dissections of them. And in this manner do Hinds and Does, though for a whole moneth together (and more) after their Rutting time, no sensible thing at all be con∣tained
in their uterus, produce by a kinde of Con∣tagion, these conceptions and rudiments in the shape of eggs, (as Plants bring forth their seed, and Trees their fruit) which about the eighteenth or one and twentieth day of November (at the farthest) are compleat; and that sometimes in the Right Horn, and sometimes in the Left, and at other times in both: having in them a certain dissolved sub∣stance, transparent, & crystalline (which we call the Colliquamentum, or Eye in the Hen-egg) which is contained in a proper thin orbicular coat of their own, being much purer then that humour where∣in the Conception swims afterwards; in the midst whereof the sanguineous fibers, & the Punctum saliens (which is the first foundation of the future foetus) without the presence of any thing else, are clear∣ly discerned; and this is the first Genital particle. Which being constituted, not onely the Vegetative soul, but the Motive also is said to be in it, from which all the other parts of the foetus are each in their order generated, formed, disposed, and en∣dowed with life: after the same manner as we have declared the Chicken to be constituted out of the Colliquamentum of the Egg. Both these humors are in the Conceptions of all Viviparous Animals; which many men conceive to be the Excrements of the Foetus, deeming the one to be its urine, the other its sweat; when not∣withstanding they have no offensive taste at all, and are alwayes most manifest in the Conception, even before any particle of the foetus is discer∣ned. The Outward coat which embraceth both the humours, is called Chorion; the Inward, Amnium. And more then these two you can never finde; the former, involving the whole Conception, and exten∣ded
over both the Horns of the uterus; the later, swimming in the first water, and contained onely in one of the Horns, except there be a Twin-foetus; in which case, there is one in each of the Horns: as in the Gemellifical Egge there are two Colliquamen∣tums. So that where there is a double foetus, they are both contained in one and the same conception, together with their two-fold crystalline waters: (as in one and the same Egg.) If you make an in∣cision into any part of the Exteriour membrane, the more impure water will presently issue out from both the Horns; but the crystalline water, which is comprehended in the interiour membrane called Amnion, doth not flow forth with the for∣mer, unless you have peirced it also. The Vein, which is first seen within the Amnion, in the crystalline humour, takes its original from the Punctum saliens; exercising the office, and par∣taking of the nature of the Umbilical Vessels; and being by degrees enlarged, it is disseminated into other ramifications, which are scattered into the Colliquamentum: whereby it is most evident, that the nutriment is at first attracted from the Colliqua∣mentum only, wherein the Foetus swims. Having dissected the uterus, I have exposed this Punctum saliens, while it yet continued its palpi∣tation, to the view of our late dread Soveraigne; which was then so small, that without the advan∣tage of the Sun-beams obliquely illustrating it, he could not have perceived its shivering motion. The entire Colliquamentum being cast into a sil∣ver or tinn-Bason, which is full of clear warm water, doth very neatly lay open the Punctum sa∣liens to the eye. To which, in the following dayes, a certain gelly, like a litle worm, in the form of a Magot, is adjoined, (as being the first platform of
the future body) divided into two parts; of one part whereof the Trunk is constituted, & the Head of the other: in the very same manner, as hath been formerly delivered in the History of the Hen-egg. The Spine of the Back is a litle inflected in manner of a Keel; the Head is imperfectly com∣posed of three small vesicles, or litle balls, and swimming in the Crystalline water, doth dayly en∣large, and grow into shape: With this difference onely, that the Eyes are much larger, and more vi∣sible in Oviparous, then in Viviparous productions. After the six and twentieth day of November, the foetus is discerned, having his whole body almost compleat, being found without distinction, some∣times seated in the Right, and sometimes in the Left horn of the Vterus: but where there is a Twin∣foetus, there is one of them placed in each of the Horns. And at this time the Male is distinguishable from the Female by his Genital parts; which are conspicuous in a humane Embryo, so soon as ever the rough Artery doth appear. You shall finde the Male and Female sometimes in the Right, and sometimes in the Left horn, meer∣ly as it falleth out. But yet the Male is more fre∣quently discovered in the Left, and the Female in the Right horn, and this frequently in Does, which have Twins within them, and I once also observed it in an Ewe. Whence I am confirmed, that the proper constitution, or peculiar virtue of either side, doth signifie nothing to the discrimination of the Sex. Nor is the uterus the Fabricatour or former of the Foetus, no, nor the mother her self, any more then the Hen is the framer of the Chicken in the Egge whereon she sitteth. But as the Chicken is made in the Egge by an internal formative Agent,
so likewise is the foetus constituted out of this Egge of the Doe. A man would admire to see the Foetus formed and compleated in the Amnion, in so small a time after the first rise and beginning of the Blood and Punctum saliens. For about the nineteenth or twen∣tieth day of November, that Point makes his first appearance: about the one and twentieth or two and twentieth day, the litle unshapen Worme or Maggot discovers it self: but within six or seven daies after that, the Foetus is so compleat, that you may distinguish the Male from the Female, (by the Genital parts) and perceive the feet formed, and the little hoofes cleft, being then like Gelly, some∣thing inclining to yellow. So soon as ever the foetus begins to be formed and grow, the substance of the Uterus is much extenuated: contrary to the custom of it in Wo∣men, whose Womb according to the increase of the Foetus becomes thicker, and more fleshy. For in Hinds, and Does, how much the more the foetus augmenteth, so much the Hornes of the Uterus approach neerer to the shape of the Guts: and chiefly that Horne, wherein the Foetus doth reside, doth resemble a little wallet, though in its extent and capacity it exceed the other. This Egge or Conception, doth as yet on no side adhere, or grow fast to the Matrix (though the foetus is now compleat) but may bee very easily drawn away whole; as I have tried it in an Ewe, which bore a foetus in her Womb, almost the length of my Thumb. Wherefore it is most apparent, that the foetus is yet onely nourished by the White, which is shut up with it in the Conception, as it hath been observed in the Hen-egge before; for the Orifices of the Umbilical Vessels are quite obli∣terated
between the White of the Conception, and the adjacent humours with their membranes; not being any where as yet fastned to the Uterus it self, though those Veins or Vessels onely are the convoy to administer nourishment to the foetus. And as in an Egge the propagations of the Veins are first disseminated into the Colliquamentum; (as the roots of plants are into the ground) and are after∣wards communicated to the exteriour Membrane (called the Chorion) and do dispatch their bran∣ches up and down with innumerable divarications through the albugineous humour conteined in the utmost membrane, that so they may forage, and provide Aliment: so likewise in humane abortions, I have plainly discovered the vein in the Chorion; and Aristotle himself affirmed, that that coat was full Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7. of veins. If there be a single foetus, the distribution of its Umbilical vessels is extended to both the Hornes of the Womb (having litle branches disseminated through the cavity thereof) that so it may attract aliment on both sides. But if there be two (name∣ly one in each Horne) they both shoot forth their Umbilical propagations into that part onely of the Conception which borders upon their proper Horn: so that the foetus seated in the right Horne deriveth his sustenance from the right side of the conception, and he in the left from the left onely: The Gemel∣lifical conception being in all other matters also like the Gemellifical Egge. Now, about the end of November, all the parts are clear and distinct, and the foetus now appears of the magnitude of a large Beane, or a Nutmeg: the hinder part of his Head being a litle promi∣nent, as it is in a Chicken, but his Eyes are lesse. His Mouth lies gaping wide even from Ear to Ear:
for the Cheeks and Lips are last of all perfected, as being cutaneous parts. So that in all Productions (even in humane also) the slit of the Mouth is di∣lated as far as the Ears on both sides, having nei∣ther Lips nor Cheeks to abate it. And for this cause, as I conceive, many are born with cleft lips, (we call them Hare-lips, that is, having such lips as Hares, and Camels have) because in the forma∣tion of the humane foetus, the upper lips do very slowly close. I have often times cast the foetus, when it was now grown to the quantity of a fair Bean, being transparent under his coat Amnios, and swimming in his most pure alinient, into a silver bason full of the clearest water, whereby I discovered chiefly these most remarkable following things. His brain being of a litle thicker consistence then the White of an Egg, (like milk a litle coagulated) of a rude shape, lieth encompassed on every side in a mem∣brane, having as yet no scull at all. The After-brain stands up something prominent, as in a Chicken. The Cone or whole frame of the Heart looks white, and so also all the other Bowels (even the Liver it self) are white, and as it were spermatical. The Trunk of the Umbilical Vessels doth arise from the heart, and passing the gibbous part of the Liver, doth insert it self into the Trunk of the Vena Porta, or Gate Vein; and running thence a litle farther, and distinguishing it self into several propagations, it is diffused through the colliquamentum, and the coat called Chorion, by an infinite number of bran∣ches. The Sides on both hands arise from the spine, so that the Thorax or chest looks like a boat, or litle pinnace, before the Heart and Lungs are re∣tired into its circuite: just in like manner as it is in the chicken. For the Guts, Heart, and the rest
of the Bowels are very conspicuous, and seem to be litle appendixes of the body; untill at last the chest and coverture of the lower Belly are drawn o∣ver them (as the Roofe is erected upon the open roomes) and so veil and conceal them. At that time the sides as well of the Breast, as the Loines, seem to be white, mucilagineous, and of a similar constitution, excepting onely that through the in∣side of the Breast, some certain slender capillary lines do run along, and so occasion a distinction between the future Ribs, and the carnous or fleshy parts of the sides. I have also sometimes seen the Twinne-foetus in the Conceptions of Ewes, which have been about the same time whereof we now speak (and some∣times one alone) which were of the longitude of a transverse finger: their form was like that of the smallest Lizard, and their magnitude like that of a Waspe, or Worm called Eruca: the Spine of the back was bent round, so that the head did almost reach to the taile. Both of them did swim in a peculiar clear humour of their own, inclosed within the Amnion: and both were of the same magnitude, (as if they had been begotten at one and the same act of coition and conception) For though the one lay in the right, and the other in the left Horn, yet both were included in the same wallet, and in the same exteriour water: (and so consequently in the same egge, or conception.) Their mouthes were wide, but their eyes were small, and scarce discernable points; contrary to those of Birds. Their Bowels or Intrals also were not as yet inclosed within the cavity of the body, but were hanging out. Their Exteriour Membrane cal∣led Chorion, did not adhere to the Uterus, so that I could not take away the conception whole & en∣tire.
There were also in the same coat an infinite number of Umbilical propagations which had no connexion at all to the Uterus: as we have noted in Deer also, and after the same manner, as we have described them in the outward membrane of the Hen-egge. There were onely present two hu∣mours, and as many coats conteining them: where∣of the exteriour called Chorion was extended over both the Horns, and being full of a more turbid humour, did fashion or shape the egge, or concepti∣on. But the coat called Amnios, was almost invisi∣ble (like that coat of the Eye which is called Arach∣noides, or the Cobweb, being the membrane of the Crystalline humour) conteining in it a clear bright Water like Crystal, wherein this foetus of the Ewe did swim. The humour contained within the Chorion, was in proportion a hundred times more (I might say a thousand) then the other, though the Cry∣stalline humour too which is reserved in the Amnios, was in a larger quantity, then to be suspected for the Sweat of so small a foetus swimming amidst it. Nor was it of any distastful savour, or sent, but exceeding clear: and (as we have noted in Hinds and Does) resembling thinne watry milk, being tainted with no kinde of excrementitious pravity. Now in case this humour were an Excrement, it would also grow and encrease as the foetus it self doth: But I finde the matter clean contrary in the foetus of the Ewe also; for a litle before it is aned, there is scarce any portion of this humour left. Wherefore I conceive it rather to be the Ali∣ment, then the Excrement of the Foetus. The Interiour coat of the Ewes womb was imbos∣sed with an infinite number of caruncles, (as the Skie is with starres) which were of the likeness of
Crabbs eyes, as I call them, but something less; and resembling loose or hanging warts, were glan∣dulous, and white, sticking within the coats of the womb, being something hollow or excavated on that side wherewith they incline towards the Conception: (contrary to their course in Hinds and Does, in which they do extuberate to∣wards the Foetus it self) and besides all this, they did strut with blood; and their interiour superfi∣cies, as it did direct it self towards the conception, was full of black, sanguineous points. The Umbi∣lical Vessels of the Foetus were not as yet inserted into these caruncles, nor was the conception hither∣to fastened to the Uterus. As for that coat, which they talk much of, and call Allantoides, I can finde no such matter in the conceptions of Ewes; but afterwards (when the foe∣tus is now grown bigger) when the Egge or Con∣ception doth now cleave to the Uterus, and the veins are inserted into the caruncles, then is the Chorion extended farther, and in its two ends (or Appendixes as it were) a certain humour died yel∣low (you would conceive it to be an excrementi∣tious humour) is secluded, and reserved apart from the rest. As for a Humane Conception, that hardly differs any thing from an Egg, for the first moneths. For be∣fore the After-birth or Uterine cake hath been fra∣med, I have seen a white humour (like to the thin∣ner White of the Egge, and equal in magnitude to a Pigeons egge, nay sometimes to a Pheasants) encompassed in a slender membrane; wherein the Embryo, who was as long as the naile of the little finger, did appear like a small frogge: having a broad body, a wide mouth, and his armes and leggs newly shot forth, like the young buds of flowers:
he had a prominent Occiput, or After-braine, which may be rather called a little bladder annexed like an appendix to the rest of the head, as hath been mentioned in the first rudiment of the Occiput of chickens. An other humane Conception I saw (which was about fifty dayes standing) wherein was an egge, as large as an Hen-egg, or Turkey-egg. The foetus was of the longitude of a large Bean, with a very great head, which was over-looked by the Occi∣put, as by a crest; the Brain it self was in sub∣stance like Coagulated milk; and instead of a solid scull, there was a kind of Leather-membrane, which was in some parts like a gristle, distributed from the fore-head, to the Roots of the Nose. The Face appeared like a Dogs snout. Without both Ears, and Nose. Yet was the rough Artery, which descends into the Lungs, and the first rudiment of the Yard, visible. The two deaf-ears of the Heart, appeared like two black eyes. In a Woman with childe, who dyed of a Feaver, I found an Hermaphrodite Embryo of almost the same bigness. Its Privity was like that of a Cony, the labra resembling the prepuce; and the Nymphae, the Glans or Nut. Above this privity I saw the first rudiments of a Yard, to which there hung down on both Sides, instead of Testicles, the laxe or flaggy skin of the Scrotum, or Cod. Its Uterus or womb. was very litle, resembling the Uterus of an abor∣ted Lamb, or Mole, having both the Horns. And as the Glandules or Kernels, called Prostatae, were scituate neer the Yard, so also were the Testicles, which were of a discernable magnitude, placed next to those Horns. So that, according to out∣ward appearance, it did most express a Male childe, but upon inward discovery of the Parts, a Female.
The womb of the woman that bare it, was very vast, having the bladder of Urine adjoined to it (as its Appendix:) but contrariwise in the Foetus, the Bladder of Urine was large, and the Uterus looked onely like its Appendix. All these fore-mentioned humane Conceptions, like the Ewes, had a rough or wrinckled superfi∣cies outwardly, and were dawbed over with a kinde of Gelly, or glutinous substance; and at that time, there was neither any appearance of the After-burden, nor yet any union of the Conception to the matrix, nor any insertion of the Umbilical Vessels into the matrix, or womb, though they were disseminated into the superficies of the Conception. Though diverse foetus are sometimes found in the same Conception of Hindes, and Does, (as divers Chickens in the same white of a gemellifical Egg) as it also happeneth in Ewes, she-Goats, and other cloven footed creatures: yet in Bitches, Conies, Sowes, and other Viviparous and Multiparous Ani∣mals, the matter is clean otherwise; for every foe∣tus in them doth challenge two several humors, and two distinct coats. In Bitches there are several Knots through the whole cavity of the Horns of their uterus, in which so many several humors are contained, and in every one of them a several Foetus. In the Hare, and Cony which are Does, you may perceive many round gobbets or balls (such as the eggs of Serpents are) like bracelets made of several Amber beads. The Hares Conception is exceeding like an Acorn, and the After-burden covereth it in manner of a Cup; and the Humours contained in the membranes hang down like litle Acorns.
Of the manner how the Conception of Hindes, and Does, is found to be in the month of De∣cember. EXER. LXX. IN the beginning of December, the Foetus is now more grown and perfect, being of a fingers length. The Heart, and other Bowels, together with the Guts (all which were formerly exposed to publick view) are retreated into the hollow of the body; so that you can neither discern them, nor the motion of the Heart, without dissection. The Conception or Egge, by the mediation of the five Caruncles in each Horn, (formerly spoken of) is in five several places adjoined and fastned to the Uterus, yet not so firmly neither, but that a small force will disjoin them again. Which being done, you shal discern the different print of the Caruncles in the outward superficies of the Chorion, by which Caruncles it was united to the Uterus, the impression which they leave behinde them being rugged and viscous, as if by that glew or paste, the said adhe∣sion or conjunction had been effected. And thus have we revealed the Nature and use of these Ca∣runcles; for they which before (like Warts or Mushroms) were bred at the sides of the Uterus, do now, being knit to the conception, supply the place and office of an After-burden, or Uterine Cake (as it is in Women) namely, they are instead of so many nipples from which the foetus by the assistance of his
Umbilical Vessels doth derive to himself such Ali∣ment as his Mother affords him: as shall appear hereafter. The Magnitude and capacity of the Vterus (under which name we understand the Hornes of the Vte∣rus; namely the places of conception) do enlarge according to the growth of the foetus, but yet so, that, that Horn wherein the foetus setleth his abode, is larger then the other. Their conception or egge is one onely; whether they produce a single, or diverse Foetus: and that single conception is dilated over both the Horns; so that it looks like a brace of puddings, or rather like one onely, and that tied in the middle, as hath been formerly said: for passing along slender, and round, from the farthest part of the Horne on one side, it doth by degrees enlarge, and so goeth on to that common place, which in a Woman we call the Womb and Matrix or Mother; (because a Wo∣man in that part is made a Mother, by conceiving and fostering a foetus in it) where it is streightned as if it passed through an Isthmus; and being a∣gain dilated, as it arriveth at the other Horn, it proceedeth still on to the farthest extremity there∣of likewise; where growing less, and pointed (as it did at the beginning) it erects its non Vltra, and proceeds no farther. Therefore these kind of con∣ceptions, if they be drawn away entire, do resem∣ble a wallet whose both ends are full of Water: and thence also that coat chorion, is likewise called Al∣lantoides; because the conceptions of such Animals resemble a Gut blown up, or stuffed pudding, which is tied fast in the midst. If you dissect an Embryo at this time, you shall discern all the interiour parts distinct, and com∣pleat: but chiefly the Stomack, the Heart, and
Kidnies, and the Lungs; which are also divided into their Lobes, and look as they had blood in them, having gained their just form. But the com∣plexion of these Lungs is more ruddy, then of those which have at any time breathed; because the Lungs stretched and dilated by the Air, put on a whiter colour. And by this observation of the different complexion, you may discover whether a Mother brought her Childe alive or dead into the world; for instantly after inspiration the Lungs change colour: which colour remains, though the foetus dye immediatly after. In a Female foetus, the Testicles (improperly so called) are seated neer the Kidnies, in the hanging or loose ligament of the uterus, or womb, at the ends or extremities of the Horns on both sides; and are for their proportion larger in a foetus, then in a grown body, and look white, like the carun∣cles. In the Stomack of the Foetus, there is found a watery substance, (not unlike that wherein he (swims) but something more troubled, and less transparent: like to that milk which is dreined out of Womens breasts, that are about four or five moneths gone, or like white Posset as we call it. In the upper Guts there is store of chyle made of the fore-said substance now concocted. But in the Colon or colick Gut there do begin to appear yel∣low excrements, and shaped. But as for the Urachus (or Perforation of the Navel of the foetus, by which it is imagined to dis∣charge the urine into the coat called Allantoides) I finde no such matter; nor any difference at all between the coat Allantoides (which is supposed to contain the urine) and the Chorion; nor do I dis∣cover any urine in the After-birth, but onely in the
Bladder, and in that, good store: the Bladder it self, being something Oblong, is scituate between the Umbilical Arteries, which arise from the bran∣ches of the descending Trunk of the Great Arte∣rie. The Liver is rude, and almost inform or un∣shapen, as if it were something besides Natures in∣tention, it looks onely like a ruddy affusion of Blood. The Brain being now somewhat redu∣ced into shape, is comprehended in a thick mem∣brane. The Eyes lie concealed under the lids; and those lids are so starched together, and shut so fast (as it is with puppies newly whelped) that I had much ado to disjoin them, and open the eyes. The Breast-bone and Ribs do now harden by degrees: and the complexion of the Muscles shifts from white, to be blood coloured. Having made very many several dissections for the whole course of this Moneth, I am become more assured, that the caruncles before mentioned, do exercise the office of an After-birth or Uterine cake; which I now discerned to be red and swelled, and about the bigness of a Wall-nut. The Conce∣ption, which, as we said, did before stick only to the caruncles by the help of the glutinous sub∣stance, doth now dispatch the litle branches of the Umbilical Vessels into the very body of the carun∣cles (as Plants work in their Roots into the earth) by which it is fastened, and grows to the Womb. About the end of December I have feen the foetus being then about a span long, lustily bestirring himself, and kicking; opening his mouth and jawes, and also shutting them again. His hear was now placed in its purse, or pericardium, and the Breast being dissected, it was very discernable making apparent and forcible Palpitations; and
yet the Ventricles of the Heart were Vniforme, and of equal magnitude, and did consist of equal height, or of a double cone: the thickness also of their sides was equal. Where also I clearly discerned the deaf ears of the Heart, which at this time were full of blood, like two pretty large bladders, to continue and persist in their motion for a little space, even when the Heart it self had resigned it up. All the Bowels, which were indeed perfect be∣fore, are now larger and more conspicuous. The Scull is partly cartilagineous, and partly bony. The Hoofs are yellowish, flexile, and soft (just as the Hoofs of grown Deere are, being mollified in see∣thing water) the Caruncles, now very great, (as large Mushroomes) are spred over the whole cavi∣ty of the Uterus, and do evidently supply the use of an After-birth: for several propagations and those large ones too, are from the Umbilical Ves∣sels disseminated into them, that so they may derive aliment to the foetus: in like manner as in those that are already in the world, the chyle is transported by the Meseraick branches into the Gate vain of the Liver. In whatsoever Conception of this kind, there is but one onely foetus, there the Umbilical vessels are conveied to all the caruncles: (as well of the op∣posite, as the same side) but in that conception where there is a double foetus, there the ramificati∣ons of the Vmbilical vessels relating to each foetus, are not propagated beyond the caruncles of the same side wherein it resideth. The lesser Vmbilical veins as they respect the foe∣tus, do where they unite and join together deter∣mine and end in other greater Veins; and those again passing farther on, and uniting, do conclude
in Veins yet greater then themselves, till at the last they constitute two truncks, which being con∣joined, do convey Blood into the Hollow, and Gate Vein. But the Vmbilical Arteries (arising from the branches of the descending Trunk of the great Artery.) are two, and those very small ones, and such as were it not for their pulse, could scarce be discerned, which being carried along, to the capacity or superficies of the conception) where the caruncles or After-birth meet the propagations of the Veins) do first diminish or lessen into capillary threads, and at last become quite invisible, and are clean expunged. As in the Vterus the Extremities of the Vmbilical vessels are terminated into the caruncles, so like∣wise out of the Vterus, the Vterine vessels (which are many, and large) carrying blood from the Mother to the Womb (by the conduct of the suspen∣sory ligaments) do terminate outwardly in those very caruncles. We are also to take notice, that the Interiour vessels, are all of them Veins, for the most part: but the Exteriour are for the most the propagations of Arteries. In the Womans After∣burden, if you mind it well, presently after she is delivered, are many more Arteries then Veines, and also larger too, which are disseminated with almost innumerable propagations up and down, even to its utmost superficies. As also in the fun∣gous Parenchyma, or Affusion of the Spleen, which is not unlike it, the number of the Arteries exceed∣eth that of the Veins. The exteriour Vterine vessels do, as I say, tend towards the Matrix, and towards the Testicles, which are seated in the suspensory ligament; as some men imagine. In the Gibbous or convex part of the caruncles,
which respect the Matrix, I have observed a won∣derful contrivance in Nature: For in diverse of the Cavities, and Cotyledones, or Orifices of the vessels gaping outwards, I found a white mucila∣ginous substance, which did fill up the whole body of the caruncle, (as the Honey stuffs up the Honey-comb) and was of a complexion, consistence, and tast much like the White of an Egge. But if you pluck a sunder the conception from the caruncles, you shall presently descry so many spriggs, or ca∣pillary branches of the Vmbilical vessels (which look like long threads or filaments) to be drawn out also from every one of the Cotyledones, and Combs as it were, and out of their mucous substance: just as Herbs plucked up from the Earth, have their Roots trailing after them. By which it is evident, that the Extremities of the Vmbilical vessels, are no way conjoined to the Vterine vessels by an Anastomôsis; nor do extract blood from them, but are terminated in that white mucilaginous matter, and are quite obliterated in it, attracting nourishment from it; after the self same manner, as they did formerly draw Aliment from the white moisture or sap, which was conclu∣ded within the membranes of the conception. And as the chicken in the Hen-egge is susteined by the White attracted by its Vmbilical vessels; so the Conception also of Hinds and Does, is nourished with a white substance like to that, which is stored up in these litle Cells, and not with blood. Wherefore these Caruncles may be justly sti∣led the Vterine cakes, or dugs: that is to say, Con∣venient and proportionate Organs or Instruments designed for the concocting of that Albuginous Aliment, and for preparing it for the attraction of the Veins. And therefore those Viviparous A∣nimals
which have not these Caruncles or After∣birth; (as the Mare, and the Sow have none) their foetus is susteined even till the hour of their birth, with the humours which are conteined in the Conception onely; and their conception doth no where adhere or grow to the Vterus. It is therefore manifest in those, and also in these sorts or species of Viviparous Animals, (and perhaps in all other whatsoever;) that the Embryo is in no other manner susteined in the Vterus, then the chicken in the Egge; but out of the same Nu∣tritive substance, and of like kind to the Aliment in the White of an Egge. For as in an Egge, the extremities of the Vmbilical vessels are terminated in the White and Yolk: so likewise in Hinds and Does, and other Animals, that are furnished with these Caruncles, the extremity of the Orifices of the Vmbilical vessels are opened into, & terminated in the humour which is conteined in the Concep∣tion; and in that white substance, which is found in those Orifices or Cotyledones. And this truth is hence also asserted, in that the extremities of the threads or filaments of the Vm∣bilical vessels, when they are drawn out of that mucous or white substance, are all of them white likewise; which is a forcible argument they do onely imbibe this gelly or mucilage, and not blood. And any man may prove the same Experiment in an Egge also, if he desire it. The After-burden, or Vterine cake of a Woman, is in its gibbous part, wherewith it respects the Womb, uneven, & hilly, by reason of several tumors or mushroom-like substances; and seems by their mediation to grow to the Womb. As if it were not fastned to the womb in every part, but onely in those places, where the vessels disseminated into
it do extract Aliment, and in which for that cause, the extremities of the vessels are broken off. Now whether those extremities or terminations of the vessels do suck blood from the Womb, or ra∣ther some kind of concocted substance like to the White of an Egge, such as we perceive plainly in Hinds, and Does, I am not yet satisfied. Lastly, (that the truth in hand may be certainly confirmed) if you squeeze those caruncles between your fingers; you may easily Milk as much of that Nutritive juice as a spoon can contein, out of any one of those Caruncles; (as out of a Nipple) without any appearance of blood at all; which blood you shall never squeez from them though you force them never so much. Moreover, the ca∣runcle thus milked & drained, doth contract it self, and flag, like to a sponge that is squeezed, and ap∣pears to be bored through with several perforati∣ons. So that by all signs and tokens it appears that those Caruncles are Ubera Vterina, the Breasts or Vdders of the Uterus, or the receptacles and store-houses of that Nutritive white substance. At the end of December, these Caruncles do less firmly cleave to the Vterus, then they did before, and are with case divided from it. And by how much the foetus doth improve, and grow neerer to the birth, so much the easier do those caruncles disjoin from the Womb: and in the end (as ripe fruit falls off from the Tree) they depart from the Vterus of their own accord, as being things which relate to the conception. And when they are parted from the Womb, you may, in the impressions which they leave behind them, perceive the points or terminations of the Arteries which pass on towards them, breathing forth blood. But if you force the conception from
the caruncles, no blood doth issue out from the im∣pressions which they leave behind them: though it do seem more consonant to reason, that blood should issue out of the caruncles, then of the con∣ception upon their divorce. For since the caruncles are embroidered by several propagations of Arteries derived from the Vterus; and are commonly con∣ceived to convey blood for the nutriment of the Foe∣tus, they ought in consequence to abound with plenty of Blood. And yet though you milk or com∣press them, they effund no blood at all; because they are not ful of blood, but of this white substance; nor do they seem to be instruments instituted for the concoction of the former, but Promptuaries, or Treasuries of the latter. By which it is apparent, that the foetus in the Womb, is not susteined by the Mothers blood, but by this white substance fitly pre∣pared. And perhaps even grown bodies are not nourished by blood, but something which runs in the blood, is their common and last Aliment: as shall perhaps be elsewhere discovered in our Phy∣siological Treatise, and in the proper disceptation relating to the blood. I do much question the truth of that place of Hippocrates, where he saith: Those Animals whose L. de nat. Mul. de morb. vulg. & Sect. 5. & aphor. 45. Acetabula or Orifices of their Vterine vessels are full of a mucous substance, do suffer Abortment. For that substance is not an Excrement, and cause of Aborti∣on, but an Aliment and first cause of life. But Hippocrates perhaps meant some other Acetabula: for in a Woman they are not found, nor hath her After-birth any such substance as this to be sensi∣bly perceived in any of its cavities. The Later Physitians, according to the opinion of the Arabians, do phansie three several Nutri∣tive Humours; namely, Rorem, the dewy sub∣stance,
Gluten, the glutinous substance, and Cam∣bium, the substance which is immediately trans∣formed into the essence of the parts: and these Fernelius calls succos Nutritios, the alible juices; as conceiving, that the Parts of our bodies are not immediatly nourished by the Blood, as its last ali∣ment, but by these secundary humours: by the first whereof, as by a kind of Dew, all the smallest par∣ticles of the body and parts thereof, are sprinckled and bedewed; which humour being thickned by a farther concoction, and sticking more firmly to the Parts, is now called Gluten, which at last being altered and assimilated by the power and virtue of the Parts, is called Cambium. We may, according to these Mens conceit, call that substance which we finde in the Acetabula, or Orifices of the vessels, the Gluten, or Nutritive white, and say that it is (as being the last Aliment which is designed to all the several parts of the foetus) proportionable to the White or Yolk of the Egge. For as we said ere-while, with Aristotle, that the Yolk is proportionable to milk: so we likewise conceive it consonant to reason, to affirm, that this substance, which is contained in the Cotyledo∣nes, or Acetabula of the Uterine cake, doth supply the office of milk to the foetus, so long as it conti∣nues in the womb: and consequently, that the Ca∣runcles are as it were Ubera interna, internal Dugs, and that the alible juice is (after the delivery) transported into the Breasts, and there made milk; that so the foetus may enjoy the same nutriment after he is born, wherewith he was fed when he continued in the womb. And therefore this onely difference is between the party-coloured Eggs of Oviparous Animals (which are compounded of the Yolk and White) and the Eggs or Conceptions of
Viviparous Animals, that in the former, the Yolk (which is their secundary sustenance) is provided for them within the Egg, and presently upon their Exclusion, is shut up within the belly of the Chic∣ken, as being reserved there for their support; but in the latter, this nutritive substance is before the Birth preserved in the Acetabula, and after the Birth transmitted to the Breasts or Udder. So that the Pullus is supplied with a kinde of milke, which is concluded in it self; but the Viviparous foetus, sucks the same from the duggs of the Dam. When December is ended, seeing that in the sub∣sequent moneths of January, February, &c. there is nothing new or notable doth befall the foetus, but all its accessions have been observed already, (save onely the Hair, Teeth, Horns, and the like) only the parts formerly described seem to have attained a larger Augmentation, litle or nothing respecting the business of Generation, we conceive it useless to discourse any more of them at pre∣sent. But as to the Conceptions of Ewes, I have disse∣cted divers of them about this time, which (like those of Does) did also resemble the figure of a Wallet, or double-pudding, being extended over both the Horns of the Womb. In some of these Conceptions I found two foetus; in other, one on∣ly, and that void of all kinde of wool, with its eyes so congealed and fixed together, that I could not open the lids, and yet the hoofs were already made. Where there were two foetus, they lay in several Horns of the Uterus, and that promiscu∣ously, without any order at all observed, the male being sometimes in the left, and the female in the right Horn, and sometimes clean contrary: but both were still encompassed in the same common
Conception, and concluded in the same exteriour membrane called Chorion; whose Extremities or ends on both Sides towards the termination of the Horns, were stained as it were by a kinde of cholerical excrement, and did seem to have some turbid and excrementitious matter within them. The Caruncles, or litle Cakes, were diverse, and of a different magnitude, and of a distinct figure from the caruncles of Hinds and Does: for in Ewes, there is a kind of round mushroom with the stalk broken off, contained between the Coats of the Uterus, whose gibbous Part lieth towards the U∣terus; (as it is also in the Conceptions of Cowes) but the concave (which is smooth) towards the foetus: and likewise larger Branches or Vessels are derived to this concave part, as it also happens to the interiour part of a Womans After-burden. The Propagations of the Umbilical Vessels being annexed to the caruncles, do grow so firmly to them, that when I endeavoured to divide them, the gibbous part would be sooner broken off from the interiour coat of the Womb, then recede from the Conception: contrary to their custom in Hinds and Does, whose membrane called Chorion, is easily separated from the Cotylidones of the ca∣runcles; and the convexe side of the caruncles, which adhereth to the Conception, may be divided from it; but the Concave part, or root rather, or stalk, sticketh fast to the Uterus. But in other matters, the office is alike in all, and they have the like A∣cetabula, and an Albugineous gelly may in like man∣ner be milked out of them, as out of these carun∣cles of Cowes also. Where there is but one single foetus in a Conce∣ption, there that foetus doth transmit his Umbili∣cal Vessels to all the caruncles of both the Horns of
the womb, that so he may derive nutriment from both. But that Horn wherein the foetus himself (swimming in the crystal water which lies within the coat called Amnion) doth reside, is larger then the other. But where there are two foetus in one and the same Conception, there each of them are confined to their proper caruncles, and do trans∣mit their Umbilical Vessels into their own proper Horn only, and receive their Nutriment from thence. If it be a Male foetus, the Testicles are large (for it's time) hanging without in the Scrotum. If an Ewe-lamb, the Udder hanging in the same place, hath litle Tets or Nipples, as Womens Breasts. In the twofold stomack of the foetus (namely, the Maw and the Dew-lap) there appeared a crystal water like to that where he swam; for they did agree both in colour, sent, taste, and consistence: there was also in the upper Guts a substance like to chyle; in the lower, a green excrement, and dry dung, such as they use to eject when they graze: the Liver was something large, and the Bladder of Gall of an oblong figure, and in some of them it was quite empty. But as to the order of the production of the Parts, we have still found the same to be observed in all Vi∣viparous Embryo's whatsoever, as Experience hath revealed to us in that of the Egge, the Hinde, and the Doe.
Of the Innate Heat. EXER. LXXI. BEcause there is much talk of the Calidum In∣natum, or Innate Heat, we do intend in this place (by way of second course, or addition) to discourse a while concerning both it, and the Hu∣midum Primigenium, the Radical or Primigenial moisture; and that the rather, because I perceive many men to please themselves much with those two Notions, when as (according to my judge∣ment) they do not understand their meaning. The truth is, there is no need at all to enquire after any kinde of spirit distinct from the Blood it self, or to introduce any forraign heat, or invoke the Dei∣ties to appear in the fable, and so trim up Philoso∣phie with vain opinions and fictions; for what we commonly derive from the Starres, is bred and born at home, and within us. For the Blood alone is the true Galidum Innatum, or first-born Animal heat: as it is made apparent by our observations concerning the Generation of Animals; (especially of the Chicken out of the Egge) and therefore to multiply Entities, is meerly frivolous. For, in∣deed, there is nothing either before, or more ex∣cellent in the Animal body, then Blood; nor are those spirits which some men distinguish from Blood, any where to be found a part from the blood; and the Blood it self, without spirit and heat, is no longer to be called Blood, but Gore. The Blood, De part. an. l. 2 c. 3. saith Aristotle, is in a manner hot, and in such a man∣ner, as it hath the essence of Blood in being hot just as if we should express Hot water under one word: but
yet being considered as the subject of Heat, and such a substance, as when it is in being, is Blood, so it is not hot: for it is in some respect hot per se, or essentially, & in some respect it is not hot per se; for Heat is of its essence, as Whiteness is of the essence of a white man: but for asmuch as it is blood, in relation to Action or Passion, so it is not calidus per se, or essentially hot. We Physitians call that Spiritus, a Spirit, which Hippocrates called Impetum faciens, that is, what∣soever doth attempt any thing proprio conamine, by its own proper endeavour, and doth set upon any action, or excite any motion with agility and ve∣hemence: and under that capacity, the spirits of Wine, or of Vitriol, are called spirits. And here∣upon Physitians count as many spirits, as principal parts, or operations; namely, Animal, Vital, Natu∣ral, Visory, Auditory, Concoctive, Generative, Im∣planted, Influent Spirits, &c. But the Blood (the primogenit and principal part of the Body) is furnish∣ed with all these respective qualities, and endow∣ed with active power beyond all other parts of the body, and doth therefore deserve the name of a spirit . Scaliger, Fernelius, & others, having not through∣ly considered the excellent endowments implant∣ed in the Blood, have phansied other Aerial or Ae∣therial spirits, composed of an Aetherial and Ele∣mentary substance, to be a more excellent and di∣viner Innate heat then blood; which they conceited to be the most immediate instrument of the Soul, most proportionable to all its operations: ground∣ing their opinion upon this opinion; namely, that the Blood (as being a substance compounded out of the Elements only) cannot perform any action be∣yond the sphere or activity of the Elements, and such bodies as are framed out of them. Hereupon
they feigned a distinct spirit, and innate heat, which is of a celestial extract; namely, a most simple, most subtle, most thin, swift, lucid, and aetherial substance, partaking of a fift essence. But yet they have no where demonstrated that there is any such substance, or that it doth act beyond the power of the Elements, or execute greater things then the Blood alone is able to accomplish. But we, who examine the nature of things according to sense, have never discovered any such substance. Nor are there in the Body any receptacles design∣ed to the conservation, or generation of such matters, and they themselves also have not assign∣ed any. Feruelius, indeed, saith, That whosoever hath not yet attained to the knowledge of the substance and condition of the Innate Heat, must first consider the structure of our bodies, and then address himself to the arteries which are seated in the cavity of the Heart, and to the Ventricles of the Braine; which when he shall discover void and empty, and without any hu∣mour contained therein, yet can be not imagine that such worthy matters are made by Nature rashly, and to no use: and upon this consideration, I conceive, he will presently conclude, that while the Animal was a∣live, they were replenished by some thin Aerial sub∣stance, which when the animal Soul departed, being exceeding light, did insensibly vanish. Now, to support this substance, the faculty of Inspiration is bestowed upon us, which doth not onely coole the body (for that might be derived to us by other meanes) but also ad∣minister a kinde of nourishment. But we affirm, that (so long as the Animal is alive) the Arteries & Ven∣tricles of the Heart, are filled with blood; reputing the Ventricles of the Brain, to be too mean instru∣ments for so noble a work, conceiving them rather allotted to the reception of excrements. For, what
shall we say of those several Animals, whose Brain hath no Ventricles at all? And though we should admit, that a kinde of Aire or vapour may be there found (because Nature doth decline a vacuity) yet that that substance is of a celestial extract, and heir apparent to such excellent performances, hath no semblance of truth at all. But that which we most admire, is, How this so exquisite, so divine a Spi∣rit, should be sustained and fed by our common elementary aire? especially, since themselves assure us, that none of the Elements can perform any thing beyond their own abilities. These men do likewise confess, that the spirit is in continual declension, and quickly dissipa∣ted, and corrupted, and that it could not subsist one moment of time, were it not repaired by the plentiful accession of outward aliment; and that therefore like the Primum Vivens, the first particle inspired with life, it must continually be fed. And now what need of this forraign guest, this Inno∣mate Spirit, or etherial heat? Since the blood is of ability to execute whatsoever is attributed there∣unto; and since these spirits cannot recede from the blood, (without their dissolution) Nay they do not move any whither, or insinuate themselves into any part (as distinct bodies) without the company of the blood. For whether you con∣ceive them to be framed, nourished, and increased out of the thinner part of the blood, (as some ima∣gine) or out of the primigenial moisture (as others) yet all confess that they are no where to be found out of the blood, but that they continually cleave to the blood, as to their support (as the flame clea∣veth to the oyle in the lamp.) And therefore their tenuity, subtlety, and mobility, &c. are of no more use then the blood, whose inseparable companions
they are. So that the blood is sufficient, to become the proportionate and immediate instrument of the Soul; because it is every where present, and doth fly to and fro with an admirable agility. Nor are there any other bodies, or spirital incorpore∣al qualities, or any diviner heat to be allowed of, (as lux & lumen, the Light, and Shine) as Caesar Dictato. 7. Cremoninus (a man excellently versed in Aristotles Philosophy) doth solidly contend against Albertus. If these men pretend, that these spirits do reside in the primigenial moisture, as in the last Aliment, and from thence insinuate themselfs into the whole body, thereby to nourish all the parts; they then conclude upon an impossibility, namely that the Calidum Innatum the Innate Heat, which is the primigenial part of the body (and stands it self in need of sustenance) doth nourish the whole body. For upon this account, the same thing is both the thing that is nourished, & also the thing by which it is nourished; and the self same substance, under the same respect, should both feed it self, and be fed also, which is indeed impossible: for in pro∣bability the thing which doth feed, and the thing which is fed, are not so much as mixed together: for miscible things must be of equal power, and operate one upon the other. And Aristotles posi∣tion is, Ubi nutritio, ibi nulla mistio est, Where there is Nutrition, there is no Mistion. For where∣soever Nutrition is, there the Aliment is one thing, and the thing nourished another; and a necessity of the transmutation of the one into the other. But whereas they conceive that the Spirits, and the last or primigenial Aliment, or some other thing what ever it be in an Animal, can (more then the blood) operate above the power of the Elements; they seem not to understand what it is to operate
above the power of the Elements: nor do they rightly interpret that place of Aristotle, where he De gen. an. l. 2. c. 3. saith: Every vertue or faculty of the Soul, seemeth to partake of another substance, and that more divine then those substances which are called Elements. And likewise where he saith, There is a certain thing in the seed of all things, causing them to be fruitful, which thing is called heat, which is not fire, nor no such fa∣culty, but a spirit which is conteined in the seed and frothy body, and the nature which is in that spirit is answerable in proportion to the Element of the Stars For fire doth not generate any Animal, nor doth any thing seem to be constituted by thick, moist, or dry quali∣ties. But the heat of the Sun, and of Animals, not that onely which is conteined in the seed, but also whatsoe∣ver excrement there be, though of a different nature yet even that also hath a vital principle. Wherefor it appeareth by what hath been said, that the hea conteined in Animals, neither is it self fire, nor doth take its original from fire. For I also do affirm the same of the Innate Heat, and of Blood, namely that they are not Fire, neither do they take their ori∣ginal from fire, but do partake of a different, and more divine substance then fire is, and therefore do not act by any elementary faculty; but as in the seed there is something which doth make it fruit∣ful, and exceeds the vertues or powers of the Ele∣ments in constituting an Animal body; namely the spirit and the nature which is in that spirit, an∣swerable in proportion to the element or substance of the Stars. So likewise in the Blood, there is a spirit or vir∣tue, which doth act above the power of Elements (most conspicuous in the nutrition or preservation of each particular part) and also a nature, nay a soul in that spirit and blood answerable in proporti∣on
to the Element of the Stars. And lastly, it is most evident, and my observations do plainly shew it, that there is a Heat in the Blood of Animals (whilest life continueth) which is neither fire, nor doth derive its original from fire. But for the clearer illustration of these matters, give us leave to digress a while from our purpose, and declare briefly, what a spirit is, and what it is to act above the power of Elements, and likewise what is meant by these words, namely, to partake of a different body, and that more divine, then those bodies which are called Elements: as likewise what is that nature in that spirit which is answerable in pro∣portion to the element or substance of the Stars. What A Spirit, and Vital principle is, we have partly spoken already, and shall now handle something more largely. There are three several (simple) bodies, which do chiefly seem to challenge the name, or function at least of a spirit; namely, the Fire, the Aire, and the Water; and every one of these doth seem to partake of a life, or other body, by reason of their perpetual motion and flux; (I mean) the Flame, the Wind, and the Floud. The Flame is the Flux, or Stream of Fire, the Wind of Aire, and the Flood of Water. Flame like an Animal, doth move it self, nourish, and increase it self, and is an Embleme of humane life. And therefore it is much used in divine Ceremonies: and was reli∣giously kept (as a sacred thing) in the Temples dedicated to Apollo, and Vesta, by Virgins; and a∣mongst the Persians, and diverse other Nations, it was from all Antiquity honoured with divine wor∣ship. As if God were more visible in Fire, and did converse with us, (as heretofore with Moses) out of the Fire. The Air also seems to merit the name of a spirit too, for a spirit is called spiritus a
spirando, from breathing; and Aristotle confesseth in plain tearms, that there is a kind of life and death of Winds. And lastly, the Water of the Flood De gen. an. l. 4. c. ult. or River, is called Viva, living Water. Those three bodies therefore (in as much as they enjoy a kind of life) do seem to operate above the power of E∣lements, and so partake of a diviner body or sub∣stance, and hereupon were by the Heathen ranked amongst the gods, who conceived that whatsoe∣ver did perform any eminent effects, which did surpose the naked abilities of the Elements, those effects did proceed from some diviner Agent. As if it were the same thing, to act above the power of the Elements, and to partake of a more divine essence, which did not deduce it selfe from the Elements. Thus in like manner the Blood doth act above the Power of the Elements, when now being the Primogenite part, and Innate Heat (as it is in the Seed, and in the Spirit) it doth constitute the o∣ther parts in order; and this with an eminent pro∣vidence and understanding, acting in order to a certain end, as if it did exercise a kind of Ratioci∣nation or discourse. For it doth not these offices as as it is Elementary, and deriveth its original from Fire, but in as much as it is made the Primigenial Heat, and most immediate and convenient instru∣ment of life it self, by being impowred by the Plastical virtue, and function of the Vegetative soul , the Blood is the Vege∣tal part of Man, saith Suidas, which is true also of all other Animals. And Virgil seemeth to have intended as much, where he saith:
—Unâ eâdem{que} viâ sanguis{que} Animus{que} sequuntur: Both Soul and Blood Aenead. 10. Stream in one Flood. The Blood therefore is a Spirit, in regard of its excellent power and virtue; and also celestial, because the Soul is an Inne-mate in that spirit, which Soul is of a nature answerable in proportion to the E∣lement of the Stars; that is, something which beareth an Analogy to the Heavens, as being the Instrument and Deputy of the Heavens. And so in this manner, all natural bodies fall under a double consideration; namely, as they are considered, in their private capacity, conclu∣ded within the bounds of their own proper nature; or else, as they are the Instruments of a nobler Agent, and superiour power. For being considered in their own proper abilities, it is perhaps no question, but that being all subject to generation and corrup∣tion; they do derive their original from the Ele∣ments, and act according to their rule: but being considered as they are the Instruments of a more worthy Agent, and regulated thereby, they do not now act of themselves, but by the guidance of an∣other; and thereupon seem to participate of ano∣ther more divine Essence, and so exceed the power of the Elements. So likewise the heat of the blood is an animal heat, inasmuch as it is guided in its operations by the soul; and also a Celestial heat, as being subservient to the Heavens; and lastly, a Divine heat, in that it is the Instrument of Almighty God: as we have formerly said, where we also did demonstrate, that the Male and Female, are the Instruments of the Sun, the Heavens, and of God himself, as being subservient to the generation of Animals.
The Inferiour World, according to Aristotle, is so continuous to the Superiour Orbes, that all its motions and mutations do seem to borrow their original, and regulation from them. And truly in this World (which the Greeks call , from the beauty of its order) the inferiour and corruptible things are subservient to the superior and incorruptible: and yet they all are obedient to the will of the Almighty and Eternal Creator. They therefore who conceive that in a body compounded of the Elements, it cannot act beyond the power of the Elements; except it do also parti∣cipate of another more divine body; and upon that ground, do suppose those Spirits whereof they treat, to be constituted partly out of the Ele∣ments, and partly out of a certain Aetherial and Ce∣lestial substance, do seem to have built their rea∣sons upon a very shallow foundation. For you can hardly finde out any Elementary body, which doth not in its actions surpass its own proper power. Not to seek farre for an instance, which is every where obvious; the Aire and the Water, while they carry ships to the farthest Indies, and round the world; (and many times also into contrary parts) while they Grinde, Bake, Sift, drain deep Wells, cut Timber in sunder, kindle fires, bear up some things, and overwhelm others, and perform many other innumerable and won∣derfull offices, do they not seem to act above the power of Elements? So also Fire; how many, and how strange employments doth it undergo? viz. in the Kitchen, and also in the Shops of such as deal in Mettles, and in the Chymists furnace, by sub∣ation, fusion, concoction, corruption, coagulation, and infinite other uses. What shall we say of it, when Iron it self is produced by its assistance,
—quod terram domat, & quaetit oppida bello? Which tills the Field, And makes Towns yeild. When the Load-stone (to which Thales did there∣fore ascribe a Soul) draws Iron unto it, and that Mettle which subdueth all opposers, (as Pliny speak∣eth) L. 36. c. 16. pursueth after I know not what vanity; and the Needle also being only touched by this Loadstone, doth still direct it self towards the Poles of the world. When our Clocks do faithfully strike all the houres both of Day and Night, do they not seem to partake of another Body, (besides the Elements) and that more divine then the Elements? Since then such excellent Operations are produced by the dominion and sway of Art; which operations do farre exceed the power of the Materials them∣selves; what shall we then think may be produ∣ced by the prescript and regiment of Nature, whom Art doth onely imitate? And if they effect such wonderfull things in obedience to Men, what performances may we expect from them, when they are instruments in the hands of God him∣self. In short therefore, this distinction is necessary, namely, that no Primary or first Agent, doth act any thing beyond its own power: but every In∣strumental Agent, doth exceed its own power; for it acts not onely by its own power, but also by the virtue of the superiour efficient. They therefore which deny such eminent en∣dowments to the blood, and flye up to Heaven to fetch down I know not what Spirits, to whom they may ascribe those divine operations: they do not know, or at least do not consider, that the work of Generation (and of Nutrition also, which is indeed a Species of Generation) for whose sake
they attribute such notable prerogatives to those Spirits, doth much exceed the power of those spi∣rits themselvs: & not of those spirits only, but even of the Vegetal Soul, nay of the Sensitive, & in a word, of the Rational soul her self, and not the power only, but the very apprehension of the Rational soul; for the Nature and Order of Generation, is truly admi∣rable and divine, beyond the comprehension and grasp of our thoughts, or understanding. That it may therefore more clearly appear, that those eminent attributes which learned men bestow upon the Spirits, and the Innate Heat, do belong to the blood alone; These few following considerations do offer themselves, over and a∣bove those things, which are wonderfully evident in an Egge (before any rudiment of the Chicken appear) and also in a perfect and adult Foetus. Namely, that the blood being considered absolute∣ly in it self out of the Veins, as it is an elementa∣ry substance, and composed of several parts (nam∣ly, of serous, thin, crass, and concrete parts) is called Cruor, Gore, and doth possess a few onely, and those obscure abilities. But being in the veins, as it is a part of the body, and that also an Ani∣mate, and Genital part, and the Immediate Instru∣ment, and primary seat of the soul: and also as it seemeth to partake of another more divine body, and is inspired with a divine animal heat; it is then endowed with excellent abilities, and an∣swerable in proportion to the element of the Stars. In as much as it is a Spirit, so it is the Fire, the Vesta, the Houshold deity, the Calidum Innatum, the Sun of the Microcosme, and Platoes Fire; not because (like ordinary fire) it shineth, burneth, and destroyeth: but because it doth conserve, nourish, and encrease it self, by a free perpetuall motion. It
doth also challenge the name of Spirit, in as much as it doth primarily, and before the other parts, abound with Radical moisture, which is the last and neerest aliment thereof, and doth dispence and provide the same sustenance for all the rest of the parts; wherewith it self is supported: namely while it doth nimbly dart it self through the whole body, and nourish, cherish, and keep alive all the parts thereof, (which it self doth first frame, and adjoin to it selfe) after the same manner as the superiour Orbes (but especially the Sun and Moon) do, by their continual motions, quicken and preserve the inferiour world. Seeing therefore that the Blood doth act above the power of the Elements, and is inspired with such notable virtues, being also the Instrument of the Omnipotent Agent; no man can worthily mag∣nifie and extol its wonderful and divine faculties. In it the soul doth first, and principally reside, and that not the Vegetative soul onely, but the Sensi∣tive and Motive also; it penetrates every part, and is every where present; and that being taken a∣way, the soul is presently gone: so that the blood seems to differ nothing from the soul; or ought at least to be counted that substance, whose act the soul is. For such is the soul, that it is not altoge∣ther a body, nor yet wholly without a body; it comes partly from without, and is partly born at home: in some sort it is a part of the body, and in some the beginning and cause of all things which are contained in the Animal body; namely, nutri∣tion, sense, and motion; and so consequently of Life, and Death also: for whatsoever is nourished, doth also live; and so on the contrary. Like∣wise whatsoever is plentifully nourished, is also inlarged; but that which is too sparingly nourish∣ed,
doth diminish: that also which is perfectly nourished, doth continue in health, but that which is not, doth incline to diseases. The blood therefore, as well as the soul, is to be reputed the cause and author, both of Youth, and Old Age, of Sleep and Waking, and of Breathing also: es∣pecially since in Natural productions the first In∣strument doth contein in it self the internal mo∣ving cause. And therefore it comes all to the same reckoning, whether we say, that the soul and the blood, or the blood with the soul, or the soul with the blood, doth performe all the effects in an A∣nimal. We use, as persons that neglect the things them∣selves, to pay much reverence to the specious names. The blood which is still at hand, and dai∣ly in our view, makes no great noise in our ears; but at the magnificent name of Spirits, and of an Innate Heat, we are strangely amused. But when once the vizour is plucked from before them, as our errour, so our wonder ceaseth. That mira∣culous Stone, rendered so venerable to Mizaldus by the commendation of Pipinus, did not onely fill him with admiration, but Thuanus also: (who was an eminent Historiographer in his time) I shall here adjoin the Riddle it self. I saw, saith he, a Stone which was lately brought hither to our King out of the East Indies, which Stone did dart forth light, and brightness, after a wonderful manner, sparkling and shining with so much incredible lustre, as if it were all burning, and in a flame. This stone doth by his rayes scattered into every corner, illustrate the ambient aire with so clear a shine, that the firmest sight is scarce able to behold it. It is also most impati∣ent of earth: for if you attempt to cover it, it doth of its own accord, with an impetuous violence fly upward.
All the Art of man cannot confine and shut it up into a narrow room, for it seemeth to be affected with free & open places onely. The infinite purity, and brightness thereof, is not tainted by the least spot, or blemish. It hath no certain shape or figure, but varieth, and is al∣tered in an instant. And though it be most faire and beautiful to the Eye: yet will it not endure to be touch∣ed: and if you attempt too long to handle it, and con∣tinue too obstinate in your resolution, it will mischiefe you: as many in my presence have deerly found. And if any thing be by violence taken from it, it remaines for all that (which is very wonderful) nothing less then it was before. The stranger who brought it, addes far∣ther to all this, that its virtue and power is exceeding useful to sundry emploiments, but will not discover them without a great reward. This travailer also might have added to his description, that this Stone is neither soft nor hard; that it puts on several shapes and com∣plexions, that it hath a continual trembling and palpitation, and doth like an Animal (though it be an Inanimate thing) daily devour great store of food, converting it to its own nutriment and augmentation: and that he hath been told by men of good credit, that this Stone did long ago fall down from heaven, and is to this day the cause of Thunders and Lightnings; being some times begotten by the refraction of the Sun-beams through the Waters. Who can but admire so strange a Stone, and conceive less of it, then to be above the power of the Elements, and so to partake of another body, and of an etherial spirit, especially when he finds that it is answerable in proportion to the Element or substance of the sun himself. And yet if Ferne∣lius De abd. rer. caus. l. 2. c. 17 may be the Oedipus, all this is but a Riddle of the Flame.
In like manner, if I should describe the Blood un∣der the veil and covering of a Fable, calling it the Philosophers stone, and displaying all its endow∣ments, operations, and faculties, in an aenigmati∣cal manner; doubtless every body would set a greater price upon it, and believing it to act be∣yond the Activity of the elements, would ascribe another and more divine body unto it. Of the Primigenial Moisture. EXER: LXXII. WE have now adorned the Blood with the Title of Calidum Innatum; and do likewise conceive it proper, to dignifie the Colliquamentum Crystallinum, as we cal it (out of which the foetus, and its first parts do immediately arise) by the name of Humidum radicale & Primigenium, the Radical and Primigenial moisture. For we meet with no∣thing in the Generation of Animals, to which this title doth upon better right belong. We have stiled it the Radical moisture, because out of it the first particle of the foetus, namely the Blood, and all the post-genit parts do arise, as out of their Root; and do owne the same, as the mat∣ter out of which they are procreated, sed, increased and conserved. We likewise call it Primigenial, because it is first generated in the constitution of every Animal, and is as it were the foundation of all the other parts: as is evident in an Egge, in which after a short time of Incubation, it doth approve it self to
be the first production of the implanted fructify∣ing, and generative faculty. It is likewise the most simple, pure, and sincere body imaginable: wherein all the parts of the Chic∣ken do abide in potentiâ, but none, actu: nature seem∣ing to have afforded to it the same priviledge which men commonly ascribe to the materiaprima, or first Matter, for which all things spring; namely, to be capable of all formes, potentially, but to possess none, actually. So the Crystalline humour of the Eye, to the intent that it may be susceptible of all Co∣lours, is it self void of all: and in like manner the Mediums, or organs of each particular sense, are quite destitute of the qualities of sensible things, or objects: namely the Organs of Hearing and Smelling, and the Aire which is subservient unto them, are without all Sound or Odour: so like∣wise, the moisture of the tongue and mouth, is of it self insipid. And upon this Argument chiefly doe they rely, who constitute Intellectum possibilem incorporeum, a Potential Understanding which is incorporeal, namely, because it is susceptible of all formes without matter; and as the Hand is cal∣led Organum Organorum, the instrument of instru∣ments, so they affirm that to be forman forma∣rum, the Form of forms, having no matter at all, but being altogether Incorporeal, and therefore they assert it to be Possibilis, Potential, but not Passibilis, passible. And this moisture also doth seem, if not the same, yet proportionable to the last Aliment, whereof Aristotle doth teach that the Animal Geniture or Seed is made. I say the last Aliment, which the Arabians call Ros, the Dew, wherewith all the parts of the Body are moistned and bedewed. For as that dew doth by farther condensation and adhesion pass into the alible glu∣ten,
or glewey substance, and Cambium, which is that substance which doth constitute the parts of the body: so on the contrary, in the first genera∣tion and nutrition, out of the glutinous substance dis∣solved and rarefied, is made a Dew: namely, out of the White of an Egge is the Colliquamentum fra∣med; which is the radical moisture, and Ros pri∣migenius, the primigenial Dew. Nay if there be any faith due to our observations, the matter is the selfe same in both; and that is a truth which all Philosophers consent in, and Physitians do not dissent, namely, that an Animal is nourished by the same thing whereof it is made; and aug∣mented by that out of which it is generated. So that Ros nutritius, the nutritive Dew, doth differ from the Colliquamentum, or primigenial moisture, onely under the several respect of that which is first, and that which is after: in that this is con∣cocted and made by the Parents, and that by the Foetus it selfe: and both the juices are the next and immediate aliment of the Animal: yet not the first aliment; according to that saying, Con∣traria ex contrariis augeri necesse est, Contraries are are necessarily encreased out of contraries; but the last (as I have said, and as Aristotle also doth denote) according to that other saying, Similiae ex similibus, Like are fed by like. And both these humours doe stand in that proximâ potentiâ, that next or most immediate capacity or potentiality, by which (all impediments being removed) they are ready of their own accord, or by the law of nature, to pass or be transformed into all the parts of the Body. Which things being so, all the controversies which doe arise concerning the matter, and ali∣ment of Animals, seeme to be easily reconciled.
For whereas some were of opinion, that the seed, or matter ejected in coition was deduced from all the parts of the body, and that therefore the child had the resemblance of the Parents imprinted in it, Aristotle saith thus: We must be of a different judgement from the Ancients: for whereas they doe De gen. an. l. 1. c. 18. own that to be the seed which is discharged from the whole body; we conclude that to be the seed, which of its own inclination doth conduce to the constitution of the whole body: and whereas they call it a Colliqua∣mentum, or melted substance, we rather stile it ex∣crementum, an excrement; (but he had a little be∣fore said, I call an excrement the reliques of the ali∣ment, and a Colliquamentum, that which is separa∣ted from the excrement by a praeternatural resolution:) for that which commeth last to the parts, and is the excrement of that last aliment, is in probability a like substance. As Painters have commonly some rem∣nant of those colours, which they have spent upon their Pictures: but now that which doth melt away and dissolve, doth corrupt and degenerate. One Argu∣ment to prove that the excrement is rather the seed, then any colliquated matter, is this; namely, that those Animals which are of great growth, are less fruitfull; but little Animals are most of all fertile. For there must of necessity be more dissolved matter in great Animals, but less excrement: for the stock of aliment is wasted in the support of a large bulk; and thereup∣on there is little excrement. Moreover, there is no place designed by nature for the reception of that sub∣stance or matter which doth melt off from the body: but there is a place assigned to all the natural excre∣ments: as for example, the Guts are intended for the excrements of the dry aliment; the bladder of u∣rine for the moist; the stomack for the profitable or usefull excrements; and the Womb, the Genital parts,
and the Breasts, for the Seminal: for unto those places they resort, and assemble themselves. Likewise by several other arguments he proceedeth to main∣tain, that the seminal substance, out of which the Foetus is framed, is the same with that which is provided for the nourishment of the parts. As if a man should desire a little colouring from a Pain∣ter; surely the Painter would not scrape off that colouring which he hath already laid upon his Pi∣cture, but afford him some of that which remains, and this supernumerary staffe is of the same nature with that which he hath expended upon his Pi∣cture. So likewise the Excrement of the last Ali∣ment, or the Reliques of that nutritious substance which is called Ros, and Gluten, is deposited in the Genetal parts: and this opinion is most a∣greeable to the Generation of the Egges in the Hen. Physitians also (who conclude that all the parts at the beginning are made out of seed, or sperme, (and upon that ground call them sperma∣tical parts) do affirm that the seed is by the pow∣er of the Genital parts made out of the last aliment (which they with Aristotle conceive to be blood) and so doth constitute the matter of the Foetus. It is indeed a plain case, that the egge is produced by the Hen, and from her last aliment (namely her Ros nutritius, her nutritive juice.) The White therefore of an Egge, or that primogenit, or ra∣ther antegenit colliquamentum, or melted substance, is to be reputed the truer seed of the Hen (though it be not ejected in coition, but provided ready before coition, or else collected after it; (as shall be perhaps more largely declared, to be incident to several Animals) which the geniture of the Male, doth according to Aristotle, coagulate.
Since therefore I plainly see, that all the parts are fashioned and fed by this one moisture onely, (as the matter and first root of all) and since the fore-cited argument doth necessarily conclude as much; I can scarce refrain my pen from rebuking those that follow Empedocles and Hippocrates al∣so: (who will needs have all similar bodies to be generated by the congregation of the four con∣trary Elements: (as being mixt bodies) and dis∣solved or corrupted by their segregation) nor is Democritus and the Epicureans, who follow him, less blameable, who constitute all things out of the confluence of Atomes of different Figures. For it was their errour of old, and is a popular er∣rour at this day, that all similar bodies are framed out of heterogeneous or different bodies. For according to this opinion, had a man Lincous his eyes he could not discerne any thing that were si∣milar, one in number, identity, and continuity: but there were nothing but an appearing union, and an assembly or heap made up of a congre∣gation and certaine colligation of indivisible bodies: so that generation were nothing else but an aggregation, and convenient positure of several parts. But for my part, neither in the production of Animals, nor in the generation of any similar body whatsoever, (whether it were of the parts of A∣nimals, Plants, Stones, or Minerals, &c.) I could never discover any such congregation, or any se∣veral praeexistent miscible bodies, which were to be united afterwards in the work of Generation. Nor (so far as I could ever yet perceive, or by any meanes observe) are there any similar parts which are first constituted in their several order, or existence at the same time together (as mem∣branes,
flesh, fibres, gristles, bones, &c.) that so from them conioined together (as out of the Elements or first rudiments of Animals) the organs or parts, and the whole entire animal should at last be fra∣med; but as we said before, the first rudiment of the body is onely a similar soft gluten, or stiff, sub∣stance, not unlike a spermatical concernment, or coagulated seed: out of which (the decree of Ge∣neration going on) being changed, cut in sunder, or distributed into several parcels, as by the di∣vine Mandat as we have said, (let here be a Bone, there a Nerve, or a Muscle, here the Bowels, the re∣ceptacles of the Excrements, &c.) out of an inorga∣nical substance, was made an organical: out of one, and that one being of the same nature, were many things made, and those also diverse, and contrary: not by a kind of transposition, or lo∣cal motion (as if by the virtue of the heat, there did arise a congregation of homogeneous, and a dis∣gregation of hetorogeneous bodies) but rather by a disgregation of homogeneous parts, or bodies, then any composition of heterogeneous. And this do I believe to be observed in every Generation; so that the Similary mixt bodies have not their Elements existent in time before them, but are rather themselves in being before their Elements, (whether you understand by Ele∣ments the Fire, the Aire, the Earth, and the Water, with Empedocles, and Aristotle; or the Salt, the Sul∣phur, and the Mercury, with the Chymists; or the A∣tomes with Democritus) as being in Nature more per∣fect then they. There are I say mixt and compoun∣ded bodies, even in respect of time before any E∣lements, as they call them, into which they are corrupted and determine; for they are dissolved into those elements rather in order to our appre∣hension,
then really and actually. And there∣fore those bodies called Elements, are not before those things which are made and generated; but rather after them, and their Reliques rather then their Principles. Nor doth Aristotle himself, nor any other Philosopher, demonstrate that the elements do subsist apart, or are the Principles of similar bodies. Indeed Aristotle, where he goes about to prove, L. 3. de coelo. c. 31. that there are such things as Elements, seems to waver in his judgement, whether he should re∣solve that they were actually in being, or onely in potentiâ: and doth conceive that in natural things they are in potentiâ rather then actu: and there∣fore he affirms that there are such things as Ele∣ments, out of the division, segregation, and solution of things. And yet that is but an infirme argu∣ment, namely, that natural bodies are genera∣ted or compounded first out of those things, into which they are at last dissolved and corrupted: for by that argument, somethings should be compounded of Glasse, of Ashes, and of Smoak; (because we see them reduced at last into such bo∣dies) and since Artificial Distillation doth clearly demonstrate, that so many several Vapours or Waters, and those all of them of different Spe∣cies, are extracted out of so many several bodies; the number of the elements ought to multiply in infinitum. Nor doth any Philosopher say, that the Bodies which are dissolved by Art, and are called Sincere Bodies, and indivisible in species, are more single elements, then the Aire, Water, and Earth, which we perceive by Sense, and are obvious to our eyes. And lastly, we do not see that any thing is na∣turally produced out of fire, as a miscible substance;
and perhaps it is altogether impossible there should; since fire (like a kind of living body) is in contiual flux, and seeketh sustenance whereby it may be nourished, and conserved: according to that of Aristotle, that fire onely is nourished, and that chiefly because of its form. But whatso∣ever De gen. & corr. l. 2. c. 50. is nourished, cannot possibly be it self mixed with its nutriment. Whereupon it followeth, that it is impossible for Fire to be miscible. For Misti∣on, according to Aristotle, is miscibilium alterato∣rum unio, the union of miscible things altered; where one miscible thing is not transformed into another, but both of them being both active and passive in regard of themselves, do constitute a third thing: but generation (especially that which is by a Metamorphosis) is the distribution of one similar thing which is to be altered into di∣verse more. Nor are mixt similar bodies said to be generated out of the Elements, but in some sort to be constituted out of them: into which also they are capable to be dissolved. But these matters do properly relate to that part of Physiology, which treateth of the Elements, and the Temperaments: where also we shall dis∣course more copiously of them.
Of the Birth. AFter the Generation, the Birth succeedeth, by which the Foetus comming into the world, doth enjoy the outward Aire. Whereupon we conceive it convenient to speak something concer∣ning it. And therefore (with Fabricius) we shall consider the Causes, Manner, and Times of Birth; as also those things which are precedent and sub∣sequent thereunto. Those things which are incident a litle before the Birth, and especially to Women, presaging the approaching delivery, are in part the preparation and disposition of the Childing Woman, whereby she may bring forth: and in part the scite, or pro∣per position of the Infant in order to the Birth. As concerning the Position, Fabricius saith, that it is of a conglobated and inflex figure, left the Foetus by his extream and eminent parts, might injure the De form. Foetus c. 9. pag. 140. The Posi∣tion of the Foetus in the Womb. Womb, or the conteining membranes: and likewise that so he may be comprehended in the lesser roome. But I am not of opinion that the foetus doth still observe the same scite or positure of his members in the Womb, (for the fore-scited causes.) For he swimmeth in a water, and moveth himself to and fro, he stretcheth himself, now this way, and anon that, and so is variously inflected, and tum∣bled up and down; in so much that sometimes being entangled in his own Navel-string, he is strangely insnared. True it is that all Animals, while they lye still and sleep, do for the most part draw in, and contract themselves, and direct themselves toward an Oval or Conglobated fi∣gure. So likewise Embryo's, which pass their time
most in slumbers, do compose their bodies in that posture wherein they are formed: (as being the most natural, most easie, and most advantagious for their sleep.) And therefore the Infant in the Womb is commonly found, with his Knees drawn up to his Belly, his Thighs bent backwards, his Feet hanging down, and his Hands elevated to his Head, whereof the one is placed about his Tem∣ples or Ears, and the other at his Cheek; in which parts there are white spots discovered in the skin, as being the signes of his confrication: His Spine is bent round, and his Neck being inflected, his Head hangs neer his Knees. The Embryo is scitu∣ated with that position of parts, wherewith we commonly apply our selves to rest, with his Head uppermost, and his Face directed towards his mo∣thers Spine. But a litle before his Birth, his head being bent downwards, he dives towards the bot∣tom, and the Orifice of the Matrix, (as if he were seeking his way out.) So Aristotle: All Animals Hist. an. 2. c. 8. do naturally come into the world with their head for∣most; but those that lye cross, or come with their heels formost, are unnatural births. But yet this is not constant in all Animals, but according to their se∣veral site or position in the Womb, so is their Birth various; as in Bitches, Sows, and other Multipa∣rous Animals. And the Great-bellied Women know full well, that even the humane Embryo doth some∣times acquire a different scituation; when they find the Child kick sometimes above, sometimes below, and now on this side, and at other times on that. So also the Matrix being neer delivery, doth The Ma∣trix. bear down, groweth soft, and openeth its Orifice. The Waters also as they commonly call them, are Gathered, that is, a certain part of the Chorion, in
which the fore-said humour is conteined, doth usher in the Foetus, and slide down from the Ma∣trix into the Vagina, or Sheath of the Womb: and the neighbouring parts also are loosened, and rea∣dy to distend: also the Articubation of the Holy bone, and the Share-bone to the Hanch-bone (which Copulation, or Articulation is by Synchondrosis, or a gristly ligament) is so softened and losened, that the fore-said bones do easily give way to the parting Infant; and by gaping open, do amplifie the whole region of the Hypogastrium, or Lower belly. And when these things are in this condition, it is certain that the Birth is at hand. And that so the Foetus (like a ripe fruit) may come forth into the World, Nature makes this provision of dilating the parts: as she likewise concocteth the Milk which is sent before into the Breasts, that the In∣fant now ready to be born, may have his enter∣tainment ready to wellcome him, being now to be susteined from without. And these are the fore-runners of the Birth. Wherefore the Milk is counted amongst the chiefest signes of an immi∣nent birth: I mean such Milk, which both for store, plenty, and consistence, is convenient to feed the Child: which (according to Aristotle) is never so qualified but neer the time of the Birth, and therefore is never found before the seventh moneth. Fabricius concludeth upon two queries, chiefly Gen. an. l. 4. c. 8. & l. 7. c. 5. pag. 141. in order to the Foetus: namely, how the birth is, and when? the last whereof relates to the time of Bearing, the first to the manner of the Birth it self. The times of bearing, are by Aristotle conceived De gen. an. l. 4. c. 4. & ult. to be various. There are, saith he, peculiar times of bearing to all kind of Animals, for the greatest part as long as they live: for the race of Animals which is
longer liv'd then others, must of necessity be more du∣rable. But the magnitude of the Animals is by him assigned as the chiefest cause of the variety of the times of bearing. For, saith he, the great fa∣brick, either of Animals, or any thing else, cannot be easily absolved in a short space: Wherefore Mares, and those Animals that are of kin to them, though they live but a shorter time, yet they are longer in bring∣ing forth: And therefore the Elephant (as they say) is two years in her production, because of its excessive magnitude. But every Animal hath certain bounds of magnitude, which it cannot exceed: and there∣fore they have a definit matter, out of which they are made: he addeth moreover: But there is ex∣ceeding good reason, why Animals do receive the di∣mension or measure of their times of ingravidation, ge∣neration, and their lives also by certain Circulations. Now I call a Circulation, a day, a night, a moneth, a year, and all those times which are described by them, as also the motions of the Moon: for these are the com∣mon beginnings of Generation to all Animals: For it stands to good reason that the Circulations of less prin∣cipal things should follow the Circulations of more prin∣cipal. And therefore Nature hath defined or limit∣ed the generation and decease of Animals, by their motions. And as the Births of Animals do depend upon the Revolutions or Circuits of the Sun and Moon, so do their times of Coition, and bearing their young vary, and are either more prolixe, or breifer. The time of going with young (saith Aristotle in the same place) is enormous onely in Women. For all other creatures have some one time, but a Woman hath several, for a Child may be borne either the Seventh, or the Tenth moneth, and likewise in the moneths in∣tervening
between the Seventh and the Tenth: For they that are borne in the Eighth moneth, though they do seldom live, yet they may live. Diverse Animals have indeed a set time of bringing forth, and spe∣cially in the Spring, when the Sun returnes; di∣verse in the Summer, and some in the Autumne, as the Gristley Fishes. And hence it happens, that when the time of bringing forth approacheth, they direct themselves to their wonted places, where they may safely build their Stalls, or Nests, where they may bring forth, cherish, and sustaine their young. Hence it is that those Winds which blow a∣bout the beginning of the spring, are called, Or∣ithiae, namely from the comming or flocking in of the Birds, which about that time, do by the help of those Winds arrive at certain usual places. And Fishes also which swim in Shoals many hun∣dred thousands together, do conspire to meet in such particular parts, and at such set times, to spawn and cherish their fry. And likewise in the Spring, so soon as ever the Cankerwormes do appear, (whose seeds are for the most part carried about by the Winds like in∣visible Atomes; and are not begotten as people commonly believe, either of their own accord, or out of putrefaction) the trees do presently shoot forth their buds, which are to become the sustenance of those creatures: and they themselves also are pursued by small Birds, and conduct∣ed into their Nests to be devoured by their young. So that whensoever we see unusual kinds of these Canker-wormes, we do likewise meet with several sorts of forraign litle birds, which are sel∣dom seen at other times, (as if these Birds did
Son sued for the Inheritance, did cast him in Law though his Mother did affirm that the eldest Son was born in the thirteenth moneth: because there seemet to be no certain time allotted for bringing forth. There was a Woman not long since amongst us, which kept a Child within her above sixteen moneths, and perceived him to bestir himself in her Womb a∣bove ten monethes (as many did evidence) and ye at last she brought him forth alive. But, I confess those are rare accidents. And therefore Spigelius doth reprechend Ulpian the Lawyer without cause in that he admits none to be legitimate Heires tha are borne after the tenth moneth. For Lawes and rules of Art, are for the most proportioned o fitted to the actions of life, which are rightly or∣dered. Besides, it must not be denied, that there are many crafty, fraudulent Women, which for lu Hist. an. l. 7. c. 4. cre sake, or for fear of punishment or infamy, wi feign and swear that they are with Child. And likewise it is well known, that others are easily deceived, and being inexperienced in the matter do conceive themselves to be with Child, when it is no such thing. And to this purpose are those words of Aristotle. The conception of those In∣fants which are borne after the eleventh moneth seem∣eth to have not been exactly known to the Women who are with Child, for the women do not know when they first conceived. For their Wombs being possessed with flatulencies, and they afterwards conceiving a Child upon Coition, conceive that flatulency to have been the first beginning of their conception, because they then had some usual indications, as do accompany such as do really conceive. And we have also a other times known, that after three, or four moneths space, the former conception dying in
the Womb, and putrifying, and the corrupt mat∣ter (like to putrid after-purgings) flowing forth, a Superfoetation hath happened: and yet the same Women have constantly affirmed that they have been delivered of a Child after the fourteenth moneth. It falleth out some times, saith Aristotle, that after one Abortment, tenne or twelve succeeding Ibid. Infants which have been conceived by a superfoetation, have fallen from the Mother. But if the Mothers have been delivered in some short time after, they have brought forth that Child which was begotten by a su∣perfoetation: and so they bring them forth, like those children which are born Twinnes: As the Fable runs of Iphicles and Hercules. And this hath been al∣ready found to be so. For a certain Adultress brought forth two Children, one like her own Husband, and the other like the Adulterer. And likewise a cer∣tain Woman a long while since, having Twinnes with∣in her, did conceive a third Child also, so that when the time of her delivery was fully come, she brought forth the Twinnes in their just time, and they were perfect: but the third was but of five moneths time, and so he died instantly. A certain Servant-Maid being gotten with Child by her Master, to hide her knavery came to London in September, where she Lay in by stealth: and being recovered again, returned home: but in December following, a new birth (for she had a Superfoetation) did proclaime the crime which she had cunningly concealed before. It happened to another Woman (as Aristotle pro∣ceedeth) that when she had brought forth one Child in the seventh moneth, she was after two moneths end, delivered of two more, whereof the first Child died, but the Twins survived. Likewise some Women that have suffered abortment, have conceived two Children at
the same time, whereof the one hath been aborted be∣fore the time, and the other hath continued the full time, and been brought forth perfect. For it is an easie matter, that the first, or last Conception which is conceived by a Superfoetati∣on; being ejected after the third or fourth month, the following moneths may be reckoned more or less then they ought to be, especially by credu∣lous or unskilful Women. I have sometimes known the Conception to perish in the Womb, and being turned into Pu∣trid Matter, to have glided and issued forth: (like the flores albi) and this both in Women and other Animals. There was not long since a Wo∣man in London, which after such a kinde of A∣bortment did conceive again; and was delivered at the just time. But a litle after, as she went a∣bout her worke, being not in any great paine, or distemper, she did eject by peices the black li∣tle Bones, which related to her former Abort∣ment. Some of these Bones were brought to me, which I could discover to be the fragments of the Spine, the Bone of the Thigh, and of other Bones. I know a young Woman, who was the Daugh∣ter of a Physitian, who was of my neer acquain∣tance, which being Big, felt all the Symptomes incident to Women in that condition; and con∣tinuing healthy and sprightly, after the four∣teenth week she perceived the motions of a Foetus in her Womb; and having finished her time for going with Child, conceiving the hour of her de∣livery to be nigh at hand, she had her Bed furni∣shed, her Cradle ready, and all the implements appertaining to the purpose laid out for use. But all these preparations came to nothing, and Luci∣na
was cross to her wishes; for her customary paines quite left her, and her Belly as it rose by degrees, so it sunk againe, and shee never sicke for the matter, but she remained barren ever after. I also knew a noble Matron, who had borne above ten Children, and whose Courses were ne∣ver suppressed unless she were with Child. But being afterwards married to another Husband, besides other usual signes, she apprehended her self to be with Child, by the stirring of it (which both she her self, and her Sister also, who then lay with her in bed, did many times in the night perceive) and all the Arguments I could suggest, could not remove that perswasion from her: till at the last, all her hopes vanished into flatulency and fatness. So that sometimes, the most approved signes of Ingravidation, have not onely deluded the silly Women, but the experienced Midwives, and the skilful Physitians themselves. Wherefore, since besides the deceits of Women themselves, there are several false Indications of Gravidation, we must not rashly determine of the Inordinate Birth, before the Seventh Moneth, or after the Eleventh. The ordinary Computation of going with Child, observeth that time which our blessed Saviour, the perfectest of all men, did fulfil in the Virgins Wombe: namely, from the day of the Annunciation, which is in March, to that blessed day of the Nativity, which we celebrate in De∣cember. And according to this Rule, the Sager Matrons keeping their account (while they cast in the wonted day in every moneth, whereon they were accustomed to have their purgations) they
are seldom out of their Reckoning; but, ten Re∣volutions of the Moone beeng expired, they are de∣livered, and reap the fruit of their Wombe, upon that very day whereon (were it not for their Praegnation) their Purgations would ensue. As concerning the causes of the exclusion or de∣livery of the Foetus, Fabricius, besides that gi∣ven De usu part. l. 15. c. 7. by Galen (wherein he delivers, That the Foe∣tus is so long continued in the Wombe, till being now enlarged and made perfect, he is capable of being su∣stained at the mouth: by which argument, the weaker sorts of Foetus ought to protract their continuance in the Wombe, which yet is no such matter:) conceives the other reason, and that the more rational one too, to be the necessity that the Foetus standeth in of more large refrigeration pro∣cured by respiration: because the Foetus, so soon as it is borne, doth presently respire, but doth not so soon feed. And this (he affirmeth) is not onely observa∣ble in Men and Beasts, but chiefly in Birds: which though they be small, and have yet but a tender bill, yet will the Chickens peck that part of the shell, where they stand in most need of respiration: which thing they doe, being more streightned for Breath, then A∣liment: Seeing that immediately as soon they are e∣scaped out of the shell they doe respire, but abstaine from meat two or three dayes together. But whether Respiration be instituted for Re∣frigeration, or for any other use: we shall more largely debate elsewhere, out of our Observa∣tions. In the mean time I shall propose this Probleme to the Learned; namely, How the Embryo doth subsist after the seventh moneth in his Mothers womb? when yet in case he were borne, he would instant∣ly breath: nay he could not continue one small
hour without it? and yet remaining in the womb, though he pass the ninth moneth, he lives, and is safe without the help of Respiration. I shall de∣liver it yet more plainly. How commeth it to pass, that the Foetus being now borne, and con∣tinuing yet covered over with his entire mem∣branes, and abiding still in his water, can subsist for some hours space, without any danger of suf∣focation: and yet being shifted out of those mem∣branes, if he have but once attracted the Aire in∣to his Lungs, he cannot afterwards live a minute without it, but dyeth instantly? doubtless this is not for want of Refrigeration: for in a diffi∣cult Delivery, he sticketh fast in the streights with∣out anȳ Respiration, sometimes for some houres together; and yet we find him alive: but yet so soon as he hath escaped, and tasted the vital air, if you deprive him of it, you destroy him in a moment. So likewise in the Cesarean Section the Infant is taken out of his Mothers wombe, many houres after his Mothers decease, and yet he is found alive, and continueth safe, without the use of Aire, though he lye intombed in the Se∣cundines: but having once attracted the Aire, (though you instantly restore him to the Secun∣dines againe) he will expire for want of breath. Whosoever doth carefully consider these things, and look narrowly into the nature of Aire, will (I suppose) easily grant, that the Air is allowed to Animals, neither for refrigeration, nor nu∣trition sake. For it is a tryed thing, that the Foetus is sooner suffocated after he hath enjoyed the Aire, then when he was quite excluded from it: as if the Heat within him, were rather infla∣med, then quenched by the Aire. But thus much we have discovered by the way
concerning Respiration; being perhaps resolved to discuss the debate more fully in its proper place: then which disquisition you shall hardly meet with a more nice; for it is debated with Arguments of almost equall weight on both sides. I return to the Birth, which Fabricius conceiv∣eth to come to pass (besides the fore-mentioned necessity of Respiration, and want of Sustenance) because the Foetus being grown bigger, doth press out by his weight; and also can be no longer conteined within, by reason of his large bulk; and likewise, saith he, the Excrements are so multiplied, that there is no longer place for them in the membranes. But we have already proved, that the humours in the Wombe are not Excrementitious. Nor is the rea∣son deduced from the Weight and Magnitude of the Foetus more available then the former: for the Foetus swimming aloof in the humours, is scarce any burden at all to the After-birth or Womb; for some Infants of nine moneths are very litle, and less then some others of eight moneths onely, yet can they no longer subsist in the Womb. And as to the Weight, Twins of eight moneths do pre∣ponderate any one single Foetus whatsoever, though of nine moneths abode in the Womb, yet are they not born till the nineth moneth. Nor can we quarrel at the scarcity of Aliment: since at that time there is entertainment enough even for Twins, and sometimes for more Infants: and also the milk which is conducted to the Breasts of Women in Child-bed, being recalled to the Uterus, would as conveniently supply the foetus in the Womb, as out of it. I shall rather impute the cause of being born, to the juice conteined in the Amnion, which being
most proportionate to the nourishing of the Foe∣tus, doth either much faile, or else is depraved by the admixture of the superfluities. As I have also hinted before. But as for the diversity of going with Child, which is contrary to the time allotted by Nature (which diversity doth chiefly respect Women) I do ascribe it to the custome of living, the infir∣mity of the constitution, and the several passions incident to Women. And therefore those tame Animals, which live amongst us, by reason of their lazy lives, and plenty of food, are of more incertainty in their times of Coition, and pro∣duction, then wild Beasts, which live according to Natures intent. Likewise sickly Women have easier and greater dispatch in their Travaile, then others: but it falls out clean contrary to such Women, whose strength is very much consumed. For the same thing befalls them, as happeneth to Plants, whose fruits and seeds, do more slow∣ly and seldom arrive to maturity in cold Coun∣tries, then to other Plants of the same kind which are in a fat and warm soile. So Orenges in England adhere to the trees al∣most two whole years together, before they come to maturity: and Figgs also scarce ever arrive at any perfection here, which are ripe in Italy twice or thrice a year. And the like befalleth the fruits of the Womb; namely, the Foetus is brought to ma∣turity sooner or later, by reason of the scarcity or plenty of Aliment, the imbecillity, or strength of the body, and the orderly or inordinate regi∣ment of life (according to the six non-naturall things recited by Physitians.) Fabricius hath described the Manner of the Birth, thus: The Womb being dilated by the weight
of the Foetus; in so much that it can now be no far∣ther distended, and thereupon being excited to dis∣burden The man∣ner of the Birth. it self, is by the motion of the transverse fibres gathered up into it selfe, and so contracted into a narrower compass. And therefore, whereas before, neither the Excrements, by means of their abundance, nor the Foetus by reason of his weight could be contei∣ned any longer, the Uterus being more streightned and drawn together then it was, can be much less a∣ble to contein them, and therefore first the membranes as being the weaker parts, and more distended, do break, and the humour which is most fluxile, doth first pass out to make the parts glibbe. And hereup∣on the Foetus followeth, as being not onely increased in his weight (by reason that he now no longer swimmeth in the humour) and so descendeth downwards, forc∣ing the Orifice of the Womb, but as being also compres∣sed, driven forward, and shut out by the action of the Womb itselfe: in which act on, the muscles of the Abdomer, together with the Midriffe, are wonder∣fully assistant. By which words he describes the ejectment of the Excrements of the Guts, and an Abortion ra∣ther, then a Natural Birth: for though the mem∣branes in Women do for the most part break, and so disload the Water before the Birth; yet that is not always so: for other Animals do not bring forth as they do, but produce the Entire Con∣ception together, (namely the foetus together with the Secundines) as we may observe in Ewes, Mares, Bitches, and other Animals: and especially in the Viper, which doth conceive within an Egge which is of one onely colour, having a soft shell (such as the humane conception is) and continueth that Conception so long within her, until a foetus be formed thereout, which she doth produce wrap∣ped
up in a membrane, which membrane (accor∣ding to Aristotle) is broken up the third day. And yet it so happeneth, sometimes, that the young Hist. an. l. 5. c. 34. ones are produced, having eaten through the membranes, (while they are yet in the Uterus.) And so also it is no novelty to experienced Midwives, that their Women do sometimes bring forth their Conceptions whole, and entire, with∣out any breach in the Membranes at all. And this kind of birth seemeth to me the most Natural; wherein the foetus (like a mellow fruit which drop∣peth from the tree, without shaking out its seed before the time assigned by nature) is born with the Secundines embracing it. But, where it com∣eth otherwise to pass, and the After-burden doth adhere to the Uterus after the Child is borne: it is oftentimes hardly divided from it, and doth induce evil Symptomes, which are accompanied with noisome smells, and sometimes with a Gangreen, whereby the Mother is brought into imminent danger. Because therefore the Birth described by Fabri∣cius, is not agreeable to all kinds of Births, but onely to Women, and not to all their Births nei∣ther, but to such onely whose Births are prema∣ture, and as it were forced: it is to be ranked rather amongst preternatural, precipitate, and in some sort abortive productions. In a Natural and Genuine Birth, therefore, two Two things required in a Natu∣ral Birth. things are required, which are assistant the one to the other, that is to say, the Woman in travaile, and the Foetus which is to be produced. Both which, except they be ripe for the business, the Birth is hardly successful. For if the Foetus being disquiet, and coveting to be enlarged, doe prevent his parent by exciting her, and offering
violence to her womb: or if the Mother, by rea∣son of the infirmity of her retention, (as if her womb were disturbed with a kind of nauseous∣ness) or by some necessity of expulsion, be before hand with the Infant, the Birth is to be reputed a Disease or Symptome, rather then a Natural and critical Production. As also when some parts of the conception escape out, and others are stil retaind within: namly, if the Foetus attempt a departure ere the After-burden be dismissed from the sides of the Womb; or else the After-burden, on the contrary, be loose from the Ute∣rus, the foetus being not rightly composed, nor the Uterus relaxed for the accommodation of the work. And therefore the younger, more giddy, and officious Midwives are to be rebuked; which, when they hear the woman in travaile, cry out for paine, and call for help; lest they should seem unskilful at their trade, and less busie then comes to their share, by daubing over their hands with oyles, and distending the parts of the Uterus, do mightily bestirre themselves, and provoke the expulsive faculty by medicinal poti∣ons: so that being impatient of a competent ex∣pectation, by their desire to hasten and promote the Birth, they do rather retard and pervert it, and make it an unnatural and difficult delivery; and leaving the Membranes, or some part of the After-burden still adhering to the Womb, they do both expose the poor women to the injuries of the Aire; and vainly perswading them to their three-legged stoole, weary them out, and bring them in danger of their lives. It is much happier with poor women, and those that dare not own their great bellies, where the Midwives help is ne∣ver required; for the longer they retain and re∣tard
the Birth, the easier, and more successfull proves the delivery. And therefore there are chiefly two sorts of Unnatural Births; namely when the foetus is ei∣ther born before, or after the time allotted by na∣ture: (and this is a kinde of Abortive Birth) and the Birth proves difficult and painful, because it doth not succeed in that manner, and order as it ought to do: or else is hindered by some bad Symptomes: which cometh to pass cheifly for two reasons: namely, in that the Mother doth faile in her expulsive office, or else that the Foetus is himself but sluggish, and so doth not promote his own release: for a facile and natural delivery re∣lieth upon the endavour and joint furtherance of both parties. Fabricius doth ascribe the work of bringing forth to the Uterus, to which performance, saith he, the Muscles of the Lower Belly, and the Midrifle are assi∣stants. But when I consider the matter throughly, the throws of the woman in travaile do seem to proceed from the Motion and Agitation of all the Body, (just as we find it in Sternutation.) I knew a young Woman, which by reason of her extream torment in her travaile fell into a Sowne; and became instantly so consternated, stupid, and slee∣py, that nothing could recover her. I being cal∣led in to her cure (finding that Clysters, and other proper remedies had been applied to no purpose, and that nothing could go down her throat) I put up a feather which was dipped in a strong Sneezing medicine, into her Nose; by which being moved (though she was so overwhelmed with a deep stupidity, that she could neither sneeze, nor be awaked) she began to be seized by a kind of general Convulsion, all her body over, which begin∣ning
at the shoulders, did by degrees extend it self to the lower parts. But as often as I applied this provocation to her, her delivery was advanced and came on, and at last, the Mother being in∣sensible of it her self, and remaining still in her sleepy condition, a healthy and sprightly Child was born into the world. We may observe the manner of their throwes, in other Animals: (as in the Ewe, the Bitch, and in great Cattel) wherein we shall discover that it is not by the sole action of the Uterus, or Belly ei∣ther, but is the joint conflict of all the whole body. And how much the Foetus doth conferre to the ac∣celeration and facilitating of his owne Birth, is cheifly evident in Oviparous Creatures: for it is apparent that the Foetus it self, and not the Mo∣ther, doth break through the shell. By which it is probable that in Viviparous births also, the chief∣est cause of being born is owed to the Foetus it self, and that, to his industry and indeavour, and not to his weight, as Fabricius conceiveth. For what doth the weight thereof conduce to the birth in four-footed beasts which stand upright, or sit down; or in Women which lye along? nor doth the en∣deavour of the foetus proceed, as he supposeth, from its largeness of bulk, or the plenty of the water, (the Water indeed is the cause of the delivery of the foetus which is dead and putrified in the womb, in that by its corruption and acrimony it doth exti∣mulate the Uterus to relieve it self) but the foetus himself sets open the Gates of the Womb with his head turned downward, and unlocks their inclo∣sure by his own force, and so struggleth himself into the world by conquest: And therefore that kind of birth is counted the nimbler and more fortunate. But when the Child comes into the world
thrusting his feet formost, saith Pliny, the birth is counted unnatural, and those that are so born are cal∣led L. 7. c. 8. Agrippae, quasi aegre parti, born with much dif∣ficulty: For their birth is slow and painful. And yet notwithstanding in abortment, and where the foetus is dead, or that there would be a hard deli∣very any other way, so that there is necessity of handy-work in the business, the more conveni∣ent way of comming forth, is with the feet for∣most; for by that means the streights of the Uterus are opened, as it were by a Wedge. Wherefore when the hope of delivery relieth chiefly upon the foetus, (as being strong and lively) we must endeavour to further his comming out with his head fore-most; but in case the task is like to de∣pend upon the Uterus, we must procure his com∣ming out with his feet fore-most. That the assistance of the foetus is chiefly requi∣red in the birth, is evident, not in Birds onely, which do by their own industry without the help of their Parent break up the shell; but also in o∣ther Animals; for all Flies, and Butterflies, doe perforate the litle membranes (in which they did lurk when they were the Worme Aurelia) and likewise the Silk-worm doth at his appointed time mollifie and erode the litle Silken bagge, which he had weaved for his defence and security, and so gets out without any forraign aide. And in like manner, Wasps, Beetles, and other Insects; and all Fishes, are borne without others helps; as doth chiefly appear in the Raie, the Fork-fish, the Lamprey, and all cartilagineous Fishes, which do conceive their Egges within themselves, and those perfect ones, and party-co∣loured, (being furnished with a Yolk and White) and concluded in a strong cartilagineous quadran∣gular
shell: out of which being detained within the Belly and the Uterus, they do form their young; which breaking open the shell by force, do get abroad: as also the young Vipers, by their erosi∣on of the membrane which conteineth the Egge, do sometimes in their Mothers Bowels, and some∣times as they stick in the very passage, and other times at the end of two or three daies after their nativity, expose themselves to the wide World. From whence that Fable, that the Vipers do eat their way through their Mothers bowels, and so revenge the death of their Father, took its foundation: When yet they do no more then all other issues which come into the world, breaking through the membranes which encompass them, either in their very Birth it self, or a litle after it. But how great furtherance the foetus doth con∣ferre to its own Birth, several observations doe clearly evince. A certain Woman here amongst us (I speak it knowingly) was, (being dead over night) left alone in her Chamber: but the next morning an Infant was there found between her Leggs, which had by his own force wrought his release. Gregorius Nymmanus, hath collected cer∣taine examples of this nature out of approved Authors. I also knew a Woman, who had all the interi∣our part of the neck of her Womb excoriated and torne, by a difficult and painful delivery: so that her time of Lying in being over, though she pro∣ved with Child againe afterward, yet not onely the sides of the Orifice of the Neck of the Womb neer the Nymphae did close together, but all the whole Cavity thereof, even to the inner Orifice of the Matrix, whereby there was no entrance even
for a small probe, nor yet any egress to her usual fluxes. Hereupon the time of her delivery being now arrived, the poor soul was lamentably tor∣tured, and laying aside all expectation of being delivered, she resigned up her keys to her Hus∣band, and setting her affairs in order, she took leave of all her friends. When behold, beyond expectation, by the strong contest of a very lusty Infant, the whole tract was forced open, and she was miraculously delivered; the lusty Child pro∣ving the author of his own, and his Parents life, lea∣ving the passage open for the rest of his Brethren who should be borne in time to come. For, proper applications being administered, his Mother was restored to her former health. I shall adde one example more memorable then this. The Queen had an exceeding white Mare, excellently shaped, presented unto her: whose genitall parts (lest by going to Horse shee might endanger the beauty of her proportions, and become unfit for use) were, as the custome is, locked up all with iron rings. Notwithstanding which, this Mare (by what accident I cannot tell, nor could the Groomes inform me) was made big with Foale: and at last, when they fea∣red no such matter, she foaled by night, and the Foale was found alive next morning by the mares side. When I came to heare thereof, I went presently to the Stables, and saw both the labia of the lap, which were locked up with rings, and all the privity towards the left side, so torne and dilacerated from the right haunch-bone, that the unity of that most tight part being dissolved, by the incredible force of the young Foale, hee might easily finde a passage through that wide gap. So forcible is the vigour and efficacy of a mature and liuely Foetus.
But on the contrary, in case the Foetus be sick∣ly, and languishing, or borne before its time; it is not properly a birth, but an abortment: and the Foetus is rather ejected, then borne: and there∣fore though he be now some dayes old, he will neither take the breast kindly, nor deposite his excrements as he ought to doe. And yet the Uterus hath its share in this busi∣ness of Delivery: as shall appear in the follow∣ing example. A poor woman, who was a Laun∣dress, did for a long time labour under the Bear∣ing down, or precipitation of her wombe, and the sheath thereof did hang down to the bigness of ones fist, and at length, using no applications to it, her grief grew so forcible upon her, that it now begun to resemble a Scrotum, the skin being rug∣ged and squalid; and yet found now less paine or trouble in it, then she was formerly used to find, when it newly bore down. But, she asking my advice, I counselled her to keep her Bed for some certain dayes, and to mollifie the dryer parts thereof with fomentations, and oyntments, and so when her wombe was reduced into her bo∣dy, to keep it still up with pessaries and swathes, till by the use of drying and strengthening re∣medies it was confirmed and setled in its proper place. The cure did for some time succeed to our wish; but she being poor, was fain to fall to her calling again, to get money, and so in∣termitting her appointed applications, she fell in∣to a relapse, and endured it pretty well, her womb sometimes retiring back again, and sometimes continuing quite out; but for the most part, at night she did reduce it, and there it remained for some time. But after many dayes, she addres∣sed her self to me again, complaining that her
wombe being swelled by the use of her remedies, and especially of her fomentations (as she concei∣ved) would now no longer abide in her body. And yet applying some oyntments which I had prescribed, she had forced it in againe, but her cure did not continue long: for no sooner did she rise, and stand upon her leggs, and so goe about her work, but her wombe did presently, by reason of its bulke and weight, disturbe her a∣gaine, and would easily beare downe upon any occasion. And now at this time it was as large as a Bulls Cod, dangling between her leggs,: so that I suspected, that not onely the sheath, but that the womb it selfe was now inverted, or else that shee was diseased with a Uterine Hernia, or rupture. It grew at last bigger then a mans head, being then a hard tumour, and hanging downe to her knees did much pain her, so that she could not goe (but upon all foure) and breaking just in the bottom of it, it did effund a moisture (as if it had been an Ulcer) and blood with it. Look∣ing upon it (for I did not explore it by touch) I did suspect it to be a Cancer of the wombe, and therefore did bethink my selfe of a Ligature, and cutting it off: and in the interim, I advised her to apply gentle fomentations to it to asswage the paine. But the following night, an Infant per∣fectly shaped, of a span long, was cast out of that Tumour, but it was dead; and the next morning they brought it to me; which having embowelled, I kept swimming in cold water without corrupt∣ing for some moneths time, shewing it to many of my friends (as a miraculous spectacle.) The skin in this Foetus was not yet formed; but on∣ly a thin paring appeared (such as lieth about a Codlin) which I easily drew away whole and en∣tire;
whereupon all the muscles disclosed them∣selves very distinctly, (for the Foetus was leane.) What other matters I observed in the dissection of this Foetus, shall be related elsewhere: in this place, I thought it onely convenient to signifie, how the Matrix it self alone did promote this A∣bortive, and did eject this Foetus by its owne in∣dustry. Fabricius doth propose two things worthy ad∣miration De form. foet. pag. 142. (as he saith) in the birth, and after it: the first is concerning the dilatation of the Uterus in the Birth: and the other is, of the reduction of the Uterus after the Birth into its former com∣pass and narrowness: Wondering that the womb should be so much distended to make way for the foetus, and that in a short time after delivery, it should retire into its pristine dimension. How the Neck of the Womb, which is thick, hard, and so shut up, that it will not admit a slender probe, should subscribe to so vast a disten∣tion in the time of Delivery, We may with Galen De us. part. l. 15. c. 7. pag. 143. admire, saith he, but we shall never comprehend it. Yet he gives this Reason for it, namely That the Uterus, while it is not pregnant, is a thick and hard body, so likewise is its orifice; but being impreg∣nated, it becomes soft and thin: and the nearer it drawes to delivery, so much the more is the substance, and by consequence its orifice too, made thinner, and softer. And this he conceiveth to be effected by its distention; which being distended, its compact and complicated body (if he may so speak) is expanded and smoothed, and so, though it was thick and hard before, yet now it is rendred thin and soft, and so con∣sequently fit to afford an exit to the foetus. And af∣terwards he saith, There was one, who once enquired of me, how, if it be so indeed, it can be true that in wo∣men
with childe the orifice of the womb is so occluded, that not so much as a small probe can get into it? I make answer, that it came to be so, in that the womb while it is distended, and is unfolded like a linnen cloth that is compacted and folded up together, doth begin to be raised up first in its upper part, and there to be unfolded, and after it the lower parts do by de∣grees begin to distend, till at the last that distending faculty doth arrive at the very orifice of the womb it self; which is convenient to be so then, when the Ute∣rus is inclining towards delivery. Wherefore the Ori∣fice of the womb is deservedly shut for the first months, (whilest it is crass and obdurate) but in the last dila∣ted. And thus much touching Galens unknown cause: we might also adde other Reasons, whereby the dilatation of the womb becometh more easie, as, sup∣pose, the Excrements of the Foetus, namely the Sweat and the Urine: which though they are contained in their own proper membranes and receptacles, yet may the power of Humectation arrive even unto this Orifice, especially since it is placed below, and neer to these humours, being alwaies present with them. Adde also moreover, that a certain mucous and pituitous substance is alwaies found about the orifice of the womb. But, in my opinion, this worthy man is mista∣ken; for the Neck of the womb is not hard by complication, but of its own essence, and ner∣vous constitution: and likewise, those accidental Causes (which he alledgeth) are of litle advan∣tage to this purpose. For, doubtless, this is done by the Divine Providence of Nature (as well as the rest of the wonderfull Fabrick of the Body) which doth direct her workmanship to a certain End, Action, and Use. The Wombs constitution therefore is such, that in the first Conception it
should have its nervous Orifice constringed, for retention sake, which afterwards in the delivery of the foetus (like the fruit in the Tree) doth of hard become soft and mellow, for the convenience of ex∣pulsion: and that not from any unfolding, but from the alteration of its Temper; for even the conne∣xion of the bones themselves, namely the Synchon∣drosis of the Haunch-bone with the Share, and Holy-bone, & the synneuresis or natural union or co∣alition of the Rump, or utmost end of the Os Sacrum is dissolved and mollified. It is indeed a wonder∣full thing, that the litle bud of a growing Nut (as suppose of the Kernel of an Almond, or other Fruit) should break those bones which a Malet can hardly bruise: and that the tender fibers of the Ivy-root crawling along the narrow chinks or crannies of stones, should at last demolish large walls. But it is nothing so wonderfull, that the genital parts of Women which are relaxed in the birth, should afterward harden, and draw them∣selves together, because it is natural to those parts; especially if we consider that the Yard of the Male is in coition very much stretched, and hardened, and anon doth flagge, and soften. We are more to admire (which is beyond all plica∣ture or folding) that the substance of the Uterus is not onely dayly amplified and distended, accord∣ing to the growth of the foetus, (as if it were, ac∣cording to the opinion of Fabricius, unfolded) but doth grow thicker, more carnous, and stronger then before. That indeed is more wonderfull; yet, as Fabricius admireth it, that the so large bulk of the Uterus should in so few dayes space, by the customary purgations of Child-bed, return to its pristine dimensions: since it is not so in other umours and impostumations: which consisting of
praeternatural, and digestive faculties, which rebell against the expulsive, are longer under cure. And yet this is no more admirable, then the other works of Nature; for all things are filled with the Deity, and the God of Nature displayeth himself in all things. In the last place, Fabricius doth most admire, that those Vessels of the Embryo (namely the Oval perforation out of the Hollow-vein into the Venal Arterie, and the passage from the Arterial Vein in∣to the Aorta; (whereof we have treated at large, in our Tract of the Circulation of the Blood) should presently after the birth wither, and be obliterated, and is enforced to betake himself to that reason cited by us before out of Aristotle; namely, that all parts are constituted for some Action ot other, De part. an. l. 1. c. 5. and that Action being taken away, the parts also themselves do vanish. As the Eye seeth, the Eare heareth, the Braine perceiveth, the Stomack concocteth; not because they are endowed with such a kinde of temper and fabrick; but those or∣gans are therefore endowed with such a kinde of temper and fabrick, that so they may perform the Functions assigned them by Nature. By which argument it appeareth, that the Ute∣rus is the chiefest of the Parts dedicated to Gene∣ration: for the Testicles are constituted for the ge∣niture or seed; but the seed for coition; and coi∣tion it self, or emission of seed, that the Uterus may receive fecundity, and so generation ensue thereby. We have formerly said, that the Egge is as it were the fruit of Animals, and as it were an ex∣posed Womb. Now on the contrary, we shall contemplate the Uterus as an Egge residing with∣in. For as Trees, at set times, do flourish with leaves, flowers, and fruits: and Oviparous Animals
do sometimes generate eggs, and lay; but some∣times they grow emerit, and the place or part which did contain them is not to be found: so also Viviparous Animals have their Spring, and Au∣tumne. At the Seasons of fecunditie and genera∣tion, the Genital parts, especially in Females, are very much altered: insomuch that the Ovary in Birds, which at other times is conspicuous, doth then appear something turgid: and the Belly of Fishes, about the time of Spawning, doth much exceed all the rest of their body, by reason of the multitude of their eggs, and affluence of their seed or spawne. In many Viviparous Animals, the Ge∣nitals (namely the Uterus, and Spermatical Ves∣sels) are perceived to be at some times of a diverse Constitution, Temper, and Fabrick; but as they grow pregnant, or forbear to be so, so do they di∣versly change; so that a man can hardly know them for the same things. For as in Nature no∣thing is wanting, so there is no superfluity. And therefore the Genital parts, when there is no more use of them, do wither, are retracted, and as it were obliterated and expunged. At the times of Coition, the Testicles are conspi∣cuous in male Hares, and Moles, and the Hornes are then visible in the Uterus of their females. It were strange to relate, how great an affluence of seed is then conspicuous in the larger sort of Moles, and Mice, in which at other times no seed at all is to be seen (but their Testicles are extenu∣ated and retracted into their Bellies) but when they forgoe impregnation, there is hardly any such thing as a Uterus to be perceivd: insomuch that it is a difficult matter to distinguish Male from Femal. The Womb doth, chiefly in Women, exceedingly
vary both in Temper, as also in those Adjuncts which follow the Temper (namely Scituation, Magnitude, Figure, Colour, Thickness, Hard∣ness, & Density.) Unripe Virgins, as their Breasts are no bigger then the Breasts of Boyes; so is their Uterus very small, white, of a skinny sub∣stance, destitute of Veines, and in magnitude, not exceeding the top of ones Thumb, or a large Bean. So also antient Women, as their breasts do sink, so have they a retreated, flaggy, lank, pallid Womb, void of Veins and Blood. Which I also conceive to be the cause, why Women growing Antient have not their monthly Termes: but that they descend into the Haemorrhoides, or else do abruptly for∣sake them, and so endanger their health. But when the Womb is now chill, and as it were de∣funct, & all the Veins and Arteries thereof are ex∣punged, the superfluous blood, when it boileth, doth either restagnate, or divert its course into the neighbouring Haemorrhoids. But on the contrary, in pale Virgins, and such as have the Green sickness (whose Womb is slender, and their Terms are at a stay) by Coition with the Male, saith Aristotle, De gen. an. l. 3. c. 1. the excrement of the Terms is drawn down, for the Uterus being tepefied, doth attract the humours, and the passages are opened. Whereupon a vast abate∣ment of their distemper doth ensue: for the Womb being unmindefull of his function, many mis∣chiefes do befall the Body in general: because the Womb is a principal part, which doth easily draw the whole body into consent with it. No man (who is but never so litle versed in such matters) is ig∣norant, what grievous Symptomes, the Rising, Bear∣ing down, and Perversion, and Convulsion of the Womb do excite; what horrid extravagancies of minde, what Phrensies, Melancholy Distempers,
and Outragiousness, the praeternatural Diseases of the Womb do induce, as if the affected Persons were inchanted: as also how many difficult Dis∣eases, the depraved effluxion of the Terms, or the use of Venus much intermitted, and long desired do foment. Nor is it less known, how great an Alteration doth befall Virgins, when their Uterus doth enlarge, and is tepefied, for they grow ma∣ture, and their Complexion doth improve; their Breasts strut forth, they become more beautifull, their Eyes glisten, their Voice is more tunable, their Gate, Gesture, and Discourse, are more gracefull then formerly; and their more grie∣vous Distempers are at this time, or never, cured. I knew a noble Lady, which was wilde by rea∣son of a Uterine Melancholy and Distemper, for a∣bove ten years together: and when all Remedies had been in vain employed, she fell at last into the Bearing down of the Uterus; which accident, contrary to others judgement, I did prognosti∣cate would conduce to her health; and perswa∣ded her not to return her womb, untill its distem∣per was asswaged by the outward cold aire: the success was answerable to my perswasion, and in a short time she was perfectly cured; and her womb being at last restored to its seat, did remaine there, and she lives a healthy life, even to this day. I knew another Woman, which was trou∣bled with Hysterical symptoms, such as no Ap∣plications could subdue; who at length af∣ter many yeares was cured by the Bearing down of the Womb. And both these being relieved in their Symptoms, I did restore their wombs to their places with happy success. For the Uterus being by any sharp humour excited violently to
expulsion, doth not onely gently bear down, but (like unto the Right Gut when it is irritated by a troublesom Tenesmus) doth precipitate it self outward. Divers therefore is the Constitution of the Ute∣rus; and that not onely praeternatural, but natu∣ral also, namely, in the time of Fecundity, and Barrenness. In young Girles, and Women past Childing, it is (as I have said) of the magnitude of a Bean, and without any blood: in a Virgin ripe for a husband, it resembleth the bulk and form of a Pear: in fruitfull Women, and such as are apt to conceive, it is as large as a small Gourd, or a Goose-egge; and doth likewise swell as the breasts do, and growing more laxe and fleshy, it becom∣meth warme; and as Virgil speaketh of the Fields, —superat tener omnibus humor, —& genitalia semina poscunt: They all a flowing moisture have, And so a fruitfull seed do crave. Wherefore their Terms being now at hand, or newly over, whilest the warmth and moisture of the Part (which are two necessary causes of Ge∣neration) do remain, Women are most apt to con∣ceive. And so other Animals likewise (when they are excited to Venery) their Genital parts are moist, turgid, and swelled. And this Constitution I have found in the Womb, before the Birth. But in Women with Child, the Uterus (as hath been said) doth extend accord∣ing to the growth of the Infant, and so enlargeth into a vast proportion. I have found it presently after Delivery, of the bigness of ones head, and
thicker then the middlefingers breadth, and fraught with diverse vessels full of blood. It is indeed a wonderful thing, and (as Fabricius not∣eth) doth much exceed our humane apprehensi∣on, that the so vast bulk of the Uterus should so much lessen, in so short a space, namely in the space of fifteen, or twenty days. For no sooner is the foetus and the After-burden excluded, but the Uterus doth by degrees gather it self together, streighteneth its Neck, and re∣treateth it self towards the interiour parts; being partly insensibly abated by a diaphoresis, and part∣ly dissolved into the Purgations: and all the bor∣dering parts, the bones, belly, and all the Hypoga∣strical region, are together contracted, and grow sirme againe. In the Purgations, first of all pure blood, then corrupt blood, like that Water wherein flesh that is newly killed is washed, and then paler blood doth issue forth: our women doe call it lact is proventum, the coming of the Milke, when their purgations are now no longer died with blood; because perhaps, the Milk doth at that time flow more plenteous, and sound for the Infant, from the breasts; and the purgations do then be∣gin to diminish, and dry away: the alible juice being now translated from the Uterus to the breasts. And yet other Animals do not require so great trouble in the business, for the fore-said parts in them are, in the compass of a day or two, quite restored, and perfectly consolidated. Nay some of them (as the Hare, and the Coney) in the space of an hour after they have kindled, do admit the Buck, and are again fructified by Coition. As we have shewed that the Hen so soon as ever she hath layed, is compressed by the Cock. But Women a∣lone,
as they onely have Termes, so do they a∣bound with after-purgings, and do alone under∣goe difficult and hazardous deliveries: because their Uterus doth either unseasonably gather it self to∣gether, by reason of weakness, or else the After-purgings are depraved contrary to nature, or do not come away kindly. For it often befalls Wo∣men (especially the more tender sort) that the After-purgings being corrupted, and grown noi∣some within, do call in Feavers, and other grie∣vous Symptomes. For the Womb being excoriated by the separation of the After-burden (especially if the separation were violent) like a large in∣ward Ulcer, is cleansed and mundified by the li∣beral emanations of the After-purgings. And here∣upon we conclude of the welfare or danger of a Woman in Child-bed, according to her excretions. If any part of the After-burden be left sticking to the Uterus, the After-purgings will flow forth evil-sented, green, and as if they proceeded from a dead body: and sometimes the courage and strength of the womb being quite vanquished, a suddaine Gangrene doth induce a certain death. In case any Clotted Blood, or any other preter∣natural matter, do remain in the cavity of the womb after the Delivery; the Womb will neither retire upwards, nor close its Orifice, but its Neck will continue soft and open: As I have had experience in a Woman, which lying very sick of a Malignant Feaver, and being very weak, did suffer an Abor∣tion: who after the exclusion of the Foetus; which was incorrupt and entire, yet lay exceeding weak with a disorderly Pulse, and in a cold sweat, as if she were a dying. I perceived the Orifice of her Womb was lax, soft, and very open, and her Af∣ter-purgings were something noisome: whereup∣on
I suspected that something did lurke in her Womb which did putrefie: and putting in my hand, I extracted a false Conception, as bigge as a Goose-egge; which was made of a most thick, ner∣vous, and almost gristly substance, having some per∣forations in it: (whereout did issue a viscid and putrefied matter) and immediately upon this she was discharged of those greivous Symptomes, and suddainly after did perfectly recover. When the Neck of the Womb doth a litle con∣tract it self, and thereupon the Clotted Blood doth get out, though not without pain and difficulty, causing those paines, which our Midwives call the After-throws: the danger is then supposed to be over, and indeed it is usually so; because it is a signe of the strength and firmness of the U∣terus, collecting it self easily together; whereby the After-purgings are more readily expelled, and the Woman is the sooner well. But I have known the Orifice of the Womb draw together so close in some immediately af∣ter the delivery, that the Blood being deteined in the Womb, and thereupon suddenly putrefying and thickening into Clots, did induce most grei∣vous Symptomes; and when no means would availe to unburden them, a present death insued. A very Honourable Lady in Child-bed falling into a feaver (by reason no After-purgings came from her) had her Privities swoln, and scortch∣ing: the Orifice of her Matrix being hard, and shut up, I did open it a litle way by force with an Iron Instrument, that so I might immit an In∣jection by a litle Syringe; whereupon black, clot∣ted, and noisome blood did issue out, even to some certain pounds weight, whereby she received pre∣sent ease.
The Wife of a Doctor of Divinity, who was of a good habit of Body enough, but being Barren, did consult me; and being very desirous of Children, she had tried many Medicines, and Physicians, but all to no purpose: she had her Termes at the usual times; but sometimes (especially when she had rod on Horse-back) some corrupt and puru∣lent substance did issue from her: Which present∣ly after would stop again. Some conceived it to be the Whites: others suspected it to be some deep Ulcer: being perswaded thereunto, chiefly, be∣cause her flux was not constant, and by litle and litle, but by certain Intervalls, and much at a time: Whereupon by the help of a Speculum Ma∣tricis they did survey all the sheath of the Uterus, and did apply several Medicines, but all in vain. At last I, being called, did open the inward Ori∣fice of the Womb, and presently there did issue forth to the quantity of two spoonfulls, of corrupt matter, sprinkled with bloody streaks. Which when I perceived, I told them that there lay an Ulcer lurking in the cavity of her Womb; and by injecting proper Medicaments, I restored her to her former health. But being intent upon the cure, and seeing the ordinary remedies did litle availe, I applied more forcible ones; because I suspected that the Ulcer was inveterate (and perhaps with flesh growing upon it) wherefore to my former injections, I added a litle Roman Vitriol; by whose acrimony the Uterus being extimulated, did grow so hard, that it did seem as hard to the touch as a Stone: and occasioned several Hysterical Symp∣tomes withall; which Physitians commonly con∣ceive to proceed from the suffocation of the Ma∣trix, and foul vapours being thence sent upwards. This inconvenience continued a while; till the
Uterus being asswaged by milder applications, and such as abate pains, did relax its Orifice a∣gaine, and did exclude the sharp liquour which I had injected, together with a putrid matter. Whereby the Patient was in a short time resto∣red. I conceived it convenient to transferre this Hi∣story out of my Medicinal Observations, to this place, that it may evidently appear, of how sharp and quick a sense the Uterus is: and how easily it doth close it self upon the presence of its adver∣versary: especially in a greivous and difficult Ly∣ing in. Now these casualties are most incident to Women above all other Creatures, and of them, to those that are tenderly brought up, and doe lead a sedentary and lazy life; as also to such as are of a sickly constitution, and do easily fall into distempers. For Country Women, and such as take great paines, are not so dangerously ill, upon so smal grounds. Some of these will be with Child again within a moneths time: when as the other are often out of order for two years after. Hippocrates allotteth as many daies for the Af∣purgings, as for the formation of the foetus; and there∣fore I. de foetu. more for a female, then a male Child. But that, witness Scaliger, is false: For none of our Women are purged above a moneth after their delivery: ma∣ny Com. in hist. an. Arist. l. 7. c. 3. not beyond fifteen daies: and some but seven: nay I have known a Woman, who was cleansed in three days, even after she had brought forth Twins. Galen hath many things concerning this subject, in his Book . The Women (as the report goeth) in the New-found Land, keep close the day of their delivery; but the next day returne to their ordinary emploiments.
I will onely adde, for conclusion, a memora∣ble relation, delivered to me from the Noble Lord George Carew, Baron of Tatnes, and for a long time President of Munster in Ireland, who also wrote the Annals of those times. There was a Woman bigge with Child, which followed her Husband, who was a Souldier in the Army; and the Army being daily in motion, was it seemes forced to make a Halt, by reason of a litle River that run cross the place whether they intended to March: whereupon the poor woman finding her labour come upon her, retired to the next thicker, and alone by her self, without any Midwife, or o∣ther preparation, brought forth Twins: which she presently carried to the River, and there washed both her self and them; which done, she wrapt her Infants into a course cloath, and tied them to her back, and that very day, marched along with the Army twelve mile together, bare-footed: and was never the worse for the matter. The next day after, the Deputy of Ireland, the Lord Montioy (who at that time was General of the Army against the Spaniards, at the siedge of Kingsale) and the President of Munster, being af∣fected at the strangeness of the story, did both vouchsafe to be God-fathers to the Infants.
Of the Membranes and Humours of the Uterus. HIeronymus Fabricius recounteth four sorts of bo∣dies, Lib. de for. foetus c. 1. which do consist without the Foetus, namely the Umbilical Vessels, the Membranes, Humours, and fleshy substance. Concerning which, I shall brief∣ly declare, wherein I differ in opinion from him, (by the instigation of several Observations) but first I shall succinctly lay down his opinion. There are, saith he, three Membranes, two where∣of do encompass the Infant throughout, but the third doth not. Of those which do incompass the Foetus, one is the interiour, called  id est, amiculum, the litle covering. The other is placed next to the former, and called in Greek , in Latine, Innominata, the coat without a name (but it is by Interpreters fals∣ly called Secundae, or Secundina, the Secundine) and this also doth encompass the whole Foetus. The third is called , id est, Intestinalis, the Gut-like Membrane, because it is like a stuffed Gut, or Pudding: which therefore doth not encompass the Foetus, but lieth over part of the breast and lower bel∣ly, and is extended to each horn of the Uterus. He doth confess that this Membrane is onely to be found in a Lamb, and a Calfe; and saith that it is joined to the Uterus, and doth by the Urachus receive the Urine of the foetus from the Bladder. And therefore, saith he, In Horned beasts, which cap. 7. have this coat called Allantoides, the Urachus is so large, and straite, that it resembleth a Gut; grow∣ing by degrees lesser and lesser, even till it reach to the bottom of the bladder: which doth easily evince
that its original is rather from the Allantoides, then from the Bladder. But in a Man, and other Animals which have teeth in both Jawes, the fore-mentioned largeness of the Urachus is so small, that whereas it riseth single from the bottom of the Bladder, it is pre∣sently after divided into most slender fibers, which passing along with the Umbilical Vessels, do transfund the Urine into the coat Chorion (in an almost invi∣sible manner.) And upon this ground he doth challenge Arantius of a double errour; both in that he denyed any Urachus to be found in a hu∣mane foetus; and likewise for saying, that it doth discharge its Urine through its privy member. But for my part, I confess my self to be invol∣ved in the same errours with Arantius (if at least they be errours.) For I am sure of this, that if you compress the bladder of a large-grown foe∣tus, (be it the humane foetus, or of any other Ani∣mal) the Urine will start out at the Privities. But as for the Urachus, I never yet saw any such thing, nor could ever observe that upon compres∣sion of the bladder, the Urine would gush out in∣to the Secundines. I have indeed in Sheep and Deer, seen a certain Process of the bladder, which doth contain Urine in it; but never saw any such as the Urachus by him described. And yet I will not too stiffly deny, that there is a Coat called Allantoides; for the Interiour mem∣branes are so thin and transparent, (such as wee have signified to be found between the two whites of an Egg) that they may easily impose upon the Eye. Likewise in a Hen-egg, between the Colliqua∣mentum and the White (that is, between the Am∣nion, and the Chorion) there is to be seen some whitish excrements, nay, sometimes the very down∣right excrements of the Guts; as we have former∣ly
spoken, and Coiterus hath also observed. More∣over, the Membrane of the Colliquamentum it self (wherein the Chicken doth swim) though it be pellucid, thin, and so subtle, that (according to Fabricius his own confession) thinner cannot be imagined: yet (since according to Him, all the membranes though never so thin, are nevertheless double) Nature may possibly sometimes upon necessity deposit the Urine, or some other excre∣ment between the Reduplications or folds thereof. And such a kinde of Allantoides as this, I shall willingly indulge to Fabricius: but as for any other kinde of Pudding, carried on to both the bornes of the Womb, I finde no such thing in the Secundines of Cloven-footed-beasts, nor any thing else, but the Conception it self. I onely finde, (as I have said before) a kinde of Process of the blad∣der, which being seated between the Umbilical Arteries, doth contain an excrementitious humour, and this Process is in some longer, and in others shorter. Wherefore, in my judgment, the Coat which Fabricius calls Allantoides, is the meer Chorion: and yet the Antients called it Allantoides, from the fi∣gure of a double-pudding, which it doth resemble. For the exteriour membrane, which (like a Wallet tyed in the middle) is extended to the extremities of each Horn; and passing through the interposed part of the Uterus (or the connexion of both the Horns) is fastened together, is the Chorion; which, in Sheep, Goats, Hinds, and Does, and other cloven∣footed beasts, if you take it in your hand in the middle of that passage, you may draw it away entire: and this we have called their Egge, or Conception. For it containeth as an Egge doth, a two-fold
liquor, a foetus, and all things relating thereun∣to; and hath the same qualifications which Ari∣stotle assigneth to an Egge; namely, that out of part thereof an Animal ought to be constituted, and that the remainder ought to become the sup∣port and sustenance of that Animal, when it is now constituted. And therefore that Coat which Fabricius cal∣leth Allantoides, I either conceive to be the Choriou, or that something praeter-natural had befalne some Animal which he had seen. For certain it is, that it is onely to be found in some few Ani∣mals, and not alwaies in them neither: for at the Beginning it is not found, & afterwards, in some it is more, and in others less conspicuous, and in some nothing at all is discernable, but meerly a Process. And Fabricius himself conceiveth it not usefull to the encompassing of the Infant, but only to the reception of the Urine. And truly I believe, that he maketh mention of it, rather in justification of the Doctrine of the Antients, then that himself found any such thing, or thought it usefull to any intent. But (both with the Antients, and the whole School of Physitians) he doth confess, that the Chorion doth contain Urine; where hee saith, that two humours are about the foetus, the one being Sweat, which is in the Amnion, the other Urine, which is contained in the Chorion. By which it is manifest, that the Antients un∣derstood one & the same membrane under a double compellation; namely, in cloven-footed beasts, (in whom alone it is found) they called it Allan∣toides, by reason of its figure: but in other Ani∣mals, they called it Chorion, from its emploiment, because they conceived it was designed for the entertainment of the Urine. And therefore they
confess that this Coat is neither found in a Man, nor any other Animals. For what need of any o∣ther Coat to entertain the Urine, when that of∣fice, by their own confession, is already executed by the Chorion? And indeed, there can no pro∣bable reason be alledged why that coat should be found in Sheep, Goats, and other beasts which cleave the hoof, and not also in Dogs, Cats, Mice, and Others. For if it were instituted for the rece∣ption of the Urine, it is necessary, that the foetus of Sheep, and Cowes, should either abound with greater plenty of Urine then other animals which have Teeth in both Jawes; or else, that there are three diverse kindes of humours; or at least two Receptacles of the Urine. For this I am sure, that the Chorion is from the first beginning full of wa∣ter. But I do not here intend to dispute contro∣versies, I shall rather rehearse what I have found by experience. It is one thing to exhibit the fabrick of a Con∣ception, or Embryo that is now perfected, as Fa∣bricius doth: but another thing, to disclose the the generation thereof, and first scheme and rudi∣ments of all: as it is a diverse business to describe Apples, or the ripe seeds of Plants, and their first production from the bud. We therefore will brief∣ly relate, how the Conception is framed by litle and litle, even from the beginning to the end; that it may thence more likely appear, what we are to conclude concerning the Membranes, and other Appurtenances relating to the Foetus. All Living things do derive their Original (as we have said) from something, which doth contain in it both the matter, and efficient virtue and power: which therefore is that thing, both out of which, and by which, whatsoever is born, doth de∣duce
its beginning. And such an Original or Ru∣diment in Animals (whether they proceed from o∣ther Animals which do beget them, or else are spontaneous, and the Issues of Putrefaction) is a cer∣tain humour, which is concluded in some certain coat, or shell; namely, a similar body, having life actually in it, or in potentiâ: and this, in case it be generated within an Animal, and do there re∣main, untill it have produced an Vnivocal Ani∣mal, is commonly called a Conception: but if it be exposed without, by being born, or else as∣sume its beginning elsewhere, it is called either an Egg, or a Worm. But I conceive that both ought alike to be called Primordium, the first Ru∣diment from which an Animal doth spring; as Plants assume their nativity from the Seed: and all these Primordia are of one kinde, namely, Vital. And this kinde of Rudiment I finde in the Vte∣rus of all Viviparous Animals, before any part of the foetus appear; namely, there is a cleare, stiffe, white humour (like the white of an Egge) which is included in a membrane, which I call their egge: and this doth fill up all the Vterus, and both the Horns thereof, in Hindes, Does, Sheep, and other Beasts which cleave the Hoof. In process of Time, there is a most pure, and clear watry part distinguished or severed from the rest of the Rudiment, or egge, which we call the Colliquamentum, or dissolved part in a Hen-egge) and this doth in brightness or perspicuity farre exceed all the rest of the egge (in which it is com∣prehended. The form thereof is round, and it is concluded in its own proper membrane, which is most thin and transparent, which they call Am∣nion; as for the rest of the humor, which is thicker and darker then this, an exteriour coat, which is
contiguous to the concave superficies of the Vterus, and embraceth the whole Egge, doth contain it: which obtaineth a several figure, according to the diversity of the shape of the womb: for in some it is oval, in other oblong, but in Beasts which cleave the hoof, it resembleth a Wallet. A litle while after, there doth appear in this crystal Colliquamentum, Punctum rubrum saliens, A Red leaping Point; from which most slender strings of litle Veines are disseminated, like rayes or beames. Anon the first concrement or substance of the Body doth appear, like a Magot, which is bent like a Keel of a Ship: and so the rest of the Parts doe follow in their order, as hath been related in our History. For we have obser∣ved that the Procreation of the foetus in Viviparous Animals is instituted in the same manner out of the Egg or Conception, as the Chicken out of the Henn-Egg. But these Viviparous conceptions do (as I have noted) differ in Figure, Number, and Connexi∣on to the Vterus. For at the beginning, the Con∣ception (especially in those that cleave the hoofe) doth not grow to the Vterus; but being onely contiguous thereunto, doth fill up all its cavity, and distend it, and may be easily drawn out whole. In such Creatures as cleave the hoofe, (which do conceive in the Horns of the Womb) and also in those that are whole-hoofed, there is onely one of these eggs found at a time, and that also ex∣tending it selfe to both the Hornes, and though sometimes they do produce a single, and some∣times a double foetus; and thereupon have some∣times one single Colliquamentum, and sometimes two (namely, one in the Right, and another in
the Left Horn) yet are they still concluded in that Common Egg or Conception. But in other Animals, so many foetus, so many several Eggs are to be seen apart; and as many Colliquamentums in them, as it is in the Dog, the Cat, the Mouse, and such like Animals as have teeth in both their Jawes. The Figure of the Conception in such as cleave the hoof, is like a Wallet; namely such, as Fabri∣cius doth attribute to the Allantoides. In a Mare, the internal shape of the womb resembleth a litle oblong Sack; but in a Woman, it is Orbicular. In those Animals, whose conception doth cleave to their womb (which, truly, is not so in many, un∣till the foetus be fully formed) it is distinguished by its Diversity of Connexion: for in some, it doth stick onely in one place, by the mediation of a carnous substance, which we call Placenta, the Ute∣rine cake in women, because it resembleth the round figure of a Cake; but in others, it groweth to the Uterus in several places, being fastened thereunto by divers fleshy substances, or caruncles: namely, by five, in Hindes, and Does; by more in Cowes, but they are lesser also: but in the race of Sheep, by very many, and those of different magnitude. In Dogs and Cats, these Carnous Bodies, do (like a girdle) encompass every conception round. A like substance doth in Hares, and Moles, grow to the sides of their Uterus: as also the Uterine cake in a woman, which embraceth more then one half of the conception (as the cups do the Acorns, when they first spring) and therefore the gibbous part thereof doth stick fast to the womb, but the hollow part doth grow to the Chorion. These things being premised, we shall now dis∣close, what our judgement is of these Humours,
membranes, fleshy substance, and also of the distri∣bution of the Vmbilical vessels (which are spoken of by Fabricius.) Fabricius doth rightly understand by the words  and , the Secundines, or After-Burden, cap. 5. namely not the Membranes onely, but all that which doth come away last in the delivery (or at lest, not long after it) and is constituted of hu∣mours, membranes, and fleshy substance, as also of the Vmbilical Vessels. But as for what he relateth concerning the hu∣mours, Of the Humours. which as he supposeth he doth receive from the Ancients (as a thing most sure, and which standeth in no need of any proof) namely, that the water in the Amnion, wherein the foetus swimmes, is its sweat; and that that outward Water in the Chorion is the Vrine, are both incon∣gruous, and false assertions: For both those two humours do appear in the conception before any portion of the foetus it self be in being: and that which he calleth the Urine, is before that (which they conceive to be the sweat.) Nay you may find these humours, especially the last, in some barren, and unfruitful conceptions (wherein there is no tract of a foetus at all.) Such Conceptions as these, or Subventaneous eggs, Women do sometimes eject: and Aristotle saith De gen. an. l. 3. c. 9. Ibid. thy are called, Fluxus, Emanations or Fluxes, but we call them false conceptions, and slips. Such an egge as these, did Hippocrates shake from his abor∣ting Minstrel. For those creatures which do breed an Animal within themselves, have in some sort after their first conception, something like an egge within them, for a humour is conteined in a thin membrane, just as if you should pluck the shell off of the egge. But as for that humour conteined in the Chorion, which
Fabricius and other Physitians conceive to be the Urine, Aristotle seemeth to apprehend it to be the liquour of the Sperme, or Geniture. For, he saith, Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7. The seed being received by the Uterus, having con∣tinued in it a while, is covered with a membrane. For if it chance to fall out, before any dearticulation, or delineation of the parts do appear, it looketh like an egge covered with a membrane, when the shell is pilled off. But that membrane is full of Veins, name∣ly, the Chorion, which hath assumed its denomi∣nation a venarum choro, sive copia, from the conflux or multitude of veins. I have often seen those kind of egges ejected in the second, or third moneth: they are many times corrupt and rotten within, and do steale out insensibly (like the Whites) and so delude those, who have entertained hopes of a true con∣ception. Again, those fore-mentioned humours cannot be conceived to be sweat, or Urine: because they abound in such plenty at the very beginning, that the Embryo swimming in the middest thereof, is thereby secured (whilest his Mother runneth, or danceth, or doth imply her body by any forcible agitation) from the collision of the circumjacent parts, as it were by a fortress. Add to all this, that many Animals never sweat at all: (when yet according to Aristotle, all Wa∣ter, Land, and Volatile Animals, and I shall put in creeping things, and Insects also, whether they be produced in the shape of an egge, or an Animal, or else be spontaneous productions, are all procreated after a like manner) all fowl, creeping things, and fishes, are conceived neither to Sweat, nor Urine. Ibid. The Dog, and Cat, do never sweat; nor any other Animal, while it doth emit abundance of Urine.
And certainly it is impossible, that any Animal should make water, before the Reines and Bladder are made. Besides, which is a more evincing Argument then the rest, these humours cannot be excrementi∣tious, because so many litle filaments of Veins are disseminated into them: which doe derive Ali∣ment from thence (as from a large stock) and af∣terwards conduct it unto the foetus. Againe, if the humour conteined in the Chorion, be the Urine; what need is there of the Allantoi∣des? and if the humour conteined in the Amnion be the Sweat, why did nature, who is so exact in all her contrivances, order the matter so ill, as to condemn the foetus to lye wallowing in its own Excrement? and why doth the Parent pre∣sently after delivery (for that is usual with seve∣ral creatures) devour that which is but the Excre∣ment of her foetus, together with the membranes which contein it, with so much greediness and appetite? Some have observed, that if the Animal do not eat up these membranes and humours, it will not give down its Milk freely. If, notwithstanding all these arguments, some men will still maintain that these humours (which we dispose to the nutriment of the foetus) are ex∣crementitious; and that upon this inducement, viz. because they also improve according to the growth of the foetus: and that in the birth of some Animals (at which time the whole stock of Ali∣ment is in probability almost consumed) great store of these humours doth abound; and that therefore they must needs performe other offices, then can well consist with the dignity of the nu∣triment. Yet for all this, I confidently pronounce, that these humours are the Aliment of the foetus
from the beginning of all; (as the Colliquamentum and the White do serve the Chicken for the same purpose) but in process of time, the thinner, and purer parts being exhausted, the reliques do then put on the nature of an useful excrement: and are reserved in some Animals, that so they may secure the foetus and facilitate the delivery. For as Wine, when the Spirits are exhaled, turnes into dead∣wine: and as several Excrements do result from the reliques of the Aliment: so in like manner, when all that substance, which is commodious to the sustenance of the foetus, is derived out of the hu∣mour concluded in the Chorion; the remainder doth turn into a kind of excrement, and is reser∣ved for the uses aforesaid. But all that humour which was included in the Amnion, it common∣ly spent neer the approaching delivery; so that it is probable, that the foetus desireth to get out by reason his provisions faile him. Lastly, if at any time there be any other hu∣mour conteined in the Allantoides (as indeed there sometimes is) I esteem it to be a preter-na∣tural humour. For I have seen when women at their delivery have had a mighty flux of water; and sometimes a two-fold water: our Midwives call them the By-waters. And therefore some women have a monstrous great belly, though they are brought to bed of a very litle & lean Childe; but such women do effund abundance of Waters. Some are of opinion, that the larger quantity of Waters, doth accompany weakly, and those fe∣male Children: but the lesser, strong, and male Children. I have often seen waters burst forth in the midst of the going with Child without Abor∣tion, the Child remaining safe, and strong even to the birth. As therefore there are naturally
but two Waters only, (whereof the one is contei∣ned in the Chorion, and the other in the Amnion) so it may sometimes fall out, beside the ordinary course of nature, that several Waters may be ac∣cumulated in membranes proper to themselves, or else in the reduplications of the Chorion. As for the Membranes or Coats of the Womb, Of the Mem∣branes. since their proper use and office chiefly is, to con∣tein the Waters; and those Waters appear to be two only; it is most certain that the membranes them∣selves are not (necessary and usually) more then two. But as for those who reckon three, I conceive they were deluded, because the Ancients call the self-same membrane sometimes Chorion, from the conflux of Veines; and sometimes Allantoides, from its figure. Every conception is covered over with these two membranes; as also every Braine hath a dou∣ble Meninx: every Tree and Shrub a two-fold Bark; every Seed and Fruit a two-fold Covering: whereof the Exteriour is the harder, and tighter. The more Interiour of the two fore-mentioned membranes (conteining the Colliquamentum, or purer humour) is the thinnest, and is called Am∣nion, that is, Amiculum, the litle covering, be∣cause it covereth and involveth the foetus. The Exteriour (which is by much the larger, and stronger membrane) is called Chorion, because (saith Fabricius) many Veins, and Arteries are as∣sembled in it, tanquam in Choro, as in a Quire. And hence the Coat of the Eye, and likewise that con∣texture of Veins and Arteries which is found in the Ventricles of the Brain, are both called , from the resemblance they have with these veines in the Chorion.
This Membrane Chorion doth fill all the Womb; conteining a stiffe, troubled humour; and to its exteriour part, the Vterine Cake or Caruncles ad∣hering, do fasten the Conception to the Womb. The Interiour part of this Membrane (in a Wo∣man) is almost conjoined to the Amnion, nor is it easily separated from it. In those Animals which cleave the hoofe it is exceeding large, and conteineth a hundred-fold more moisture in it, then the Amnion. For the Amnion at the begin∣ning, is scarce so large as a Nutmeg, or fair Bean, and is commonly found in one Horn of the womb onely, namely in that where the Foetus inhabit∣eth. The Coat Chorion is (chiefly in Women) rough, and viscous without; but within smooth, and glibbe, and interwoven with abundance of Veins. The upper part of it is (in Women) thick∣er, and softer, but the lower part, thinner and more membranous. In women the After-burden groweth to the upper part of this membrane: But in Sheep, seve∣ral Caruncles are fastened to several parts of it. In Hinds, and Does, the conception doth cling to the Vterus at five places onely: but in a Mare it doth adhere to the Vterus in an infinite company of places. And therefore Fabricius saith, that the cap. 3. After-birth is in almost all Viviparous creatures, a soft flesh, lax, porous, thick, and something black, growing about the terminations of the Vmbilical vessels, which he resembleth to a looser Parenchy∣ma or affusion of a Liver or Spleen; which is there∣fore by Galen called Caro adenosa, a glandulous 5. apho. 45. flesh; and we now commonly call it Hepar Vte∣rinum, the Uterine Liver; into which the extre∣mities of the Vmbilical vessels are disseminated,
which do derive nutriment from the womb to the foetus. But now, this fleshy Substance neither is in all Animals, nor at all times in those in whom it is: but in those Animals onely in whom the conce∣ption doth firmly cleave to the womb, and then onely, when it is fastened to the womb to bring down sustenance to the foetus. For in the begin∣ning, the conception (like an egge seated in the womb) is contiguous to all the circum-jacent parts of the Uterus, but doth on no side grow thereunto; but doth produce its foetus (as it is in an Egge which is sat upon by the Henne) out of the Humours contained in it: but that adhaesion and cleaving to the womb, is then first of all pro∣cured, and also this fleshy body is then first begin∣ning to be generated (which fleshy substance is the Tye of the Conception to the womb) when the foe∣tus is now perfectly formed, and standing in need of other, and more plentifull supply of Aliment, doth dispatch the Extremities of the Umbilical vessels to the Uterus, as Emissaries or Agents, that may from thence (as the Roots to Plants) convey provisions. For in the beginning, (as we have shew∣ed) when the Punctum saliens, and the Blood doe onely appear, the Propagations of the Vmbilical vessels are onely disseminated through the Colliqua∣mentum, and the Coat Amnion. But when once the fabrick of the Body is set up, those Propagations do conduct themselves farther, and being grown more numerous, are divaricated in the Chorion al∣so, that so they may transport sustenance from thence to the foetus, out of the whitish humour which resideth there. By which it appeareth, that the foetus of Vivi∣parous Animals is at the beginning fed in the same
manner, as the Chicken is sustained in the egge; and doth for that cause abide in the Vterus, that at length (when it hath no longer a supply from its own stock) it may, by the mediation of the ca∣runcles grow to the Vterus; and be more plenti∣fully supported, by the contribution of its Pa∣rent. Wherefore Fabricius did rightly observe, that the conception was in some Animals scarce fastened to the Vterus at all. And therefore Sowes, and Mares, have none of this carnous connexion; but their egge or conception, as it is first of all constitu∣ted out of the moisture or juices which do flow in the Vterus, (as the Egge in the Hen is enlarged by the White, without any tye to the Vterus) so doth it also receive Augmentation; and the foetus al∣so, having Aliment administred to him from the conception, (wherein he is contained) is in the same manner supported, as the egge out of the li∣quors. Whence a notable argument doth result, that the Foetus of those Animals is no more nouri∣shed by the Mothers blood, then the Chicken in the egge: and that the Humour comprehended in the Chorion, is neither Urine, nor any other Excre∣ment, but the Aliment of the Foetus. Although (as we have observed before) when the alible juice is exhausted, the remainder thereof doth de∣generate into an Excrement, like to the Urine. And this also is evident, from that which we have formerly noted, concerning the Cotyledones; namely, that the fleshy substance is in those Ani∣mals of a spongy substance, and doth (like a Hony∣comb) consist of innumerable acetabula, holes or o∣rifices, which are all of them full of a mucous white matter; (which Galen also records to be ancient∣ly observed) and that thence the Extremities of
the Vmbilical vessels do suck Nutriment, which they transport to the foetus; as the small branches of the Mesenterical veines do, in those Animals which are already born, derive chyle out of the coats of the Guts, through which they are diffu∣sed. I therefore apprehend the imployment of the Vterine cake and the caruncles, to be such as is commonly imputed to the Liver and the Breasts. For the Liver doth adde a preparation to the chyle which is attracted from the Guts, fitting the same for the sustenance of the Body; and likewise the Vterine cake doth afresh concoct the alible nutriment which proceedeth from the Pa∣rent, to support the foetus. The Breasts also (being composed of a glandulous substance) do strut with milk; and though they are parts which (in some Animals) do not appear at all, yet at the time of pregnation they are seen to be full, and tumorous: so the Vterine cake, being a laxe or flaggy and fungous substance, both flow with a whitish sap, and is never found but at the time of Ingravida∣tion. The Liver, I say, is the nutritive instrument of the Body wherein it is; the Breasts of the In∣fant, and the Placenta of the Embryo. And as the mother doth by her own food acquire more milke then she hath use for to sustain her flesh, and blood, which milk is reconcocted in her breasts, and trea∣sured up; so also such Females as are great with young (in whose womb this Placenta is) do pre∣pare, and suppeditate to their foetus an aliment which is defecated by those caruncles: by which it cometh to pass, that an impure or laudible diet is administred to the Embryo's, according as the Parents diet it self is either wholsome or impure, and according to the sufficient or imperfect con∣coction,
which they afford it in those organs of the Vterus. For some Embryo's have a more perfect organ provided for them, such as is that carnous substance of the Uterus, which is wanting in some. In some likewise this Vterine cake is thicker, lar∣ger, and fuller of Blood; but in others it is more spongy and paler: like those two Sweet-breads, or glandulous bodies called Thymus, and Pancreas. For you shall finde as much difference of these in A∣nimals, as of the Breasts, or of the Bowels: for to instance onely in Livers, they are in some ruddy and sanguine; in others, (as in the greatest part of Fishes, and likewise Cachectical persons) pale. Mares do feed upon the crude grass, and do not chew the cud; Sowes swill themselves with any filth, and both these want a Vterine cake, which is the organ of compleating the Aliment. And therefore true is that of Fabricius; saying, cap. 3. This fleshy substance is, in several kinds of Animals, different in Magnitude, Figure, Scite, and Number. Women have one onely; as Mice, Conies, Ginny-pigs, Bitches, Cats, and several Animals, whose feet are distinguished into toes, and have teeth in both jawes: but all Animals which cleave the hoof, and have teeth in one jaw onely, whether they be dome∣sticks, as the Sheep, the Cow, and the Goat; or wilde, as the Hinde, the Doe, the Roe, and the like, have diverse. Again, those Animals which have but one, in them it either resembleth a Cake (and thence cometh its denomination) as in Women, Conies, the Hare, and the Mole, Mice, and Ginney-pigs: or else it resembleth a zone or girdle, or swath ingirting the trunck of the body, as in Bitches, Cats, Ferrets, and the like. In some it is like a chalice, or Acorn cup, comprehending the greater part of the foetus (as in the Hare and the Cony:) where the convexe
part groweth to the Vterus, and the concavous re∣spects the foetus. Likewise in those females which have but one, and that resembling a Cake, though the figure be alike in them all, yet the scituation is unlike. For in a woman it groweth to the bottom of the womb, and is distant a great way, that is by the length of long vessels from the foetus: but in Mice, Ginny-pigs, and Conies, it is annexed partly to the Region of the Loynes, partly to the sides of the breast. But those ani∣mals which have more of these carnous substances then one, they are all of them furnished with teeth in one jaw onely, as Sheep, Cowes, Hinds, Roe-deer, and the like, and yet in these also there is a diversity. For Ewes have more caruncles, and those of different magnitude; the biggest whereof are as large as a Nutmeg; the least, as a Cich-pease, or Vetch: which are also of a round figure, and ruddy complexion, and their convex parts do respect the Uterus, ap∣pearing like soft Warts, or Nipples. But Cowes have greater, flatter, and paler, which are of a spon∣gy consistence, like Mush-rooms: and these seem to take their original from the Chorion. Hindes and Does have five onely; and those bred out of the womb, do protuberate towards the conception, and there exhibit their Cavities. But being firmly fastened to the Uterus, are not easily separated from it; except it be when the birth is drawing nigh; at which time (like ripe fruits) they do very easily forego their former connexion. And being torn off from the womb, I have observed the greater part of the Blood which flowes after∣ward, to issue, not from the Conception, but from the Uterus it self. Fabricius treating of the Union of this Carnous substance with the Vterus, doth labour by many (but weak) arguments to prove, that the Vmbilical
vessels, do join to the extremities of the vessels of the Womb by several insertions: and De form. foet. pag. 122. this he doth undertake, chiefly, to countenance the old opinion received almost by all: for he confesseth that he can deliver nothing certaine touching this matter, because the Carnous substance hinders a man from discovering the truth thereof. But yet neither sense, nor reason do evince, that there are any more Anastomoses in the Vterus, then in the Liver, between the branches of the Gate, and Hollow-vein; or in the Breasts, between the veins which convey blood, and those that waft the Milk. There is indeed, in some places a kind of contigui∣ty or juxtaposition of those vessels, and sometimes an insertion of the one into the Coat of the other; but no where any such coalition, or Vnion, as Fa∣bricius conceiteth. For were it so, the veines ought to be inserted into the Arteries: for the vessels, which do convey blood into the Vterus and Caruncles are Arteries: but they which transport it from the Vterus to the Foetus, are Veins, as is ap∣parent to all men; because they waft the blood from the After-birth into the Hollow-vein. Wherefore the Opinion of Arantius seems to me to be more true; namly that the Orifices of the Um∣bilical vessels are not united to the Orifices of the Vessels of the womb. For there are fewer Ves∣sels conducting blood to the womb, then veins re∣turning it to the foetus: and the greatest part of the propagations of these are terminated in the Chorion. And yet Fabricius, either overswayed by his respects to Antiquity, or his envy to Aran∣tius, doth stubborny persist in the patronage of the old opinion. As concerning the Cotelydones, or Acetabula, cap. 4. De Aceta∣bulis.
Fabricius concludeth nothing certain: but only compileth the several opinions of Antiquity. But we have before, in the History of Hinds and Does, shewed in what Animals these Acetabula are; where we have withal signified, that they are certain litle Cells of small capacity, dispersed through the Caruncles or fleshy substance, and fraught with a white, or gellyish substance: as the Honey-comb is full of Honey. In Hinds, they do fitly resemble the shape of that cavity in the Haunch-bone which receiveth the Bone of the Thigh; and therefore they are by the Greeks called Cotyledones: and in Latine, A∣cetabula, because they resemble those litle Vessels or Sawsers, which were anciently brought to the table with Vineger for sawce. These cavities do not exceed in magnitude the perforations of a large sponge, and into each of them, so many slender sprigs of the Umbilical Vessels do deeply insinuate themselves; because in them is laid up the sustenance of the foetus, and not blood (as Fa∣bricius conceived) but a gelly resembling the thicker white of an egge. Whereby it appears (as we have formerly declared) that the foetus of such as cleave the hoof (as likewise all other) are not susteined by the mothers blood. That which Aristotle delivereth concerning the Hist. an. l. 7. c. 8. Acetabula, that they are diminished as the Foetus doth improve: is contrary to experience; for the larger the foetus, the larger the caruncles also, and their Acetabula, or cavities, are more capacious, and more numerous, and more full of an albugi∣neous juice. If you compress these caruncles, no blood at all doth issue out; but as water, or honey doth
distill out of a squeezed Sponge, or Honey-comb. So in like manner if you press the Acetabula, an albugineous liquor doth drop out; and when that liquor is pressed out, the Acetabula are more contract, pale, and flaggy: and at last do resem∣ble the Nipples of the Breasts, or large falling Warts. Aristotle indeed doth truly affirm, that these A∣cetabula are not in all Animals; for they are not in Women, nor in any else (as far as I know) who have onely one carnous substance in their V∣terus. But as for their office and use: I conceive that all the Caruncles (like Breasts) do not con∣tein blood, but digest a sap, like to the White of an Egge, which they do administer to nourish the foetus. The description of the Vmbilical Vessels, is Of the Navel. elegantly delivered by Fabricius, as his Tables or Pictures of them are very artificial. cap. 2. The Veins, saith he, passing from the Uterus to∣wards the Foetus, are ever united, and improved: nor doth their conjunction give over, until two large Trunks do result out of them all; which penetrating the Navel of the Infant, they do constitute one onely large Trunk; which is inserted into the Liver of the Infant, and perforated into the Hollow and Gate∣vein. In like manner, the Arteries adjoined to these Veins, which are very numerous, and small, passing on from the Womb to the Foetus, and at last uniting their forces together, and so enlarging, do conspire into two large Trunks also; which after they have passed the Navel, do separate themselves and break company from the Veins, and sticking to the sides of the Bladder of Urine, by the help of an intervening Membrane; they do here and there disperse them∣selves
into the branches of the great Artery descend∣ing into the Thighs. But we must take notice that this description given by Fabricius, doth agree only to the Navel of an Infant, and is not common to the foetus of every Animal at large: Nor yet to an Infant neither, but after it is fully formed; for the Arteries (at the beginning,) are inconspi∣cuous, as being so slender, that we have need of the quick sight of a Lynceus to discern them: nor do they indeed reveal themselves afterwards, but only by their pulsation: for in other things they are no way distinguishable from Veins. Because there∣fore (as I have shewed elsewhere) the slender bran∣ches or filaments of the Arteries have no pulsati∣on, (at lest so far as we can discover) they cannot be known from Veins: for they are at that time so thin & subtle, that they are woven to the coats of the veins like the finest threds: or rather do ob∣scurly insinuate themselves into the tunicles of the veins: whereby they are utterly indiscernable. But all the veins (by a retrograde production) uniting their sprigs at last, do all conspire into one Trunk, (as all the branches into one stock) as also the Me∣seraick Veins are all concluded in the Venae Portae. Neer the Embryo, they are divided into two Trunks; but when once they enter into him, they do constitute one onely Navel, which doth termi∣nate in the Hollow-vein, neer the right deaf-eare of the Heart; & passing through the Liver, is inserted into the Gate-vein, and doth scatter no more Pro∣pagations, untill by a very large Orifice it display∣eth it self out of the gibbous part of the liver. So that if you open the Trunk of the Hollow-vein from the deaf-ear of the Heart, downwards, and so exhaust it of all its blood, you may perceive three Orifices as
conjoined together; one whereof is the entrance into the descending Trunk of the Hollow vein, the other is the going out of the Branch of the Liver disseminated through all its gibbous part; but the third is the Original of this Umbilical vein. Where∣by it clearly appeareth, that the original of the veins is not to be sought for in the Liver: because the O∣rifice of the descending Trunk of the Hollow-vein is much larger then the Liver-branch; for the Umbili∣cal branch is as large as that. But the Branches are never said to be the Original of their Trunk, but ra∣ther where the Trunk is largest, there are wee to re∣pute the Original of the branches toreside: now that happeneth at the entrance of the right ventricle of the Heart; and therefore that ventricle is to be acc∣ounted the original, & promptuary of all the veins. I return now to the Umbilical vessels, which are not divided after the same maner in all Animals; for there are found in some 2. or more litle Bran∣ches in the body of the foetus; whereof some pass into the Liver, others into the Vena Portae, or Mese∣raical veins. But in a human foetus, the Trunks of the veins & arteries being involved together, are com∣plicated, some 3. or 4. Fingers breadth from the Navel (as if one should twist so many wax candles together like a cord) being skinned over, and con∣glutinated by the help of a thick & gellyish mem∣membrane. This litle cord passing on to the Chorion, is in the flat part of the After-birth, and interior su∣perficies of the Chorion distributed into several Pro∣pagations; and thence is ramified into many other almost infinite litle Branches; by which the Ali∣ment attracted as it were by so many roots, is de∣rived to the foetus. The Veines relating to this li∣tle Cord, are distinguished in sundry places by
litle knobbs, or warts, as it were by litle bladders full of blood, that so the blood might not rush in too forcibly upon the foetus. By the number of these protuberations, the superstitious Midwives do spend their divination concerning the num∣ber of children yet to come; and in case they finde none of these knobs, they pronounce the Woman barren for the future; and likewise by the distance betweene these protuberati∣ons, they fondly prophesie of the space be∣tween childe and childe; and also of the discri∣mination of the Sex, from the variety of their com∣plexion. Also the constitution of the Umbilical vessels is like to this, in almost all other foetuses which have but one onely Uterine cake; namely, in Bitches, Mice, and others: but the litle cord is in them shorter, and less complicated. But in Cows, Ews, Hindes, Does, Sowes, and other Animals, whose foetus is not sustained by aliment derived from one carnous substance, or cake, but from diverse, the distribution of the Umbilical vessels is also diverse: For the litle branches, or terminations of the vessels are not disseminated through the cake onely, but also (and that chiefly too) without it, through the coat called Chorion, dispatching their most slender fibers thither likewise: just as the distribution of the Umbilical vessels (namely with∣out the litle cord) appeareth in a humane foetus, before the conception is fastened to the Uterus. Whereby it appeareth, that the Embryo doth not derive all his Aliment from the cake; but part thereof, and that the chiefest, from the humor con∣tained in the Chorion. As touching the uses of the Vmbilical vessels,
I do not consent with Fabricius: for he is of opi∣nion that all the blood is derived to the foetus from the Vterus by the veines; and the vital spirits from the mother by the Arteries. He also denyeth, that any part of the foetus in the womb doth execute any publick function: but affirmeth, that each par∣ticular part taketh care onely for it selfe, how it may be nourished, augmented, and preserved. And also, because he findeth no Nerve amongst the Umbilical Vessels, he concludeth the foetus to be void of all Sense and Motion: Implying, that the Mothers Womb, or the Uterine Cake, is as it were the Heart, and Original from whence all things spring to the foetus, and from whence the Influent heat is divided amongst all the parts. All which are manifest mistakes. For the Humane Embryc, when he is not yet four moneths standing in the Womb (and some sooner) exerciseth an op∣parent motion, volutation, and calcitration: es∣pecially if he be prejudiced by extremity of cold or heat, or any other outward inconvenience. Likewise the Punctum saliens it self, (before the Heart is erected) doth stirre by an apparent pulsa∣tion, and also distribute blood, and spirits: and being (as we have observed) reduced to a dying and langiuishing condition by cold, is by the fresh accession of heat, kindled anew, and revived. And also in the Caesarean birth, it is very evident, that the Embryo's life doth not immediately pro∣ceed from the Parent, nor the Spirits result from her: for we have often seen Infants, which have been cut out of their Mothers Womb, survive their Parent for several hours: and have also known a Cony and a Hare which did live, though they were born by incision made upon the Uterus of
their Parents. Moreover, it is a sure way to know whether the Infant that sticketh in the birth be a∣live, or not, by the pulsation of the Vmbilical Ar∣teries. But most certain it is, that those Arte∣ries are not moved by the virtue or operation of the Mothers, but of his own proper Heart: For they keep a distinct time and pawze, from the Mothers pulse: which is easily experimented, if you lay one hand upon the Mothers wrest, and the other on the Infants Navel-string. Nay in a Ca∣sarean Section, when the Embryo's have been yet in∣volved in the membrane called Chorion, I have of∣tentimes found (even when the Mother was ex∣tinct, and stiffe almost with cold) the Vmbilical Arteries beating, and the Foetus himself lusty. Wherefore it is not true, that the Spirits do pro∣ceed to the foetus from the Mothers Arteries: nor is that more true; namely, that the Vmbilical Vessels of the foetus are conjoined by Anastomosis, to the Vessels of the Vterus. For the Foetus en∣joyeth his own proper life, and is furnished with beating Arteries, which are full of Blood, and Spirits long before the conception (in which he is formed, and walloweth) doth cleave to the Vterus: just as it is with Chicken in the Egge. As for the use of the Arteries in the foetus (as also in grown bodies) we have in our Treatise of the Circulation of the blood, demonstrated it to be much different from what hath been former∣ly received: all which is also confirmed from hence. The Secundines; they also are an undeniable part of the Conception, and do depend upon the Foetus, assuming life and their vegetal faculty from him. For as in the Mesentery, the blood
is derived to the Guts, by the branches of the Coeliacal, and Mesenterical Arteries; and that very Blood being circulated by the Veines, doth convey the chyle together with it unto the Liver, and the Heart: so in like manner, the Vmbilical Arteries do derive blood to the Secundines, which blood the Veins do reduce to the Foetus, together with alible juice. And therefore those Arteries do not immediately proceed from the Heart as principal Vessels; but (as instruments of inferiour rank and quality) do arise out of the Crural branches. There came forth a Book of late, wrote by Adrianus Spigelius, entituled De formato Foetu, of the formed foetus: wherein he treateth concer∣ning the Use of the Umbilical Arteries; and doth demonstrate by powerful arguments, that the Foetus doth not receive its Vital Spirits by the Arteries from the Mother: and hath fully answe∣red those arguments which are alledged to the contrary. But he might also as well have pro∣ved by the same Arguments, that the Blood nei∣ther is transported into the foetus from the Mo∣thers Veines by the Propagations of the Umbili∣cal Veins: which is cheifly made manifest by the examples drawn from the Hen-egge, and the Cae∣sarean Birth. For did the Heat and Life flow to the blood from the Mother; she being extinct, the Infant would instantly dye also; (for he must needs be a thing concluded in the same fatality) nay before her: for when death approacheth, the subordinate parts doe first languish, and grow cold, before the principal; and hereupon the Heart declines the last of all. The Blood, I
say, of the Foetus himselfe, should grow chill first, and disproportionate to its Office, as be∣ing derived from the Uterus; seeing that the V∣terus it self, is deprived and destitute of all vital heat, before the Heart.
Of the Conception. FAbricius hath indeed recounted many mira∣culous things, concerning the Birth, but wee meet with more things worthy our wonder con∣cerning the Conception. It is indeed a dark, ob∣scure business; however we shall adventure to propose something in a problematical way, in such sort that it shall appeare we doe not onely goe about to subvert other mens opinions, but also to disclose our owne. And yet whatsoever falleth from me concerning this subject, I desire may not be so taken, as if I conceived them pro∣nounced by an Oracle; but that liberty which I freely allow all other men, I doe of right chal∣lenge to my self; that so I may offer those things as true, which seem probable in such dark mat∣ters, until such time as they can be convinced of falsity or errour. This imployment doth chiefly relate to the Uterus, without whose preparations and functions, you may in vaine expect a Conception. And be∣cause it is certaine, that the Geniture of the Male doth not so much as reach to the cavity of the U∣terus, much less abide there for any time; that geniture doth derive foecundity to the Uterus only by a kinde of contagion, (not as if it were now tangent, and operating, but because it hath for∣merly touched.) The Woman or Female doth seem after the spermatical, contact (in coition) to be af∣fected in the same manner, and to be rendered prolifical, by no sensible corporeal Agent, as the Iron
touched by the Loadstone, is presently indowed with the virtue of the Loadstone, and doth draw other iron-bodies unto it. Namely, having once received that virtue, which we have spoken of, it doth exercise the plastick generative power, and procreateth its own like, no otherwise then plants doe, which we see are impowered with the force of both Sexes. But I cannot but wonder, where that faculty, (when the act of coition is finished, before the production of the Egge or Conception doth reside? and to what that active vertue of the Male is im∣parted? namely, whether to the Uterus alone, or to the whole Female? or rather, primarily to the Uterus, but secondarily to the Female? or lastly, whether, as we see with our eyes, and think with our braines, so a female doth conceive with her Vterus? For though the female sometimes (conceiving after coition) doth not produce a Foetus: yet we know that those Symptomes did ensue, which gave a cleare testimony of a conception set on foot, (though it came to nothing.) Your litle Bitches which are kept too plentifully, and thereupon admit coition (without success) are notwithstan∣ding observed to be sluggish about the just time whereat they ought to puppy, and bark as if they were in distress, and likewise filtch away the young whelps from another Bitch, and lick them over and cherish them, (as tenderly as if they were their own natural productions) and fight eagerly to keep them from the true Parent. Nay some of them have milk, or beestings (as they call it) in their teats; and are obnoxious to the distempers incident to those that have really pup∣pied;
just as Hennes will cluck in their season, though they have no eggs at all to sit upon. Some kinde of birds (as namely Pigeons) if they ad∣mit coition at the wonted time, though they lay no eggs at all, or subventaneous ones onely, yet are possessed with their usual sedulity & providence of building nests. For the vertue proceeding from the Male, doth so largely fructifie the whole Female, that it pro∣duceth a thorough change and alteration, as well in the frame of their minds, as in the constitution of their bodies. And though this doe principal∣ly happen to the Vterus fitted for the impression; and from thence the power and efficacy thereof be derived to the whole body; (as from the tur∣gent testicles of the Male, there is an accession of strength superadded to the whole body) yet the same scruple remaines: namely, how this pow∣er communicated to the Vterus it selfe, doth in∣here in it? as whether in the whole Vterus, or in any one part of it onely? For there is nothing to be found abiding therein after coition: for the geniture of the Male doth either suddenly fall out againe, or vanish away, and the blood doth circulate againe from the uterus, by the ves∣sels. Besides, what preparation or maturity of the V∣terus is it, that doth require the genitall seed; or from whence doth it proceed? for unless the ute∣rus be prepared for coition, all other attempts are frustrate; nay several animals doe not admit co∣ition it self, without they be thus prepared. That maturity, I confess, doth sooner befall them, by reason of their converse with the Male, and the incitements which he useth to provoke them; yet
it is procured (as that ripeness of fruits in plants) by natures owne inclination and tendency. But what this Alteration is, I shall now deli∣ver, according as I have found it by experi∣ence. First of all the uterus appears thicker and more fleshy: and afterwards (forasmuch as concern∣eth the interiour superficies, which is the place where the future conception is to be received) it groweth more tender, answering in lubri∣city and softness to the internal ventricles of the Braine, as we have even now affirmed concern∣ing Hindes, and other creatures which cleave the hoofe. But in Bitches, Cats, and other multipa∣rous Animals, whose feet are distinguished into toes, the hornes of the Wombe doe exactly resem∣ble the litle smooth trumpets of a womans womb, or the appendixes of the guts of Birds, or the U∣reters in Men: and in some places have litle knobs which doe swell inward, and become exceeding soft, through which, after coition (as we have observed in Hinds and Does) as if they did open themselves, the first albugineous humours doe transpire into the capacity of the Uterus, out of which humours the Conception or Egge is for∣med. And this is the manner how the Uterus is by the Coition of the Male (like Fruit by the Summer heat) impregnated, and heightned into the highest pitch of maturity. But because there are no manifest signs of Con∣ception visible, before the Uterus doth begin to open, and the albugineous liquor, or slender threads, (like the Spiders web) and the first rudi∣ments of the future Egge or Conception appear: and seeing the substance of the Uterus, now ready
for Conception, doth so neerly resemble the Con∣stitution of the Braine: why may we not ima∣gine, that both their functions are also alike; and that something like, if not the selfe same thing that the phantasme, or appetite is to the brain, is excited in the Uterus: from which the genera∣tion or procreation of the Egge doth succeed? for both their functions are equally called concep∣tions, and both are Immaterial; though they be the principles of all the actions of the body: name∣ly this, of the Natural, that of the Animal actions: this the first cause and principle of all actions re∣lating to the generation of Animals, & that of all actions tending to their preservation. And as Appe∣tite doth spring from the conception of the braine, and that conception from the outward appetible or desirable objects: So also from the Male (as being the more perfect Animal) as from the most natural ap∣petible object, the natural conception dotharise in the Uterus, as the Animal conception in the Brain. And from this Appetite or Conception it com∣eth to pass, that the female doth produce an off∣spring like the male Genitor. For as we, from the Conception of the Form, or Idea, in the Braine, do fashion a form like to it in our works, so doth the Idea or Species of the Genitor, residing in the Uterus, by the help of the formative facul∣tie, beget a Foetus like the Genitor himself; name∣ly by implanting that Immaterial species which it hath, upon its Workmanship. In like manner as Art, which is the , or Species of the future work, doth produce a Like in its operation, and generate it in the matter: As the Builder erects a House, according to his pre-received conception. And the same thing happeneth in other produ∣ctions,
and artificial generations. So that what discipline doth effect in the Braine, namely Art, that in proportion doth the Coition of the Male effect in the Uterus, namely the plastical Art: whereby several foetuses are procreated either like or unlike, by the same Coition. For if the Ge∣nerations, and first artificial conceptions (which are onely imitations of the natural) are thus pro∣duced by the Braine; how much more probable is it, that the Exemplars of Animal Generati∣on and conception, are in like manner produced by the Uterus. And because Nature (all whose works are admirable and divine) doth institute such an Or∣gan (namely the Braine) by whose sensitive fa∣culty and virtue, the conceptions of the rational soule doe exist; namely Desires, and Arts, and the Principles and Causes of so many several pro∣ductions, whereof man (by the motive faculty of the Braine) is the Author by Imitation; why shall we not think, that the same Nature, which hath contrived the Womb, which is a no lesse ad∣mirable Organ then the Braine, and hath framed it of a like constitution to execute the office of Conception, hath designed it also to a like fun∣ction, or at least to one which beareth an Analo∣gy with it: and that Nature did intend an Or∣gan which is every way like the Braine, to an imployment, like to that to which the Braine is assigned? For since a skilful Artificer, doth ac∣complish his Workmanship, by his ingenious proportioning one Instrument to one thing, and the same to the same, and the like to the like: So that by the materials and shape of his Instru∣ments, a man may easily judge of their use and
actions; no less then Aristotle hath instructed us, to know the nature of Natural Bodies, by Analyt. l. 2. c. 35. their conformation, and the Fabrick of their Parts; and the Art of Physiognomy, doth by lineaments and parts of the face (as the Eye, Nose, Fore-head, &c.) give judgement of the manners and dispositions of Men: What shall hinder us, out of the same fabrick of parts, to pass our conjecture that their Office is al∣so the same? But such is the preposterous success of things, that when we come to debate customary and fa∣miliar things, their frequency doth diminish their greatness, and admiration which is due unto them; but when matters of less consequence (but such as are more unusual) do present themselves, wee instantly magnifie them be∣cause of their novelty and rarity. Whosoe∣ver shall weigh with himself, how the brain of the Artist, or the Artist himself by virtue of his brain, doth form things which are not present with him, but such as he only hath formerly seen, so much to the life: and how litle birds which immure themselves all win∣ter long, do exactly chant, and recall to minde those Ditties, the next Spring, which they had learned the Summer before, though they did never practise them all the while; and which is yet more strange, how a litle bird will most artificially contrive a Nest (whereof shee never saw any platform before) and that not from her memory, or any habit implanted in her, but onely by meere phansie: and how a young Spider, without any pattern, or brain, by the help of phansie onely, doth
dispose her web; whosoever, I say, doth di∣ligently ponder these things, will, I con∣ceive, not think it an absurd or monstrous matter, for a woman to become the efficient cause of Generation, being impregnated by the conception of a generall, immateriall Idea. I know full well, that some scoffing per∣sons will laugh at these conjectures; appro∣ving nothing but their owne private inven∣tions. Yet this is the wont of Philosophers, when they cannot clearly discover how things themselves are brought about, to conceive some way consonant to the course of nature, and the next borderer upon truth her selfe, how such matters may be atchieved. And, indeed, all those Opinions (which we now cry up) were at first meere figments, and ima∣ginations; untill they wrought a solid credit in us, by sensible experiment, and were ra∣tified by their necessary knowne causes. Aristo∣tle saith, That Philosophers are in some sort lo∣vers of Fables, because a Fable doth consist of Metaph. l. 1. c. 2. strange things. And, indeed, those who were first possessed with the admiration of things, did advance Philosophy. And for my owne particular, since I plainly see that nothing at all doth remaine in the Uterus after coi∣tion, whereunto I might ascribe the principle of generation; no more then remaines in the braine after sensation, and experience, whereun∣to the principle of Art may be reduced; but finding the constitution to be alike in both, I have invented this Fable. Let the Learned and ingenious stock of men consider of it; let the supercilious reject it: and for the scoffing
ticklish generation, let them laugh their swinge. Because, I say, there is no Sensible thing to be found in the Uterus, after coition; and yet there is a necessity, that something should be there, which may render the female fruit∣full; and that (in probability) can be no corporeal essence; we have no refuge left us, but to fly to meere Conception, and reception of Species without any matter; namely, to apprehend, that the same thing is effected in the womb, as in the Braine: unless some cunning Phi∣losopher, whom the Gods have better provided for, can finde out some efficient cause, which is not concluded in our recapitulation. Some Philosophers, even of our owne time, have furbushed over the old opinion concern∣ing the Atomes: and doe therefore conceive, that this Contagion (as also all other) doth proceed from the most subtle effluviums, or e∣manations of the masculine seed, which do easi∣ly transpire after the manner of Odours, and so are shot into the Uterus at the time of coi∣tion. Some againe raise up certaine incorpo∣real spirits, like so many Agents, Angels, or Dae∣mons. Others understand a Contagion, like to a kinde of ferment, or sower levening. Others phansie, and imagine otherwise. Allow there∣fore, amongst others, some place for this conjecture of mine, untill there be some cer∣tainty established in the business. I have observed many things, which will easily extirpate the recited opinions of other men: (so that now it is much more obvious to say what it is not, then what it is) but those Observations relate not to this place,
but must be proposed elsewhere. At the pre∣sent I shall say this onely: If that which we commonly call Contagion, as being derived from the spermatical contact in coition, and re∣maining behinde in the female, (when the Geniture it selfe is not then in presence) is the efficient and operatour of the future procreation: if, I say, this Contagion (whether it be A∣tomes, or Odour, or Ferment, or whatsoever else) be free from the nature of a body, it must of necessity be an incorporeal thing. And if moreover, upon enquiry it do appear, to be neither a Spirit, nor a Daemon, nor a Soul, nor any part of a Soul, nor yet something which hath a Soul (as I conceive I can demonstrate by several arguments, and experiments.) What re∣mains, since I can imagine nothing else, nor no man hath hitherto dreamed of any other thing, but freely to profess my self to be at a stand? But He that doubts & admires, saith Aristotle, doth con∣fess Ibid. he doth not know. Wherefore, if to avoid the stain of Ignorance, ingenuous Men turn Philosophers, it is cleare, that they pursue Knowledge, for Know∣ledge sake, and not for any other use. Wee ought not therefore to be condemned, if being desirous of knowing things, and upon that account walking in untrodden paths, wee set before you something, which, at first blush, may seem fabulous, and fictitious. For as all things are not to be swallowed with too much credulity; so those things which have been exactly and long considered, are not utterly to be despised, though they doe not appeare so rare to sharp-witted men. Aristotle himself wrote a Book de Mirabili∣bus Metaph l. an. .
Auditis, of Heare-say Wonders. And in another place hee saith, That wee must not onely pay thankes to them, to whose Opinions a man may safely subscribe; but to those also who have spoken but superficially to the purpose. For even they also are of some use, for they exercise our habits. For had not Timotheus been, wee had lost a great deale of Musicke: And yet if Phrynis had not been, Timotheus had not been existent neither. In like manner they who have delivered any kinde of truth; for wee have re∣ceived some Opinions from some Philosophers, and yet some others were the occasion of these Philosophers. And therefore being moved by the example and authority of so Gallant a person as Ari∣stotle, least I might seem made up of nothing but the subversion of other mens Doctrines; I have chosen rather to propose a feigned Opi∣nion, then none at all: and have contented my self in this place to play the Phrynis to Timotheus; viz. to shake off the sloth and drowziness of the Age wee live in, and to awaken the wits of Industrious heads, permitting rather that abler men should sport themselves with my proposals, then that any carefull Enquirer into the nature of Things should accuse mee of sluggishness. Truth is, a man cannot search after a more august Theorem, nor learn any thing of more use, then this; namely, How all things are produced by an Univocal Agent? or after what manner the same thing doth still gene∣rate the same? and that not onely in the productions of Art, (for so a House erects a House, one Face limnes another, and one I∣mage
formeth another Image) but in those al∣so which relate to the Minde: as a Minde be∣gets a Minde; and one Opinion another Opi∣nion. Democritus his Atomes, and Eudoxus his Chiefest Good placed in Pleasure, did impreg∣nate Epicurus: Empedocles his Foure Elements, Aristotle: the Doctrine of antient Thebes, Py∣thagoras and Plato: and Geometrie, Euclid. Just in this manner is the Son borne like the Father; and the Virtues which doe innoble a Family, and the Hereditary Vices also, are sometimes after many Generations transported to Posterity: some Diseases also produce their like in other subjects; as the Leprosie, the Gout, Syphilis, or French-Pox, and so forth. But what talke I of Diseases, since Succession Arist. hist. an. l. 7. c. 6. &, de gen. an. l. 1. c. 17 l. 7. c. 11. hath at a vast remove, repeated the very Moles, Warts, and Scarres, which the Great∣grand-sires formerly wore? The marke of the Familie (saith Plinie) is repeated in the armes of the Daci, every fourth Birth. That Minde, Opinion, and those very Manners, which are now out of use, may many yeares hence (when all those are decryed, which are now received) returne againe. For the Eternall minde of the Divine Creatour; which is imprinted in Things, doth create the I∣mage of it selfe in Humane Concepti∣ons. Having therefore overcome some difficul∣ties which relate to this Subject, I have a strong desire to discourse the Matter more closely: that what I have hitherto deli∣vered cursorily, may seeme to carry a fairer probability at least with it, and
also to excite the Wits of Studious men, to make a deeper search into the bu∣sinesse. Therefore (that we may illustrate the thing the better) let A stand for the fruitfull egge (name∣ly the matter of the fruitfull chicken) which is al∣terable and convertible into a chicken, or is a chick∣en in posse: and let B stand for that which fructifi∣eth the egge, distinguishing it from a subventane∣ous egge: namely, the efficient cause of the chick∣en, or that which doth alter the Egge, and con∣vert or terminate it into a chicken. And C for the chicken it selfe, or final cause, for whose sake both the Egge, and that which fructifieth the Egge doe exist: namely, the act, or reason of the chicken. Now we take it for granted (which Aristotle doth demonstrate) that every first Mover or Alte∣rer is together with that thing which is moved or altered by it. Now those things are most pro∣perly said to be simul, together, which are gene∣rated at the same time: so that movens & mobile the thing altering, and the thing altered are actu∣ally together, and in case one of them be, the other must needs bee also; for of necessity if the effect be in being, the cause thereof must also be. Whensoever therefore A (namely the fruitful Egge, is actually in Being; B likewise (namely the internal mover, and efficient, or fructifier) is actu∣ally in being also. But whensoever B is actually existent, C also, (at least in some sort) namely the Species of the chicken, or the form without matter is existent. For B is the internal efficient of the chicken; that is to say, that thing which doth
move, or alter) A, (namely the Egge) into C, namely the Reason of the chicken. That therefore every moving thing, may be together with the thing that is moved; and every cause with the thing caused, it is necessary that C, should exist together with B, because the Final cause, as well in Nature, as Art, is the first of all the causes; for it moveth, and is it selfe not moved: But the effi∣cient moveth, because it is incited by the finall cause. For there is in every efficient, in some sort, ratio finis, the reason of the End or finall cause; by which final cause, the efficient, opera∣ting with providence, is moved. Aristotles Authority is clearly on our side. de part. an. l. 1. c. 1. That seemeth, saith he, to be chiefest amongst Natu∣ral causes, which we signifie under this notion, Cu∣jus Gratia, for whose sake: For that is the reason; but the reason is the first cause as well in Natural, as Artificial effects. For when the Physitian doth define Health, and the Mason a House, by either the Intel∣lect, or by Sense, he useth to render the reasons and causes of the thing which he doth effect, and also subjoineth the reason why hee maketh it so: though that cause which is the cause for whose sake, which is the cause, and reason of the good and faire, is rather conjoined to the works of Nature, then of Art. But the End, saith he, is the thing for whose Phys. l 2. tract. 3. sake: as the thing for whose sake we walk, is Health. For if you aske, why a man doth walk, we reply, to continue his Health: and having made that answer, we conceive we have rendered the cause thereof. And therefore whatsoever is interposed, some other thing moving thereunto, is done for the Ends sake: as Extenuation is procu∣red
for Health sake, or Purgation, or Physick, or any other instruments, for all those are for the Ends sake. And a while after. But we ought al∣wayes to seek out the first cause of every thing: as in other matters. As a man buildeth because he is a Builder: but he is a Builder by reason of his Art of building: this therefore is the first cause: and so it is in all things whatsoever. And hereupon he affirmeth, that, that cause which doth first move, and in which the Reason and de gen. an. l. 2. c. 1. form doth lye, is a worthier, and more divine cause, then the material. In every Natural Generation of Animals there∣fore, both the matter out of which, and the efficient by which (namely A, the thing mo∣ved, and B, the thing moving) are both for the sake of the Animal already begotten, or which is to be begotten: because that which moveth, and is not moved it selfe, namely C, is alike in them both. For both they (namely A, & B,) are both movable, and moved; namely the thing fructifying, which is B, (which doth both move and is moved,) and that thing which is fructified, which is A, namely the Matter or Egge, which is onely moved or altered. Wherefore if no moveable thing be actually moved, unlesse the thing moving be together present with it. Certainly, neither shall the Matter be moved, nor the Efficient move or ef∣fect any thing, unlesse the first mover bee in some sort present too: viz. the form, or species which is without Matter, and is the principal cause. For the Efficient and Generant (accor∣ding de gen. an. l. 2. c. 4. to Aristotle) as they are such, do belong to that which is effected, and generated. And
therefore it is a syllogisme framed out of the first and necessary causes: namely, Whensoever B is actually ex∣istent, C also is actually existent: (namely, moving in some sort) Whensoever A is actually ex∣istent, B is also actually existent. Therefore, whensoever A is actually existent, C also is actually existent. Indeed Natural, and Artificial Generation are after one and the same manner. For both are instituted for the sake of something, and doe alike out of a kinde of providence di∣rect themselves to a proposed End: for both are first moved by some conceived form, which is immaterial, and is produced by Conception. For the Braine is the Organ of Arist. de part. an. l. 1. c. 6. the Conception of the one, (for Art is the Rea∣son of the Worke) (devoyd of all Mat∣ter) in the Soule, whose Organ the Braine is) but the Uterus, or Egge of the O∣ther. The Conception therefore of the Egge, or Uterus, is (in some sort) like the Con∣ception of the Braine it selfe, and both
of them doe alike partake of the End. For the Species, or Forme of the Chicken is in the Uterus, or Egge, without any mat∣ter at all: as the reason of the Work is in the Artificer, and the Reason of the House, in the Brain of the Builder. But because,  inesse, this word, to bee in, is perhaps an Equivocal word, and things may bee said to bee Simul, toge∣ther, severall wayes; therefore we say, and affirme, that the Species and Immateriall Forme of the future Chicken is Aliquo modo, in some sort, the cause of the pregnation, and fecundity of the Uterus: because, after coition, there is no corporeal thing found therein. But how this Immateriall cause, as the principle, can be alike in the Braine, and in the Vterus, and how they agree among themselves, or doe differ, namely the Con∣ceptions of the Braine, and of the Vterus, or Art, and Nature; and in what manner, that which fructifieth (namely, the internal Efficient cause of the procreation of an Ani∣mall) is in the Male, and its Geniture; in the Female and her Wombe; in the Egge also, or mixt Workmanship of both; and what the difference betweene them is: here∣after, when wee shall treat Universally of the Generation of all Animals (even of those also, which are generated by Metamor∣phosis; namely, of Insects, and Spontaneous Productions, in whose Egges, or first Rudi∣ments, there is a plaine Species or Imma∣teriall forme, as being the moving principle in regard of those things which are to be
produced, as also in all other Seed whatso∣ever) and also when we shall discourse of the Soule, and its affections; and also how Arts, Memory, and Experience, are onely the Conceptions of the Brain, wee shall endeavour both largely, and perspicuous∣ly to explaine. FINIS.
