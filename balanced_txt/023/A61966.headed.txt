The Suffering CASE Of the PEOPLE commonly Called QUAKERS, Relating to OATHES and SWEARING, Humbly Offered. IT is not unknown to this Nation, that ever since we were a People, it hath been our Principle not to Swear, make or take Oathes, which He who is the searcher of all Hearts knows, is no other than a Case of pure Conscience, in tender Obedience to the Mind of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as we are fully per∣swaded, according as many Eminent Martyrs, and Men of Wisdom and Renown were who Testified against Oathes and Swearing in the Gospel∣Day, and not any Obstinacy, Disaffection or Worldly Interest whatsoever on our parts: We being really Willing and Desirous to Answer the Just and Good Ends of Law and Government, as a peaceable People fearing God, and for this Cause of not Swearing we have been exposed to great Sufferings and Inconveniences in our Persons and Estates, by tedious Im∣prisonments, and Disabled from Receiving Our due Debts, or defending Our Just Titles and Properties; not suffered to give Evidence in Courts of Judicature at Common or Civil Law, nor to Answer in Chancery or Ex∣chequer, prove Wills and Testaments, or take Administrations, or to pro∣ceed in our Trades at Custom-House, or be admitted to our Lands, or Trusted in our Duties and Services in Courts Leet, and Courts Baron, but great Advantage is taken against us, because we so fear an Oath, as that we Dare not Swear: For which cause also our Children and Young Men are not Allowed their Freedoms in Cities or Corporations, when they have Faithfully served out their Apprentiships. Nor admitted to give our Voices in Elections of Magistrates, and Parliament Members in divers Places, tho known to have Right thereunto as Free-holders, &c. VVherefore Our Request is, That in all Cases where OATHES are Imposed, and Swearing Required, Our Word, that is, our Solemn Affirmation or Denial as in the fear and pre∣sence of God may be accepted instead of an OATH, for which we Humbly Offer, and freely submit, that if any under the same Profession, among us, break their Word, or be found false in such their Affirmation or Denial, or guilty of Falshood in any Unsworn Testimony, Evidence, or Answers, That then such Penalty be in∣flicted on the Person so Offending, as Law and Justice Require in Case of False Swearing or Perjury.
