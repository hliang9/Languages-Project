The History of Valentine a Chap. I. How King Pepin gave his Sister Bellisant in  to Alexander, Emperour of Constantinople; and how  Priest made Love to her, and the Misery that ensued ther  and of the Birth of Valentine and Orson. IN former time reigned a potent and wise King in France, wh had a fair and virtuous Sister, having in her all the perfecti∣ons of Nature; this Lady was nam'd Bellisant, the fame of her running thro many Countries, at last fame spread it felf in∣to the ears of Alexander, Emperour of Constantinople, who being striken in love, with the fame of her beauty, shipp d himself, with his Train of Nobles, for the Kingdom of France, (renowned at that time thro the World;) having a prosperous gale he soon lan∣ded, and journy'd to the Court, and shortly after his arrival, he declares the cause: King Pepin knowing this, prepared great tri∣umphs for the celebrating this noble contract: great joy there was on every side, being nobly entertained in great honour, as be∣fitted their estates? as soon as the marriage-feast was done pre¦paration was made for their departing to Constantinople  not long after the arrived, and were received with  nor and  ou would think it now  two  tur  an
er to speak, and presently banish'd her his Court and  ompanied only with one Man called Blandiman, these  ight and day, till they come to the Kingdom of France  entations began of fresh, not daring to appear before  her, King Pepin, being under this disgrace; and being  d near Paris, she fell in travel, and her Man rode for a , but before he could return, she was delivered of two s to her great joy; but see what followeth, a bear crossing the ood, violently takes one of the Babes and bears it to her den; the Empress lays the other down, ond runs after the bear, but all in vain, at last, being tired out, she fainting to the ground; in the mean time King Pepin, being a hunting, comes by where the Child lay, and seeing it to be a pretty Babe sends it to his Court to be brought up nobly. Blandiman being returned, and finding the Empress in that condition, recovers her, but she fills the air with cries and lamentations, and travesting on they were taken by Giant Ferrgaus, and imprison'd, where we'll leave 'em, and see what became of her two Sons. Chap. II. How Valentine being brought up in King Pepin's Court, increased daily in Strength and Vertues; and how Or∣son became a Wild-man in the Wilderness among the Beasts. as before I rehearsed, having sent the Child, Va∣  Paris to be brought up, at long  n apt∣  d∣  wn  the
somuch that she gave it sock, which nourishment caus'd th Child to grow hairy rough like a beast, and exceeding strong, and he soon began to run up and down the woods, fighting with, and devouring other beasts, and grew extreem rte, insomuch that no Man dur approach near where this Wild-man was; his renown spread∣ing itself in a small time thro all the Kingdom of France, that all the Country round about chased and hunted him; he feared no wea∣pons but snapped them asunder: he wore no garments, nor had any kind of speech. In the mean time Valentine increased in knowledge and wisdom exceedingly, and was greatly beloved of all the Court; and now the Squire that had the charge of him, pre∣sented him before the King, whom the King placed with his own Daughter Eglantine, which caused many murmurings against his greatness, saying, 'That at best he was but a Bastard. In the mean time it chanc'd that there came into Orleans divers Imbas∣sadors from the Pope. demanding id against the Sarazens, who had lately taken the City of Rome. King Pepin understanding this, prepares a great Army to make resistance against them. Amongst the rest, Valentine was made a Chief Commander; when they were come to Rome, King Pepin desir'd battle, and fain would understand the state of the City; and it was told him, that the Admiral of the Sarazns had surprized the City, and put ll without the sword. The King lays close siege to the City, and calls h s Barons and Officers of his Army, desiring them to find out a Man to bear a letter to the Admiral, which none did d to undertake; Valantine stepped before the King, and said, Mighty, Soveraign. If you be pleas'd, I will carry the lette, and deliver the message, and shall not fear to speak to the proud Pagan Ad∣miral, and to the whole Host of Pagans, were their number twice as many as they be. The King hearing this, was exceeding joy∣ful, marvelling at his courage; whereupon he drew a letter of de∣fiance, and gave to him, who took his leave of the King, and went to the City, and came to the place where the Admiral lay, and salu∣ted him thus, The Gods preserve the Noble and Puissant King Pepin, my Dread Soveraign, and Mahomet, whom thou serve save and defend thee, Renowned Admiral. When Valentine had thus said, the Admiral roused himself in his chair, and with a frown reply'd, 'Messenger, return, and get thee out of my sight, and say unto King Pepin, I will him either to renounce his faith, and believe in Mohomet, or else let him look to receive no o∣ther sentence than death; and get thee gone, make no longer stay,
for my heart is inraged against thee. But his high words no∣thing daunted our Warrior, but he mildly said, High and Mighty Admiral, do not imagine that by pride and presumtion, I come before you, until you hear the cause thereof. Then said the Ad∣miral, Say on, Valentine reply'd, I was accused before the King for a Coward, and that since I come I would have run from Camp; for which he vowed to smite off my head: I hearing this, sought rather to save my life, man to lose both life and ho∣nour, and therefore I gave out, That I would come and desire you on the King's behalf, to break two spears with you to try your valour, and win my lost honour; therefore I desire you would grant my request, otherwise I dare not return. The Admiral hearing this cunning tale, said, I swear by Mahomet, thou shalt not be refused; and to the end the French may see it. I'll ordain the just without the City. Valentine fell down and kissed his hand, desiring a Confessor, telling him he was afraid he should be slain, which he granted, and presently sent him a Christian Priest, when Valentine tells his plot how to surprize the City, that when he Pagans came forth to see the justs he should cause the Christi∣ans to surprize the Cowards, and shut the gates, which was after∣wards, effected. The time being come, and the Champions arm'd they took their way towards the chief gate of the City, on that side King Pepin lay; they being entred the first, there was a great noise in the French Camp for joy, which caus'd the Pagans to issue th to behold the usts; in the mean time the Fryer having plaid his part in the City, the Christians possess the gates, so that no entrance could be expected: all things being ready, each of them va∣liantly prepares to encounter, and each touching his spear, the first course they shiver'd them all in pieces, each admiring the o∣r's strength, then making a second, Valentine got the better, for which his a charged against the Admiral's breast, he gave him such a stroak that  run his spear quite thro his body, so he fell dead from his hose; which caused the Pagans to run on Valentine with naked swords to kist him, which had been effected, had not the King suddenly with his Hst rush'd into his aid: Here our noble Hero, Mirror of Chivalry, wr saved the life of the King by hor∣sing him again: At length the Christians prevailing, the Pagans began to retire to the City, which finding shut, there they misera∣bly perish'd by the sword: and the City was reduc'd to his former obedience; and King Pepin was with much magnificence crown'd Emperour of Rome, to the great honour of Valentine, who beha∣  well that day.
Chap. III. How Valentine, after his return from Rome, re to the Forrest of Orleance, and there Conquered Orson, and brought him with him to Orleance; and how Haufry and Henry, Sons to King Pepin, took Counsel how to take away Valentine's Life, and what ensued thereupon. KIng Pepin after he was return'd from Rome, every day more and more shewed his love to Valentine, to the great grief of Houfry and Henry, Bastard-sons to the King, and in their hearts they did daily hatch mischief: and they hearing of the mischief the Wild-man did in the forrest, and the daily complaints made of his great injuries, endeavour'd to perswade Valentine to undertake this conquest, who being of an heroick spirit, and undaunted va¦lour, was always wisling to rush into any hazard wherein he might win honor: At length he sets a resolution to go and fight the Wild-man, and either to die or conquer him, chusing rather to die in ho¦nour, than live in disgrace: which resolution much rouled the King, and he grew angry at his two Sons, who had laid this plo to take away the life of Valentine, and did disswade him as much as he could from it; but it was in vain, for go he will and so he sets forward on his journy, accompanied only with his Page; and so he rode one whole day in the forrest seeking the Wild man, but could not find him so he lay down and refreshed himself till morning: As soon as day appeared, he espyed his Brother Orson running to him, and seeing Valentine's horse stand ty'd, he fell furiously clawing him, whch the horse feeling, began to fling and kick; Valentine being on a tree noted the Wild-man's terrible shape, and began to be timerous; In the mean time the Wild-man had near slain his horse, which Valentine perceiving, cries out to the Wild man, Save my horse, and stay till I come down, and thou shalt have fight∣ing enough with me. With that the Wild-man espied him and made signs as if he would tear him to pleces; he drawing his sword leap'd down close by him, and smote at him with his sword, which he leaping aside escaped, and presently cotching Vaentine, throws him to the ground, which caused him to look for nothing but death, feeling the strength of the Wild-man to be so great; being thus on the ground, Valentine try'd to get Orson under him, but an in van; at length drew pocket-dagger out and smote him on the de that the blood ran out Orson seeing himsel wounded gave such a secreeth that all the wood sounded therewith, and running a,
gain on him threw him to the groud again, and wounded him in di∣vers places; but Valentine recovering, laid about him very fiercely, and brought the Wild man to his obedience, then tying his hands to his horse-tail, he rode towards Orleance; and as he came the People run away for fear, and being to lodge in a little Town that Night, the Inhabitants seeing the Wild-man with him, run a∣way: they took up their lodging at one of the best houses in the Town, where they went into the wine cellar, and Orson drinking too much become drunk; morning being come, he was bound as before, and so they rode, to Orleance, where bring come, the People shut up their doors for fear; at length tydings came to King Pepin, that Valentine had conquer'd the Wild man, the King was greatly astonished, and said, Ah Valentine! my Child in a happy hour thou was born, blessed be the Father that got thee, and the Mother that bore thee. When Valentine came to the Palace gates, the Porter espying Orson, shut the gates, till Va∣latine said to him, Fear not, but go tell the King, I'll shield him and the Court from the fury of the Wild-man. The King com∣manded them to enter the Palace: Then Valentine took Orson and led him into the Court where the King and his Nobles were, among the rest were Haufry and Henry, and seeing Valentine more honoured than before grew enraged, and therefore resolv'd to lay a plot to cut him off, and understanding that Valentine was gone to their Sister Eglantine's lodgings to make sport with Orson, they thought it fit to kill him there, and inform the King they found him in her bed; so they presently rushed in with their swords drawn, and calling him Traytor smote at him, and wounded him in the face: Orson perceiving that, leapt to them, and crushed them between his Arms, and then struck them to the ground, and had not the Ladies appeased the uproar, they had there been slain. Haufry and Henry mad with rage that there purpose did not take effect, runs to the King, making a grevious complaint against them. The King sends for Valentine, and hearing the truth, bid him be∣ware of Haufry and Henry, and so dissmissed him. This plot not taking, they resolve on another far more dangerous than the for∣mer, they joyn to their aid their Cosin Grigar, who was to lye in ambuse with one hundred Men at Arms to take Valentine as he rid that way, and when they'd taken him, to carry him to a strong Castle in the forrest, and there imprison him; so it came to pass that as Valentine, with Orson running by him, was riding that way where the Ambush lay, out stept Grigar their Captain, and
Our Warriour considering how he was encompassed with his E∣nemies, was resolved to sell his life at a dear rate, and he that stood nearest him tasted first of his been sword; the first that he en∣countered he cleft down to his teeth, the next he cut asunder in the midst; in the mean while Orson was not idle, but with his rough paws tore their flesh from their bodies, and bit them to pieces with his teeth, and thus they continued fighting, killing and wound∣ing many, but all in vain, the number being so many, and being tired with the press that came upon him, he was taken and carried away, do all that Orson could, who follow'd  to the Castle where they imprisoned him, and then ran again to the Court of King Pepin, and into the midst of the hall, where the King and his Nobles were at dinner and run about the hall makeing strange lamentations, and knocking his breast in a most hideous end fear∣ful manner, which did drive the King into a thousand fears; at length Orson looking round the table, espied the Traytor Grigar, who hung his head in his bosom, but Orson seeing him, run furi∣ously upon him, and gave him such a grievious stroke that smote off one of his ears, and laid him on his face, and put out one of his eyes: Grigar feeling his wounds, began to cry out for help, at last a valiant Prince releued him, and brought Orson before the King, desiring he might be put to death: but Orson being before he the King, made sighs oat Valentine was taken in the Forrest he and demanded the combat with Grigar, which with the consent of King and Nobles was granted, between whom was fought a cruel battle, but at length through Orson's strength, and the just∣ness of his cause, he overcame Grigar, and he openly confessed the treason before King Pepin, and they presently sent and re∣eased Valentine, to the great joy of the Court, who admired the save that Orson bore to him.
Chap. IV. How Valentine and Orson travelled to Aquitain, to the Relief of the Lady Fezon; and how Orson overcame the Green Knight, and how they came to the Castle of the Lady Clerimond, whereby Orson recover'd his Speech. VAlentine and Orson being returned with King Pepin into Or∣leance, but being not minded to stay there, they resolved to go to Aquitan, to endeavour the delivery of the fair Lady Fezon, the Duke's Daughter, whose City was closely besieged by a Pagan Knight, call'd, the Green Knight; and this Duke was to bring one to conquer this Green Knight, or else he was to take his Daugh∣ter: so they took their leave of King Pepin; Valentine resolving not to return till he had found his Parents: Being come to Aqui∣tain, People stock'd from all parts to behold the unmanly shape of Orson, which caused Valentine to get him an iron-jacket; when they came to the Duke's Palace, he entertain'd them nobily, and sent for the Green Knight to dine with him, which he accepted, on∣ly that he might have a sight of the beautiful Lady Fezon and he began to speak proud speeches, and told them they should be hanged on a tree, as many of their Fellows had been; which Valentine hearing answer'd, Proud Knight, these taunts might have been buried within thy breast, for I tell thee, this day is come hither a Knight that shall hold thee tack: thou hast vanquished many, he it is shall vanquish thee. Orson knew Valentine spoke of him, and knowing this to be the Green Knight who had slain so many, with a fierce countinance leapt from the table, and taking him a∣bout the middle, threw him with such violence against the wall that they thought his neck had been broke; at this action they began to laugh, and said to one another, Now is the Knight come that shall overcome the Green Knight. Orson made signs that he would fight him the next day, for the love of the Lady Fezon: morning being come, Valentine armed him with his own arms, and so he departed to combat, and made signs that he would bring the Knight with him dead or alive: It was not long e're Orson came to the tent of the Green Knight and smote the top with his spear in defiance: he taking this in disdain, swore by Mahomet, he would abate his pride e're the sun went down; and then couching his spear in his rest, he enter'd the field against Orson, and encoun∣tred with such force, that both Men and horses fell to the ground, but lightly recovering their feet, drew their swords, and laid at
each other fiercely; the Green Knight parted Orson's shield and wounded him on the shoulder; he finding his blood run down, was far more fierce than before, and at last with his sword took the Gi∣ant such a pat on his head, that he cut away a piece, and wounded him in the arm; but he had a medicine that if he but touched the wound with it, it healed. Orson perceiving this, threw away his arms, and run furiously upon him, and cast him to the earth, and held him under him, which made the Knight yield to his mercy; yet Orson would have taken away his life, had not Valentine rescu∣ed him: The Green Knight inplored pardon for his former actions, and obtined it, and was carried into Aquitain, and there was baptized. He declared to Valentine, he that overcame him could be no less then the Son of a King or Emperour, and must be one that never suck'd any Woman; and that it should be further prov'd by his Sister Clerimond, who had a brazen-head that could resolve all questions that he asked it. To return to the Lady Fezon, who was in  Orson, being his by conquest, desir'd to be marry'd,  not consent to till he should obtain his speech, and  ents. Valentine remembring the Green Knight's  resolv'd to go see the brozen-head, being already in love  the Lady Clerimond, by the commendations he heard of her beauty: He declar'd this to the Green Knight, who presently gave him his ring, as a token that he might be admitted into the Castle, which was impossible to be conquer'd. The Duke hearing they would depart, made Orson swear to marry his Daughter at his re∣turn. Valentine and Orson the day following set forward on their journy: and the Green Knight went to serve King Pepin. In the mean time Blandiman, the Servant of the sorrowful Lady B∣lisant, had escaped out of Ferragus's Castle, and travelled to the Court of France, where he declar'd the sorrowful estate of his La∣dy, and cause of her sorrows, and of the birth of the Children in the forrest in every particular: which the King hearing, and ta∣king an account of the time and place, found it to fall on that day he took up Valentine, and so they concluded that them two were her Children, to the great joy of all the Couer: King Pepin could not alone hear this great news, but he must presently set sail for Con∣stantinople to declare it there, to the exceeding comfort of all that heard it. In the mean time, Valentine and Orson arrives at the Castle of the Lady Clerimond, and he made a proffer to enter but was deny'd entrance until he had leave of the Lady: as seen as she heard two Strangers were there, she viewed them out at a win∣dow,
seeing Valentine, began to be in love with him, and she en∣quires if they had any token from her Brother; Valentine shewing the ring was admitted into her presence, whose beauty he greatly admired; desirous therefore to break silence, being a wonder to each others eyes, Valentine began, Divine Paragon of Beauty, I was driven hither by the report of a brazen-head that remains in your Castle that can tell wonders, therefore if it please you to admit us to the sight, we shall remain your Bond servants in all re∣spects.  Clerimond granted their request, and brought 'em where the head was which thus began to speak Thou famous Knight of Royal Parentage, thou art call'd Valentine the Valiant, thou art the Man that ought to marry the Lady Clerimond, thou art Son to the Emperour of Greece, and thy Mother was in Portu∣gal, in the Castle of Ferragus, who hath had the keeping of her twenty years: the Wild-man who accompaineth thee, is thy Bro∣ther, born in the Forrest of Orleance, and was nourished by a bear, and be shall not have the use of his tongue till a thread be cut under it. Now thou art come, my time is at a period; and so bowed down and never spoke more. Valentine immediately embra∣ced his Brother, and presently cut the thread under his tongue, and he spoke: Valentine receives Clerimond as his esopused Lady, and she him as her Lord, but defers the marriage till he had deliver'd his Mother, and seen his Royal Father and she setled in Constan∣tionple. Chap. V. How Patolet, an Enchanter, gave Ferragus Cleri∣mond's Brother, the knowledge of all that past, of the Delive∣ry of the Lady Bellisant: how Valentine and Orson were im∣prisoned by Farergus, and escaped again, and Ferragus's Reso∣lution thereupon. IN the mean time while these Lovers admired one another, is little Dwarf that Clerimond kept was an Inchanter, and he gave Ferragus an account of all their proceeding, in the Castle of Clerimond, for he could in a day's time come and go, for by his art he had made a wooden horse, with a pin at the head, and which way he turned the pin, and the horse mounting in the air, he could be at the place design'd immediately; when Ferragus heard Pacolt's cal he grew exceedingly enrag'd at his Sister for granting leave to a Christian Knight, swearing by the Gods to be revenged, on them both, After Pacolet's return, Clerimond commanded him to go
and see it Bellisant, Valentine's Mother, were there or no which he did, and brought word she was in health. In the mean time Ferragus provides a Fleet, and came to his Sister's Castle, and was very pleasant with Valentine and Orson, and desires them and his Sister to accompany him to Portugal, there to be married which they did, but when they were upon the Sea, in the dead of the night, he caused them to be took out of their beds, bound 'em and cast them into a dungeon, and when they came to Portugal, they were put into a Castle, and there left to bewail their : A¦las, said Valentine, how soon are our ioys blasted, and mirth turn¦ed into mourning. Bellisant hearing two Christian Knights were in the Castle, left her chamber, and came to have a sight of them and to ask them whence they were: but Ferragus, being enraged, would not suffer her; Clerimond had not long been in the Castle, but she esp'yd Valentine's Mother, and being private toge¦ther, she declar'd to her how her Sons were Prisoners there,  for joy to hear they were alive. In the mean time Pacolet comforted them, and told them, he would set Valentine and Or∣son at liberty, and them too; and he was as good as his , but as soon as he saw  oppertunity, by his art he opened all the doors and came where the Prisoners lay, who hearing the door opened ex¦pected nothing but  Pacolet said, My Lords, fear not, I am come  So leaving them where Clerimond and Bellisant were,  before their Mother craving her blessing; but  away: but Pacolet seeing no time to  and they presently arrived at Clerimon  they had refresh'd themselves, they journey'd toward Aquitain But let us return to Ferragus, to see how  the Iaylor came to unlock the doors and found them  and looking found his Priso∣ners  told Ferragus, who enraged thereat, re∣solves to  Castle  as¦sembled his Men of war declaring his  mean  Valentine and Orson,  also Pacolet, were safe arrived at the  they where received with much  and  accomplish'd  Fezon  Duke of Aquitain, so both their  Ferragus who not , for when  Castle, he sailed to Aquitain with  revenge for these  upon  as a
about twelve foot high, and much feared by all his Neighbours, ha∣ving a prosperous gale, he s on landed his army, King Trompart being with him to aid him, accompanied with the Inchanter Adra∣main, who was to further Trompart's design in getting the Lady Clerimond, intending with the consent of Ferragus to take her to Wife. Chap. VI. The admirable Feats of Arms performed by Valentine and Orson, in a famous Battle before Aquitain, and the Suc∣cess thereof; and how Valentine and Pacolet went to Constan∣tinople to help his Father and Uncle, who were besieged by the Sarazens. THe couragious Duke of Aquitain hearing of the landing of his potent Enemy, suddenly prepared great Forces to resist him, to the great content of Valentine and Orson; and at last seeing their Town besieged by Ferragus, they issued out with their Army resolving to give them present battle: Here you might see the rare exploits perform'd by gallant Warriors, Valentine and Orson work∣ing wonders wheresoever they came, making every one give way to their keen swords. Here the Giant Ferragus triumphed over his Enemies, intending a final conquest. The valiant Duke of Aquitain cleared their ranks, and fought manfully, but venturing too far in the press, was taken Prisoner and carried to Ferra∣gus's Tent; but Orson, accompained with Pacolet, rush'd through the Enemy, resolving to free the Duke or die on the spot, came at last without the Camp, putting on Pagans shields, went into Fer∣ragus's Tent; and brought the Duke from thence, and plac'd him in the head of his Army, who seeing him released, fought like de∣sperate Men, and made havock of their Enemies crying Long live the Duke of Aquitain; the Pagans hearing this, and knowing him released, were discomfitted and fled to their ships. As soon as this battle was ended, Valentine and Pacolet resolve to go to Constanti∣nople to aid his Father, who was besieged by the Sarazens: Pacolet made ready his wooden horse, and the same night they arrived at Constantinople, in the great hall before the Emperour who sat at supper with King Pepi, who came to aid him against the Sarazens, and the Green Knight was present, who espying Valen∣tine knew him: King Pepin said, Behold here one of your own Blood, a valliant Knight, and your natural Son. The Em∣perour presently ran and kissed him; and Valentine declared
how and where he left his Mother, the Empress Bellisant, and his Brother Orson, and all his adventures since he departed from the Court of King Pepin, to the delight of all that heard him, and joy of the whole City, who made bonefires for his return: when the Sarazens heard these shouts and revellings in the City, they were fore afraid, and put themselves in readiness. Valentine and the Green Knight were greately moved to see the City begirt with ar∣med Men, therefore they armed themselves, resolving to try their fortune, issuing forth with two thousand Men, seiz'd on two hun∣ed wagons laden with victuals and sent them into the City: the Souldan vexed at this loss, got between Valentine and the City, in∣tending to take them Prisoners: King Pepin seeing their intent, issued out of the Town with his Army, and see upon the Sarazens, and there was fought a cruel battle, there King Pepin bore the Souldan to the earth: but Valentine and the Green Knight being in the middle of the Enemy, wearied with labour, were at last taken Prisoners, and sent to the Souldan's Tent, to the great grief of the Emperour and King Pepin, who were forced to retreat. After this the Souldan came to his Tent, and caused the Green Knight and Valentine to come before him, and using to m proud words, vow'd they should never escape with life: he order'd them to be hanged in the sight of the City; which sentence aused great fear to seize on them: but Pacolet being in the City, understanding the sad event, and seeing how heavenly King Pepin and the Emperour took their loss, took his wooden horse and depar∣ted to the Souldan's Host, and came just as Valentine and the Green Knight were going to execution; Pacolet entering the Tent was known by the Souldan, who calling him aside said, 'What news from Portugal? Pacolet replyed, 'The best that ever you heard from the fair Wise of Ferragus. The Souldan hearing this news from Ferragu 's Wife whom he dearly loved for joy reprieved the Prisoners till morning, and then went with Pacolet to hear the particulers; Pacolet i a serious manner relates to him how Ferra∣gus's Wife resolv'd to visit him that night, her Husband being at Aquiain, for her heart was on fire with the love of him. At this he was like to leap one of his skin for y: so acolet bid him tarry till ight, and he'd carry him to her; Pacolet remained with him also, and then set him on his wooden-horse and departed, and set him down in the great hall in Constantinople, bidding him stay till he ame; so going again to the Souldan s Army, and charming the Guards, took Valentine and the Green Knight on his wooden-horse,
and set them down by the Souldan, to his great astonish∣ment, knowing then he was betray d who insaantly laid hands on him, committing him to prison till the morrow, and then hang∣ed him in the view of all his Host to their wonder discomfiture; and Valentine suddenly issuing out of the City with the whole Army, made havock of the Pagans,  all that made opposition, the rest fled and saved their lives The City was again made free without any Enemies to oppos it, to the unspeakable joy of the Iuhabitants. The next day Pacolet took his journey to Aquitain, to bear tydings to the Lady Clerimond, the Empress Bellisant, and Orson, whose company the Emperour greatly desir'd; but while they were preparing for Constantinople, Ferragus renews his Forces and again besieges Aquitain. Chap. VII. How Adrimain couzez'd Pacolet of his Horse; how ing Trompart's Head was smitten off by th King of Iudia, with the loss of the Lady Clerimond; Pacolet's Revenge on A∣drimain; Ferragus's Death; Bellisant and Orion's landing at Constantinople, and other remarkable Passages. THere was a cunning Inchanter that came to assist King Trom∣part to gain the Lady Clerimond, this Fellow come to Pa∣colet and seigns himself his Servant, to do what he shall command m; Pacolet not privy to his deceit, accepts of, and ooges him in his bed, but it proves a fatal night, for when Pacolet was asleep, Adrimain charms all the house asleep, and goes to Pacolet's horse and to the Lady Clerimund's chamber, and set her on the horse, and turning the pin, mounted in the air, and presently arrives at King Trompart's tent, who presently call'd him to behold her, to his great joy, who would not stay there, but presently carry hee to his own Country, so setting her on the wooden-horse, she being last asleep turn'd the pin, mounted into the air, and before morn∣ing an hundred miles off Aquitain, the horse stopped in a Market-town near the King of Judea's Court, the People seeing such a strange sight were much amaz'd and carried the news to the King who sent for them, and knew Trompart to be the Man which sew his Brother, for which he caused his head to be smitten off; The Lady Clerimond was led into the Palace, where the King began to comfort her, and used her very courteously, being in love with her? But nothing could give her joy, but only the presente of her Valentine, for whom she wept sorely, but at last she count is
madness, only to make the King leave his suit, who wearied her with his speeches. But to return to Pacolet, who made great la∣mentation for the loss of the Lady Clerimond, and his horse, at last he vow'd revenge on the Traytor Adrimain, and presently he apparelled himself in Woman's habit, departs to Ferragus's Camp and came to the Tent of Adrimain, who seeing such a gallant Beauty, was amaz'd and fell in love with him, and perswaded her to stay all night in his chamber, which Pacolet consented to; so Adrimain went to bed and Pacolet seeing that, inants him and the Host asleep, puts on Adrimain's apparel, and with his sword smote off his head; and then went to the tent of Ferragus whom he made leap out of bed, put on his cloaths and follow him into the City of Aquitan, where they secur'd him till morning; and then Pacolet bid 'em issue out and stay the whole Host, they being asleep, which they did, not leaving one to tell the dreadful tragedy of their Companions. In the morning Ferragus was brought before the Duke of Aquitan, and Orson; they told him if he would forsake Mahomet and turn Christian, they would save his life, but he would not consent, so they presently commanded his head to be struck off. Now they resolved to go to Constantinople, which was again besieg'd by the Sarazens: the Lady Bellisant requiring the Duke of Aquitan to bear them company, so being ship'd, the wind serving, they soon landed near Constantinople, but could not come to the City; but Pacolet gave notice to the Emperour and King Pepin, that there was an Army arrived from the Duke of Aquitan, which would assail the Sarazens Camp in the night on one side, whilst they issued out of the City on the other, which was to the total con∣fussion of the Sarazens, who were all slain by break of day: And as soon as the Battle was finished, the Emperour and King Pepin, Valentine and the Green Knight, took their way to the Sea-side to meet Bellisant; as soon as the Emperour saw her, he leapt off his horse, and fell on his knees and imbraced her, intreating he a par∣don for her heard usage, whilst she for joy sounded in his arms; but recovering her self, they went to the Palace where no∣thing but salutations pass'd that day; and the Emperour did great honour to the Duke of Aquitan, and the Lady Fezon. But all this while Valentine did not see his of Sun Beauty, at which he much woundred; when all the Train were entred, and the salutations o∣ver, Valentine calls Polet aside, and enquires where he left the La∣dy Clerimond; now began Pacolet for to fear to tell him of her loss but Valentine being earnest with him, he declared that she was stoln
away by Adrimain, and carried away by King Trompart, upon his horse; Valentine hearing this, could not chuse but shed many tears in remembrance of his Lady, and resolv'd to search the whole World for her. But to leave him amidst his sorrows, let us return to King Pepin, who seeing all things in peace, took his leave of the Emperour and Empress, and Valentine; but Orson he desir'd to bear him company into France, which he did, where they were re∣ceived with great joy, and they highly esteemed and honoured Orson, which much grieved Haufry and Henry, insomuch that they plotted how to take away his life, and the execution of their design they committed to one of their Nephews, who was Vsher unto the King's privy chamber, his name was Granier, their design was to hire their Nephew to enter into the King's chamber in the night and murder him, and then to lay it on Orson, who alone had charge of the King: The night was come wherein they design'd to finish their purposed treason, and Granier being hid in the Chamber, ri∣ses, and assays to cut the King's throat, but being afraid, he laid the knife down in the bed, and went his way and told Haufry and Henry what he had done, and said he would accuse Orson with the laying it there, which would be enough to condemn him. The next day Granier said unto the King, May it please your Majesty: I will betray unto you, the Practiser of your overthrow; Orson in∣tended to have murthered you in bed, and to that intent hath laid a knife therein: now if it please you to send and see, you'll find my words true. The King at this, enrag'd, said, False Tray∣tor, can such a thought enter into thy breast, who shall I trust! seeing thou, whom I account as my Child, does prove a Tray∣tor to me? Orson being innocent, would have spoken, but the King would not suffer him, but called his Lords to be Eye-witnes∣ses of this tragedy intended; coming to the King's bed-chamber, they uncover'd the bed, and found the knife, which drew great a∣stonishment in them: The King presently condemned Orson to death; but by intreaty of the Lords, he was allowed the combat against Granier and his Brother, which combat was perform'd with much valour on both sides, till Orson had slain one of them, then the other being very weak, cry'd for quarter, and confess'd 'twas he that should have kill'd the King; but before he could utter any more, Haufrey drew his sword and cut off his head, for fear he should betray them. The King was joyful for Orson's victory, and went to meet him before he came to the Palace, and did him great honour, and bid him have a care of Haufry and Henry, who
did all they could to destroy him all the Nobles rejoyc'd, for  loved Orson. But  you have heard.  Se, and  a short time la  he could not hear of he there: before he had  information was given to the King of Antioch,  Chrisans were landed; which he immediately sent for  was, That if any Christian came, he must eier  his faith, or fight with a dragon that re∣main'd in a Forrst had by the City; which task aine wil∣lily undloo d after much l of blood, conquer him, to his verlasting same, for it caused the King of Antioch to turn Christian, and all his Kingdom to be baptiz'd. But our noble Conqueror is not limited to one place, but he depars grievously afflicted for the lo of his Lady; but shortly after his departure, Brandiffer, a potent Monarch of the Turks, hearing of the King of Antioch's conversion lands an Army o a hundred thousand Men, and put all to the sword, took the King Prisoner, and put him to death, and crown'd himself King of Antioch; after that he departed toward his own Country, and, having a great storm at Sea, was drove to Cretophe, a little City on the Coast of Greece, where by chance the Emperor and the Green Knight were; Brandiffer's arrival being sudden and unexpected, he surpriz'd them, and carried them Prisoners to a Castle of his which was invincible, to the great grief of the Empress and Orson. In the mean time Valentine and Pacolet travelled thro' many strange Countries, but could hear no tydings of the Lady Clerimond; at last they came to a strong Castle, and desires entrance, which was denied them by the Sentinel, who told them, that the Emperour of Greece and the Green Knight were Prisoners there, with twelve Peers of France, who were taken at Jerusalem, being gone thither on Pil∣grimage, and were betrayed by the treachery of Haufry and Hen∣ry. Valentine hearing this, and ready to burst with grief, the Castle being invincible, he departed and went to Angory, a City that had been taken from Brandiffer; Valentine's arrival much re∣joyced the wearied Citizens, who were quite tir'd with the daily a∣larms of the Pagans: here Valentine fought many battels, and won much honour; and in one battle he took King Luca Priso∣ner, by the policy of Pacolet, but this was the last piece of service that he did Valentine, for King Lucar espying him in the hall where he was kept, stept to him and stabbed him, before Valentine could come to his succour; Valentine enraged at this dismal hap, began
thus, False Traytor, thou hast slain him who was all my hope, but thy life shall surely pay for it. Then Valentine fell on the dead body, and lamented over it grievously. But Brandiffer hearing of King Lucar's state, seat a Messenger into the City to Valentine, to tell him that he should have the King of France for his ransom; which greatly contented Valentine: King Pepin be∣ing safely arrived in Angory, Valentine did him great honour; and King Pepin declar'd to him how he was taken Prisoner at Je∣rusalem, and had remained ever since Prisoner in the King of In∣dia's Court; and told him that the fair Lady Clerimond was Pri∣soner there, who counterfited madness to avoid the Kings love. Now began Valentine to take courage again, after all these storms fair weather begins to appear; now he's in hopes to bring his wishes to a good end, and close up all his travels with a quiet life; he is resolved to leave Angory, and in habit of a Pilgrim travel to the King of India's Court, and there make known that he can cure mad and lunatick People, and all other diseases. In the next Chapter you'll see how this device succeeded to his purpose. Chap. VIII. How Valentine in Pilgrim's Habit carried away the Lady Clerimond from the Indian Court; and how he took the strong Castle where the Emperour and the Green Knight were Prisoners; and how Valentine, unfortunately and unknow, slew his own Father, and other Acts which endeth this Story. VAlentine being arrived at the City where the King of Indian kept his Court, like a Physician takes up his lodging at an Inn in the Town: His Host began to enquire of him what he was: Valentine told him he was a Physician that could cure all manner of diseases, and therefore desir'd him to set his Man go into the City and post up some Bills, that he might make known his are, whereby to get somewhat to defray his charges; which his Host consented to: The Man having done as he was appointed some of the Courtiers chanced to espy the Bills, and reading in s that the Man could cure Madness, declares it to the King; presently Va∣lentine was sent for, and the King call'd him aside and declar'd to him, that he had in his Court a Lady that was lunatick whom if he would cure, he should have a bountiful reward: Valentine at∣tending on the King's tale, told him he would endeavour the re∣oring the Lady to her senses, Therefore, great Soveraign, cause a Fire to be made in her Chamber, and I'll be with her to
night, and use my Skill. The King called one of his Srvants to guide Valentine to the Lady's chamber, where he left him: The Lady Clerimnod beholding him, began to throw things at him; Valentine seeing her, said, Alack, my dear Lady, you have bought me as dear as I have you; but now I hope to return to my Father's Court with you. Clerimond eying him, began to look strangely, which caused Valentine to say Dear Love, I am thy Valentine, and for thee have suffered more torments that can be imagined; for the Love of thee have I travelled night and day. When the Lady heard her true Love's Voyce, the instantly fell into a sound, but being recover'd she burst forth into these speeches.  Ah, my dear Love, and lovely Valentine, how many dangers have we passed thro'; I for the love of thee, and thou for me? And now, my dear Love, behold the extremity I have cast my self into, into what baseness I have cast my self for thee; but Love dearly bought, they say, is the sweetest. After their kind salutations were past, she shewed him Paolt's horse which rejoy∣ced his heart: Valentine then set Clerimond thereon, and turn∣ing the Pin, they suddenly arrived in the City of Angory, to the unspeakable joy of the Inhabitance. The next day they were married in as great solemnity as so short a warning could afford; after dinner were exercised many pastimes which lastedt ill n ght, which caused these two incomable Lovers to prepare for bed, where we'll leave them unto those sweet embraces enjoyed by Lu∣vers: Valentine remained a month in Angory with his beloved Lady, and then thinking of his Father's Imprisonment, he resol∣ved to endeavour his release by a cunning Plot, he will, like a Marchant, put forth ships well mann'd, and richly laden, and go to this Castle and proffer to sell 'em to the Lady Galazy; with this resolution he put to Sea, and in a short time arrives at the Castle where he armed his Men privately, putting their Cloaths over their armour: So Valentine went out of his ship Marchant like, and coming to the gate the Porter ask'd him what he brought he cold him he had store of Iewels aboard, and he desir'd to know whe∣ther the Lady of the Castle would make choice of any of them, the Porter went and inform'd his Lady, who sent the Governour, with some Souldiers, to view them; being come into the shps, the Christians, as Valentine had before commanded, slew them: then Valentine caused them to put on the Turks apparel, and to set forward to the Castle, carrying with them many Iewels; the Porter thinking them to be the Men of the Castle, let them pass
in, where they slew all the Infidels, and broke open the doors till they came to the Lady Galazy's chamber, and demanding the keys of the prison; she delivered them, wherewith they opened the Pri∣son, released the Emperour, the Green Knight, and the Peers of France. As soon as this enterprize was finish'd, Valentine sail∣ed to Angory, and left his Father, the Emperour, and the others, to take their rest: The Emperour soon after hearing the City of Angor, was begut with brand-ster's Hoast, resolved to leave the Castle, and to ship himself and ten thousand Men, and being at Sea they engaged with a Fleet that was going to aid Brandiffer, and soon overcome them: The Emperour commanded his Men to put on the Pagans armour, that they might safely land; which stratagem prov'd fatal, as you shall hear; and just as they arrived, Orson, attended with one hundred valiant Knights, came into the Port also, to the great joy of the Emperour: Now the Christi∣ans in Angory, for want of provisions, resolved to give the Pa∣gans battle: and so were devided into ten Bands, led by ten vali∣ant Captains, whose courage and conduct added valour to all the o∣thers. The Pagans knowing their design, put themselves into fifteen bands, standing in battle-array; the Christians issuing sud∣denly out of the City, presently put all in confusion, resolving to die or conquer; great courage was shewed on both sides. Valen∣tine slew a Pagan Commander at the first onset; and meeting the Indian King unhorsed him, and had he not been rescued by his Followers, he had lost his life by Valentine's keen sword: and if fresh Succours had not come, the Pagans had been put to flight, which renew'd the fight, so that the air was darkned with the smoke, and nothing was heard but cries and confusion of voices; but on a sudden news came that a great Fleet of Sarazens were ar∣rived at the Port, and just landing. Valentine hearing this made great hast to the Port with a select Party to strengthen the Guard there, (but little need was there of it, for these were Christians commanded by the Emperour, his Father, joyned by his Son Orson and his Knights;) Valentine being ignorant who they were, charged them furiously, and the first that he engaged he run quite thro' the body, which unfortunately was the Emperour. Orson seeing his Father slain, began to weep, and knowing Valentine by his armour, said to him, Alas, Brother Valentine, here's small conquest in this, for you have slain your Father. Valentine hear∣ing this, broke out in such a grievous lamentation, that it grieved all his Followers to hear him, Alas, quoth he, what an infamous
deed have I done? What a wicked act have I committed? I have spent my life in trouble and now have added murther to my other sins. Orson seeing him thus lament, comforted him, and desired him to go with his Army to the battle, for the Pagans in his absence had prevailed. At last Valentine being set on his horse flew like a lion into the midst of the battle, and meeting a Pagan Prince, run his sword thro' his body, and being careless of his life, proceeded on till he came where Brandisser was making havock of the Christians, he rushed so fiercely on him, that he struck him to the ground, and with his sword clove his head: The Pagans seeing their Generals slain, and some began to flie, founded a re∣treat; the Christians greedy of their blood, pursuing, slew many thousands, others leap'd into the Sea and were drowned, leaving the Christians a compleat victory, who immediately returned into the City, where was great lamentation made for the unfortunate death of the Emperour of Constantinople, where he was nobly bu∣ried But Valentine refused all comfort, and who was as a Man out of his wits. As soon as they had setled the affairs in Angory, they crowned the Green Knight King thereof, who had in the battle valiantly slain several Pagan Commanders, and then departed to∣wards the City of Constantinople. In the mean time great troubles arose in France; King Pepin being arrived there, and the twelve Peers of France, from the strong Castle where they had been Pri∣soners, Hafry and Henry begin to plot the death of the King and Queen, and their young Son Charl main, whom the King had made Heir of the Crown and Kingdom: to bring this thr devil∣ish design to pass, they invite the King and Queen, and their Son to a rich banquet, but Charlemain, came not; in the midst of the banquet they fill'd a cup of deadly poyson and gave it to thy King, and the King drnk to the Queen, but the poyson wrought so in their bodies, that they fell down dead of the tll: Ater that they seized on all the strong Castes and Cttes, but could not find the young Prince Charlemain, who was under his Sister's protection; whereupon having aid from the King of England, she fought ma¦ny battles successfully against Hafry and Henry, till they were both slain and Charlemain was crowned King, to the great joy of the whole Kingdom, for he eminently shewed forth his Father's vertues. In the mean time our Royal Train arrive at Constantinople to the ex∣ceeding joy of the Empress Bellisant, and the whole City, but when she heard that her Husband the Emperour was slaine Valen∣tine and Orson, byh e consent of her and the whole Nation, wee
crowned Ioynt-Emperours: but Valentine calling to mind his for∣mer sin, in killing his Royal Father, resolved to go on Pilgri∣mage; and calling his Lady aside, he declared to her his intent, and broke a Ring in twain, and charged her not to marry until she saw that piece of the Ring again, and said, if he did not bring it himself, he would send it when he died, having so said, with tears they parted: Long time he travelled, lying in the woods, caves and rocks, enduring great hardship; and at last he returned again towards Constantinople, where he arriving, begged about the Ci∣ty, and came to his Brother Orson's Palace, and craved there a lodging under a pair of stairs, where he lay the term of seven years, eating nothing but scraps which were daily brought him in a basket (being unknown who he was) at length his time of death growing nigh, he falling into a deadly feavour, wrote a letter putting his name thereto, holding it fast when he died: When Orson saw the poor Pilgrim was dead, he commanded the letter to be taken from him that he held in his hand but none cou'd take it but the Lady Clerimond, who reading the same, fell in a swound upon the dead body, lamenting over it. And after that great preparation was made for the funeral, and his body was enterred with all honour due to so noble a Warriour. Orson lives long after with his Wife the fair Lady Galazy, (whom he married after the death of the Lady Fezon,) administring Iustice to all; and was greatly beloved of all his Subjects. FINIS
