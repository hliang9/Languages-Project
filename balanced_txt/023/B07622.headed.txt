THE Kynges mooste roy∣all Maiestie, by the aduise of his most dere vncle, the duke of Somerset, Lorde Protec∣tor of all his Realmes, Do∣minions, and subiectes, and Gouernor of his moste roiall persone, and the residewe of his moste honorable counsaill, intendyng thad∣uauncement of the true honor of almightie God the suppression of Idolatrie, and Supersticion, throughout all his Realmes and Dominions, and to plant true Religion, to the extirpacion of all Hypocrysy, enormities, and abuses, as to his duetie apperteineth: Doth minister vnto his lo∣uyng subiectes, these Godly Iniuncciōs, hereaf∣ter folowyng: Whereof, parte were geuen vnto theim heretofore, by aucthoritie of his moste de∣rely beloued father, Kyng Henry the eighte, of moste famous memorie, and parte are nowe mi∣nistered and geuen by his Maiestie. All whiche Iniunccions, his highnes willeth and commaū¦deth his saied louyng subiectes, by his supreme aucthoritie, obediently to receiue, and truely to obserue and kepe, euery man in their offices, de∣grees,

THE firste is, that all Deanes, Achedeacōs, Persones, Vicars, and other Ecclesiasticall per∣sones, shall faithfully kepe and obserue, and as far as in them maie lie, shal cause to be obserued and kept of other, al & singuler lawes and statu∣tes, made aswel for the abolishyng and extirpa∣cion of the bishop of Rome, his pretensed and v∣surped power and iurisdiccion, as for the establi¦shement and confirmacion of the kynges autho∣ritie, iurisdicciō and supremacie of the church of England, & Ireland. And furthermore, all eccle∣siasticall persones, hauyng cure of soule, shall to the vttermoste of their wit, knowledge, and lear∣nyng purely, syncerely, and without any colour or dissimulacion, declare, manifest, and open, iiij. tymes euery yere at the least, in their Sermons, and other collacions, that the bishop of Romes vsurped power and iurisdicciō, hauyng no esta∣blishement nor ground by the lawe of God, was of moste iust causes, taken awaie and abolished, and that therfore, no maner of obedience or sub∣ieccion, within his Realmes and Dominions, is dewe vnto hym. And that the Kynges power, within his Realmes and Dominions, is the highest power vnder GOD, to whom all men, within thesame Realmes and Dominions, by Godes lawes owe moste loyaltie and obedience, afore and aboue all other powers and potenta∣tes
in yearth. BESIDES this, to the intent that all Su∣persticion and Hypocrisy, crept into diuerse men¦nes hartes, maie vanish awaie, thei shall not set∣furthe or extoll any Images, Reliques, or mira∣cles, for any Supersticion or lucre, nor allure the people by any inticementes, to the Pilgri∣mage of any sainct or ymage: but reprouyng the same, thei shall teache, that all goodnesse, healthe and grace, ought to be both asked and loked for onely of God, as of the verie aucthor and geuer of thesame, and of none other. ITEM, that thei, the persones aboue rehersed shall make or cause to bee made in their Chur∣ches, and euery other Cure thei haue, one Ser∣mon, euery quarter of the yere at the least, wher∣in thei shall purely and syncerely, declare the woorde of GOD: and in thesame, exhorte their hearers to the woorkes of Faithe, Mercie, and Charitie, specially prescribed and commaunded in scripture, and that woorkes deuised by man∣nes phātasies, besides scripture: as wanderyng to pilgrimages, offeryng of money, candelles or tapers, to Reliques, or Images, or kissyng and lickyng of thesame, praiyng vpon Beades, or suche like supersticiō, haue not onely no promise of reward in scripture, for doyng of thē: but con∣trariwise, great threates & malediccions of God for that thei bee thynges, tendyng to Idolatrie and supersticiō, whiche, of al other offences, god almightie doth most detest and abhorre for that
thesame diminishe moste his honor and glorie. ITEM, that suche Images, as thei knowe in any of their Cures, to bee, or haue been so abu∣sed with pilgrimage or offrynges, of any thyng made thereunto, or shalbee hereafter censed vn∣to, thei (and none other priuate persones) shall, for the auoydyng of that moste detestable offēce of Idolatrie, furthewith take doune or cause to be taken doune, and destroye thesame, and shall suffre from hensefurthe, no Torches, nor Can∣delles, Tapers or Images of waxe, to be sette a∣fore any Image or picture, but onely two ligh∣tes vpon the high aulter, before the Sacrament whiche, for the significacion, that Christe is the verie true light of the worlde, thei shall suffre to remain still: Admonishyng their parishioners, that Images serue for no other purpose, but to be a remembraunce, wherby, men maie be admo∣nished, of the holy lifes and conuersaciō of them that thesaied Images doo represent: whiche I∣mages, if thei do abuse for any other intent, thei commit Idolatrie in thesame, to the great daun∣gier of their soules. ITEM, that euery holy daie throughout the yere, when thei haue no Sermon, thei shall im∣mediatly after the Gospell, openly and plainly, recite to their parishioners in the pulpit: The Pater noster, the Credo, and the tenne Commaun∣dementes in Englishe, to the intent the people maie learne thesame by harte: exhortyng all pa∣rentes and housholders, to teache their children
and seruaūtes thesame, as thei are bound by the lawe of God, and in conscience to do. ITEM, that thei shall charge fathers and Mothers, Masters and gouernors, to bestowe their children and Seruauntes, euen from their childhode, either to learnyng, or to some honest exercise, occupacion or husbandrie: Exhortyng and counsailyng, and by all the waies and mea∣nes thei maie, aswell in their Sermons and col∣lacions, as otherwaies, perswadyng their saied Fathers and Mothers, Masters, and other Go∣uernors, diligentely to prouide and forsee, that the youthe bee in no maner of wise, brought vp in idlenes, least at any tyme afterward, for lacke of some craft, occupacion, or other honest meane to liue by, thei be driuen to fall to beggyng, stea∣lyng, or some other vnthriftinesse: For asmuche as we maie daily se, through slothe and idlenes, diuerse valiaunt men fall, some to beggyng, and some to thefte and murdre, whiche after brought to calamitie and miserie, doo blame their paren∣tes, frendes and gouernors, whiche suffered them, to be brought vp so idlely in their youthe, where, if thei had been well brought vp, in good learnyng, some occupacion, or crafte, thei should (beeyng rulers of their awne housholde) haue proffited aswell themselfes, as diuerse other per∣sones, to the greate commoditie and ornament of the common wealthe. ALSO, that thesaied persones, Vicars, and other Curates, shall diligently prouide, that the
Sacramentes, be duely and reuerently ministe∣red in their Parishes. And if at any tyme it hap∣pen, theim in any of the cases expressed in the sta∣tutes of this Realme, or of speciall licence geuen by the Kynges Maiestie, to be absent from their benefices, thei shall leaue their Cure, not to a rude and vnlearned person, but to an honest wel learned and experte Curate, that can by his ha∣bilitie, teache the rude and vnlearned of their cure, holesome doctryne, and reduce theim to the right way that do erre, and whiche will also exe∣cute these Iniunccions, and doo their duetie o∣therwise, as thei are bounde to doo in euery be∣halfe: and accordyngly maie and will proflite their cure, no lesse with good example of liuyng, then with the declaracion of the woorde of God, or els their lacke and defaulte, shalbee imputed vnto them, who shall straightly aunswere for the same if thei do otherwise. And alwaies let theim see, that neither thei nor their Curates, doo seke more their awne proffite, promocion, or aduaun¦tage, then the proffit of the soules, that thei haue vnder their Cure or the glory of God. ALSO, that thei shall prouide, within three monethes, nexte after this visitacion, one booke of the whole Bible, of the largest volume in En∣glishe. And within one twelfe monethes, next af∣ter the saied visitacion, the Paraphrasis of E∣rasmus also in Englishe vpon the Gospelles, and thesame sette vp, in some conuenient place, within the saied Churche, that thei haue cure of,
whereas their parishioners may moste cōmo∣diously, resorte vnto thesame, & reade thesame. The charges of whiche bokes shalbe ratably borne, betwene the Person or approprietary, and the parishioners aforesayd, that is to say, the one halfe by the Person or proprietary, & the other halfe, by the paryshyoners. And they shall discourage no man (auctorised and licen∣ced thereto) from the readynge of any parte of the Bible, either in Latyn or in Englishe: But shall rather conforme and exhorte euery per∣sone to reade thesame, as ye very liuely worde of God, and the speciall foode of mans soule, that all christian persones are bounde to em∣brace, beleue, & folowe, if they loke to besaued: Wherby they may the better knowe their due∣ties to God, to their souereigne lord ye Kyng, and theyr neighbour, euer gentilly and chari∣tably exhortynge theim, and in hys Maiesties name, straightly charginge and cōmaunding theim, that in the readynge therof, no man to reason or contende, but quyetly to heare the reader. ALSO, the sayde Ecclesiasticall persons, shal in no wyse, at any vnlaufull tyme, nor for any other cause, thē for their honest necessitie, haūte or resorte to any Tauernes, or Alehou∣ses. And after their dynner and supper, they shal not geue thē selfes to drinckyng or tyot, spēdyng their tyme ydely, by day or by night, at dyse, cardes, or tables plaiyng, or any other
vnlaufull game: But at all tymes, as they shall haue leasure, they shall heare or reade somwhat of holy scripture, or shall occupie thē selfes with some other honest exercise, and that they alwayes do the thinges, whiche apper∣teyne to honesty, with endeuour to profite the common weale, hauynge alwayes in mynde, that they ought to excel all other, in puritie of lyfe, and shoulde be example to the people, to lyue well and christianly. ITEM, that they shall in confessions euery Lent, examine euery person, that cometh to cō∣fession to theim, whether they cā recite the ar∣ticles of their Fayth, the Pater noster, and the tenne commaundementes in Englishe, & heare thē saye the same particularlie, wherin, if they be not perfite, they shall declare then, that euery christian personne, oughte to knowe the sayde thynges, before they shoulde receyue the blessed Sacrament of the aulter, and monysh them to learne the said necessary thinges, more perfitely, or els they ought not to presume to come to Gods bourde, without perfite know∣ledge, and will to obserue thesame: and if they do, it is to the great periel of their soules, and also to the worldly rebuke, that they might in∣curre hereafter by thesame. ALSO, that they shall admitte no man to preache, within any theyr cures, but suche as shall appeare vnto them, to be sufficiently li∣cenced therunto, by the Kynges Maiestie, the
lorde Protectors grace, the Archebishop of Canterbury, the Archebishop of Yorke in hys prouince, or the Byshop of the Dyocesse. And suche as shalbe so licenced, they shall gladly receyue, to declare the woorde of God, without any resistence, or contradiction. ALSO, if they haue heretofore declared to their paryshyoners any thynge, to the extol∣linge, or setting furth of pilgrimages, reliques or ymages, or lighting of cādels, kissinge, kne∣ling decking of thesame ymages, or any suche supersticion, they shall now openly, before the same, recante, and reproue the same: shewynge them (as the trueth is) that they did the same vpon no grounde of scripture, but were ledde and seduced by a cōmon error and abuse, crept into the churche, through the sufferaunce & a∣uarice of suche, as felt profite by thesame. ALSO, if they do, or shall knowe any man within their parishe, or els where, that is a let∣ter of the woorde of God, to be redde in En∣glishe, or syncerely preached, or of the execuciō of these the Kynges matesties Iniunccions, or a fautor of the byshop of Romes pretensed power, now by the lawes of this realme, iustly reiected, extirped, and takē away vtterly, they shall detecte, and present thesame, to the Kyng or hys counsaill, or to the iustice of peace nexte adioyninge. ALSO, that the Persone, Vicar, or Curate, and parishyoners of euery paryshe, within
this realme, shall in their Churches and Cha∣pels, kepe one boke, or register, wherin they shal write the day and yere, of euery wedding, christenynge, and buryall, made within their parishe for their tyme, and so euery man suc∣cedynge theim lykewyse: and also therin shal wryte euery persons name, that shalbe so wed∣ded, christened, or buryed. And for the saufe ke∣ping of thesame boke, ye parishe shalbe boūde to prouide of their cōmon charges, one sure cofer, with two lockes and keyes, wherof, the one to remayne with the Person, Vicar, or Cu∣rate, & the other with the Wardeynes of euery parishe Churche or Chapel, wherin the sayde boke shalbe layde vp: whiche boke they shall euery sondaye take furth, and in the presence of the sayde Wardeyns, or one of them, wryte & recorde in thesame, al the weddinges, christe∣nynges, and buryalles, made the whole weeke before, and that done, to lay vp the boke in the sayd cofer, as afore. And for euery tyme, that thesame shalbe omitted, the partye that shalbe in the faulte therof, shall forfaicte to the sayde church .iii. s̄ .iiii. d, to be employed to the poore mens boxe, of that parishe. FVRTHERMORE, because the goodes of the churche, are called the goodes of ye pore, and at these dayes, nothynge is lesse sene, then the pore to be susteyned with thesame: al Per∣sons, Vicars, Pencionaries, Prebendaries, & other beneficed men, within this deanry, not
beynge resident vpon their benefices, whiche may dispēde yerely .xx. l. or aboue, either with∣in this deanry, or els where, shall distribute hereafter, emong their poore parishyoners, or other inhabitauntes there, in the presence of ye church wardeyns, or some other honest men of the parishe, the fortye parte of the fruictes and reuenues of their sayde benefices, leaste they be worthely noted of ingratitude, whiche reseruinge so many partes to themselfes, can∣not vouchesafe, to imparte the forty porcion therof, emōg the poore people of that parishe, that is so fruicteful, and profitable vnto thē. AND to the intent, that learned men maye hereafter springe the more for the execucion of the premisses, euery Person, Vicar, clerke, or beneficed man, within thys deanry, hauynge yerely to dispende in benefices, and other pro∣mocions of the churche, an .C. l. shall geue cō∣petēt exhibiciō to one scholar: and for asmany hundred poundes more, as he maye dispende, to so many scholars more, shal geue lyke exhi∣bicion, in the vniuersitie of Oxford, or Cam∣bridge, or some grāmer schole, which after they haue proffited in good learning, may be par∣teners of their patrones cure and charge, as∣well in preachynge, as otherwise in the execu∣cion of their offices: or may when nede shalbe, otherwise proffite the cōmon weale, with their counsaill and wisedome. ALSO, that all proprietaries, Persones,
Vicars, and Clerkes, hauynge churches, cha∣pels or mansions, within thys deanry, shal be∣stowe yerely hereafter, vpon thesame mansiōs or Chauncelles of their churches, being in de∣caye, the fifth parte of that their benefices, till they be fullye repaired. And thesame so repai∣red, shal alwayes kepe and mainteyne in good estate. ALSO, that the sayde Persons, Vicars, and clerkes, shall once, euery quarter of the yere, reade these Iniuncciōs geuen vnto them openly and deliberately, before all their pari∣shyoners, to the intent, that both they maye be the better admonished of their duetye, & theyr sayd parishyoners the more moued, to folowe thesame for their parte. ALSO, for asmuch, as by a lawe establis∣shed, euery man is boūde to pay hys tithes, no man shall by colour of duety omitted by their curates, deteigne their tithes, and so redubbe and requite one wrōge with another, or be hys awne Iudge, but shall truely pay thesame, as he hath been accustomed, to theyr persons, vi∣cars, and curates, without any restrainte or diminucion. And suche lacke and default, as they can iustely fynde in their persons and cu∣rates, to cal for reformacion therof, at their or∣dinaries and other superiors hādes, who, vpō complaint, and due profe therof, shall refour∣me thesame accordingly. ALSO, that no persone shall from hens∣furth,
altre or chaunge the ordre and maner of any fastyng daye that is commaunded, nor of cōmon prayer or diuine seruice, otherwise then is specified in these Iniuncciōs, vntil such ty∣me as thesame, shalbe otherwise ordered and transposed, by the Kynges auctoritie. ALSO, that euery Person, Vicar, Curate, Chauntry preeste and stipendarye, being vn∣der the degree of bachilar of Diuinitie, shall prouyde, and haue of hys awne, within three monethes after this visitacion, the new Testa∣ment, both in Latyn and in English, with Pa∣raphrasis vpon thesame of Erasmus, and di∣ligently studye thesame, conferringe the one with the other. And the Bishoppes, and other ordynaryes by them selfes. or their officers, in their synodes and visitacions, shall examyne the sayde ecclesiasticall persones, howe they haue proffited in the studye of holy scripture. ALSO, in the tyme of highe masse, within euery churche, he that sayeth or singeth the same, shall reade, or cause to be redde, the Epi∣stell and Gospell of that masse, in Englishe, & not in Latyn, in the pulpit, or in suche conue∣nient place, as the people may heare the same. And also euery Sondaye and holy daye, they shall playnely and distinctely, reade, or cause to be redde, one chapiter of the new testament in Englishe, in the sayde place at Matyns, im∣mediately after the lessons, and at Euēsonge, after Magnificat, one Chapyter off the olde
Testamēt. And to the intēt the premisses, may be more conueniently done: The Kynges ma∣iesties pleasure is, that whē. ix. lessons should be redde in the Churche, thre of them shalbe o∣mitted, and left out with their respondes. And at Euensonge tyme, the respondes with al the memories shalbe left of, for that purpose. ALSO, because those persones, whiche be sicke, and in perel of death, be oftentymes put in dispaire, by the craft and subtiltie of ye de∣uill, who is then most busy, and specially with them, that lacke the knowledge, sure perswa∣siō, and stedfast belief, that they maye be made partakes of the greate and infinite mercye, whiche almightye God, of his moste boūtiful goodnes, and meere liberalitie, without oure deseruinge, hath offered frely to all persons, that putteth their full trust and confidence in him: Therfore, that this damnable vice of dis∣paire, maye be clerely taken awaye, and firme belefe, and stedfast hope, surely conceyued of all their parishyoners, beyng in any daūgier, they shall learne, and haue alwayes in a redy∣nes, suche confortable places and sentences of scripture, as do setfurth the mercy, benefi∣tes and goodnes of almighty God, towardes all penitent, and beleuyng persones, that they may at all tymes, when necessitie shal require, promptly comfort their flocke, with the liuely woorde of God, whiche is the onely staye of mans conscience.
ALSO, to auoyde all contencion and strief, whiche hertofore hath risen, emōg the kynges Maiesties subiectes, in sondrie places of his Realmes and dominions, by reason of fonde curtesie, and chalengyng of places in processi∣on, and also that they maie the more quietely, heare that whiche is saied or song, to their ede∣fiyng: they shall not from hensefurthe, in any parishe churche, at any time vse any processiō, about the Churche or Churche yarde, or other place, but immediately before high Masse, the priestes with other of the queire, shal kneele in the middes of the Churche, and synge or saye, plainly & distinctly, the Letany, whiche is set∣furthe in Englishe, with al the Suffrages fo∣lowyng, and none other Procession, or Letany to be had or vsed, but the saied Letanie in En∣glish, addyng nothyng therto, but as the kyn∣ges grace, shall hereafter appoynt: and in Ca∣thedrall or Collegiate churches, thesame shal∣be doen in suche places, as our Commissaries in oure visitacion shall appoynte. And in the tyme of the Letanie, of the high Masse, of the Sermon, and when the priest readeth the scri∣pture to the parishioners, no maner of perso∣nes, without a iuste and vrgent cause, shal de∣parte out of the Churche: and all ringing and knowlynge of Belles, shalbe vtterly forborne for that tyme, excepte one Belle, in conuenient time, to be rōg or knowled before the Sermō. ALSO, like as the people be commonly oc∣cupied
on the worke day, with bodily labor, for their bodely sustenaunce: so was the holy daye at the firste beginninge Godly instituted and ordeined, that the people should that day, geue themselfes wholy to God. And wheras in oure tyme, God is more offended then pleased, more dishonored, then honored, vpon the holy daye, because of idlenes, pryde, drunckennesse, que∣rellyng, and brawlyng, whiche are moste vsed, in suche dayes, people neuerthelesse, perswa∣dinge themselfes, sufficiently to honor God on that daie, if thei heare Masse & seruice, though they vnderstande nothyng, to their edefiynge: therfore all the Kynges faithfull and louynge subiectes, shall from hensefurth celebrate, and kepe their holy daye, accordynge to Gods ho∣ly wil & pleasure, that is: in hearyng the worde of God redde and taughte: in priuate and pu∣blique praiers: in knowledging their offences to God, and amendement of thesame: in recon∣cilynge their selfes charitably to their neigh∣bors, where displeasure hath been: in often ty∣mes receiuinge the communiō, of the very bo∣die and bloudde of Christe: in visitynge of the poore & sicke: in vsyng all sobernes, and godly conuersacion, Yet notwithstandynge, all Per∣sones, Vicars, and Curates, shall teache and declare, vnto their parishioners, that thei may with a saufe and quiete conscience, in the tyme of Harueste, labor vpon the holy and festiuall dayes, and saue that thyng whiche God hath
sent. And if for any scrupulositie, or grudge of conscience, men should supersticiously, abstain from working vpon those daies, that then they should greuously offende and displease God. ALSO, forasmuche as variaunce and con∣tencion, is a thynge whiche moste displeaseth God, and is moste contrary to the blessed com∣munion of the body and bloude of oure sauior Christe: Curates shall in nowise admitt to the receyuinge therof, any of their cure and flocke, who hath maliciously and openly contended with his neighbor, onles thesame do firste cha∣ritably and openly, reconcile hym self agayne, remittynge all rancor and malice, whatsoeuer controuersie hath been betwene theim: and ne∣uerthelesse, their iuste titles and rightes, they may charitably, prosecute before suche as haue aucthoritie to heare thesame. ALSO, that euery Deane, Archedeacon, Master of Collegiate churche, Master of Ho∣spitall, and Prebendary, beynge Prieste, shall preache by himself personally, twise euery yere at the leaste, either in the place, where he is en∣tituled, or in some Churche, where he hath iu∣risdiccion, or els whiche is to the said place ap∣propriate, or vnited, ALSO, that they shal instructe and teache in their Cures, that no man ought obstinately, and maliciously, breake and violate, the lau∣dable Ceremonies of the Churche, by the kyng commaunded, to be obserued, and as yet not
abrogated. And on the otherside, that whosoe∣uer doth supersticiously abuse theim, doth the same to the greate periel and daungier of hys soule healthe: as in castinge holy Water vpon hys bedde, vpon Images, and other dedde thinges, or bearinge aboute hym holy breade, or sainct Ihons Gospell, or makynge Crosses of woodde vpon Palme Sundaye, in tyme of readinge of the Passion, or kepinge of priuate holy dayes, as Bakers, Brewers, Smithes, Shoomakers, & suche other do, or ringing of ye holy Belles, or blessing with the holy candel, to thintent, therby to be discharged of the bur∣den of synne, or to driue awaie Deuilles, or to put awaie dreames and phantasies, or in put∣tinge truste and confidence of healthe and sal∣uacion, in thesame Ceremonies: when they be onely ordeyned, instituted and made, to put vs in remembraunce of the benefites, whiche wee haue receyued by Christe. And if he vse theim for any other purpose, he greuously offendeth GOD. ALSO, that they shall take awaye, vtterly extincte, and destroye, all shrines, couerynge of shrines, all tables, candelstickes, tryndilles or rolles of waxe, pictures, paintynges, and all other monumentes of fained miracles, pilgre∣mages, Idolatry, and supersticiō: so that there remain, no memory of thesame, in walles, glas∣ses, windowes, or els where, within their chur∣ches or houses. And they shall exhorte all their
parishioners, to doo the lyke within their seue∣rall houses. And that the Churche Wardey∣nes, at the common charge of the parishioners in euery Churche, shall prouide a comely and honest pulpitte, to be set in a conuenient place within thesame, for the preachynge of Gods woorde. ALSO, thei shall prouide, and haue within three monethes after this visitacion, a stronge Cheste, with a hoole in the vpper parte therof, to bee prouided, at the coste and charge of the parishe, hauyng three keyes, whereof, one shall remayne in the custodie, of the Persone, Vy∣car, or Curate, and the other twoo, in the cu∣stodie of the Churche Wardeynes, or any o∣ther twoo honeste men, to be appoynted, by the parishe, from yere to yere. Whiche Cheste, you shall sette and fasten, nere vnto the highe aul∣ter, to the intente, the Parishioners, shoulde putte into it, their Oblacion and almose, for their poore neighbours. And the Persone, Vi∣car, and Curate, shall diligently, from tyme to tyme, and specially, when men make their Te∣stamentes, call vpon, exhorte, and moue their neighboures, to conferre and geue, (as they maye well spare) to the sayde Cheste: declaring vnto theim, whereas heretofore they haue been diligente, to bestowe muche substaunce, otherwyse then GOD commaunded, vpon Pardons, Pylgrymages, Trentalles, dec∣kynge of Images, offerynge of Candelles,
geuyng to Friers, & vpon other like blynd de∣uocions, they ought at this tyme, to be muche more ready to helpe the poore and nedy, know∣yng that to releue the poore, is a true worship∣ping of God, required earnestly, vpon payn of euerlastyng dampnacion: and that also, what∣soeuer is geuen for their comforte, is geuen to Christ hym self, and so is accepted of hym, that he will mercifully, rewarde thesame with euer∣lastinge life. The whiche almosse, and deuociō of the people, the kepers of the keyes, shall at tymes conuenient, take out of the Cheste, and distribute thesame, in the presence of the whole parishe, or sixe of theim, to be truly and faithe∣fully deliuered, to their moste nedy neighbors: and if they be prouided for, then to the repara∣cion of high waies, nexte adioynyng. And also the money whiche riseth of fraternities, guyl∣des, and other stockes of the Church (except by the Kynges Maiesties aucthoritie, it be other∣wise appoynted) shalbe put into the said chest, and conuerted to the said vse, and also the ren∣tes of landes, the profite of cattaill, and money geuen or bequethed, to the findyng of torches, lightes, tapers, and lampes, shalbe conuerted to the sayde vse, sauyng that it shalbe lawfull for them, to bestowe parte of the sayd profites, vpon the reparacion of the Churche, if greate neede require, and whereas the Parishe is very poore, and notable otherwyse to repaire thesame.
AND for asmuche as Priestes be publique ministers of the Churche, and vpon the holy daies, ought to applie theim selfes, to the com∣mon administracion of the whole parishe, they shall not be bounde to go to women liynge in chyld bedde, except in tyme of daungerous sic∣kenes, and not to fetche any corse, before it be brought to the Churche yarde: & if the woman be sicke, or the corse brought to the Church, the Priest shall do his duetie accordingly, in visi∣tyng the woman, and buriyng the deed person. ALSO, to auoide the detestable synne of sy∣mony, because biyng and sellyng of benefices, is execrable before God: Therfore, al such per∣sones as bye any benefices, or come to them by fraude or deceipte, shalbe depriued of suche benefices, and be made vnhable at any tyme after, to receyue any other spiritual promociō. And suche as do sell them, or by any colour do bestowe them, for their awne gain and profite, shall lose their righte and title of patronage, and presentement for that tyme, and the gifte therof for that vacacion, shall apperte in to the Kynges Maiestie. ALSO, because through lacke of preachers in many places of the Kinges realmes and do∣minions, the people continue in ignoraunce and blyndenes: all Persones, Vicars, and Curates, shall reade in their Churches, euery Sondaye, one of the Homilies, whiche are and shalbe sethfurthe, for thesame purpose, by
the Kynges aucthoritie, in suche sorte, as they shalbe appoynted to doo, in the preface of the same. ALSO, whereas many indiscrete persones, doo at this daye, vncharitably contempne and abuse priestes and ministers of the Church, be∣cause some of them, (hauinge small learninge) haue of long time fauoured phantasies, rather then Gods truthe: yet for asmuche, as their office and funccion, is appoynted of God: The Kynges Maiestie willeth and chargeth, al his louynge subiectes, that from hensefurthe, they shall vse theim charitably and reuerently, for their office and ministracion sake, and especi∣ally, all suche as labor in the settynge furth of Gods holy woorde. ALSO, that all maner of persones, whiche vnderstande not the Latin toungue, shall pray vpon none other Primer, but vpon that, whi∣che was lately setfurth in Englishe, by auctho∣ritie of Kynge Henry the .VIII. of moste fa∣mous memorie. And that no teacher of youth, shall teache any other, then the sayde Prymer. And all those, whiche haue knowledge of the latin toungue, shall pray vpon none other la∣tin Primer, but vpon that, whiche is likewise setfurthe by the sayde aucthoritie. And that all graces to be sayde at dyner and supper, shal be alwaies sayde in the Englishe toungue. And that none other Grammer, shalbe taught in a∣ny Schoole or other place, within the Kynges
realmes and dominions, but onely that which is set furth by the sayde aucthoritie. ITEM, that all Chauntrie Priestes, shall exercise them selfes, in teachyng youth to read and write, and bringyng them vp in good ma∣ners, and other vertuous exercises. ITEM, when any Sermon or Homilye shalbe had, the Pryme and Houres shalbe o∣mitted. ❧ The fourme of biddyng the common prayers. YOV shall praye for the whole congregaciō of Christes Churche, and speciallie, for thys Churche of Englande and Irelande: wherin, first, I commende to your deuoute praiers, the kynges moste excellent Maiestie, supreme hed ymmediately vnder GOD, of the spiritualtye and temporaltie of thesame Churche: And for Quene Katharine dowagr, and also for my ladie Mary, and my ladie Elizabeth, the Kyn∣ges susters. SECONDLY you shall praye for my lorde Protectors grace, with all the reste of the kyn∣ges Maiesties Counsaill: for all the lordes of this realme, and for the Cleargie, and the com∣mons of thesame: besechynge almightie God, to geue euery of theim, in hys degree, grace to
vse thēselfes in suche wise, as maye be to God∣des glorie, the Kynges honor, and the weale of this realme. THIRDELY, you shall praye, for all them that be departed out of this world, in the fayth of Christe, that they with vs, and we with them at the daye of Iudgement, maye rest both bo∣dy and soule, with Abrahā, Isaac, and Iacob, in the kyngdom of heauen. ALL whiche and synguler Iniunc∣cions, the kynges Maiestie, ministe∣reth vnto his Clergie, and their suc∣cessours, and to all other his louyng subiectes: straightly chargynge and commaū∣dinge them, to obserue and kepe thesame, vpon payne of depriuaciō, sequestracion of fruictes of benefices, suspension, excommunicaciō, and suche other cohercion, as to Ordinaries or other hauyng Ecclesiastical iurisdicciō, whom his Maiestie hath appoynted for the due exe∣cucion of the same, shalbe sene cōuenient: char∣gyng and commaundyng them, to se these In∣iunccions, obserued and kepte of all persones, beynge vnder their Iurisdiccion, as they wyll aunswere to hys Maiestie for the cōtrary. And hys Maiesties pleasure is, that euery Iu∣stice of peace (beyng required) shall as∣sist the Ordinaries, and euery of them, for the due execucion of the sayde Iniunccions.
