FAITHFUL JEMMY, And Constant SÆ²SAN, Living near Reddriff. When Iemmy he was bound to Sea, Susan she did complain, Said he, my Dear, be of good chear, while I return again. To the Tune of, State and Ambition. JEMMY and SUSAN both loving and Loyal, and in their Embraces their joys did abound, Fortune divided them, this was a tryal, sweet Susan with sorrow encompassed round: Now he was forced to leave his sweet Susan, and also commanded to hoist up their Sail, This was a grief to them both in conclusion, ah! how she in sorrow then did bewail. Thus his sweet Susan alas! she lamented, she blaming the fate and her fortune unkind, Jemmy beholding his heart then relented, he said my dear Creature, thou surely shalt find: Though for a time we must now be divided, my heart I will lodge and lay up in thy breast, If by the powers above we are guided, when I return my dear love shall be blest. I do desire to have Life no longer, then I do intend to prove true to my Dear, Though for a time we are parted asunder, yet I will be faithful, love be of good cheer: Never was creature more fair and compleater, then my loving Susan, the joy of my mind, Graced with Beauty in every feature, I'le be unchangable, Love thou shalt find. Oh that my sighs and my tears were prevailing, my dear to enjoy thee, and all would be well; But in thy absence all blessings are failing, sweet Jemmy 'tis thee that my grief can expel: Love do not leave me, sweet Jemmy reprieve me, now from those sad fighing, and sorrow and grief, Thou hast my heart, dear Jemmy believe me, then take some pitty and yield me relief. My dearest Jemmy, the Seas they have danger, when in raging Tempests the Billows do roar, I to those sorrows my Love am a stranger, and whn thou art gone I shall ne'r see thee more: I have five hundred pounds to my portion, in Silver and Gold, love all shall be thine; Why shouldst thou hazzard thy Life on the Ocean, and leave me in sorrow here to repine? Cease my sweet Susan, for I am engaged, with Noble Commanders to Sail on the Main, Love, let thy sorrows and tears be asswaged, dear be but contented and do not complain. Let not my absence my jewel so grieve thee, the pride of my Heart and joy of my mind, Take here my Ring as a pledge I will leave thee, and I will be faithful, love thou shalt find. Then from her fair Eyes the tears they did trickle, like streams that flow'd down from the fountain of love, Faithful and Loyal, and scorns to be fickle, her heart it was fixed and could not remove; Susan in sorrow almost broken-hearted, the wind it did serve with a most pleasant gale, Then these two Lovers, alas! they were parted, for the goodly Ship was now under Sail: Now he is gone, may the Heavens protect him, from all the proud Waves of the Tempestuous Main, Keep him from danger, and always direct him, and send him in safety to England again: Here to compleat our joys with a blessing, in a true Lovers knot which can ne'r be unty'd; All that is mine, he shall then be possessing, and never depart till Death us divide. FINIS. Printed for I. Deacon, at the Angel in Guilt-spur-street.
