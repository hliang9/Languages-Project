Sermo die lune in ebdomada Pasche
Ipse Ihūs apropinquans ibat cū illis. Thyse Wordes ben conteyned in the xxiiij. chapytre of Luke▪ and rad in the holy gospel of this day. To say in englyssh tonge The same Ihūs nyghynge walkyd with mankyn∣de / This Ioyous trouth conteyneth in itselfe two partyes / In whoos declaracyon wyth our lordys mercy & your suffraūce. shall stonde the sōme of this poore collacōn. The fyrste is this / that the same Ihūs nyghed to mankynde. The second is. that the same Ihūs hath wallryd wt mankyn∣de / Of whyche two pryncyples foloweth as a con∣clusyon the entent o his nyghyng and walkynge. That the same Ihūs hath broughte mankynd to the euerlastynge reste of heuen / For sure it is. y• this same Ih of whyche I purp to treate. neuer put man to labour / but to the entent. that he sholde af∣ter his labour haue full reste, ye & for thorte labour haue eternall reste / as after shall appere. Yet or I descende to the declaracōn of thise two partyes / for as moche as I saye. that the same Ihūs nyghynge walkyd with mankynd / I shall shewe you of whi∣che Ihūs I meane. whyche it was that nyghed to man that walkyd wyth man. & that fynally brou∣ghte man to euerlastynge reste in heuen. Where ye
shall vnderstonde. that of dyuers we rede in holy scrypture whiche were namyd Ihūs. of thre in espe∣cyall / al men of noble memory. & of grete praysyng And but figures & seruauntes of the same Ihūs of whom wyth his mercy. I purpoos pryncypally to trete. The first was) Ihūs fili{us} Naue (The secon∣de was (Ihūs fili{us} Iosedec) And the thyrde was (Ihūs fili{us}) the sone of Sirach / All thyse thre. and eche of this. was for his tyme y• fygure of the four∣the Ihūs / callyd (Ihūs filius dei) Iesus the sone of god / The same Ihesus whyche nyghynge. wal∣kyd wyth mankynde / ¶To whose declaracōn ye shall vnderstonde. that Ihūs by interpretacōn. is to saye (saluator) a sauyour or helper / Now soth it is that eche of thyse thre rehercyd. was in his tyme an helper or sauer of the people / And yet but in fy∣gure of Ihūs Cryste. Wherof folowyth / that they were not the same Ihūs of whom I purpoos talke For he bothe was & is (saluator mūdi) the sauyour of the worlde. ¶How eche of thyse thre Ihūs reher¦cyd dyde helpe. & saue y• people in his tyme / I shall shewe you. The fyrst Ihūs the sone of Naue. sa∣uyd the people ({per} potenciā) The seconde ({per} obedien¦ciā) And the thyrd ({per} sapienciā) The fyrste saued the people by myght & power. The seconde by pe∣fyte obedyence. The thyrde by his grete wysdom. ¶The fyrste of them callyd Ihūs Naue. at hebre∣ees namyd Iosue Benun after saynt Ierom i his prologe (cū Iosue) the fyrste ruler of y• chyldren
of Israel after the deth of Moyses the seruaunt of god / as it appereth in the fyrste chapytre of Iusue. was conuenyently namyd Ihūs / For by the grete myghte & power geuen vnto hym of very Ihūs. he notably sauyd the people of god / as in the story of Iosue playnly doth appere. acordynge vnto y• pro∣myse of god made vnto him in the fyrste chapytre of the same boke / as foloweth (My seruaunt Moy¦ses sayd god vnto Iosue is deed & from this world departid. Arise thou & passe ouer the water of Ior∣dan. thou. & all my people wyth the. in to the lon∣de of repromyssion. whiche I shal geue to y• chyldn of Israel. what so euer grounde ye shal set on your fete. I shal geue it to you. as I promysid to Moyses my seruaunt. It folowyth soone after / Noo man shall mow resyst thy power in all thy lyfe. be thou herof comfortid. & take strengthe vnto the. ¶Now how this myghty prynce executyd the hyghe cōma¦undement of god in helpynge the people & sauyng y• same by the grete power geuen vnto hym of god y• sayd story of Iosue playnly doth declare ¶Short¦ly rehercyd. eccliastic. the .xlvi. chapite (Ihūs naue sayth he successour vnto Moyses strong in were & bataylle. was a man of grete name / but of grettest name was he in helpynge of the people of god. to distroye his enmyes. where by he myght atteyne to the people of god promysid / whiche glory and renō∣mee of name he obsteyned in lyftyng his hondes & scute. in shetynge of sharpe & fyy arowes ayenst y•

He distoryed the aduer¦saryes of Cryste. and sette his people in reste & pe∣as / Ye but amonge all his praysynges: his memo∣ry is specyally laudable / For what cōmaundid him to do. that gladly fulfylled he wythoute grutche o ieluctacōn. leuynge example vnto all pryncis & ru∣lers
of the people vnder god to doo the same. Our lorde cōmaundyd hym. as in the fyrste chapytre of Iosue doth appere this wyse. ¶Be thou sayth god vnto this valyaunt knyghte stronge & hertely com forid. se ye thou obserue & kepe al my lawes cōma∣undyd vnto the by my seruaunt Moyses. Declyne thou neuer fro them ne in to y• ryght honde. ne yet in to the lyfte honde / that is to saye. ne in prospery∣te. ne yet in aduersyte / so y• vnderstondynge of my lawes be thy leder. Lete in no wyse the boke of my lawe departe from thy mouth: ut sette therin thy meditacōn bothe nyghte & day / so y• thou may tru∣ly obserue al thynges there wythin wryten & com∣maūdyd / This cōmaundement of god he gladly fulfylled as it appereth in the .xi. chapytre of ye sa∣me boke. in this worde (As our lorde commaunded vnto Moyses: so Moyses cōmaunded vnto Iosue) And he gladly accomplysshed all goddis preceptes There escapyd hym not one worde of goddis pre∣ceptes / but to the extremytee he fulfyllyd them all. Loke & this well beholde ye Iuges of this worlde. lerne the lawes of god / and se ye theim obseruyd & keptleest ye perysshe from the ryght waye of god / For & ye be one in prosperyte. a nother in aduersyte One for affeccōn. a nother for money. one for loue. a nother for hate: thenneere ye fro the ryght way of Ihūs. ¶Of y• seconde Ihūs namyd Ihūs of laudable memory in the scrypture of god. was Ihūs y• sone of Iosedech. the grete preest of y• lawe
& one of the .lxx. Interpretours of the Bible / This grete preest of the lawe at the highe cōmaūdement of god in y• mouth of Cu. 9. kyng & fyrst Monarke of Perse. whom our lorde had wt his grace inspy∣red / as in y• fyrste chapytre of the fyrst boke of Es∣dre doth appere. to release the captiuyte of the Iuys Whyche for theyr synnes hadr ben in thraldom in Babylon by the space of .lxx. yere after the distruc∣cōn of Ihrlm. & subuersion of the temple of god in the same. by Nabugodonosor. & Nabuzardan hys capytayne / This grete preest I saye Ihūs the sone of Iosedech. was in his tyme conuenyently named Ihūs. y• helper & sauer of the people of god (per sa∣cram obedienciā. by holy obedience / as Ihūs Nau was Ihūs. sauer and helper of the people ({per} magni¦ficā potenciā) by his grete & myghty power geuyn vnto hym of god. To shewe you this. ye must vn∣derstonde / that for the synnes of the Iewes it pley∣syd god. to haue them punysshed / so were they acor¦dyng to the propheci of Ieremye. the .xxvij. chapy∣tre. Theyr cyte. theyr temple of grete honour was dystroyed. Sediche theyr laste kynge was exocula∣te & made blynde. brought wyth all his noblesse in to Babiloe by Nabugodonosor. & there kepte in streyte captiuyte by the space of .lxx. yere. And here was an ende of kynges in the genelogy of Crist as by the processe of the Byble playnly dooth appere. For soth it is y• after the tyme of this transmigra∣cōn vnto Cristis natiuyte. where regalyte & preest∣hode
were Ioyned in one in our sauyour Ihū Crist The Iewes beyng in ther lyberte or captiuyte. had neuer moo kynges / but oonly prestes & dukes. bys∣shops & pryncis / But thenne were bysshops rulers of the people. & pyncis helpers & coadutours / So yt the lyne of kynges after this transmigracōn ses∣syd as in rule. not in successyon / And thenne began the lyne of bysshops in rulynge of the people. whi∣che contynuelly enduryd vnto Cristis tēporall na∣tiuyte / This declaryth the Mayster of the storyes who so lyste to se it. ¶Now the fyrste of thyse gre∣te preestis or Bysshops hauynge rule of the people. was this Ihūs the sone of Iosedech A man of gre∣te zele. & deuowte obedyence vnto god / so yt he was conuenyently namyd Ihūs. helper or sauer of ye pe∣ple by deuowte obedyence. leuynge example to alle preestys. prelates in especyall to beere deuowte obe∣dience vnto almyghty god. & teche other the same For whan it pleysid our lorde to haue his people re¦leuyd from theyr captiuyte. & his temple in Ihrlm to be reedifyed to his honour & praysyng: he cōmit¦tid therof the rule vnto Zorobabel sone to Salat∣ell. & to this Ihū the sone of Iosedech / as in ye pro∣phecy of Agge playnly dooth appere. Declarid at large in the fyrste boke of ldre. the fyrste. thirde. & syxte chapytours. ¶And full conuenyently was this besynes cōmyttid vnto thise two men of auc∣toryte & honour / For of y• one. that is of Zorobabel our Ihūs. our sauyour descendyd by his temporall
natiuyte. as it apereth in the fyrst chapitre of Ma∣thewe. ¶The other. that is Ihūs Iosedech prepa∣ryd the people by due obedyence. truly to serue god in this materyall Temple whyche they thenne to goddis honoure reedifyed / but more vrely to serue god in the temple of Crystis holy body whyche he toke of Zorobabell. and was in it togyder god and man in one persone / Of whiche holy temple of his body. hymselfe sayd. the seconde chapytre of Iohn / ¶Dissolue ye this temple. & wythin thre dayes I shall reyse it agayn. & soone after foloweth. Thy∣se wordes sayd our sauyour Ihū Cryst of the tem∣ple of his holy body. Of whiche holy temple of cris¦tis body was spirytually vnderstonde the prophe∣cy of Agge. in the seconde chapytre. ¶Ferre gretter sayth this prophete. shall be the glory of this secon¦de temple. than was of the fyrste buylded by Salo¦mon / Spyrytually I saye For the letter full harde it is. to expowne of this temple reedifyed bi Ihū Io¦sedech. Zorobabell & other Iewes. Sy this second temple was neuer half so gloryous as was that fyr¦ste buylyed by Salomon. ne in buyldyng ne et in aparell as Iosephus declareth / For in y• fyrst tem∣ple was conteyned the arke of the olde testament. in it concernyng the tables of the lawe. Manna & the rodde of Aaron. whiche flourisshid & fructifyed by myracle. The appostle this declareth to the He∣breos the .ix. chapytre. Many also precyous Iewels & tresours were in that temple born awaye by Na∣bugodonosor.

Many wyses thys seconde temples with his holy presence dyde dedicate & inourne / For in to this Temple by his holy vyrgyn & moder at her purifycacōn he was offryd vnto god / In this Temple his holy moder fonde hym in myddes of doctours. From this temple he droue oute byars & sellers / In this temple he often prayed. prechyd. & many myracles shewed. grete thenne was y• glory of this holy hous. & ferre gretter than euer was the glory of Salomons temple. sy our sauyour Crist Ihūs this second temple so many wayes made ho¦ly & gloryous / ¶Thenne to my purpoos I saye y• this grete preest & bysshop Ihūs Iosedech was full conuenyently namyd Ihūs an helper or sauer of y• people by his holy & zelose obedyence / For whe: as the people of god longe tyme in captiuyte of Ba∣bylon.

This grete preest & bysshop a∣cordynge to his offyce & duety. with helpe of Zoro∣babell the true prynce & seruaunt of god. as tymely as they had lycence of Cir{us} & Dari{us} to retorne ho¦me. and to reedifye. the temple of god: what obedi∣ence was in this holy bysshop. ye & wyth dylygence also to brynge the people to the true & faste obedy∣ence of god. the fyrste boke of Esdre playnly dooth declare / ¶So y• hymselfe was fully obedyent vnto almgyghty goddys wyl. and taughte al the people to the same / As it doth appere as well of the spedy buyldynge of the temple / as of ympnes. oblacyon sacrifyces. with other praysynges of god / whiche he & the Leuites at his cōmaundement. shewed & ma¦de vnto goddis worshyppe & praysynge. Fyrste in settynge the fundacyon of the sayd temple. as it is declaryd the fyrste boke of Esdre the thyrde chapy¦tre. ¶Zorobabell sayth he the sone of Salatiel. & Ihūs the sone of Iosedech. & other of ther brethern preestes & Leuites and all the resydue of Iewes de∣lyuerde from captyuyte ordeynyd Leuites from .xx yeres age & aboue. to suruey the artifycers gadered to the newe buyldynge of this temple. that they dy¦de not neclygently theyr labour. Iosue also. whi∣che was Ihs Iosedech. wyth his chyldn & bredern.
as one man of one mynde & herte dyde all theyr di¦lygence to spede this holy werke. What Ioye what gladnesse was there made bi this holy Ihs. & other the seruauntes of god by his example & techynge. at the settynge of the fundacōn of this seconde tē∣ple. there forthwt appereth. ¶All the people sayth Esdras there gadryd. cryed wyth grete voys to god¦dys prasynge / for as moche as the fundacōn of the temple was sette. Many also of y• olde faders whi∣che had seen the temple of Salomon stondynge. & this temple now begyn. wepte wyth an hyghe vo∣ys / And many there present lyfte theyr voyces in Ioye & gladnes. Suche agmixcōn was there of crie amonge the people to goddys praysynge / that noo man myght discerne the voyces of wepers. from y• voyces of Ioyfull people. so y• all enioyed in god. Of this appereth morally. that one vertuous prela¦te dooth moche good in crystis chyrche / as well for his owne vertue & zelose obedyence vnto the lawe of god: as in ledynge other men o do the same by his holy doctryne and vertuous example. ¶Agayn where this buyldynge of the temple was interrup∣tid in ye tyme of Cambises sone vnto Cir{us}. whom some callyd Assuer{us}. some Arthazarses / But in the tyme of Cambises was it. yt the werke of god. this buyldynge went not forwarde / but lettyd was it by fals accusars / whyche neuer cesse in the chyrche of Cryste to lette the werkes of god / as dayly expery∣ence dooth shewe: Whan Darius kynge of Babi∣bilon

Ye & what Ioye & loouyng was geuen to god in dedica¦cōn of the same temple: in the syxte chapytre of the fyrste boke of Esdre playnly dooth appere. ¶So∣me men here present. ye & not a fewe. woll perauen¦ture muse / why & to what entent I brynge in thys longe story of Ihūs Iosedech. the grete preest of ye olde lawe / Surely this is my cause / For syth al ho∣ly scripture is wryten for our erudicōn after y• apos¦te the .xv. chapytre to the Romayns / That we to whom trouthe is made open by Ihū Cryste. as te∣cheth saynt Iohn in the fyrste chapytre. sholde lern obedience. lerne zele & dilygence to the lawe of god of thyse faders passyd in fygure. And agayn to ta∣ke grete sham̄ & conscyence whan we rede them to haue doon so zelously in goddys cause. And behol¦de ourself. how neclygent we ben in the same / For cursyd is he whyche dooth the werkes of god frau∣delently. after Ieremye. the .xlviij. chapytre. They buylded. we distroye. they gadryd. we disperge. they curyd. we kylle. They made. we marre.

The fyrs¦ste was Ihūs Naue. helper and sauer of the people by myghte & power. The seconde was Ihūs Io∣sedech. sauer of the seruauntes of god by deuowte obedyence / as now hath be declared / The thyrde of laudable memory of the same name was Ihūs filius Sirach. the sone of Sirach. sonnys sone vn∣to Ihū Iosedech / as hymself rehercyth in his Pro∣loge of the boke namyd by hym Ecclesiasticus. ¶And full conuenyently was thys fader namyd Ihūs. an helper or sauer of the people ({per} sapienciā by his grete wysdom geuen vnto hym of god. and by hym taughte to the people. vnto the worldes en¦de. by reason of his laudable wysdom left behynde hym in wrytyng in the boke of wysdom callyd Ec¦clesiasticus. whyche boke. hymself fyrste made and wrote in Hebrewe tonge. and after translatyd the same in to Grekes tonge / As.

And very wyse men comynly ordre wel al theyr dedes & neuer erre And for this cause. that men wolde not erre from theyr ende. ye naturally entendyd. what zele & be∣synesse olde faders had to atteyne wisdom / wonder it is to rede. as at large declareth saynt Ierom in his epistle (ad paulinū) the prologe of the Byble it is / ¶We rede sayth saynt Ierom in old storyes. ma¦ny men haue soughte ferre countrees. straunge na∣cyns. & passid ryght peryllous sees / that they myg∣hte speke famyliarly with suche philosophers. who¦se werkes thei befor tyme had rad. to lerne of them wysdom / This dyde bothe Pictagoras & Plato. of whom sayth saynt Ierom in the same place (Su∣che

Aristotle one of the grete enserchers. of the same: sayd there were two kyndes or parties. in the syxte boke of his Ethikis. That one is callyd Prudence. the other Sapyence. ¶Prudence▪ after him is a wisdom to lede man that he erre not from his resonable ende intendid in worldly occupacōn & besynesse. ¶And Sapyence after hym stondeth in speculacōn of highe & presume causes. so that sapi∣ence
