AN EPISTLE TO THE FLOCK OF Christ Jesus, (And Professors of Truth in General amongst us,) Being to them a Tender Visitation from the True and Living God; And chiefly Intended for such as Profess the True Spirit. To which is added, A Testimony concerning the Precious Uni∣ty of the Spirit, with a Postscript to both. By Charles Marshall. The Second Edition, with Aditions. London, Printed and Sold by T. Soele, nex Door to the Meeting-House in W-Hart-Court in Gracious-Street, and at the Bible in Leadr Hall-Street, 1697.
THis Epistle, which has been very Serviceable, being out of Print (and has been so several Years) is thought meet, at the Request of Friends, to be Re∣printed, with some Additions, for a farther Service.
AN EPISTLE TO THE FLOCK OF Christ Jesus, &c. Dearly Beloved Friends, WHEN we sate in Darkness, and in the Region of the haddow of Death, when Dark∣ess had covered the Earth, nd gross Darkness the People,
as well in this professing Nati∣on, as in others, in this long and tedious Night of Aposta∣cy, wherein even all Flesh had corrupted its way, and we were seeking the Living among the Dead; seeking our Bread in desolate Places, and were cast out into the open Field, and lay polluted in our Blood, wounded by Sin and Iniquity, and greatly Distressed for want of the Knowledge of Zion's Way to be cast up in this Day, even in the fulness of the Dis∣pensation of Time, did the Ho∣ly Lord God of Heaven and Earth Visit us, a People in this Northern Island, with his E∣verlasting Day Springing from on High; and this Day was a
Day of Love, beyond all Expres∣sions, which I am, from time to time, moved of the Lord to call into Remembrance in the Ears of his People; it's a Day never to be forgotten: For if the Day of outward Israel's Visitation, in outward Egypt, was to be kept in a continued Remembrance, how much more ought the Day of the Vi∣sitation of Spiritual Israel, in Spiritual Egypt, in Spiritual Thraldom, under the Spiritual Task-masters, to be kept in per∣petual Remembrance. And dear Friends, You know what manner of entrance Truth made in its first Appearance, in the Day of our first tender Vi∣sitation; how it regarded not
the empty Profession of any, but broke in upon us, pricking us to the Heart, bringing us to a true Sence of our inward States and Conditions before the Lord; where, notwith∣standing all the fair Shews of Professions, we saw our Im∣mortal Souls in Death, and Bu∣ried in the Grave of Sin, and the Nature of Transgression Exalted above all that was cal∣led God in us; and we had not only a fight of this our De∣plorable State, but also a sight of him whom we had Pierced, and whose Countenance we saw Marred more than any Man's, and his Visage more than the Sons of Men; and here many knew a Day of
Mourning, and a passing thro' a Vail of Tears, and a Drink∣ing of a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord; for, our awakened Souls cried unto the Lord, to be eased from under the Burden and Load of Iniquity, and the Li∣ving Lord God bowed down his Ear to the Cry of his Isra∣el, and manifested his Mighty Out-stretched Arm of Power, which wrought in us mightily, for the killing and making alive, for the casting down and raising up; and because of the work∣ing and operating of the Glori∣ous Power of the Immortal God, our very Tabernacles Trembled, so as that we be∣came as Signs and Wonders to
People, yea, to our very Ac∣quaintance and Relations: For we were as a People separated from all Comforts and De∣lights. And, my dear Friends, although it was thus with ma∣ny, yet it was a good Day; for the Judgments of the Lord be∣ing in the Earth, many learned Righteousness: And as this Im∣mortal Power was Bowed un∣to, and Lived in, it brought forth the Soul out of the hor∣rible Pit, which was an Answer to the Cries of the Panting Di∣stressed Hearts and Souls of many. And so, dear Friends, as the Lord God began an effectual Work by his Immortal, Living, Glorious Power, so hath he, by
the same, been carrying it on these many Years amongst us, notwithstanding the great Op∣positions it hath met with every way by the Power or Darkness, in them that went out from us, and from Men without, by ma∣ny and various Persecutions. Ah! How hath Leviathan, that crooked Serpent, wrought? Under how many Disguises hah he appeared in, to Rend and Devour? How many false Spirits hath he appeared in? And what endeavour hath the Old Serpent made to lay waste the Heritage of God? But, Blessed for ever be the Name of the Mighty God, who is laying waste that Serpentine Spirits working, and will lay
it waste, and tread it down for ever, under the Feet of his Anointed; and will make all their Skirts bare, who have called themselves Jews, and were not, but were, and are of the Synagogue of Satan, who would have Perverted the Right Way of the Lord, and would have risen up in the ful∣ness of the Enmity of the Old Crooked Serpent, against the Servants and Messengers of the Everlasting God, whom they have caused to go with Bow∣ed down Souls before the Lord: Friends, against that Spirit, in its Root and Branches, I have a certain Testimony from the Eternal God (who Lives for ever) to bear: And Wo from
God to the Vessels that are still Polluted with that Spirit. And, dear Friends, not only this Mercy have we received from the Hand of the Lord, to wit, The treading down of the Serpentine Spirit, which indeed I cannot but say, is not one of the least of the Mer∣cies and Kindnesses of our God; but as the Lord hath Appear∣ed Wonderful in Power for our inward Deliverances, so hath he appeared wonderful in Pow∣er for our outward Deliveran∣ces and Preservations from time to time, who hath bound the Seas with Swadling-bands, and hath said to the proud Waves, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther; Magnified be the
Name of the Lord God for e∣ver. And so, my dear Friends, on every Hand we are an in∣gaged, obliged People to the Lord, who hath been Digging, Dressing, Pruning and Wa∣tering us his Vineyard, from Day to Day, from Week to Week, from Assembly to As∣sembly; and his Living Pow∣er, that begun this good Work amongst us, in the Day of our first Tender Visitation, hath been carrying the same on to this Day. And now, Dearly Beloved Friends, in every place, this to you is the Message of the Lord of Hosts, the Almighty God, that I have received from his
Mouth, and am Necessitated, both by VVord and VVriting, to Sound in the Ears of the People of the Lord God, in this Nation peculiarly, which was the first of the Nations that was Visited in this his Ever∣lasting Glorious Day, That the Lord our Righteousness do re∣quire his People in every place, To keep stayed in that Immortal Light of Life, unto which they were directed in the Day of their first Tender Visitation; in that to feel the Vertue, Power and Efficacy of the Girdle of Truth, to Gird up the Loins of every ones Mind in the Light of Righ∣teousness, daily there to wait, to feel the Everlasting Power, and Right Arm of God's Salvation,
it's Manifestation, Operation, and effectual Working; that so thereby that Good and Ho∣ly Work, which the Lord God began amongst us, in the Day of our first tender Visitation (and hath been carrying on to this very Day) may now be finished and perfected; and the residue of that Nature (a∣gainst which the Sword of the Lord hath been Furbished) might utterly be Destroyed. And dear Friends, in the Name of the Everlasting God, this is the very Work of this Day, in and amongst the People of the Lord, and for this End doth the Lord spare many, and lengthens out the Day of Tran∣quillity of this Nation (with
which he has a sore Contro∣versie, whom he will assuredly Visit for its Iniquities) and therefore, Friends, let all prize their time, and the Loving Kindness of the Lord God, that is now extending it self unto his People in this Day, wherein he is laying his Hand of Love up∣on those called to be the Lot of his Inheritance, to pull them out of Spiritual Sodom fully; and this is the Voice that is to go through unto the Unfaith∣ul and Disobedient amongst us as it was of old, Come out of Babylon, come out of Babylon my People; so now) Come out of all Babylon's Abominations, touch o unclean thing; and be not Par∣akers with her in her Sin, that
none may may partake with her of her Plagues. Dear Friends, Nothing will now please the Lord, but a through Work, and real Clean∣sing, Sanctification throughout, in Soul, Body and Spirit, really Translated out of the Kingdom of Satan, into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God. And now, dear Friends, this perfect Salvation is no way at∣tained, but as there is an abi∣ding in the Way of it, closing with, and being Comprehend∣ed into that Light of Righte∣ousness, given to us to profit withal; for, in it is the Power received, in it is the Vertue of Life known, which no Mind is made worthy of the Enjoy∣ment
of, but that which can sit at Jesus's Feet, but that Mind which can stoop to the lowest Appearance of Christ Jesus, where the Mind is made as low and little as the Grain of Mustard-seed; here is the Entrance into the Power of Life, that gives Dominion, known; for many miss here, who come not down, so as to be nothing in the Love of this World, nor in any created Ob∣ject; to be nothing in Thoughts or Imaginations that are Evil, to have no Dalilah, no beloved Lust to be as the Right Hand, or as the Right Eye; for where the Mind is in these things En∣tangled, it finds not perfectly the Way of Life, the Place of
Power and Ability to stand over every Defilement and Temptation, of what Nature and Kind soever; for the Door of Hope is found in the Valley, where the Mind, Heart and Thoughts come to be as no∣thing in their own Eyes, be∣fore the Lord; here the Power hath its Passage, and here the Spirit of Life hath its free and perfect Operation, to work the Work of God effectually, until Man throughout be Leavened into the Lump of Life, brought up into the very Image of God: So then every one must come to be as a Child; yea, and as a weaned Child too; and here the Work of the Lord in the Heart and Soul goes forward
daily; for the Lord is weary of Out-side Professions, and they are before him as the Fig-Tree, that was covered with Leaves, but had no Fruit, Con∣cerning which Christ Jesus said, Never Man gather Fruit of thee, and it withered; so will it be with the False and Hypocritical Professions; for none shall be able to stand in the Day of the Lord, that hastens, but such as come to stand in the Possession of Life it self. And so, dear Friends, that every one may know the Blood of Sprinkling, that Sprinkles the Conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God in newness of Life; for where the Blood is not known, even
the Life of Jesus, but despised and trodden under Foot, there will the Destroying Angel en∣ter, in the Day of his passing through; for the Whirl-wind of his Wrath will be revealed, to fan and sweep away the Wicked, and the Sword of the Lord is bathed in Heaven a∣gainst the Ungodly: And therefore, Friends, Prize your time, prize your time, waiting daily on the Lord God, that so the Nature of Transgression may be wholly taken away in us, for which the Mighty God hath a Controversie with the Nations; for there will be no Hiding-place for any, but the clean in Heart, in the Day (at hand) of the Dreadful Plead∣ings
and Rebukes of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth. And, dear Friends, it is upon me to leave this, as the Counsel of the Lord, upon all the Fa∣milies of the Lord's People through this Nation (as may be concerned) That all Heads of Families, or any that have the Tuition of Youth, that al∣ways in their Families and Schools to feel the daily ari∣sing of God's Immortal Power, in that to Labour (according to their Power) to keep down all Sin and Iniquity in their Fa∣milies, and in that to feel Abi∣lity to reach the Witness of God in their Children, and Ser∣vants, and Families; that so no Sin nor Iniquity may be in the
Families of the Lord's People, but that all be kept sweet and clean, pure and savoury before the Lord, all in his Fear, Dread and Awe, out of all Needless Discourses, Vain Words, Fool∣ish Jestings; but let your Words be few, and they Admi∣nistring Grace to the Hearers; that so, when the People of the World come to your Houses, to have Converse or Commerce with you, all being in the Dread, Fear and Awe of the Lord God, in the Sweet, Sa∣voury, Chast Life, the Witness of God will Arise, and make them acknowledge, you are the People of the Lord, and that he is with you; and here every one in their respective
places will be Preachers of Righteousness, and here, in this pure harmless Life, we must overcome: And this doth the Lord God (in whose Hand is the Breath of all Living) re∣quire of all the Families of his People. And where any do, or shall walk in a contrary Life, the Lord God of Eternal Might and Strength will visit with the Rod of Affliction, &c. And, dear Friends, it is likewise upon me to warn all, in all places, to be careful, that neither you, nor your Families, run into Superfluities in Meats or in Drinks; or in Apparrel (or into the proud offensive Garbs of the World) but in all these things let us all keep in our
first Fear, Dread and Awe, that in none of these things pro∣vision may be made for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof. And dear Friends, it is also up∣on me to warn all, in all places, to beware of trusting, or having a Life in Uncertain Riches, or in any External Thing; and that at all times, and in all places, all keep out of the many and needless Words, both in Dealing, and in all your Con∣verse and Commerce with the World, let your Words be few: For, Friends, there is a great Hurt fustained in a Multitude of Words; for by it is the Mind drawn forth, and the Spirit of the World let in, through which the continued Sence of
the Presence of the Lord is lost, and also, our Testimony wea∣kened against the World there∣in; and also, thereby the Op∣portunity is lost of reaching the Witness of God in the World, on all Occasions of having to do with them. And therefore, dearly be∣loved Friends, I beseech all, in the Bowels of the Love of God, in the Moving of God's Eternal Spirit and Power, that in your Dealings you use but few Words; and be Equal, Just and Upright; and do not be drawn forth in many Words, in an∣swering that Mind that is out of the Dread and Fear of the Lord; but after you have put a Price on your Commodities,
which is Equal, and as you can sell them, then if the Persons you are dealing with, multiply Words, stand you Silent in the Fear, Dread and Awe of God, and this will answer the Wit∣ness of God in them you are dealing with; and if this should not please People at first, yet you will see it will quickly overcome; so that you, in your Dealings therein, keep out of the Spirit of the World, out of all Covetousness, Over∣reaching and Craftiness in the Harmless Life, seeking the Kingdom daily, and let other things come as Additions: So all being Diligent in the pu Fear of the Lord, out of t Love of these Worldly thin
abiding in the Love of God, and seeking the Kingdom that is not of this VVorld; you will see great Opportunity in your Dealings of reaching unto Peo∣ple, and thereby Thousands may be Reached, Convinced, and brought to the Truth. And all, Friends, be watch∣ful over your own Hearts, in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, in the first moving Cause of Marriage, that none that pro∣fess to walk in the Undefiled Way of the Lord may run into the Lusts of the Flesh, and of the Eye (in which Ground stands all the Polluted Marri∣ages of the World) but all to try the very Ground of their Love and Affection, whether
it stands in the Covenant of God, in the clean Life of Righ∣teousness; for although it is the very Truth, that Marri∣age is Honourable, the Bed must be Undefiled, which is a near Word, and Judgeth many Marriages in the VVorld, that are begun, carried on, and fi∣nished out of the Fear and Dread of the Living God, &c. And, Friends, I am moved of the Lord God to warn all, to try the first moving Cause of every ones Desire and Willing∣ness to Marry this or the other Person, and that when it first Springs in their Hearts, when it is in the Bud; for then, if by bringing it to the Light, it be not found approv'd to spring in
the Fear of the Lord, but in the Spirit of this VVorld, it is easie cut off and broken; but if it still continue, and way is gave to it, then it becomes  Mountain, and the perseve∣ring thereon draws the Mind so far out into the Affectionate Part, as that it so vails and darkens the Heart, that the thing seems right in the Con∣sideration, although altogether the working of the destroying Enemy: And here stands the ground of the running out of the Affections of Friends (or such as Profess Truth) to Men and VVomen of the VVorld; which, for want of the keeping the first Motion out, to that Abominable thing, looseth the
Sence of the Truth, so perse∣vereth therein to the ruining their Condition in the Truth, and to the displeasing of the Holy Lord God, and causing his dear Name to be Blas∣phemed, and to the easing and gratifying of the VVorld; of which Practice I warn all in the Fear and Dread, and by the Power and Spirit of the Lord God, to beware; and all such things will be avoided, as heed is taken in the first Thought to any such thing. And let all know, that who∣ever have been, or shall be guil∣ty in this thing; notwithstand∣ing they may be darkened and loose their Sence, yet it is great VVickedness in the sight of the
Holy Lord God, that is in the midst of us; and with all such will the Lord plead; and a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord must all such Drink, and know his Judg∣ments to Bow them down, be∣fore perfect Peace with the Lord they know, and before they can recover their former Splendor in the Truth. And all, dear Friends every where, whose Hearts are en∣gaged in the Concern of God's Truth and People, let the sharp Sword of the Lord be in your Hearts, Hands and Mouths a∣gainst this thing. And, dear Friends, if any see that a single Condition is not best for them, then let all wait
to be guided in the Truth, in the changing their Conditions, and not to run, as the VVorld's People do many times, from Place to Place, and from Person to Person, having their Affecti∣ons residing one while on one Object, and another time on another, and it may be so on too many, which is a wrong thing, and Destruction every way attends it; but all, in the pure Fear of the Lord (that keepeth the Heart clean) pro∣ceed, seeing their way clear and plain in the Sence of Truth, out of all the VVorld's Sleights, and Bargainings, and Folly, that at∣tend the Management of such things. And all Masters and Mistres∣ses,
and Heads of Families, all to stand in their places, in the Exercise of a Pure, Meek Spirit to their Servants and Children; not in the Merciless Spirit of the World, who would require of their Servants more then they have Ability to Perform comfortably; but out of that let all keep, in the Love of God, waiting on him for VVisdom, that every one may know their places. And all Servants to stand in the subject, diligent State, in Meekness: And I warn all Ser∣vants, professing Truth, to keep low in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, out of High-minded∣ness and Pride, and out of all Eye-service, waiting on the
Lord to know your places in all things; and herein you will Adorn the Truth. And also it is upon me, in the Fear, Dread and Counsel of the Lord, to warn all, in all places, of that thing Joseph warned his Brethren, viz. Of falling out by the Way; that there be no way given to the least Appearance of that which would make any Rent, Schism or Division; for every Vessel that shall receive in that Spirit that thirsteth to Envy, that Spirit that hurries into Passions, that Spirit that will Back-bite and VVhisper in Secret, through which Breaches come; the Hand of God Al∣mighty is against every such In∣strument; the Dread of the
Lord of Hosts, as a consuming Fire, will break out against all such Vessels that shall continue in any such Spirit; for the Spi∣rit of Truth its Nature is, to bring forth the very contrary Fruits in all such Vessels where it Lives, and Reigns and Rules; all such their Life is Peace, and such are Peace-makers; such cannot rest, or be contented while there stands any thing betwixt them and a Brother or Sister, if they be concerned therein; such a one, seeing any Iniquity in his Brother or Sister, will, in the tender breaking Bowels of tender Love, go to his Brother or his Sister, and say, My Brother, or My Sister, do not offend or grieve our tender
Father, who hath dealt so tenderly with us: And so in the Heart∣breaking Love he will Labour with his Brother, or with his Sister, and if not received, will let no Prejudice nor Anger arise, nor will not shut out his Brother; but if there will be no reception, there will be a single standing in the Love and Simplicity of Truth; and he, or she that shall not so receive, shuts themselves out. And if there be a Controver∣sie between any, where the Life of Truth is known, if there be but the least slyding, yet the most Innocent will be ready to acknowledge, first, that with the Love of God he may break down, and overcome the Moun∣tain
in his Brother; and this Spirit Ruling, which is the Spi∣rit of the Saviour of the World, no rent, schism or division can Live, or have an existence a∣mong the People of the Lord; against which Spirit, that causes Division, the Hand of the Lord is and Wo from God to all whose Hearts and Spirits do not subject, which seeks Peace, and ghts in no other thing; the Living God requires this of all his People; and if there be the least of the contrary in any Heart, I beseech all such, in the Bowels of Love, that they would presently put it away, and flee from it, as from the Devourer of God's Heritage, lest that Day over-take, where∣in
there would be Gladness were there an Opportunity so to do; so that, dear Friends, all may dwell together in the Uni∣ty of the One Eternal Spirit of Life and Peace, in which to feel their Hearts United; for he, or she that loveth not their Brother, how dwelleth the Love of God in them? And so, as the Apostle well said, Mark them that cause Division, and  of their Divisions keep for ever. And, dear Friends, where-ever any thing of Division or Di∣stance remains in any Heart, I earnestly beseech you, seek speedily an end to it; for God' Controversie is gone out against all things of this Nature, and the VVrath of the Lord is, and
will be revealed against all such things; and therefore, O Israel▪ put away this accursed thing where it is found, and let every Soul desire and press in the Practice thereof, into the Live∣ly State of Brethren, dwelling together in Unity; and here the Blessing of the Life and Vertue of the Endless Fountain of Goodness will flow over all, and here all will be knit toge∣ther as by Joynts and Bands, all holding the Head, and knowing their places in the Body; here one Member will not say to another, I have no need of thee; but all will see need one of ano∣ther; here no stop will be put to the current of Life, but hough all it will run, even
from Vessel to Vessel; in which State God Almighty preserve us all for ever and ever. And all, Friends, every where, quench not the Spirit of the Lord in your selves, nor in one another; nor let any resist or judge the Power of the Lord God, although in a tender Babe, that cannot yet speak plain; for where any do thus hurt the tender Lamps of Christ's Fold, and stop the bublings up of Life, it brings a Barrenness over their own Souls, and over such As∣semblies they belong unto. And so, dear Friends, as there may be, and hath been a false forward Birth, that hath, o may run before, to the bur∣dening and grieving God's H∣ritage
(which Birth the Lord hath, and will destroy) so there hath been a stopping, and quenching, and resisting the Re∣quirings of the Power, to the hurt of many, and to the hin∣dering of the growth of many, and to the hindering the Pros∣perity of Truth in general; for some being in the sight, and under the grief of the false un∣timely Birth in some, have re∣sisted the Motion of God's Holy Spirit in themselves, whereby two Evils have proceeded at once, viz. The Exaltation of the False, and the Suppressing of the True Birth; so as that my Eye seeth some Men, unto whom God hath given Gifts, nd upon whose Spirits the Re∣quiring
of God's Power they felt, and through their Reason∣ings (as aforesaid) and looking out, have even hurt the Birth of God's begetting, to the bring∣ing Deadness and Heaviness over themselves, and to the hin∣dering of their growth; and therefore, as on the one Hand, the false forward Birth is to be kept down for ever, whose end is always something, either to be great, or looked at, or to have Ease or Prosperity in the Flesh; and also, that it may have its way in the Lusts there∣of; for all such Births center in those things, notwithstanding all fair and fine Appearances a Times and Seasons, or for a
Time or Season: So on the other hand, the true Birth is to come up. And therefore in the Name, Strength and Power of the God of Heaven, arise, arise, thou Seed of the Covenant, and come forth and shew thy self, and Work in thy Father's Vine∣yard; break through, ah thou breathing panting Birth, and in thy Father's Strength break every Bond and Chain that hath held thee under: Arise Zion and sine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is isen upon thee. Arise Zion, and thresh the Mountains, and beat the lofty Hills to Dust; for into thy Hand hath, and will the Migh∣ty God, the great Jehovah, put
a sharp threshing Instrument: And so, dear Friends, in this thing let every one be careful, to walk in the even Path of Life Eternal; in which Path every Eye will be single, and the whole Body will be full of Light; here every one will see and know the time when to Speak, and when to be Silent; for the true Birth's Life is in he Will and Power of the Lord, and in his Time and Requirings brings forth; such Sacrifice not to their own Nets, nor will ever seek an Interest of their own amongst any, but Honour God alone, and be as Worms be∣fore the Lord: But it is not so with the false Birth, its Life is not in Meekness, but it is in the
contrary: So here all may know the Motions of the one from the other: Where the true Motion of Life is, there it Lives; the more the Mind is brought into stilness to wait on the Lord, and there the Will of God comes to be Sealed to the Ʋnderstanding. And all, Friends, every where, keep di∣ligent your Meetings; for our Meetings were set up by the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and in his Counsel they now stand; and the Lord re∣quires his People now to meet as boldly, as constantly, as diligent∣ly s ever, without any regard to what Man can do unto you, because we know we meet not in Refractoriness to any Man on Erth, but purely in Obedience to
the living God, that doth require it of his People; and whatever draws from Meetings, in part, or wholly, draws from God, and is an Antichristian Spirit, let it appear when, and where, and in what Vessel soever; and God's Infinite Power and Dread will tread that Spirit down for ever: Therefore, dear Friends, let none forsake the Assembling of themselves toge∣ther, as the manner of some was in the Apostles Days, and also in our Days; and if any do thus for fear, or for saving their E∣states, or worldly Goods, and so fears to come forth to con∣fess the Name of the Lord be∣fore Men, that will prove an evil Snare to as many as go in
to, and keep in it; for this is a way to bring a Curse upon themselves, and all they have; and where any depart from Meetings to save an outward Estate, and do not give up to the Power of the Immortal God, to divide them from that Spirit, the outward (for which they have left the Lord) will be rent from them, or they from it; and then when such a one shall loose that, and his Peace with God also, what a miserable, horrid State will that be▪ which will be the State of ll them that sell their Birth∣ght for a Mess of Pottage. And Friends, this I know, and there∣o in the Name of the Lord, are it, God doth, and will ap∣pear
mightily in the Assemblies of his People, and arise in them in the Magnificency of his Eternal Power, to the Astonishment of the Heathen that know not God, and to the gathering many lost Sheep. And, Friends, these are the ends of our Meetings; to wit, Our daily Edification, through the Manifestation and Workings of his Eternal Power in our Hearts, in our Assemblies, and therein and thereby for God we give a Testimony against all the false Professions, and Gatherings in the whole World, that are n gathered by the Arm of the Lord; and stand as a City set up∣on a Hill, to gather to the Lord the Out-casts of Israel, and the Dispersed of Jacob; and at th
Report of the Holy Ghost descend∣ing in our Assemblies, as in Ages past, shall many gather to them, and be pricked to the Heart, and be turn'd from the Evil of their Ways, and be brought to the Mountain of Gods Holiness, now to be Exalted in, and over the ops of all Mountains. And, Friends, where any have been visited with God's Everlasting Day springing from on High, and have made open Profession and Confession of God's Ever∣lasting Truth, and have erred from the Holy Commandment, through which they have made Spwrack of Faith and of a d Conscience, and thereby e gone into the evil Spirit, o into any Iniquity in their
dealings and commerce with the Sons and Daughters of Men, or into any Evil whaisoever, that have, or do cast a Stum∣bling-block in the way of the Weak, or have caused the dear, and precious, honourable Name of the Lord to Blasphemed a∣mongst the Heathen, his Truth and People to be Reflected up∣on; to all such, I say, in the Name of the Lord, Return unto the Holy Light of Righteousness, from which all such have Erred, there to wait for the arising of the Living Power of the Living God to heal your Backslidings, that e may know the free Love of God to ctme over all again, and to feel a Testimony arise in you against any thing you have committed, th
hath caused his dear Name to be Blasphemed, and his Truth and People to be Reproached, and the Hearts of any to be Hardened; which Testimony you are to bear as publickly as the Thransgression has been, according to the Nature of tha Offence against God, his Truth and People, even so must the Testimony go out against it, in the Fear and Dread of the Lord God, and in the broken∣ness of Heart and Spirit before him: And where the Backsli∣der in Heart and Conversation doth not thus Return, in the Name of the Lord, I declare, That the Day hastens wherein the Hand of the Lord God will find all such out, and they shall be made an Astonishment to themselves,
and to others; for the Living God hath Determined to clear up the Innocence of his Truth and People: And where any such do not return into a Sence of what they have done in their Backslidings from the Lord, and not declare against them∣selves to the clearing of Truth, then it is the Duty of the Peo∣ple of the Lord, who keep their Garments unspotted, af∣ter they have dealt with all such tenderly, according to the Order of the Gospel of Peace, to give a Testimony against all such Persons and Practice, that are out of, and against the Truth; and this Testimo∣ny is to go forth according  the Nature of the Offence,
that the House may be clean∣sed, and all kept pure and sweet, and all may be clear of the Iniquity, and of the Blood of all Men. And so, dear Friends, in the Light of Righteousness let us all keep our Habitations in a continual watchful State, in which we shall all grow, as the Willows by the Water-courses, and be Preserved out of all the Snares and Wiles of the Enemy, in the Light of Righteousness, in which the Arm of the Lord God preserve us all to the end of our Days, that every Day we may perfect Holiness in his Fear, which will be to to the Glory of the Most High God,
and Comfort of every Faithful Follower of the Lord. Given forth in Obedience to the Requirings of the Spirit of the Lord, through him who is a Traveller for Zion's Redemption. C. M.
A Testimony concerning the Precious Unity of the Spirit in Christ Iesus. THe Unity of the Spirit is so precious a Virtue, and glo∣rious a Qualification, in all the Churches of Christ Jesus; that, whilst the People of the Lord did abide therein, in every Age they were in a thriving, flourishing, sweet and glorious Station; for as long as they truly held the Head Christ Jesus, and kept in Unity ith him; Unity and Amity was reserved amongst them in their several Stations and Services, as Members of one Body, &c. Of which Unity, David speak∣eth preciously, and Comprehen∣sively; saying, Behold, how good, and how pleasant it is for Brethren to
dwell together in Ʋnity; it's like the precious Ointment on the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, eve Aaron's Beard, and went down to the Skirts of his Garment; as the Dew of Hrmon, and as the Dew that de∣scended upon the Mountains of Zion, For there (Mark) the Lord Com∣manded the Blessing, even Life everlasting. This was the State the Holy Power of the great God gathered a People into. For, con∣cerning them, it is left upon Re∣cord, They continued daily in Fellow∣ship, and that with one accord. Now, dear Friends, we clearly saw, felt and understood in the pre∣cious Morning of our tender Visi∣tation, that the same ancient Pow∣er of the Lord that wrought Pow∣erfully; first, to disunite us from the Nature which separated us from God, and then to bring us up into Unity and Fellowship with himself,
in his dear Love, and therein one with another. For here (ever was, and is) the Foundation of the true Unity, even tht of the Spirit, in which Love, the Body Edifies it self, and is in∣creasing, and building up a Holy Habitation for God through the Spirit; so then all abiding, and growing up in the Love of God, and walking with him in the divine Nture; Unity encreaseth amongst all the Members, and Branches ta∣ken out of the wild Olive, and planted into (and abiding in) the Vine of Life Christ Jesus, our Head and Law-giver; and here the Church of Christ grew up into a State of being clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet: Ah! Precious, Blessed, Sweet and Glori∣ous Station! But did it always thus continue in the Apostles Days! Ah! No, the old Serpent, the Ene∣my
of Man's Welfare wrought Powerfully and Cunningly, first, to draw forth from the Root of Life, and out of the Holy Love and Spiritual Subjection to this Glori∣ous Power that had gathered them to a daily inward walking with God, and to draw out of a Spiritual Exercise of the Spiritual Cross, and Holy Watch, as before has been demonstrated, &c. And then Fruit from another Root was brought forth, as the Reader may note in several Epistles; and in John's Testimony to the seven Churches of Asia: Then the Power of the Lord that had gathered them, moved to Exhort, to put a∣way Bitterness, Wrath, Anger and Clamour; Evil speakings and Ma∣lice, Eph. 4 And now, dear Friends, with your Lamps trimmed and burning, look inward, searching every corner
of your Hearts, that clear unto your own Understandings every one of your States may appear, as it is in the sight of the pure All seeing God, that so all the Enemies dark∣nings, and vailings, and turnings aside, by what way or means soever. may be clearly with the Light of the Lamb seen and discovered. And, tender Friends, those that have seen the sweet, lovely, preci∣ous State of Unity and Concord, that the excellent Power of the Lord God Almighty gathered into, and was gathering into, in the Bles∣sed Morning of our Day, and the Spiritual Advantages, Comforts, Joy, Refreshments and Divine Satis∣faction that attend the Church of Christ in this true and spiritual Unity, with our Lord Jesus Christ, and one with another; and on the other hand, Head the anxious, ex∣ercising Consequences of the Ene∣mies
prevailing to break Unity, and of the lamentable Effects there∣of, so that all the True hearted and Sincere-Spirited to God, cannot but, on the one Hand, admire, prize, and unexpressibly Esteem the precious Unity: And, on the other Hand, greatly Dread the turnings aside, and going out of it: For those who have kept their Habita∣tion, and Lived to God as they have tasted, and enjoyed the sweet∣ness, and beheld the amiableness of this Unity, and Amity; so they have felt the Sorrow and Anguish of the Effects of the contrary; which have caused them to go many Days, and Months, with bowed down Souls, Crying to the Almigh∣ty God, of tender Compassion, Night and Day, under the unex∣pressible Weight thereof; and the tender God of Love bowed his Ear to the Cry of the Poor, and Sighing
of the Needy, and has arisen in the Might of his Power, and the Ma∣jesty of his Glorious Presence hath Relieved, and his Holy Arm has been made bear, through which he hath Redeemed his Darling from the Dog, and his dear Ones from the Devourer; and still continues working to bring into this precious Unity, in the Holy Light of Life with God in Christ Jesus, and one with another. And now, dear Friends every where, unto You, and to the Generation coming af∣ter, I have this Warning and tender Advice to leave behind me, in the Name of my God, that hath been with me in my Travels, in his Pow∣er, Work and Labour of the Gospel of Life and Salvation. Keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace; and let none give way to a prejudicing Spirit which leads into secret Whisperings, Back-bitings,
and such like Evil, and pernicious Fruits, the Working of which Spi∣rit is like a Moth in a Garment, dividing, destroying, spoyling and eating up; for indeed, as Zion is a City at Unity with it self, under the seamless Garment of Christ Je∣sus, and there all are well and safe, growing, increasing and flourish∣ing; so when the Spirit abovesaid prevails to draw out of Zion's Gates, and from within her Walls of Salvation: Oh! what deplora∣ble Work and Havock will it make in its Growth and Progress; work∣ing, as I said before of the Moth, gradually and secretly first; but as it prevaileth and increaseth in its growth and strength, it will ap∣pear as a roaring, devouring Lyon, seeking whom it may devour and swallow up. Here comes in Pride, and haugh¦tiness of Spirit, puffed up with the
abundance of Injoyment of outward thins, Emulations, Heart risings, evil Jealousies, bitter Speakings, Detractings, and abundance of evil Fruit ariseth from this evil Root of Bitterness, which Root and Fruit is to be brought under, and sunk down under the Eternal Judgment of the Holy, Glorious, sweet Power of the Lord. And therefore, Friends, I say unto you, in the Name of the the Lord God Eternal, let none give strength, or any incourage∣ment or nourishment any way to this Spirit in any of its murthering Workings in any Heart, but let it be looked on as a Vagabond and Fugitive in the Earth; and so as it is kept out of the Camp of God, and from Israel's Dwellings, by the sweet, living, bright Power of the great God of Heaven and Earth, it will perish under Truth, Judgment set up in every Soul, and so the Na∣ture
thereof, as well as its evil ren∣ding and dividing Fruits will be worn out, and destroyed for ever: And then all keeping in the first Love, pure Fear, living Awe, and holy Dread, fearing to offend our God and tender Father, perseve∣ring in an inward keeping the holy Watch, and abiding in Subjection and Obedience to the Spiritual Cross, in staidness of Mind, sound∣ness of Judgment, and clearness in Understanding, you See Compre∣hend and Fathom all the Enemies Devices, Temptations and Snares; and the Lord God beholding you in a stedfast Habitation of Obedience, and spiritual Tenderness before him, his Power will descend won∣derfully in an increasing manner, and his Glory will Shine, his River of Life Flow; yea, the Spring of the great Deep will be broken up, and the Windows of Heave will
be opened, that you may be abun∣dantly filled with Joy and Thanks∣givings, Holy Renown, and Songs of Deliverance, with Spiritual High Praises ascending his Throne, which will be as sweet Incense, and a Sacrifice acceptable to our God. And here you shall spend the residue of your Days in Dominion over both the Snares of the Enemy at∣tending Prosperity and Liberty, Adversity and Persecution; seeing over all things that have their Rise in Mortality and Time; feeling Mortality swallowed up of Life Im∣mortal, and so gathered to the Ge∣neral Assembly, to the Church of the First Born, to the Spirits of just Men made Perfect; yea, to the First and Last, God the Judge of all, to whom be immortal high Praises, and holy Renown, for ever and for evermore. But if the wonderful Blessings, tender Mercies, and fol∣lowing
Loving Kindnesses that the Lord God Almighty every way ex∣tends unto us in this Age, be not duely, reverently and obediently taken notice of; but instead there∣of, any shall forsake, and be un∣mindful of the Lord's tender Mer∣cies, and thereby Imbrace lying Va∣nities, going out of the Spiritual Diligence into a Spiritual Idleness, through which a Spiritual Slumber overtakes, and the Lamp thereby be inwardly Neglected, the Spiritual Watch and Cross slighted, and not duly regarded, but the Earth and Earthly things take up the Exercise of the Mind and Affections: Then, I say, instead of injoyning what is above expressed, Tribulation and Anguish will seize upon all such, and the dreadful Judgment of the Eternal God that Lives for ever and ever, will overtake all such Un∣faithfulness. A Dreadful Cup ye
shall Drink of from the Hand of God, and Distress from the Re∣bukes of the Lord shall Distress you; and you shall be numbered amongst the People of his Indigna∣tion, in his dreadful approaching Day of signal Pleadings with all Flesh that have Corrupted its way before him; and therefore Hear, Fear, and Dread the Holy Name of the Lord; and, whil'st it's called to Day, bow before him, and speedily return unto him, lest your Day pass over, and ye Sleep the Sleep of Eternal Death and Destruction, and be separated for ever from his Refreshing Presence, (in which is Life) and from the Glory of his divine Power. Therefore all, dear Friends, eve∣ry where retire Inwardly, See, Feel and Understand the Counsel of the Lord, which unto you Springs; all retire inward (that are not there)
in great Humility before the Lord, that you may feel the blessed Work, of God Blessedly begun, perfecting your inward Man, growing in the Root of Life; and, as you have professed the Knowledge of a Spiri∣tual Orracle before the Nations, you may approve your selves in the fight of God, following its In∣structions in all things, and go not without it; lean upon the Lord, and cry to him to guide you with his Eye, and lead you by his Arm, and so guide you in the Way Ever∣lasting; and this is his Promise, whil'st you keep with him, he will be with you, never leaving nor for∣saking you, if you do not leave and forsake him, his Presence and glo∣rious Arm of Salvation shall sur∣round you, to the Renown of his Name, and Consolation of his Peo∣ple, Amen, Amen.
POSTSCRIPT. DEar Friends, stand still in the Light of the Lord, that in and with it, you may see your States and inward Conditions, and feel a true Stillness, and inward sweet Silence come over all your Hearts and Minds every where, in which you will all see how you have answered the Lord God of all our tender Mercies, who hath Planted a Vineyard with the choicest Vine in a Fruitful Hill, by his Antient Glorious Arm of Divine Power, in this Age of the World; and also Pruned, Dssed, and plentifully Watered it; therefore I say unto you, in the weighty Dread of the Lord God Almighty, draw near unto him to feel the search∣ings of his divine Power go through all your Hearts, that all may truly See, and spiritually Descern how, when, whre, and in what the Enemy hath,
and doth appear to draw out from th walking with God, in the Divine Ligh of his Glorious Day, and with th Light (you truly waiting and diligently keeping therein) comes to see all Cor∣rupting Evil Thoughts that darkens the Ʋnderstanding, and grieves the Spirit of the Lord; and in the Holy Watch all will be swift to hear the inward Voice of Christ Jesus; but slow to speak so, your Words will be few, and seasoned with the Heavenly Grace: For want of keeping here, in the Ex∣ercise of the precious Cross of our Lord Jesus, many are greatly hurt, and deeply wounded, and do not see it: For, in the Exercise of the Cross, you will not make Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof, in Meats, inks, Apparrel, or fine Superfluou Furnitures for your Houses, &c. But se what is in and of the World, the Lus of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, and Pride of Life, which is not of th
Father, but of the World: And here all will be Preserved out of Fleshly Pas∣sions, Anger, Pride, Vanity, and all the Corrupting things in this World. And so, dear Friends every where, home, home, inward, inward to your Tts, that you may see through all the Snares of the Enemy of your Souls, and grow up in the sweet and heavenly Na∣ture of Christ Jesus, which is meek and lowly, who draws all that hearkens to him, to grow up in his Nature: And, O Friends, prize your time, I beseech you in the Love of Christ Jesus, and watch in his Spirit, and feel his Im∣mortal Ancient Power that will raise you up in the Resurrection of Life, and preserve you out of the Spirit of the World and all its ways: Be diligent in the Work of the Lord, and in his Name keep your Meetings diligently Week Days as well as First Days, and put away every thing that would hurt you, as to your Ʋnity before Treated of
for in this precious sweet Ʋnity of the Spirit, stands the Flourishing Happi∣ness of the Churches of Christ Jesus. And therefore where any thing hath creep'd in that hinders it, in the Name and Power of the Lord God, let it be driven out of his Camp with speed: Whose Heavenly Call is, Come up into the Holy Mountain of the Lord, which is to be Exalted over all Mountains and Hills —Where there is no hurting nor destroying, but all are kept Livingly Walking in their Ranks, holdig their Head, following the Captain of our Salvaion, hearing his Voice, receiving his divine Instru∣ctions, here the Ray of his Immortal Glory shall Shine upon you; and as the Redeemed of the Lord, you shall sound forth the Praises of the most High, and Sing the Song of the Redeemed, which is the earnest Breathing of the Soul of him that is a Traveller for Zion's Pro∣sperity. C. Marshall. FINIS.
