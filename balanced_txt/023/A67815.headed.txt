ENGLANDS SHAME: OR THE UNMASKING OF A Politick Atheist: Being a Full and Faithful Re¦lation of the LIFE and DEATH of the Grand Impostor HUGH PETERS. Wherein is set forth his whole Com∣portment, Policies, and Principles exercised from the ingress, in the Progress, and to the Egress of his Unhappy Life. By WILLIAM YONGE, Dr. Med. LONDON, Printed by Da. Maxwel, for Theodore Sadler, next Door to the Golden Dolphin, over against Exeter House in the Strand, 1663.
TO Her most Excellent Majesty HENRIETTA MARIA, The Mother Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. May it please your Majesty, TO revive the eternized and blessed Memo∣ry of your Royal Hus∣band andour now glori¦fied King, who lies em¦balmed with the me∣rits and blood of his undoubted Saviour
and Redeemer, by such an incompt and unwor∣thy pen as mine is, were cause sufficient to pull down the high displeasure of your Royal Majesty upon my self, and such pre∣sumptuous ones: But I do with all humility, supplicate your Ma∣jesties goodness and vertues, graciously to pardon this sinful
boldness of him who desires onely to imbel∣lish and set forth the unspotted innocence and admired patience of so divine a Martyr as he was; and with faithfulness and cou∣rage (maugre all dangers) to embla∣zen out the shame and malice of his undeser∣ved Enemies: So will my continual and in∣expressible
sufferings for his sake and inte∣rest be sweetned, my losses be repaired, and ny services sufficiently rewarded: they being but so many monu∣ments of duties per∣formed, and eviden∣ces of my incessant de∣sires and studies by al means to explicate my self Your Majesties most humble and obedient servant, W. Yonge.
To the impartial READER. Courteous Reader, SInce the Imprimatur to this Book and the greatest part thereof was composed and printed, I under∣stood of a Pamplet for∣merly published in com∣mendation of this tri∣umphant Enemy over the Church and State, (tam moribus quam doctri∣nâ) magnifying him for his vertues Moral
and Theological. In our small acquaintance, I did observe him so well in these and all o∣ther his actions, that I knew him intus & in cu∣te; therefore do attest, that I ever found him barren therein; onely a form of them he ob∣served, and that very co∣vertly, which I espied thus; he could not pa∣tiently behold the faces of poor Beggars, but would answer their pi∣teous and piercing cryes for almes or relief, with
unbeseeming threats of stocking and whipping them: O admiranda cha∣ritas! He was invective against Drunkards and drunkenness, forgetting the old Proverb, Loripe∣dem rectus derideat, aethiopem albus: to pull out his own moat, before he intermeddle with the beam of his brothers eye: for though he dis∣sembled temperance, he would drink plentiful∣ly of Sack or Strong beer, provided it might be done in private and
gratis; for once I found him tripping in this ver∣tue thus. After he with another of his acquaintance had drank off several Tan∣kards of March Beer, and that at single hand in his own Chamber, a Gen∣tleman coming in to vi∣sit him, he fell out into an unexpected passion, and would have beaten the Gentleman, (though a Justice of the Peace of his own stamp and coy∣ning) had not I interpo∣sed my self, and interce∣ded
between them: Then as one Maudlin∣drunk weeps, cryes, and prays, then calling for the other Tankard, be∣comes reconciled, (and then to bed mother) cry∣ing out the next day, that he did swim in his Bed all that night. I have often prevailed with him to write Letters of favour for distressed peo∣ple, to his selected Friends, Sir Henry Vane, Cromwel, Ireton, Lenthal, Salaway, Harrison, &c. but all proved ineffectu∣al,
for that their secret Compact was onely to receive Letters in a friendly manner, but not to proceed further by them; by which subtil∣ty they be came lodged in the affections and ex∣pectations of most peo∣ple. For his Qualifications in other commendable parts, both Divine and Natural, the ensuing Treatise will sufficient∣ly inform thee; the sum of which, is only his own Relation, and my
Observation of his in∣tricate proceedings, not easily discernable, espe∣cially by those who de∣pended upon his Flatte∣ries, or such as were transported with zeal, that might rather be ac∣counted madness than sound Religion. I have herein been carefull to avoid reports taken upon trust for that fama mendax; and I had read many things of him, of which he was ignorant. I confess, I could have furnished
thee with many Comi∣cal Expressions of his, uttered in publike in the Pulpit, and privately in Civil Societies; but I was importuned only to a sober and faithful Dis∣course of him, thereby as well to satisfie many who out of ignorance and dotage on him, and his delusives, did, and still do admire and dio∣lize his Name and Fame; As also, to vindicate my self in performing my duty to God, my King, Church, and Country;
thereby setting forth Gods Justice, and my own detestation of con∣cealing so execrable a sin and sinner. If it fail thy expectation, know that it was pen∣ned at some few spare hours in a fortnights re∣tirement into the Coun∣try, where I was depri∣ved of all Books, and o∣ther convenient Helps for a work of this Na∣ture. Take therefore in good part what thou li∣kest, and leave the im∣perfections to me, for
they are mine, and I am thine, In all Friendly Offices, WILLIAM YONGE. Wit was his life, then it was fit, Death should succeed th'end∣ing of's Wit.
THE AUTHORS APOLOGIE. I Have in this Task un∣dertaken one that hath overtaken many; Vas ignominiae, a contemptible fellow, a Matchivilian, one that would pretend love, but intend mischief; his chiefest amity, was but dissembled enmity, having words as soft as butter, or oyl, yet the poi∣son of Asps was under his
Tongue; For his Ave did threaten a vae, which I ever warded off by minding So∣lomons Cave, Though he speak favourably, beleeve him not, Prov. 26.25. in seeking to finde him out, I had almost lost my self; as I have lost my means there∣by some years since; and though no man remembreth the afflictions of Joseph,Ao 6 6. or the burden of Ephra∣im, yet in the midst of my unhappy Solitudes, I minde that Divine Cordial; Mens mea ne tristes
Christus tibi cuncta ministrat. Munera quae vitae fune∣ra quaequae levant. To be left remediless, and assigned over as a Spectacle for Derision, or a By-word to all Regicides, would set a stop to true Loyalty, and urge a true Subject rather with Stilpo to set his fin∣ger on his lips, and seal them up to silence, than like At∣las to bring the World a∣bout his ears; a Reprobate to true Allegiance might soon yeeld to Temptations, to co∣ver the most horrid of Trea∣sons;
but the Oath of God, Eccles. 8.2. and those hea∣venly Appeals from the in∣nocent blood of my Martyred King sounding in my ears,1 Pet. 2.13. and commanding me instrumen∣tally to set sorth his unspotted innocence by bringing this his most pernicious Lech to a condign punishment, extirpate an Incendiary, that thirsted for the destruction of the King, Country, Church, and People, and satiate himself with innocent blood, masking all with the Vizard of Re∣ligion. I have often seen those sad
Extasies, and heard those direful expressions uttered by this Regicide, and that frequently upon the appre∣hensions of wrath and shame due for that infernal Conspi∣racy of his, crying out, That he was innocent of spil∣ling the Kings bloud, when there were no discourses which could mind him of his Murther used by me or any present; but forced there∣to by the dreadful dictates of an accusing conscience, he would thus trumpet out his own shame and ruin. S. Ber∣nard saith, Tutâ consci∣entia
praestari possunt, quae propter conscienti∣am praestanda sunt, That may be done with a safe con∣science, that is to be done for conscience sake. Then when the Word of God, the cryes of innocent blood, Loyalty, his Countries ruine, the tears of his Mo∣ther then Church, and a mans own conscience do all unani∣mously awaken him to a ne∣cessitated duty that lies in∣cumbent upon him, nay him alone and none other but he, and to falter in the perfor∣mance of it, were to season
the peace of his conscience with such corrosives as this Impostor had; nay to be his co-heir of hell and hellish fears: Who but a damned Reprobate could resist, or sit down in silence? These impulsive causes gave me encouragement to act what I have acted, and do rest so well satified in what is done, that insteed of growing reluctant, I do cor∣dially joy in this, that provi∣dence should select me to be the Agitator: neither shall it repent me, that I was the first that objected this Trea∣son
to his charge in the Par∣liament, as Judge Terril can testifie. Many hard sentences have passed on me, and I am dai∣ly reproached for it, and branded with names of igno∣minie. To reward good with e∣vil is divellish, the Prophets were so, the Apostles so, nay, our Saviour was so re∣warded: Why then shall I grudge to drink of that cup of which the Son of God, and the sons of God have plenti∣fully drank: It is an honor to me, that I am cloathed with
dishonor, for honouring the memory of my unparallell'd Prince; quitting my Coun∣try of such a fiebrand, and setting an end to the Church∣es sorrows, who laboured to be delivered of such a false Conception and horrid Viper, quasi vi parens, that did eat out her bowels: Neither Ishmaels tongue, Achans Wedge, nor Nebuchad∣nezzars menaces, should sow up my mouth, frightn my spirit, or restrain my conscience from giving Tray∣tors their due benevolence, and to stigmatize them as I
have done this false Prophet; nay, you shall as soon per∣swade old Eleazer to eat swines flesh, limn the water, write on dust, and my five fingers to grow of one length as to make me guilty of con∣cealing Treason against the person, parts or power of that Holy and Anointed of the Lord, my dread Sove∣raign. Let Satan cry, I will de∣ter thee, the world cry, I will forsake thee, and the wicked cry, we will allure thee; I will rest upon this, Hominis invidia, non
nocet ubi Deus amat, Envy cannot injure him that God loves: My Loyalty will crown me, my Magnanimi∣ty will support me, and my conscience, which is mille testes, a thousand witnesses, will satisfie me of well-do∣ing. Sola sufficit pietas Religion is my portion, and I am thereby invited, encou∣raged and supported in yield∣ing both active and passive obedience to that potestas supereminens à Deo or∣dinata, that supreme pow∣er, established or decreed by God alone; My King, my
Country, the Church, and my own conscience, et abs∣que, hac neque mens, neque vires, neque e∣ventus, Neither knowledg will, nor good successe. What honour is it for a man to be a tamous Rebell, a learned Heretick, or an uncharitable Christian? as much as to have the species of a man, without the simi∣litude of God; to be a painted Sepulcher, or Gods foole, Luke 21. Vir∣tus in se lucida, sed in∣ter malos lucidior, Ver∣tue of it selfe is amiable,
but more splendent amongst vicious persons; like a Di∣amond set injet. As Noahs perfection was more and more amiable, by how much more vile the world was: He that will preserve a good Memorial to posterity, must live well: Diu vivere, est bene vivere; To live long, is to live well; that his name and fame may smell like sweet Spices in the braying. For it is commonly true, Qualis vi∣ta, finis ita; as a mans life is, such is his end, as in
this, diliro sene, mo∣pish old man, who had spent his Sixty three years of living so slavishly, as if he delighted as well in his life time, as he did at his death ululare inter Lupos, to howle amongst Wolves. But why do I stir up his ashes? Molliter ossa cubent, Let his bones rest in peace, saith the hea∣then; yet in that heaven hath not thought him wor∣thy of a Funeral, in me∣mory of our small acquam∣tance, I shall set forth his
Life, as a patern of, but not for Rebellion; for that needs none in this our Iland; Proh hominum fidem! O the fidelity of men!
Englands Shame: OR THE UNMASKING OF A Politick ATHEIST IN THE LIFE and DEATH OF HƲGH PETERS BE it that it is an A∣phorism upon Di∣vine Record,Isai. 59.2. The name of the wicked shall rot. Quia indignus est a∣more & favore Dei, being un∣worthy of the love or account of God, yet succeeding Ages have continued a Registry of
the actions of Julian the A∣postate, Judas the Traitor, and Novatus the Heretick; all which if lost, they might again be revived in the storie of this Levite, the son of a Levite, who being but an Ig∣nis fatuus, a vapour, was car∣ried through our Horizon like a moveable Star, either Jupi∣ter or Mars superintendent Orbs; rather Saturn or Mercu∣ry, as the sequel proves, but at the best but a blazing Co∣met which was soon shot, and his light went out like a snuff; Sic redit in nihilum, quod fuit ante nihil; Thus he that was nothing, became worse then nothing; for in Apostacy and wicked policies, he did equalize and imitate Julian, his trea∣son was not unlike that of Ju∣das,
and for his Heresies he far exceeded Novatus; the one being execrable, the other un∣parallell'd, and the last dam∣nable. In his infancy he was by his Father brought up neer Foy, the place of his Birth, in Cornwal; his indulgent Parents had him frequently Catechi∣zed in the Fundamentals of the Protestant Religion, or Church of England, kept him strict to the hearing of Com∣mon Prayers by our Liturgie commanded, both for pub∣like and private duties, and had him bred up in a School of good Narture, where he profited much in Moral Pre∣cepts and Learning, untill he was sent from thence to the University of Cambridge, and
there was admitted into Jesus Colledge. But his former Education not being sanctified, nor the name of Jesus setting a limit to his boundless liberty, to which he was remarkably in∣clined from his Cradle, and was so overswaied by that vi∣tiositas haereditariâ quae neutra∣liter aversi sumus omni bono, & ad omne malum propensi, that hereditary evill whereby we are averse to that which is good, and prone to sin, that neither the Word of God, nor the Works of God could de∣terr him from impiety, till he became altogether indepen∣dent to the will of God, quasi privatus gratia Dei, as ha∣ving lost the favour of God, through affective ignorance,
he precipitates himself to e∣vill practices, making good what had been spoken of him in former Ages by the Devil and his Confederates, That a Chicken should a∣rise out of the West; which should flye over all England, and do much harm to most men. A Chicken! He was a Cockatrice or Basilisk, whose eyes were pestiferous to all men; nay, to himself at the last. There the torrent of an over-weaning conceit of his own Genius, made him addi∣cted to, and guilty of libelling, untill he smarted for it, for his lashes were repaid with lashes; durus sermo, an hard saying, to physick the tail to cure the tongue; that virgula di∣vina,
divine rod, could not reduce him; Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit edorem, Testa diu, — ‐ This Casket of counterfeits, retains the sent of his first seasoning, till at the last his irreluctancy made him more obdurate and irrefragable to the Civil Government of that Collegiate Society; Consuetudo poccandi tollit sensum peccati: custome of sinning takes off the sense of sin; and least he should become exemplary to tender judgments, was ex∣pulsed the University. Now he being delivered o∣ver to a careful life, least his bread be that of sorrow, and his cloathing dishonor and po∣verty,
he having no way left him to subsist by, like an Eng∣lish Gusman, resolves upon in∣genious shifts, for that he ever delighted more in wit than grace, till at last, forgetting his abstraction from an Orthodox Minister (his Father) and the place of his late matriculati∣on, the said Universitie, after his two years residence were thus nigh finished, he as an Exile hastens to London, in assurance to finde therein men of his temper, with whom he might associate and solace himself, and in a short time fitted him for the life of a Stage-player in a common so∣ciety, from whence after vent∣ing his frothy inventions, he had a greater call to a higher promotion; namely, to be the
Jester (or rather a Fool) in Shakespears Company of Play∣ers: Omne simile est appetibi∣le sui similis, every like desires his like: There he so long spor∣ted himself with his own decei∣vings, till at last like an Infidel Jew, he conceived preaching to be but foolishness, and time spent in Gods House to hear his Oacles, was a means to destroy his, and his complices vain re∣creations. And so it proved with him; for in a short time after going on the Lords Day to hear one Doctor Dee preach at S. Faiths Church, that he might have a Subject to sport himself with, instead of finding occasions to deride learning, that learn∣ed Nuntio powerfully pressing to the Conscience the burden
of the Law, and hainousness of sin, like another Felix he was smitten with a horror of Conscience for his guilded sins, which he had so seemingly ex∣tenuated, and thereby he be∣came almost a Convert; Oh then quam foelix Evangeliza∣re, How welcome are the glad tidings of the Gospel? He thus well nigh engulfed in despair, Lex lumen & dictamen est re∣ctae rationis in intellectu, the Law is a light and dictator of right apprehensions in the un∣derstanding: He deserts his companions and imployments, and retiring to his Chamber neer Fleet Conduit in London, continues there between hope and despair for one whole year and more: But that he and others of his conviction might
experimentally finde quod De∣us est pater & fons misericor∣diarum, God is the father and fountain of mercies; nay, God is an inexhaustible treasury of mercies, though Christ be his Cabinet wherein he hath shut up all his Jewels, that there is no sin so foul that mercy cannot hide, nor any degree so desperate, as that God can∣not redeem from it, he gives him a further taste of his good∣ness, and earnest penny of mer∣cy, so that I may say, O ad∣miranda charitas, & chara tranquillitas, quaminvestigamus ex gratuita Dei misericordia; wonderful love and much de∣sired peace, wherewith we are invested out of the free mercy of God; his mercy rejoyceth more in our Salvation than his
Justice doth triumph in our confusion, it being his insepa∣rable property to be found e∣ver giving, forgiving and for∣getting; forgetting injuries of∣fered to the sacred eyes of his glory, forgiving sins, and gi∣ving gifts and graces to fit men for the life of grace, and interest them in the life of glory; his suffering growing occidental, the night of his heaviness thus drawing to an end, the day of his rejoycing began to dawn. A Gentleman living neer Malden in Essex, then a Lodg∣er in the same house, hearing of his distemper, as it well be∣came a Gentleman to foster Learning, and shew remorse, enquires of his parts and edu∣cation, and thereby concludes
him a fit person to be setled in a Free School of 24 l.per annum, then void in that Coun∣ty, and at his disposal. The proffer thereof was no sooner made unto Peters, but he presently and thankfully accepts of it, concluding it a te∣stimony of Gods mercies yet reserved for him; But these proved to be but hypocritical expressions, as most of his acti∣ons were; Simulata sanctitas duplex iniquitas, a counterfeit holiness is a double impiety: For after some applause a∣mongst the Vulgar, and Peters pence were hoarded up, he falls into a Tympanie of pride, and then Ephesian-like, the vain∣glory of the one made him for∣get his God, and the value of the other to muzzle himself in
a heedless neglect of that love he found in his late recovery; so that his lusts over-poising him, and his lucre raising him to a high esteem of his worth∣less worth, he feigns himself a Suitor, or rather a politick Servant to one Mistris Read a Widow woman dwelling neer unto him, (though she was fa∣mous for her excellent endow∣ments, and had made liberal contributions to cherish him in the ebb of his fortune, had children, and an estate of two or three hundred pounds year∣ly) he neglects no opportuni∣ties to ensnare her by captiva∣ting of her to satisfie his burn∣ing desires, and insatiable thir∣stings after her person and e∣state. Many Comical expressions
(in which he was well versed by his former employment in the Playhouse) and enticing glances passing from him at several times, thereby to hint to her his Design, they were received to be but as jocular Discourses, concluding with her self that such a Pedantick Peasant durst not clothe him with so much Impudency as to esteem himself worthy of her Vertues, or prove so besti∣ally ingrateful, as to requite her former charities with an at∣tempt of her dishonour and ruine; thus would she always bury them in a scornful silence, and heedlesly neglect them; untill at the last he one morn∣ing finding her Chamber door open, and she sickly in her bed, he with confidence (or ra∣ther
impudence) entred the Door, and pretended a friend∣ly visit; but sitting on the Bed∣side, did at last cast himself up∣on it and clasped her in his arms; at which a Confederate of his, formerly fitted for the design, was by a private sign summoned into the Chamber, where finding them thus con∣testing, he saluted them with a God give you joy: Then pre∣sently both he and Peters pub∣lish it that they were both bed∣ded together: Her modestie was such, and her reputation like to be traduced in publike; to salve all, she citra voluntatem, against her will, unwittingly condescenced to a clandestine Marriage, though it was far a∣bove his merits, and much be∣neath her vertues: but this
forced love not being reall, or sincere on either part, it brought upon them both that plague of contention which is usually the Harvest of such Marriages: Both being by the clamours of the Countrey for∣ced to live in London, their e∣state is thereby much impove∣rished, and they inclining to necessity: he having within him∣self some gleanings or relishes of a Church Oeconomy, after some overtures of preferment were made unto him, should he take holy Ordes on him? He resolved to dissemble what he ever loved, and lived by, even Schism and Sedition; Schis∣maticus communionem Christia∣num abrumpit, a Schismatick is he that breaks off all Christian community; a conviction and
conversion being pretended, and authentick Certificates framed on his behalf, he had (by the Intercession of fome Friends) an access to Doctor Mountain then Lord Bishop of London, and was by him a∣mongst others ordained Priest and Deacon, he taking the Oath of Allegiance and Supre∣macy, and vowing that votum morale, & religiosa pollicita∣tio eternal Vow, and religious Engagement (in the presence of God and the great Congre∣gation) viz. Canonical obedi∣ence, in rebus licitis & honestis in things lawful and honest, sea∣ling the sincerity of his heart herein by receiving the Sacra∣ment, and thus becomes an Hypocrite upon record, and in mans account; when as all
oathes and vowes should be ta∣ken sano judicio, with a right understanding, as well as libe∣ra voluntate, a freedom of the will, that they prove not to be arbitrary, as it is frequently urged by the Schismaticks of these times. He having thus, like an old dog Fox, gotten into the Vine∣yard to destroy the tender grapes, he bends his studies to become popular, and finds it both pleasing and profitable to be applauded amongst the female sex, not forgetting that the weakest judgements were soonest corrupted, and the womens harts once dissol∣ved, would soon be cast into his mould: They cry him up so loud, that his name doth
eccho over all the City, and his friends grew numerous, in∣somuch that one of the great∣est Parishes, St. Sepulchers, must be assigned for his Sea, to inveigh and act against that Perpetua Ecclesiae Novi Testa∣menti Gubernatio & inspectio, That perpetual Government, and overseeing of the Church of the New Testament, Epis∣copal Government: for there he continued a Lecturer near twenty years; and here of a Protestant turnes Independant dependant, persisting in his Apostacy to his former vow, still adhering to his effeminate Flock, and pleasing the wo∣men especially of that Parish, more especially the Butchers wife, but most especially the
Vinteners wife at the signe of the Goat; so that he could at pleasure command ordinary flesh for his paunch, the Goats flesh for his cat, with the best wine into the bargain. But he being detected, was prosecuted by the one at the Law, and by the other at club Law, till he found it fatally true, That he must needs go whom God leaves, and the di∣vel drives; and so he provides and ships himself for Roterdam: Sic transit Hugo, thus vanisheth Hugh. But this Gadarene having thus brought his hogs to a fair market, and rendred himself scurrilous upon record, as ap∣pears by the Regstry of Lon∣dons Diocess, will not part
with his Dalilahs at so cheap a rate; nay, his Hugonots of England were so bewitched with his confident assertions, That he was enforced only to escape the tyranny of Episco∣pal Government, that they sighed at the loss of such a pre∣cious villain (a precious one indeed, that made no consci∣ence of breaking his oathes, performing his vowes, nor sup∣porting the dignity of his fun∣ction, but makes a shipwrack of all these) though their wives had greater cause to lament their loss of him then their hus∣bands had. So that as he had them at his beek, he must receive from them some tokens of love, which was seen in their liberal
contributions gathered for his voyage; then many prayers must be set up for this Jebu∣site. But observe the issue. Pe∣ters now arriving at his wished Canaan, the Land of Promises, is triumphantly received into the sanctified parlour of Roter∣dam, and there welcomed with kisses of the holy. O quam ju∣cunde & honefle! O how sin∣cerely and honestly! But na∣ture having the predominance in him, far exceding grace, he not able to wash himself of his black spots of lying and whor∣ing, falls to his wonted pra∣ctises; that as he had obtained his Ordination by lying, and belying the holy Ghost, a∣vowing his cll to that functi∣on
to be from heaven, he fol∣lowes his old Trade of lying, for that that trick never failed him, but once at the Old Baily in London, being the day of his Tryal and sentencing to death. The Pastor of that Congre∣gation was at that time one Thomas Bartlet, a Doctor of Physick, and an English man, who lived plentifully by their voluntary contributions, and maintained his wife and diverse children in an handsom equi∣page. This morsel made Peters his teeth water, and having ac∣cording to his old wont, an e∣vil eye upon other mens wel∣fare; to wreath himself into
comes acquainted with this Doctor, Tuta frequensque via est per a∣mici fallere nomen, Tuta frequensque licet, sit via crimen habet. A safe and easie way it is by friendship to deceive. As safe and easie as it is, 'tis knavery by your leave. Thus like a second Janus, having two faces under one hood, a Magus with two tongues in one head, or a Ju∣das, bearing two hearts in one brest: to squeeze Bartlet out, and wind himself in, a scandal must be forged against Bartlet, then will his familiarity prove
Bartlets ruine, for these aiery Spirits are so volitile in their good estimation of all men, that they are as changeable in this, as in maintaining their Moonshine Doctrine; and are as easily induced to believe a lye, as they are seduced to ly∣ing opinions. This Conventicle concludes both these collapsed brethren to have been of pristine ac∣quaintance, and therefore do easily lend an eareto their re∣ports, especially that of him, who could best glaze it over with religious phrases, and present it in that shell of a desire of Godnesse and Holi∣nesse. Thus these Brethren began to grow into competition;
then Hugo a Master of Art in that of lying, impeaches Bart∣let of Bigamy, and impudent∣ly affirmes, That he had a wife in England, as well as that with him. Nay, Hugo, forgetting his own shame and adulteries, to prevent any ob∣structions, whispers it abroad amongst his Gossiping crew, who takes it for an Oracle, as coming from the mouth of a godly, zealous and honest Divine, viz. Religious Mr. Peters. God ha' mercy Par∣son, of all knaves, none like a Priest knave. This Physick wrought so pathetically with these squeezy stomacked Christians, who are apt to surfeit at any other mans failings, that it made
them spew out Bartlet, and Peters as an immaculate man, must be setled in his stead. A blessed Reformation, and no doubt, but many of that Gang might find good content there∣by, as the wise of one Frank∣lin, an English man, keeping a Victualling house in that Ci∣ty did commonly find; for Hugo found no life like to Le∣chery, being it produced him there also, as well as in Smith∣field in London, both meat and money; and in that Lying and Whoredome proved so profita∣ble and pleasing to him, he becomes as devoted to it, as the Hart to the Tamarisk, who will not be beaten from it: nay, the Butcher, the Vintner, nor the Victualler shall beat him
into better manners, for that he was as senceless, as sensual; though Mr. Franklin might have spared some stripes for Country sake, and some for Religion sake) but it seems in that company like Priest like people, pares cum paribus facil∣lime congregantur, equalls do easily agree with their equalls, they are liable to correction, and I wish that those houses were well furnished with such Arras. Thus his Minion after a fur∣feit of his being too chargeable to her box, to preserve the good esteem her Husband had of her, (for Cuckolds are soo∣nest deluded, and most conten∣ted) as also to have some other sport for her monie, she ac∣quaints
her Husband of Peters his frequent attempts made to to beat up her quarters; an which Franklin grew zealous for a Conference with this Pastor, and observing at his next coming that he had his former appetite, entertained him onely with Crabtree sauce, and of that gave him his bel∣ly full. But in fear of worse punish∣ments he falls distracted, and so continued for neer three years; after his recovery he had a Miscellany of judgments following him; for he had the head of a Fox, the heart of a Crocodile, the back of an Ass, the reins of a Goat, and the claws of a Vulture: Of a Fox, subtilly contriving mis∣chief
undiscernable. Of a Cro∣codile, destroying whole Fa∣milies, and then dissembling sorrow for thier ruines. Of an Ass, infatigable in bearing re∣proaches. Of a Goat, sparing no woman in his lust. Of a Vulture, few men escaping his claws. Nay, an Anthropopha∣gos, devouring, shall I say, whole houses, nay Parishes, yea Counties at once: Witness his Monuments in Wales, which shall be spoken of hereafter. This subtil sheep having again appeared amongst his little ones, is reputed to be a scandal or offence to the Lambs, in regard of his backsliding at Franklins: But least the wick∣ed ones should make them al∣so a word of reproach, they'l
clap their ears to their heads, (I had almost said horns) and to set an end to all controver∣sies about him, they raise a stock of 500 l. and Hugo must be intrusted therewith as their Factor for New England, from whence they longingly expect∣ed the product for many years, but it lay in Hucksters hands, and was never accounted for, until the happy farewel, or direful Catastrophe at Charing-Cross: who can without amaze∣ment consider the presumption of this Miscreant, in commit∣ting himself to the mercy of the merciless seas, when after a shipwrack of his conscience, ela∣ta manu; with an high hand, nei∣ther the terrors of death, which might suddenly surprize him
in his sinful resolutions, acted destinato concilio, with an un∣daunted resolution, nor the judgments of God to which he was lyable, could civilize this Propagator, but as an Instru∣ment preserved to ripen his sin, Peccatum perpetrans scien∣ter & volenter, wittingly and willingly filling up the number of his sins; or for a more shame∣full end, he refolves a further Precipice himself into un∣cleanness, earnestly doing and allowing of the erronious cour∣ses of man, though they tend to death, till he becomes ana∣thema maranatha, accursed: After his arrival into New Eng∣land, he like a Dog falls to his old vomit, for having buried his first Wife, marries another,
who by his ill usage proved as mad as himself, and had issue which doth patrisare & matri∣sare, the reason in nature is, par∣tus sequitur ventrem, then as he grew popular, so he grows rampant, untill several Excom∣munications were issued out a∣gainst him for you know what, that had he not been protected by the Presbyterie of that Country, he had received his desert there, and prevented Dun in England, and saved his Daughter the charges of so many crammed Capons, and bottles of Sack wherewith she bottles of Sack wherewith she cherished him in Newgate, after his tryal and condemnation: Now of an Independent he be∣comes a Presbyterian, an aliquid nihil, or a quid non, a some∣thing,
a nothing, and what not? or he would not lose a hair for Religion nor any wise man give him one for his honestie. The Classical Clergy there finding him fittest for their de∣sign, to sti up a Commotion in England they ever delight∣ing to fish in troubled waters, do give him his Mission, with their benediction; where find∣ing a Parliament according to their desires, like another Ma∣sianello, he ansewers their Chorus, and cryes also King and Par∣liament. Thus taking his part from that ill-runed Quire, he roars it up and down the Citie and Country, yet driving at the destruction of King, Parlia∣ment, and People: That as he
was the Patron of Blasphemies, the Patriot of Rebellions, and Mirror of all Apostates and Impostors, so was he the quin∣tessence of cheating; nay, all the wit in London could not espie him until he had jugled their Plate with the Bodkins and Thimbles into Guild Hall, and that he might be more ca∣pable of imployment, and seem less criminal, he utterly disa∣vows his Ordination or Conse∣cration by Bishops, qui jus voca∣tionis habent: who have the right of ordination. Thus hardning his heart, & left to that privatio gratiae assistentes, loss of prevent ing Grace, he was hoodwinked and subjected to that ipsissima excoecatio & induration, that su∣perlative blinenes & hardness
of heart, which rendred him un∣capable of timely repentance; sera poenitentia raro vera, late repentance is seldome sound. That he might not become vagrant from his first underta∣kings, he composes Canons to walk by: The first is, To admire and flatter the Gentry: The second is, To delude and blinde the Commonal∣tie: The third is, To excite and cherish the Souldiery. This is done, by applauding the one, Lying to the other, and Preaching to the rest, tel∣ling them, That they gained Martyrdome, and carried Je∣sus Christ in their Knapsacks; as if knavery rather then con∣science,
Pratling rather then Preaching, and Rebellion ra∣ther then Religion, were most fitting for Gods Oracles. Thus after sometime, Eng∣land whose hills were like Sion, valleys like Eden, was become a Golgotha, a place of skulls, a grave, O quam dira cano. Oh what sad things do I relate. The Sophistry he used to understand his company, and that none might escape him, was first to endeavor to find their conscience in point of Al∣legeance and Church Disciplin, not valuing their tenents in point of Doctrin; for he hove∣red several hereticks of all sorts, tough blasphemous or damnable; nay, his religion
consisted only of bloud and be∣nefit. He would defend opini∣ons contrary to his own fained heresies, till he found them zealous in their assertions; if disliked he would by threats, perswasions, large profers of preements, endevor to alie∣nate their affections, and be∣come his proselytes; nothing therein to be done, more than to confound them in their judgements, and that either speaking in the general (Schis∣matici versantur in universali∣bus, Scsmaticks speak al∣waies in general termes) or new coined phrases, or propo∣sing Gods glory to the end of his design. Were he detected, he would destroy all by railings, deny∣ing
his words, frienly pro∣fessings, mixt with jeerngs and appealing to God to wit∣ness the contrary. Were you once his captive, he spares no mnner of insolen∣cy to subue you, ride you as an asse to your final rune: He minded neither good nor evil as he ought; for all the wiles of men could not engage him to promise any thing, neither would he in familiar conference or serious discourse, speak real∣ly as he thougt with himself; for that he had studied to de∣lude, and would almost con∣found an Oedpus to unfold the riddle of his heart, being matchlesse and boundlesse here∣in, until our meeting at the Old Baily.
He thus armed Cap-à-pe with mischievous resolutions, and horrid principles, resolv∣ing to join himself unto Baal peor, and eat the sacrifices of the dead, sets himself to war; against whom? his God, his King, his Country, his Kind∣red and his Conscience, where Jehu-like, he satiates himself with blood. But to regain the character of a well-affected and zealous Christin, he joines himself un∣to the Scotish interest, marches into Ireland with the Lord Forbish, where he leaves him engaged, and then for England with a packet of lies of his great sfferings for Gods Cause and theirs, which in few years pro∣ved an old cause, yet died in
its infancy, or swathing cloaths. A Comical, scurrilous, ma∣licious, oftentimes blasphemous manner of Preaching and Pray∣ing was frequently and publick∣ly used, thereby to set out his name and zeal, that herds of ig∣norant people might crowd to observe his insolencies, though few can repeat one sound ortho∣dox Sermon of his, save that of his death, which preached good tidings to many people. As some for such actions had no ears, so this Pharisee had many eares: He had one for the Independent, another for the Presbyterian; one for the the Anabaptist, another for the Atheist, but none for the Protestant, were the Image of
God never so well stamped in him; forsooth he was Kingly affected, and I am sure the o∣ther was knavishly. Could you but sympathize with him in d sloyalty, you might easily espy him; for he and his complices tended all to one center, To dest oy the King, the Goernment, and Lawes, and set a Castle in the aire of thei own buiding, un∣der another John of Leyden, or Knipperdolling. To insinuate himself into the favour of this Convention he would (fter he had iscen∣ed the temper of some selected ones) sympathize with them in their dispositions, languages and designes, until by his fawn∣ings and religious phrases, with
remorseful expessions he could deceive them, so as to rckn him amongst he eliiou, and be a Licent at to ride them like Asses. For which cause h bcomes their Post-piest, as wll as their Diinty Jeste at White∣hall, and the Commtee bords: only Mr. Peters is News were recked for authentick, and re∣gistred as Oracles, witnesse the many Fiftie punds given him for this postae, wich made him often aver, That he had rather be supplanng in ld England, then planting in New England. The sword brandishing a∣broad, and the ntion begin∣ning to smoak, its time for Hu∣go to blow the fire, that he
might warm himself with the spoils of the Land; none so perswasive to engage in wars and blood as he; yet he was al∣ways sick at the time of fight∣ing, for that cowardise is the fruit of a sad Conscience and a bad cause. Nay, he valiantly deserted Essex, at his being im∣paled in Cornwal, and told his Masters at Westminster a ramp∣ing lye, and that gratis, That the Kings Forces were a terror to themselves. Two Obstacles were grie∣vous unto him, The Book of Common-Prayer, and Bishops; for he would often quarrel at these without a cause, unless for that one maintained Order, and the other had questioned him for disorder; Divide & impe∣ra.
Divide and rule, was his Go∣spel Rule untill he had brought all into confusion; he could not set up his Babel, having sowed the Darnel of liberty, by him∣self, and other his penny Go∣spellers, that his tongue might go throughout the earth, Psal. 73 9 He moves it to the Par∣liament, that he might be their Mercury into Holland, for as∣sistance and counsel to under∣prop their grand Design; their President was his precept, ma∣la locutio inficit animas, evill words corrupt good manners: Now of their merry Knave, he is their private Councellor, and to this end is dispatcht a∣way with much privacy; he desiring the contentment of men, rather then God, of na∣ture,
rather then grace; having cloathe himself with cruelty as wth a gament, like another Mephistophilus returns with this Maumetan reply; That it would be good for them to seize the King, bring him to Justie, set him to death, and settle a Common-wealth a∣mongst them here in Eng∣land, expecting to run through many difficulties as they had done. This spark of Fire kindled prs ntly amongst the lig ter Tnder, and a consideration must be voted to eay the chage of this Hobson, who che∣rishe their earts y his mes∣sage, for it proved we come ti∣dings to many peple, especially the 14 Tanners in Olivers ittle
sucking Parliament that dyed in the birth: For that pur∣pose 300 l. per annum out of the Lord of Worcesters Lands, in the Woulds of Worcester-shire, is appointed to be the lot of his inheritance; Mala par∣ta malè dilabuntur bona, ill got∣ten goods are ill spent; discoun∣ting the 8000 pair of Holland sheets which he zealously preaced for in Holland, to make shuts for their Army of precious ones, and Saints in England, with the Butter, Shirts, Shooes, and Bacon, which he had cheated about Bristol, to a considerable va∣lue: dulcis odor lucri, O how ac∣ceptabe is gai! He love Dia∣na as wel as a fair Nymh, and to shew he is aliquis in omnibus,
something in all, he is in∣comparatively a Sycophant to the prevailing part of the Armie, of which Sect soever, though firm to none, nothing coming amiss save onely his wives Nurse for aliment Mo∣nies to support her in the Bed∣lam he built for her neer Mar∣row-bone Park. Should any shadow of peace appear, he had his inferiour order of Angels, Love, Dell, Marshal, Market∣man, who by prating, preach∣ing and rayling should obstruct it, and that shall be backed by him with false scandals, treaso∣nable surmises against King, Queen, and Princes; Religi∣on must be made a Nose of Wax, sound Doctrine held for Popery, and all Order termed
as Antichristian; when we know that Order is the good of every creature; nay, there is an Order in Hell, for Beel∣zebub is called the Prince of Devils; so that they are worse then Devils that will have no Prince; Such was this Trai∣tor, who gloried in the Pallace-Yard, during the Usurpation of the Committee of Safety; saying, Can we but keep up our Armie, the line of the Stuarts shall never rule here more, nei∣ther shall we need to fear yong C. S. or any King to rule over us. Nay, to extenuate his guilt in the judgement of the sordid Vulgar, he asperses the King and Royal Progenie, and bedirt their transcendent honour, by raising such rumors
of them as no modest tongue dares utter, nor loyal heart be∣lieve. Parentum mores non sunt arguendi, we are not to dis∣pute the conditions of our pa∣rents. The Princely Issue must be designed for Apprentiships, and to be fed like children. Nay, his advice to his Con∣federates was to work their imprisonment, and then he con∣ceits that he by his preaching could animate the Armie to prepare slaughter for the Kings children; witness his Invective at S. Margarets in Westmin∣ster. But Essex his Honour be∣ing laid in the dust, and Fair∣fax (as he conceits) remaining the next man to the Crown,
though God had preserved the Royal seed for his own gar∣den, he becomes his Achito∣phel, then lists himself Chap∣lain in pay to six Regiments, which he continued for several years: Harrison and the rest of the Collonels being his Surro∣gates or Officials, whilest he officiated as their Vicar Gene∣ral. This Scene drawing towards an end, the Trumpets sound in Oliver the Actor, Ireton the Scribe, Harrison the Prolecu∣tor, Cradock the Fool, Vavasor Powel the Post-priest, Desbo∣row the Clown, Jones the Sy∣cophant, Pride the Devil, Whaley the Turkie Merchant, and Peters the Pander. When after some pause in
the government, Oliver like cauda Draconis, the Dragons tail, arising in our Horizon with stinking vapours which did corrupt the spirits of many; for qualis aer, talis spiritus, as is the air, such is the temper of the spirit; looks smiling on this pimp Peters, who had pimped for him many years, avowing him to be asecond Moses, & one walk∣ing as close to God as ever Joshua did: Nay, Oliver observing his temper to be unchangeable, and that he continued religiously villanous, popular, active, impu∣dent, and an abyss of Trea∣sons, doth sympathize with him, till at last they become to be both of one heart, one soul, one minde, and one voice; onely whilst Monies are to be
disbursed for Medalls for the Officers of the Army (as Prog∣nosticks, or Favourers of Fair∣fax his dying power) he sol∣licites to be principal in the disbursment, and thereby gains opinion of the Officers, and neer 1500 l. for himself: For as he spared no Woman in his lust, (witness the Bastard he had by his Neece at Master Ba∣kers House in the Strand) so he being as mercenary, as mischie∣vous, served no man without a considerable gain, though he was reall to none but himself, yet failed in that at last. Fairfax now becomming a dry Nurse, Peters is adopted a Foster child to Oliver, whose soul thirsted for the same blood ever since his eldest Son was
hanged at Tyborn for mur∣ther. The King discomfited and his Host all dispersed, and he taking the Scotish Army for an Asylum; this High Priest endoctrinates that Samaritan Fairfax, to buy the King at a price from that Judas, Lesley; which sounded well in the Commons House, and then the bargain was strucken, and the purchasers engaging to make him a glorious King. And so they did, for he died a Martyr, signing the truth of his De∣claration for the Protestant Religion with a full effusion of is Royal blood, purchasing his Subjects liberty by his of∣ten imprisonments; and vin∣dicating the rites and privi∣ledges
of his free Parliaments according to the fundamental Laws of this Nation; he pa∣tiently and piously undergoing the stroke of death: thereby attesting in facie coeli, before the eye of Heave, to the glory of God, his Subjects honour, and his enemies ter∣rour, that as he loved his Sub∣jects, so he died for their sakes. But though the Parliament pay the monies, the Soldiers keep possession, and conduct him to Merods-Hall, Holmby-House where Peters like a High Priest of these Jewes must con∣fer with him to find what evil he had in him; and though he found him fraught with honour and conscience, yet his Isma∣elitish
tongue must bedirt him; for that he had not the art of speaking truth, being so long conversant in that of lying and traducing, and therefore reports the King to be neither for worth or education worthy the office of a Justice of peace; though Heaven and earth could give him the lye for his pains: Nay his fellow traytor Marshall did so admire his wis∣dom at the conference in Cares∣brook Castle, that he did open∣ly declare, he spake beyond all men that ever he heard speak, both for learning politick, di∣vine, and moral. See the dangers and conse∣quences of Rebellion: when the Subject shall insult over Gods anointed, then ribaldry
shall be accounted government: and God must with long suffer∣ing bear their insolence, which hath neither bound for time, person, nor rule, nor religion, wisdom, or justice in it. How∣ever maugre all former Oathes, Protestations, Declarations and Covenants set up in Churches, to witness their intentions of Kingly government, and yield∣ing obedience to the lawes of the land, as if they were in∣tended to outface God, or make a mock of him; the Jew∣ish part of the Army are prompted by Oliver and Peters to steal away the King from those that were but initiating Pharisees, and tottering in judgment and Loyalty, though some were instigated to destroy
him privately. Ponit home, disponit Deus; Though Haman man insult over Mordecai, that intercedes for his people, yet may he be hanged for his labo: Caveto. Though rebellion make a man happy for a season, it ends in infamy. Oliver, Ireton, Peters, &c. were famous rogues; yet lie and die disgracefully: Sic pereat Barrabas, so let thine enemies perish O God. The riot committed against the Kings person, andhe pri∣vately hurried away by this giddy-headed multitude of re∣bellious Saints; the Parlia∣ment claims an interest in him, being theirs by a right of pur∣chase: and finding Oliver and Peters the grand and prime ug∣gestors of this unparallel'd con∣spiracy
intended to arrest and attaint them; but the knavish part of the House giving no∣tice thereof, like a Gemini of Traytors, they prepare them∣selves for an escape to Cam∣bridg, but the weather proving hot, after hard riding, they halted about Ware in Middle∣sex, and entred into Counsel how to settle the Nation in peace; and in fine concluded that there was no way left for this, but to take the King and bring him to Justice, try him for his life, and cut off his head. Hinc illae lachrymae! To this the whineing Saint Harrison, and the rest of the quodled or perboyled Christi∣ans the Anabaptists say, Amen. Then must his sacred person
be transplanted from place to place, from Holmby to Sion-house, where Peters and Dell conspire to pistol the King pri∣vately, but were detected; and by their impudent denying it, were enlarged thence to Wind∣sor Castle; where he by his piety and patience, did so ag∣grevate the malice of his ene∣mies, Oliver, Ireton and Peters; that they held several private consultations at Mr. Starkyes house in Windsor, and Colman∣street in London at a private house; there to contrive an act their treasonable murther; the resolve past he must be conveyed from thence to Hampton-Court, Harrison riding with him and upbraiding him to his face; but Peters ri∣ding
before him out of the Ca∣stle, cried, Weell whisk him, weel whisk him, now we have him: A patern of loyalty, one formerly a Captain for the Kings interest seizing Peters his bridle, said, Good Mr. Peters, what will you do with the King? I hope you will do his person no harm; that Peters might be Peters, he replyed, He shall die the death of a Traytor, were there never a man in England but he. But if the innocent must suffer, I pray you what would have be∣come of Peters then, who was so ore, opere & corde? The Captain forced to loose his hold of the reins by a blow given him over his hand with Peters his Staff; this trumpeter of sorrow rides on
singing his sad note, Weel whisk him I warrant you now we have him. From Hampton-Court he is deluded to pass the River, upon assurance of a Guard to rescue him; but thence he was vio∣lently carried to Carisbrook-Castle in the Isle of Wight, where many overtures of peace were there proposed unto him, but mischief or murder was the end of it: for their envy grow∣ing to a full ripeness, nothing remains unattempted to shew the r contempt of him. There Martial must discourse with him, and all proved but a quible; Scientia nullum habet inimicum praeter ignorantem, Learning is envied of none but the sordid ignorant. Yea, a
Private Soldier is by Peters a∣nimated to seize the Kings breeches which lay on him in his bed, and to take thence a book out of his pocket, where∣in was a List of his best and loyalest friends in England: this was done notwithstanding the King held it fast and ear∣nestly importuned the Souldier to forbear prosecuting his wick∣ed Treason; but he persisted to contend with the King until he had recovered it, not daring to offend Mr. Peters, who af∣terward had him rewarded with an Officers place in the Army; for the worst Traytor was the best subject; the veriest fiend their truest friend; and to be at enmity with the King, was to be at peace with them.
The head thus perplext and in imminent danger, because Peters sollicited to expedite his tryal, the body could do no less than sympathize with him in sorrow; and though the just and legal government of this Nation seemed to be in a dying condition, the members there∣of give one groane more for their redemption, and by as∣suming armes to rescue their natural Prince from this u∣surped power, or redeem him from the jawes of these Lyons, by taking armes they set a stand to their bloudy de∣sign, untill by a fatal blow they were enforced to silence, and to repine at his, and their un∣parallel'd subjction; the na∣tion thus shewing they had
some lise of loyalty yet lest; Peters prepares for an escape to the Western Islands; but a calm appearing he shrouds himself under his old Bramble, Oliver, to potect him, and down he goes with him to Wales, where he left another Monument of his cruelty; for there one Lieutenant Bartlet, the onely surviving Son of Doctor Bartlet before men io∣ned, being Lieutenant to Co∣lonel Powels Companie of Foot, and taken Prisoner at that unbappy overthrow of the Welshmen at S. Fagans in Glamorganshire, made his Address to Peters, presumng that he might receive civilities from him out of their former acquaintance at Rotterdam; and
there as a pious and penitent Christian, makes Peters his confessor, and gives him the account of his life spent, desi∣ring Mr. Peters to pray with him to his God, and to inter∣cede to Oliver for his life, which Hugo promised to do; but re∣turning to Oliver, told him, he had left the yong man in a good condition, for he had re∣conciled his soul to God, and therefore it would be accepta∣ble and well-pleasing to send him to the Lord now that he was ready for him; then forth∣with he was shot to death. Thus did he also with Duke Hamilton who rendred himself a Prisoner unto Peters, and as∣signed him all his Jewels, &c. upon condition of life, which
promised, and the goods pos∣sessed, he delivered him over to the Martial power to be put to death, and sollicited for it. This storm ended, on they go victoriously, encouraging themselves in their bloody re∣solutions, and hasten the King for Whitehall: Onely this by the way; the Souldiers were se∣cretly admonished by Letters from Peters to exercise his ad∣mired patience, by upbraiding him to his face, and so it was; for having gotten him on board of their Boat to trans∣port him, they would not afford him a Cushion to sit upon; nay, scarcely the company of his own Spaniel, but scoffed at him most vilely, as if to blaspheme
the King, were not to blas∣pheme God, who had establish∣ed him to be his Vicegerent, our supream Moderator, and a faithful custos duarum tabu∣larum legum, keeper o both Tables of the Law. He being safely arrived at Whitehal, that they might the easier reach the Crown, they do with pius pretences, secon∣ded with fears of declining, hoodwink their General Fair∣fax to condescend to this bloodie Sacrifice; whereas O∣liver and Ireton, would appear only to be his Admirers and Spectators of the Regicide, by standing in a window at White∣hall, within view of the Scaf∣fold and the People; whilest Peters fearing a Tumult, dis∣sembles
himself sick at Saint Jameses, conceiting that he might thereby plead not guil∣ty, though no man was more forward then he to encourage Col. Axtel in this action, and to animate his Regiment to cry for Justice against the Traitor, (for so he mostly called the King) yea, with what triumphing in∣solence did he settle the chair of Fate for the King to sit in at his ryal before the Court of High Injustice, thereby to satiate his thirstings after the innocent blood of him who like a Lamb yeelded to the slaughter. This Tragedy ended, Fair∣fax must be cheated of his Command, and Oliver, volen∣ter, nolenter, enforced to accept
of the Triple Crown and Go∣vernment of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Religion, Law, Militia, Parliament, Priests, and People: Thus Exit Fair∣fax; and enter Oliver with Pe∣ters his pimping Priest, who had prophesied unto him those things, and therefore is reward∣ed by becoming Clerk to his Cabinet Councils or Cabals; Nay, this notorious Publican cannot ask beyond his merit, though it be the final uine of that Church to which he stood sworn in his Ordination, or of a Judge in the Prerogative Cout, to be a Licenser, or stand impowed irresistibly to beat down all sound Doctrine, Discipline and Order, and in∣troduce all Heresies, Schisms,
and carnal villanies into this National Church. That as he had enraged them to excise the head, so he might encourage them to per∣plex the members; and to this end strikes at the soul of the Church (the Clergy) for that there was no more plunder left in England, and his bag not full, and his desires that were insatiable as Hell, never crying enough, but a quid da∣bitis, he resolves to live by Sacriledg, and for his assi∣stant calls to him Harrison that undiscernable propagator of the Nigrum Evangelii, the black Gospel: so that Oliver now contents himself with being their Solliciter; thus under∣taking a spiritual warfarel, he
from a Protestnt to an Inde∣pendant, and thence to a Presbyterian, lastly falls into apostacy; conceiving with Ju∣lian the best way to extinguish Religion, was to extirpate the Clergy, and that by sequestring their Tythes and profits, si∣lencing and imprisoning them, and so bring all into an inevi∣table ignorance, and then to sow amongst them the darnel of heresie and schism as they had formerly sown the tares of sedition, of which much re∣mains yet unweeded out a∣mongst us; proh dolor! But that they might exceed all Rebbels of former and fu∣tue ages, to fill up their vio∣lence and cup with blood, they satiate themselves with the
blood of the English, Irish, and at Droghedah and Waxford, drink a deadly draught, leaving there such monuments of cru∣elty, that succeeding ages will be hardly induced to believe that men should become so wolvish, as they were in those actions. For at Droghedah they in∣humanely massacred both men, women and children, three dayes after the seisure of the Town, though they were one∣ly innnocents that had secured themselves in the Gatehouse or Steeples, meerly to preserve them from the unmercifull u∣sage of Souldiers, frequently practised uon all storms of Cities or Forts, and heat of blood; conceiving that Eng∣lish
men would not forget the ancient honour of being mer∣cifull, which for many years hath attended that heroick Na∣tion; but being led by one who was insatiably thirsty for blood, and they, these specta∣cles of pity, enforced by fa∣mine to appear in the streets even in a peaceable manner; all relations for Countreys sake, Religion and Honour, was laid aside, and these famish∣ed Protestants were massacred in the Streets, their Childrens brains beaten out before the Parents faces, and then them∣selves enforced to undergo that cruelty. Nay at Waxford having been thus entred into a merci∣less cruelty, they do expedite
their tyranny there; for ha∣ving entred the town, they drove both men, women and children into the River, whose dead bodies lay so in heaps therein, that it did in a great measure stop the course of the River, and a passage might ea∣sily be made from the Key to the otherside of the River, the dead lay so numerous intomb∣ed in that River, as it was vauntingly related unto me by this Peters himself, several o∣thers of credit partaking of the History. But Peters becoming rich with the plunder at Waxford, and affrighted with guilt, pro∣cures a command from Oliver, and is commissionated a Colo∣nel; he undertaking to raise a
Regiment of foot, which must be sold over to their assistance in Ireland; and thus clothed with mischief, he comes for Mil∣ford Haven in Wales, sick, as in mind, so in body; but that was speedily cured, the other never. For being sickly, he was by one Captain Brandy quartered at my house: 1. For that I was the only Physician known to him to reside in that Coun∣ty. 2. For the continguity of my house, it being neer the River: and thus we first be∣came acquainted. After his cure was finished, he remained there with his servants and hor∣ses for ten weeks, all upon free quarter; during which time, I had so endeered my self unto
him, that I could unlock the closet of his heart at pleasure, and by that means became so far his Confessor, that he did three several times some weeks distant, very soberly acknow∣ledg to me the manner of con∣triving his late Majesties death, with many other sad relations of their wicked proceedings a∣gainst him: nay he was so far from concealing this treasona∣ble conspiracy, that he would relate it me whensoever I did ask it of him; which made me tremble at the old Bayly to hear him in facie curiae, in open Court, and in the presence of the Almighty to deny it, onely slubbering over his sin, saying such expressions might fall from him in his infirmity; whether
he meant his fits of madness, or fits of a troubled conscience, I know not; but do believe, and that upon good grounds, it was rather in those of his conscience, than the former. After his raising three com∣panies and transporting them over to sale, he begins to ob∣serve the temper of that peo∣ple; and finding many of them, especially the Gentry, through cowardice and want of sound principling in Religion, much inclining to a temporising, and the Clergy divided amongst themselves, though they were privately admonished then, of the imminent danger which was indeed against them; he there grew insolent, taking advan∣tage of their division; he calls
to his assistance one Samson Lort of that County Esquire, who was in his actions a se∣cond Pontius Pilate, delighting in cruelty, and cloaking all with a pretence of love, religion and innocence. This Second of his, so tym∣panizing with pride, that he was imployed by so great a Favorite as Peters, was prom∣pted by him, and would regard no Law, but act according to what he thought acceptable to Peters; witness his Warrants issued out to search for and at∣tach the body of Charles Stuart, (for so he called his Majesty that now is) and to bring him before him to be dealth with ac∣cording to Justice; and his Motto in his Colours, No King,
no Lords, we are engaged. But Olivers wife drawing Articles against Peters, and in∣tending to exhibit them, for his long stay in that Coun∣try, and leving her Husband in danger in Ireland: Peters up∣on notice given, doth with the assistance of his fellow Tyrant Lorte, contrive a way to settle a Congregational Church of their own invention, and that it might spread further there, calls into them one Philip Jones of Swansey, that called himself Collonel Jones; quo warranto, I have heard. A Letter from this Jones was directed to Peters, desiring him, in his own, and Cradocks Name to leave his advice how to drive on that great design
of propagating the Gospel in Wales. To which Peters replyed, They must Sequester all Mi∣nisters without acception, and bring the Revenues of the Church into one publike Trea∣sury, out of which must be allowed one hundred a year to six Itinerant Ministers to be selected to preach in every County: What with the fear of his being questioned, and of the Plague then increasing in that County: as also having engaged these two Sticklers to drive on their Antichristi∣anism, fitted himself with a pious Plea for his delay; Viz. To settle Religion there: He hastens to London; yet could not bauk Bristol, but must visit and strengthen the Saints
there, telling them out of the Pulpit, that he had been a∣mongst the Heathen Welsh∣men, and found them fit for nothing, but to make Clap∣pers for wooden Bells (mean∣ing the Gallows) then tells them a Storie of Puss in her Majestie, and so leaves them. Oliver arrived at London; he sollicites for impowring his two Trustees, Lort and Jones, with many others of the same Feather, and that by an Ordi∣nance of Parliament, to drive on their miraculous propaga∣tion of the Gospel, who like two Champions insultingly strive to out-vie one another; Aspe∣rius nihil est misero si surgit in altum, Set a Peasant on Horse∣back, and he will ride to, &c. bringing their poor Country∣men
to that low Ebb, that many could be satisfied with a morsel of Tithe Cheese. And thus must Wales drink off the cup of her confusion, though it was sugared with zealous pretences, and poyson∣ed with Heresies and Schisms; she must be rendred as Hea∣thenish, and these called Pro∣pagators of the Gosple; but to drive on the Trade of Tythe gathering, they set good bar∣gains to their Adherents, and hire Beggars with such like, to observe the actions of the Cler∣gie, allowing some eighteen pence a day for their good ser∣vice, and all to be deducted out of the Revenues of the Church; the Ministers almost extirpated, and scarce a Ser∣mon heard in sixty miles; Je∣roboam
like, thinking the worst of people good enough for the Lords service, they fill the vacancies with Cooks, Ranters, Taylors, Weavers, Shoomakers, Feltmakers, Stocking menders, Millers, Gingerbread-makers, Collar∣makers, Carpenters, and Chees∣vatmakers; onely one Acade∣mick, whose Name was Ste∣phen Young, for that he bare a Partisan to guard the Scaf∣fold, at the Martyrizing of our gracious King, and was an adopted Son to Peters, always calling him Father. These must be content with such pittances as are allowed them by the propagators, ra∣ther playing at small game than sit out; and their Tenants or Sycophants become Farmers,
though some of the propaga∣tos lick their fingers, and car∣ry away the sweetness of the profirt, raising their poor for∣tunes thereby unto a conside∣rable value, whilest Harrison, Peters, Craddock, and Vavasor Powell have the greater share of the booty: of this enough; Here only I refer you for a full relation to a book entituled Mercurius Cambo-Britannus. This inundation had passed o∣ver England also, had not Co∣lonel Freeman, my self and Mr. Gunter set a stand to their renewing of this Ordinance, to bring it universal throughout the Kingdom: and no man more sollicitous against us, and for this sacriledg, than Oliver, Harrison and Peters; nay, Peters excelling them all, a∣vowing
before the Commitee for plundering Ministers, that the Clergy were not worthy to keep a kennel of Dogs, or a dozen of Sheep. And thus did he rule the roast amongst that rabble of Heresies, until Tumbledown Dick accepted of the Govern∣ment, when perceiving God to smile upon this Nation with symptoms of his love; Peters fained himself mad at Whitehall, and there professeth himself to be Antichrist, and saith that he must shortly be destroyed; and so it fell out; for after I had exhibited the charge of High Treason against him, for con∣spiring the death of our Mar∣tyred King, he was taken in St. Thomas in Southwark in bed with a woman newly delivered
of a child, and wife to the Black∣smith who deserted him; and though he called himself Thompson, he was brought to the Tower, and thence to New∣gate; and though he had pub∣lished a Pamphlet to vindicate his innocency, and in it calling the holy Majesty of God to witness, that he had neither head nor hand in acting or con∣triving the Kings death, he was by the testimony of a cloud of witnesses, found guilty, and condemned, and the Tuesday following executed at Charing∣cross. But to shew his end was as desperate as his life was abomi∣nable; when several Ministers came to comfort him in New∣gate, some hours before his death, and exhorting him to
lay hold upon Gospel Promises made to repentance: he re∣plied, What have I to do with them, seeing I am guilty of the blood of my King? Then hear∣ing the Bell ring, cried out, Away away to Judgment, for the Trumpet sounds, and so goes down the stairs, thence to the Gibbet, where he behaved himself more impenitent, not being able to pray, though in∣treated to it, he dying sullen∣ly and desperately: that as was his Life, such was his End. Oh quam dulce mori, quum mors sit sola malorum Terminus, & vitae fons & origo novae! FINIS.
