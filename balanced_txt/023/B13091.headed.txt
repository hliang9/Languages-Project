THe Kings Most Excellent Maiestie, taking into consideration the great destruction made of Fish, by a Net or Engine, now called a Trawle, and finding that notwithstanding former Proclamations pro∣hibiting the vse of that Net, Diuers Fisher-men do still vse the same, whereby not onely small and vnsized Fish, but euen the Fry, and Spawne, are vtterly destroyed. And His Maiestie hauing also found, that notwithstanding many Statutes haue beene made for the preser∣uation of the said Spawne and Fry: Yet neuerthelesse, by the destructi∣on thereof, there hath beene of late yeares a greater scarcitie of Fish then in former times; So that His Maiesties Houshold and the Markets are not supplied therewith as they were wont to be, and the whole kind of some Fish, formerly taken vpon the coasts of this Realme in great plenty, are in most places therof now wholly destroyed, being chiefly occasioned by fishing wth the said Trawle, which being laid forth at the Sterne of the Boat or Vessell, and extended to a great breadth by a Pole at the bottome & forepart of the Net (like an Oister Dredge) is drawne so neare the ground by a roape with Sinkers vnder it, as thereby the smallest Fish are moued, and the Boat being vndersaile is drawne with that strength or swiftnesse, that the Meshes being contracted, it taketh them, and moueth also the Slyme and Spawne vpon the ground; For which cause his Maiestie by Proclamation hauing heretofore inhibited the vse of the said Trawle in some cases; But finding that it hath not wrought the reformation that was desired, and that the decay of fish vpon these coasts is likely to be continued, if any vse at all of those Nets shall be permitted: His Maiestie therefore (whose chiefest care is, the welfare and good of His people) to preuent these inconueniences for the future, by the vtter and totall abolishing of the vse of the said Net; Yet willing to giue the Fishermen some reasonable time of prouiding them other fit instruments for Fishing, doth (by the aduice of his Priuy Councill) hereby signifie and declare his Royall Will and Commandement to be, That after the first day of May now next comming, to Fisherman, or other person or per∣sons whatsoeuer, shall vse the said Net, called a Trawle in his or their Fishings, Nor any other like Engine or Instrument whatsoeuer now made or deuised, or hereafter to be made or
deuised in imitation or resemblance thereof. And that all such persons as betweene this and the said first day of May next shall be permitted to Fish with the said Trawle, shall passe their Boats, or Vessels, whilest they so Fish in the Chanels and Deeps onely, and not in the Sholes and Flats, and that none of them so Fish with their Boats, or Vessels vnder Sayle, but by being moued onely with the Set of the Tyde, and that the Mesh of their Nets be according to the Lawes and Customes of this Our Realme in that behalfe; vpon paine (for the first offence) of the confiscation and losse of such their Nets, and the Boats and Vessels wherein they shall so Fish; And for their second offence to be further punished by Fine and Imprisonment in His Maiesties High Court of Starre-Chamber, or other His Courts of Iustice, for their con∣tempt or neglect of His Maiesties Royall Pleasure, and Commandement herein declared. And for the better reforming and suppressing of the Abuses before-named; His Maiestie doth hereby further straitly charge and command, That from henceforth no Soale, Turbut, Purle, or Place, vnder the Assize of eight Inches in length besides the tayle, be caught, killed, bought or sold in any Market, or otherwise by Sea, or Land, by any person or persons, of what estate, degree, or condition soeuer he, or they shall be, vpon paine of the losse of the same vnsized Fish, which it shall be lawfull for the Clerke of the Market, or any other his Maiesties Officers, from time to time to seize, take away, and giue to the poore wheresoeuer the same Fish shall be found by Sea or Land; And that the said Clerke of the Market, or other Officer, within sixe dayes after such seizure, doe deliuer to the Iudge of the Admiraltie, in whose Iurisdiction the said vnsized Fish shall be found, or to the Vice-Admirall of the County, where the same shall be seized, a note vnder their hands of such Delinquents names, and of the place of their abode, with testimony that the Fish by him or them so seized, was vnsized; To the end that the Offenders therin, aswell the buyer, as the seller of any such Fish, whether in Market, or otherwise, may be proceeded against and punished by Fine, and Imprisonment, and otherwise, according to their demerits. And lastly, His Maiestie doth require and enioyne all his Iudges, and Iustices of Oyer and Terminer, Iustices of Assize in their seuerall Circuits, and Iustices of Peace in their Sessions, and all Admirals and Vice-Admirals, their Deputies and Commissaries, and all Conseruators of Riuers and Waters, Stewards of Leets, and other His Maiesties Officers and Ministers from time to time, to make diligent inquiry of all such person and persons whatsoeuer, as shall offend in any of the premisses, contrary to His Maiesties Will and Pleasure herein expressed, and thereupon to proceed against, and punish the Offendors by Fine and Imprisonment, or other∣wise, according to His Maiesties Lawes. Giuen at Our Court at White-Hall,  the second day of April, in the eleuenth yeare of Our Reigne. God saue the King.
