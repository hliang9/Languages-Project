LILLIES RVLES construed, Wherunto are added THO. ROBERTSONS Heteroclites, the La∣tine Syntaxis, and Qui mihi. LONDON, Printed by Bonham Norton, Prin∣ter to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie, in the Latine, Greeke, and Hebrew. 16.
TO THE READER. I Long since (gentle Reader) following the example of diverse learned men, who had laboured much in this kind, construed, and being thereunto im∣portuned by many, published Lillies rules of the genders of Nounes, the preterperfect tenses and supines of verbes: his Schoole-precepts, commonly called (Qui mihi) Thomas Robersons Treatise of the Heteroclites, and the Latine Syntaxis. Which I did, being vpon long and suffici∣ent experience well assured, that a good part of the Masters daily paines, and the Scholars fruitlesse dili∣gence, being hereby remoued, the one may, to the great content of his Parents and Master, euen by him∣selfe with better courage and greater profit, learne his lesson in farre shorter time, and keepe it more faith∣fully in memorie, than he did before: and the other may cheerefully with more comfort and greater credit than he was accustomed, teach more necessary things, as the declining of Nounes, conjugating of Verbes, and the meaning of the Rules, with a manifold vse of the examples, chusing rather the practice than the teaching of the Art. If by this easie meane, I any wayes helpe or encourage thee, I shall be very glad: if not, yet haue I the hire and the glory I sought for, namely, that I haue endeauoured to stand thee in stead the best that I could. Farewell. Thine in the Lord, WILLIAM HAINE.

Propria quae maribus construed. DIcas Thou mavest call propria proper names, quae which tribuuntur are attributed maribus to the male kinde mascula masculine: ut as unt be divorum the names of the heathenish gods, Mars the god of battell, Bacchus the god of wine, Apollo the god of wisedome: virorum of men, ut as Cato the name of a wiseman in Rome, Vir∣gilius Virgil: fluviorum of riuers, ut as Tybris the Tyber in Italie, Orontes the Orontes by Antioch: mensium of moneths ut as October the moneth so cal∣led: ventorum of winds, ut as Lybs the Southwest wind by west, Notus the South winde, Auster the South winde. PRopria nomina proper names referentia shw∣ing foemineum sexum the female kinde tribuuntur are attributed foemineo generi to the feminine gender: sive whether sunt they bee dea∣rum the names of heathe∣nish goddesses, ut as Iuno Iupiters wife, Venus the goddesse of beautie: mulie∣rum of women, ceu as An∣na Anne, Philotis Philot: urbium of Cities, ut as Elis a Citie of Peloponnesus, O∣pus a Citie in Locris: regio∣num of Countries, ut as Graecia Greece, Persis Per∣sia. Item also nomen the name Insulae of an Ile, ceu as Creta Creete: Brittannia Britaine, Cyprus Cypres. Tamen neuerthelesse quae∣dam some names urbium of ties sunt are excipienda to bee excepted, ut as ista mascula these masculines, Sulmo the towne where O∣uid was borne, Agragas a towne in Scicilie. quaedam neutralia some neuters, ut as Argos a Citie in Peloponne∣sus, Tybur a citie in Italie, Praeneste a citie in Italie, & and Anxur a citie in Italie,
quod which dat vtrumque genus is both masculine and neuter. APpellativa common names arborum of trees crunt shall be mulie∣bria feminine, ut as alnus an alder tree, cupressus a cy∣presse tree, cedrus a cedar tree, spinus a sloe tree mas is masculine, oeaster a wild Oliue tree, mas is masculine, & and siler an o∣sier, suber cork; thus frank incense, robur an oake, qu and acer a maple, sunt are neutra neuters. ETiam also volucrum he names of birds, ceu as passer a sparrow, hirundo aswallow, ferarum of wilde beasts, ut as tigris a tiger, vulpes a sexe, & and pisci∣um of fishes, ut as Ostrea an oister, coetus a whale, sunt are dicta called epicoena nouns of the epicene gen∣der, quibus to which vox ipsa the word it selfe feret will giue genus aptum bis right gender. Attamen Notwithstanding ex cun∣ctis among all the nounes quae Which diximus wee spake of ante before, notan∣dum we must note, omne that euery noune quod which exit endeth in um, seu whether Graecum Greeke, siue or Latinum Latine, esse is genus neutrum the neuter gender: sic so nomen a noune invariabile unde∣clined. Sed but nunc now dicam I will intreate ordi∣ne in order de reliquis of the other nounes, quae which vocantur are called appel∣lativa common, aut or quae which sunt are tanquàm as appellativa common: nam for genus the gender sem∣per dignoscitur is alwais knowne his in these ex ge∣nitivo by the genitiue case, ut as tiplex regula special∣lis the three speciall rules monstrabit will shw infa afterward. NOmen a noune non crescens not increasing genitivo in the genitiue case, est is genus muliebre the eminine gender, ceu as caro carnis flesh, capra ca∣prae a shee geate, nubes nu∣bis a cloud.
MVlta nomina many names viroum of men in a dicuntur are called mascula masculine, ut as scriba a secretarie, assecla a page, scurra a scoffer, & and rabula a brawler, lixa a scullion, anista a master of defence; quot as many as declinatio prima the first declension Graecorum of the Greekes fundit doth make to end in as and in es, & and quot as many Latine nounes as fiunt are deriued ab illis of them per a en∣ding in a, mascula are mas∣culine ut us satrapas satra∣pa a Peere of the realme, athletes athleta a great wrestler. Item also leguntur these are read mascula mas∣culine, verres a bore pig, natalis ones birth day aqua∣lis an ewer, nata nounes de∣riued ab asse of as a pound weight, ut as centussis an hundred pound wright: conjunge ioine thou lienis the milt, & and orbis any round thing, callis a path, caulis a stalke, follis a paire of bellows, collis a little hill, mensis a month, & and ensis aswod, fustis a club, funis a rope, panis bread, penis a mans yard, crinis haire, & and ignis fire, cas∣sis a hunters net, fascis a faggot, torris a firebrand, sentis a thorne, piscis a fish, & and vnguis a mans nate, & and vermis a worme, vectis a barre, postis a post, & and axis an axell tree so∣cietur may be ioyned. In er nounes ending in er mascu∣la are masculine, ceu as venter a bellie, in os vel or us, ut us logos a wrd, an∣nus a yeare. SVnt these nounes be foe∣mineï generis the semi∣nine gendr, mater a mo∣ther, humus the ground, do∣mus a house, alvus a paunch & and colus a distaffe, & and ficus quartae of the sourth declension pro fru∣ctu for a figge, què and acus a needle, porticus a porch, atque and tribus a stocke, socrus a wiues or husbands mother, nurus the sones wif, & and ma∣nus a hand, idus the ides of a moneth, anus an old wo∣man addenda est must bee added huc hither: mystica

SI is nomen a noune in e gignit make is in the ge∣nittue case, neutrum it is a neuter, vt as mae the sea, rete a net: & and quot as many as fiunt doe end in on, vel or in um, ut as bar∣biton a kind of musicall in∣strument, ovum an egge, hippomanes a venemous humour comming from a mare est is genus neutrum the neuter gender, & and cacoëthes an ill custome neutrum is neuter, & and virus poyson, pelagus the sea, vulgus the common people modò somtimes neu∣trum is neuter, modò som∣times mas masculine. SVnt these nounes are incerti generis the doubtfull gender, talpa a mole, & and dama a bucke or a doe, canalis a channell or a conduit pipe, halcyonis a kingfisher, finis an end, clunis a buttocke, restis an balter, penus all victuals meat and drinke, amnis ari∣uer, pampinus a vine leafe, & and corbis a baket; lin∣ter a cockboat, torquis a coller, specus a denne, an∣guis a ack, ficus dans fici of the second declension pro morbo for a disease, atque and phaselus a shippe called a gallion, lecithus an ye glasse, ae and atomus a mote in the Sunne, grossus a greene figge, pharus an high witch-twer, & and paradisus a paradise. COmpositum à verbo a noune made of a verbe
dans a ending in a est is commune the common du∣orum of two, Graiugena a Groecian borne, â of gigno to gett monstrat sheweth id that, agricola a husband∣man à of colo to till, adve∣na a stranger à of venio to come: adde adde senex an old man or woman, auriga a carter, & and verna a bondman or woman, sodalis a companion, vates a pro∣phet: extorris a banshed man or woman, patruelis my fathers brothers childe, què and perduellis a stub∣borne enemie affinis a kins∣man or kinswoman by mar∣riage, juvenis a yong man or woman, testis a witnesse, ci∣vis acitizen, canis a dogge or a bitch, hostis an enemie. NOmen a noune est is muliebre genus the seminine gender, si if penul∣tima syllaba the sillable last save one genetivi of the ge∣netiue case crescentis in∣creasing sonet sound acuta long, velut as haec pietas pietâtis godlinesse, virtus virtûtis vertue monstrant doshew. QVaedam nomina some ounes monosyllaba of one sillable dicun∣tur are called mascula mas∣cusine, sal salt, sol the sunne, ren the kidney or the reines of the backe, & and splen the splene, Car a man of Ca∣ria, Ser a man of Asia, vir a man, vas vadis a suretie, as a pound weight, mas the male kind, bes the weight of eight ounces, Cres one of Creta, pres a suretie, & and pes a soote, glis a dormouse, ha∣bens hauing gliris geneti∣vo in the genetiue case, mos a manner, flos a flower, ros the deaw, & and Tios a man of Troy, mus a mouse▪ dens a tooth, mons a mountaine, pons a bridge, simul & and also fons a spring, seps pro serpente a serpent, gryps a griffia, Thrax a Thracan, rex a king, grex gregis a sloke of Cattell, & and Phryx a man of Phrygia. Etiam also polysyllaba nounes of many yllables in n, sunt are mascula mascu∣lines, ut as Acarnan a hill by Athens, lichen the hearbe buer wort, & and delphin a dolphin, & in o and which
and in o signantia signi∣fying corpus a bodie, ut as Leo a Lyon, Curculio a Weasell, sic so senio the sise point, ternio the trey point sermo a word or speech. In er, or & os, nounes ending in er or and os mascula are masculine, ceu as crater a standing piece or cup, con∣ditor a builder, heros a no∣ble man, sic so torrens a brook, nefrens a yong pig, riens the East, cum pluri∣bus with many in dens, quale such as is bidens, quando when reperitur, pro instrumento it signifi∣eth a dung-forke, adde adde gigas a giant, elephas an elephant, adamas a dia∣mond, que and Garamas an inhabitant of Africke, tapes tapestrie, atque and lebes a cauldron, Cures a Townes name, magnes a stone that draweth iron unto it, que and vnum nomen one noune quintae of the fift declension meridies noone or the midday. Et also quae nounes which componun∣tur are compounded ab asse of as a pound weight, ut as dodrans nine ounces, se∣mis halfe a pound, jungan∣tur mascula let these mas∣culines be added, Samnis a Samnite, hydrops the drop∣sie, nycticorax a night ra∣uen, thorax the brest, & and mascula these masculines, vervex a belweather, phoe∣nix a phenix, & and bom∣byx pro vermiculo a silke worme. Attamen yet ex his of these, syren a mer∣maid, mulier a woman, so∣ror a sister, vxor a wife, sunt are muliebre genus the feminine gender. ET also haec nomina these nounes monosyl∣laba of one syllable sunt are neutralia neuters, mel honie, fel gall, lac milk, far bread corne, ver the spring time, cor a heart, aes brasse, vas vasis a vessell, os ossis a bone, & and os oris a mouth, rus the countrie, thus frankincense, jus right, crus the leg from the knee to the ancle, pus snot. Et and po∣lysyllaba of many sillables, in al què and in ar, ut as capital a ribon or coife, la∣quear a vauted roofe of a chamber: halec a berring.
neutrum is the neuter gen∣der & and muliebre the fe∣minine. HAec these nounes sunt are dubia the doubtfull gender, python a prophecy∣ing spirit, scrobs a dith, serpens a serpent, bubo an owle, rudens a cable rope, grus a crane, perdix a par∣tridge, lynx a spotted beast, limax, a snaile, stirps pro trunco a stumpe of a tree, & and calx pedis the heele, adde adde thou dies a day, tantùm onely esto let it bee mas masculine secundo nu∣mero in the plurall number. SVnt these are commune the common of two, pa∣rens a father or mother, què and author a beginner, in∣fans an infant, adolescens, a youth, dux a captaine, illex a lawlesse bodie, haeres an heire, exlex a lawlesse bodie, creata the compounds à of fronte a forehead, ut as bi∣rons one which hath a double forehead, custos a keeper, bos an oxe, bull, or cow, fur a thiefe, sus a sow, atque and sacerdos a priest or nunne. SI if penultima the last syllable saue one geneti∣vi of the genitiue case crescentis increasing sit bee gravis short, ut as sanguis bloud genetivo in the geni∣tiue case sanguinis, nomen that noune est is mas a mas∣culine. SIt hyperdyssyllabon let a noune of more than two sillables bee foemi∣nei generis the feminine gender in do, quod which maketh dinis, atque and in go, quod which dat gi∣veth ginis in genitivo in the genetiue case, dulce∣do sweetnesse facens ma∣king dulcedinis monstrat id tibi doth shew that, què and compago a ioynt com∣paginis id that: Adjice adde to these virgo a maide, grando haile fides faith, compes a paire of fetters, teges a matte, & and se. ges standing corne, arbor a tree, què and hyems winter: sic so bacchar the hearbe Ladie gloues, sin∣don fine linnen cloath, Gor∣gon a certaine terrible woman, Icon an Image,
& and Amazon a Woman of Schythia. Graecula Greke nounes finita ending in as vel or in is, ut as lampas a lampe, iaspis a Iasper stone, cassis an helmet, cuspis a point of speare: vox una one word in us pecus cattell dans making pecudis in the genetiue case. Adde adde thou his to these, for fex a paire of sheares, pellex an harlot to a wedded man, carex sedge, simul at que and also supellex houshold stuffe, appendix a pint-house, hiftrix a porcupike, coxendix an hippe, que and filix fearne. NOmen a noune in a signas signifying rem a thing non animatam without life est is neutrale genus the neuter gender, ut as problema a hard questi∣on: en, ut as omen fore∣speaking; ar, ut as jubar the sunne-beame; dans ending in ur, ut as jecur the liuer; us, ut as onus a burden; put, ut as occiput the hin der part of the head. Atta∣men yet ex his of these pe∣cten a combe, fur fur bran, sunt mascula are mascu∣line. Sunt these are neutra neuters, cadauer a dead carcase, verber a stripe, iter a iourney, suber corke, tuber pro fungo a oad stoole, & and uber a dugge gingiber ginger, & and laser the hearbe Beniamin, cicer an Italian pease, & and piper pepper, at que and papaver poppie. & and siler a parse∣nip, atque and siler anosier, Aequor the Sea, marmor marble, què and ador wheat, neutra are neuters, atque and pecus cattell, quando when facit it ma∣keth pecoris in genetivo in the genetiue cafe. SVnt these are dubij ge∣neris the doubtfull gen∣der, cardo the hinge of a doore, margo the brim of a∣ny thing, cinis ashes, obex a bolt of a doore, pulvis dust, adeps fatnesse, forceps a paire of tongs, pumex a pu∣mice stone, ramex bursten∣nes anas a ducke or a drake, imbrex a gutter tile: adde adde culex a gnatte, natrix a water serpent, & and onyx the naile of a mans hand,
cum prole with his com∣pound, què and silex a flint, quamuis although usus vse vult will meliùs rather hee that these nounes dicier bee called mascula masculines. ISta these nounes sunt are communis generis the common of two genders, vi∣gil a watchman or watch∣woman, pugil a champion, exul a banished man or wo∣man, praesul a president, homo a man or woman, ne∣mo no body, martyr a mar∣tyr, Lygur one of Lyguria, Augur a soothsayer, & and Arcas one of Arcadia, an∣tistes chiefe among others, miles a souldier, pedes a footman, interpres an in∣terpreter, comes a compa∣nion, hospes an host or an hostesse; sic so ales any great bird, praeses a chiefe ruler, princeps a prince, auceps a fowler, eques a horseman, obses a pledge in warre, at∣que and multa alia nomi∣na many other nounes quae which creantur are deriued à verbis of verbes, ut as conjux a husband or wife, judex a iudge, vindex a reuenger, opifex a worke∣man, & and aruspex a soothsayer. ADjectiva adiectiues ha∣bentia hauing unam vocem one termination duntaxat only, ut as foelix happie, audax bol, retinent keep omne genus euery gen∣der sub una in one ending: Si if cadant they fall sub gemina voce in a double termination, velut as om∣nis & omne all, vox prior the former word est is com∣mune the commen duûm of two, vox altera the second, neutrum the neuter. At but si if variant they varie tres voces three endings, ut as sacer sacra sacrum holy, vox prima the first word est is mas masculine, altera the second foeminea feminine, tertia the third neutrum neuter. At but sunt there are nounes quae which vocares you may call propè in a manner substan∣tiva subslantiues flexu by declining, tamen notwith∣standing reperta they are found adjectiva adiectiues natura by nature què and
usu by vse: Talia such sunt are pauper poore, puber ripe of age, cum with de∣gener waxing out of kinde, uber plentifull, & and dives rich, locuples wealthie, sof∣pes safe, comes a compa∣nion, atque and supestes one that ouerliueth, cum paucis alijs with a few o∣thers, quae which lectio justa diligent reading docebit will teach. Haec these nounes gaudent asciscere sibi will haue proprium quendam flexum a certaine proper declining: Campester of the plaine field, volucer fwift, celeber famous, celer swift, atque and saluber wholesome. Iunge adde pe∣dester belonging to a foote∣man, equester belonging to a horseman, & and acer sharpe. Iunge adde paluster belonging to a marsh, ac and alacer chearefull, sylvester belonging to the wood: at but sic thus tu variabis thou shalt decline haec these nounes, hic celer in the masculine gender, haec cele∣ris in the feminine, neutro in the neuter hoc celere, aut or aliter otherwise sic thus, hic atque haec celeris in the masculine and feminine, rursum againe hoc celere est tibi neurrum is the neu∣ter gender. Quae genus construed. De nominibus Heteroclitis Thomae Robersoni. SVnto let these nounes bee Heteroclita Heteroclites quae which variant doe va∣rie genus gender aut or flexum declension, quae∣cunque and whatsoeuer de∣ficiunt doe want, superant∣ve or haue uermuch, no∣ato ritu after a new order. Cernis thou seest haec these variantia changing genus gender ac and partim part∣ly flexum declension, Per∣gamus infoelix urbs the vnhappie Citie Troum of the Troians gignit maketh Pergama: Quod which thing ipsa the word it selfe
supellex houshold-stuffe fa∣cit doth nisi except careat it want plurali the plurall number. Singula these being singulars gaudēt foemines are feminines. Pluralia be∣ing plurals neutris neuters. Prior numerus the singular number dat giueth his to these nounes genus neutrū the neuter gender, alter the plurall vtrumque both mas∣culine and neuter: Rastrum a rake, cum with fraeno a bridle filum thread simul atquè and also capistrum an headstall, item also Ar∣gos a towne in Greece, & and coelum heauen, singula being singulars sūt are neu∣tra neuters: sed but audi marke vocitabis thou shalt call coelos & Argos in the plurall number duntaxat onely mascula masculine▪ sed but fraena neuter & and frae∣nos masculine, quo pacto after which sort & also for∣mant they forme caetera the rest: Nundinum a faire & hinc and also epulum a banquet, quibus vnto which addito adde thou balneum a bath, & and haec these sunt are neutra neuters, quidem indeede primo in the plurall number, rite by custome muliebria fmi∣nines secundo in the plurall. Constat it is certaine Iuue∣nalem habere that Iuuenal hath balnea baths plurall in the plurall number. HAec these nounes singu∣laria being singidars, dantur maribus are mascu∣lines, plurima being plu∣rals neutris neuters, Mae∣nalus an hill in Arcadia, at∣que and sacermons the sa∣cred mountaine Dyndimus a top of Ida by Try, Isma∣us a mountaine in Thracia. atque and Tartara hell Taygtus an hill in Lace∣dmonia,, sic so Tenera a Promontorie in Lconia, Massica a Mountaine in Campania, & and altus gar∣garus the high top of the hill Ida. At but alter numerus the plurall number dabit will giue his to these nounes v∣trumque genus both gen∣ders, sibilus an hissing atque and ocus sport, locus a place, & and Campanus a∣uernus a lake of Campanla in Itali.
Propago the remnant quae which sequitur followeth est is manca maimed nu∣mero in number casûve or in case. Vocabis thou shalt call those nounes Aptôta, quae which variât alter nullū ca∣sū no case, ut as fas right, nil nothing, nihil nothing, in∣star like, & and multa many in u simul i, in u & i, ut as haec these sunt bee què both cornu a horne, què & genu a knee, sic so gūmi gum fru∣gi thrifty, sic so tēpe a very faire field in Thessalia, tot so many, quot how many & & omnes numeros all nounes of nūber,  tribus from three ad centum to an hundred. QVè and nomē a noune est is monoptôtō, cui to which vox una one word cadit happeneth ceu as no∣ctu by night, natu by birth, jussu by bidding, injussu without bidding simul also ast by craft promptu with speed, permissu by sufferāce, legimus we reade a stus plu∣rali in the plural nūber, legi∣mus we read inficias a de∣niall, sed but vox ea that word est is sola onely reper∣ta found. SVnt these bee diptôta quibus to which duplex flexura a double declining remansit remaineth, ut as fors hap dabit will giue for∣te sexto in the ablatiue case, queque also spontis of his owne accord sponte: Sic so plus more habet hath plu∣ris, repetundarū of brbery repetundis, & and jugeris of an acre dat giueth jugere sexto in the ablatiue case: autem but verberis of a stripe verbere, quoque also suppetiae ayde dant ma∣keth suppetias quarto in the accusatiue case, tantun∣dem as much dat giueth tâtidem, simul also impetis of violence dat giueth hoc impete: Iunge adde vicem by turne sexto in the abla∣tiue case vice; nec neither lego doe I reade plura moe: haec quatuor these foure verberis of a stripe, at què and vicem by turne, sic so plus more cum with juge∣re an acre tenuere haue kept cunctos casus all their cases numero secundo in the plurall number.
VOcantur they are cal∣led triptôta, quibus wherein inflectis thou deest decline tres casus three ca∣ses, ut as precis prayer, at{que} and precem, & and blan∣dus a kind man petit ami∣cam wos his loue prece by entreatie; sic in like manner legis thou readest opis est nostrae it is in our power, fer opem helpe thou at què and dignus ope worthy of helpe. At but frugis of fruit tantùm onely caret wanteth recto the nominatiue case, & also ditionis of title: vis force est is vox integra a perfit word, nisi except for∣tè▪ perhaps dativus the da∣tiue case desit bee wanting prior numerus the singular number mutilus is vnpsrfect omnibus his in all these, alter the plurall integer is whole. Quae referunt rela∣tiues: ut as qui which, quae percōtantur interrogatiues ut as ecquis who: & and quae distribuunt distribu∣tiues, ut as nullus none, neuter neither of two, & and omnis all: infinita nounes indefinites solent are wont iungi to be ioyned his to these, ut as quilibet euery one, alter another: Haec these saepé often carent doe want quinto casu the voca∣tiue case. Et and prono∣mina the pronounes praeter except haec quatuor these foure, infra following, no∣ster ours nostras of our countrey, meus mine & and tu thou. Notes you may ob∣serue propria cuncta all pro∣per names quibus est which haue natura coercens a re∣straining nature, ne fuerint that they shall not bee pluri∣ma plurals, ut as Mars the heathenish God of bat∣tell, Cato the name of a wise man in Rome, Gallia Frāce, Roma Rome, Ida an hill by Troy. Tagus a riuer in Por∣tugall, Lelaps a dogs name, Parnassus an hill in Pho∣cis, què and Bucephalus the horse of Alexander the great. Dabis thou shalt adde his to these frumenta bread-corne, pensa Tow or Wooll on a distaffe, herbas hearbe, uda moist things, metalla metals in quibus in which ipse requi∣ras thou maist search quae what sint are placita the
pleasures authorum of au∣thors, Est there is a time vbi when haec these retinent keepe pluralem the plurall number, est there is a time also vbi when spernunt they haue it not. HOrdea barley, farra breadcorne, forum a market, mel honie, mulsum wine mingled with honie, de∣fruta wine sodden till the third part bee boiled away. què and thus frankincense, pluralia being plurals ser∣vant they keepe tantùm only tres similes voces three like cases. Hesperus the euening starre, et and vesper the eue∣ning, pontus the sea, que and limus mud, que and fimus dung, sic so penus all victuals meate and drinke, & and sanguis blood sic so aether the skie, nemo no bo∣die: sed but Ista mascula these masculines vix sunt excedentia scarcely exceede numerum primum the sin∣gular number. SIngula these singulars foeminei generis of the feminine gender, rarò sel∣dome pluralia are plurals, pubes ripenesse of age, atquc and salus health, sic so talio like for like, cum with in∣dole towardnesse, tussis the cough, pix pitch, humus the ground at{que} and lues a mur∣ren, sitis thirst, & and fu∣ga a flying away, iunge adde quietem rest, sic so cholera choler, atque and fames hunger: què and bilis me∣lancholie, senecta olde age▪ juventus youth Sed but ta∣men yet haec these nounes soboles an of spring, labes a spot, vt as & also omnia all quintae of the fifidcclen∣sion saepe often tenebunt will keepe plurali in the plurall number tres similes casus, three like cases, exci∣pe except res a thing, spe∣cies a kind, facies a face, que and acies an edge que and dies a day, quas voces which words licet may esse be totas whole secundo nu∣mero in the plurall number. Solent they are wont necte∣re to adde istis to these multa muliebria many fe∣minines: ut as haec these sunt are stultitia foolishnesse, in∣vidia enuie, & and sapien∣tia
wisedome, desidia sloath, at que and innumerae vo∣ces innumerable words id genus of this sort, quas which lectio reading prae∣bet yeeldeth quam prefix∣am tibi which set before thee collige gather together ceu as certum filum a sure guiding thread.

The Syntaxis construed. VErbum personale a verbe personal cohae∣ret agreeth cum no minativo with his nomina∣tiue case numero in number & and persona person: ut as via the way ad bonos mores to good manners est is nunquam neuer sera late. Fortuna fortune est is nun∣quam nuer perpetuò al∣wayes bona good. Nomi∣nativus the nominatiu case primae vel secundae perso∣nae of the first or second per∣son rarissimè exprimitur is very seldome expressed nisi except discretionis causâ for difference sake: ut us vos ye damnastis haue condem∣ned, quasi as though dicat hee should say nemo none praeterea besides; aut or emphasis gratiâ: for the bet∣ter expressing of the thing to be spoken: ut as tu euen thou es art patronus eur patron, tu euen thou art pater our father; si tu deseris if thou forsake vs, perimus wee are vttery vndone: quasi as though dicat hee should say, praecipuè specially & and prae alijs before others, tu euen thou es art patronus our patron. Tu euen thou eras wast mihi to mee Do∣minus a Lord, tu euen thou vir a husband: tu euen thou frater a brother. In verbis in verbs, quorum significa∣tio whose signification tan∣tùm only pertinct belong∣eth ad homines to men, nominativus the nomina∣tiue case tertiae personae of the third person saepe often∣times subauditur is vnder∣stood, ut as est he is, fertur hee is reported, dicunt they report, ferunt they report, aiunt they say, praedicant
they tell it abroad clami∣tant they crie it abroad, & and in similibus in such like, ut as fertur he is repor∣ted designasse to haue com∣mitted atrocia flagitia hai∣nous offences▪ Què and fe∣runt they report poenituisse that it hath repented te thee irae tuae of thy anger. Vox casualis a casuall word non est is not semper alwayes nominatiuus he nomina∣tiue case verbo to the verbe sed but aliquando some∣times verbum infinitum a verbe of the infinitiue mood: ut as mentiri to lie non est is not meum my propertie. Aliquando sometimes ora∣tio a sentence: ut as Adde adde this quòd that didi∣cisse to haue learned inge¦nuas artes the Liberall Sci¦ences fideliter faithfully, e∣mollit mollifih mores men manners, nec sinit & carries them not esse to bee fers brutish▪ Aliquando sometime aduerbium an ad∣uerbe cum genitiuo with a genitiue case, ut as partim virorum part of the men, cecedêrunt were slaine in bello in warre; partim sig∣norum part of the ensignes sunt combusta were bur∣ned. Verba verbes infiniti modi of the infinitiue mood statuunt set ante se before themselues accusatinum an accusatiue case pro nomi∣natiuo for a nominatiue: ut as gaud eo I am glad te re∣dijsse that thou art returned incolumem safe. Volo I will te agere that thou play fabulam a comedy Hic mo∣dus this mood potest may resolui hee dissolued per quòd & ut by quòd and ut ad hunc modum after this manner: ut as gaudeo I am glad quòd that tu redijsti thou art returned incolu∣mis safe. Volo I will ut that tu agas thou play fabulam a comedie. Verbum a verbe positum placed inter duos nominatiuos betweene two nominatiue cases diuerso∣rum numerorum of diuers numbers potest may con∣uenire agree cum alteru∣tro with either of them: ut as Irae the falling out aman∣tium o louers redintegra∣tio est is the renewing amo∣ris of loue Quid enim for what nisi but vota prayers
supersunt remaine? Percus∣sit she strooke pectora her brest, quoque also pectus her brest robora fiunt was made oke Hic heere nihil nothing nisi but carmina verses desunt are wanting. Impersonalia imparsonalis non habent haue not nomi¦natiuum a nominatiue case, praecedentem going before them: vt as taedit me I am weary vitae of life. Pertae∣sum est I am weary coniu∣gij of wedlocke, de quibus whereof suo loco I will in∣treate in their place. Nomen a noune multitudinis of multitude singulare singu∣lar quandoque sometimes iungitur is ioyned verbo plurali to a verbe plurall, ut as pars part abêe are gone: vter{que} both deludun∣tur are mocked dolis with deceit. ADiectiuum the Adie∣ctiue consentit agree∣eth cum substantiuo with the substantiue▪ genere in gender, numero number, & and casu case; ut as Rara auis a rare bird in terris in the earth, què and similima most like nigro cygno a blacke Swanne. Ad eundem modum after the same man∣ner participia participles, & and pronomina pronounes adnectuntur are ioyned substātiuis to substantiues, ut as Donec so long as eris thou shalt bee foelix in pro∣speritie numerabis thou shalt number multos ami∣cos many friens. Nullus amicus no friend ibt wll goe ad amissas opes to lost riches. Pectora mea my brest non senserunt hath not felt. hoc vulnus this wound primum now the first time, tuli I haue suffe∣red grauiora more grieuous. Aliquando sometimes ora∣tio a senence supplet doth supply locum the place sub∣stantiui of a substantiue: ut as audito when it was heard regem proficisci that the King went Doroberniam to Canterbury. RElatiuum the Relatiue concordat agreeth cum Antecedente with the Antecedent genere in gen∣der, numero number & and persona person: ut as Quis
who est is vir bonus a good man? Qui hee that servat keepeth cōsulta the statutes patrum of his forefathers qui hee that keepeth leges their lawes, iuraquè and ordinances Nec solùm and not only vnica vox one word alone sed etiam but also in∣terdum sometimes oratio a sencence ponitur is put pro antecedente for the ante∣cedent: ut as Veni I came in tempore in seuson ad e∣am to her, quod which est is primū the chiefest omni∣um rerum of all things. Re∣lativum a Relatiue collo catum placed inter duo an∣tecedentia betweene two antecedents diuerforum ge∣nerum of diuers genders nunc sometimes convenit agreeth cum priore with the former: ut as Senatus the enate peragebat keept assiduam stationem their daiy meeting eo loco in that place qui which hodie at this day appellatur is cal∣led Senaculum the Senate∣house. Non procul not far off ab eo flumine from that Riuer quod which vocant they call Saliam Salia. Stel¦la the starre Iouis of Iupi∣ter, quae which dicitur is called Phaêton, fertur is carried propiùs à terra not farre from the earth. Nunc sometimes cum posteriore with the latter: ut as homi∣nes men tuentur doe defend illum globum that round thing quae which dicitur it called terra the earth. Est there is locus a place in carcere in the prison quod which appellatur is called Tullianum a dungeon. In coitu Iunae in the coniuucti∣on of the Sunne and Moone quod which vocant they call interlunium the space betweene the old Moone and the new. Aliquando some∣times Relativum a Relatiue aliquando sometimes & al∣so Nomen Adjectivum a Noune adiectiue respondet hath relation primitivo to the primatiue, quod which subintelligitur is under∣stood in possessivo in the possessiue. ut as Omnes all men dicere did say omnia bona all good things, & and laudare did prayse fortu∣nas meas my good hap, qui who haberem had filium a
son praeditum endued tali ingenio with so good a na∣ture. Vidisti thou hast seene nostros occulos our eyes flētis of mee weeping. Quo ties as often as nullus no¦minatiuus no nominatiue case interseritur is put in∣ter relatiuum betweene the relative & verbum and the verbe, relatiuum the rela∣tiue crit shall be nominati∣uus the nominatiue case ver∣bo to the verbe: ut as Faelix he is happie qui which po∣tuit could visere go to see fō∣tem lucidum the cleare fountaine boni of goodnesse. At but si if nominatiuus the nominatiue case inter∣ponatur bee put betweene relatio the relatiue & ver∣bo and the verbe, relatiuum the relatiue regtur shall be gouerned a verbo of the verbe, aut or ab alia di∣ctione of another word quae which locatur is pla∣ced cum verbo with the verbe in oratione in the sentence: ut as Gratia thanks abest is wanting ab officio from that good turne quod which mora linge∣ring tardat delayeth. Cuius numen whose deiie adoro I worship. Quorum whereof ego habeo I haue optimū the best. Cui to whom non vidi I haue not seene simi∣lem the like. Quo where∣of iudicaui I haue thought te thee dignum worthy. Quo than whom nemo none scribit writeth meliùs better. Quem videndo in seeing of whom obstupuit hee was amazed. Lego I reade Virgilium Virgil prae quo in comparison of whom caeteri Poetae the other Po∣ets sordent are of very small account. QVum when duo sub∣stantiva wo substan∣tiues diuersae significatio∣nis of diuers significations sic concurrunt doe so come together, ut as posterius the latter quodammodo af∣ter a sort videatur may seeme possideri to bee possessed à priore of the former, tùm then posterius the lat∣ter ponitur is put in geniti∣uo in the genitiue case ut as Amor the loue nummi of money crescit increaseth

Cultor a tiller agri of the ground. Proinde fur∣ther hic genitivus this geni∣tiue, case saepissimè very often mutatur is changed in adiectiuū possessiuū into an adiectiue possessiue: vt as Do∣mus the house patris of my father, paterna domus my fathers house. Filius the sonne heri of my master, Herilis filius my masters sonne, Est there is a time e∣tiam also vbi when verti∣tur it is turned in datiuum into a datiue case: vt as Est he is pater a Father vrbi to the Citie què and maritus a husband vrbi to the Citie. Herus a master tibi to thee: Pater a Father mihi to me. Excipiuntur nounes are ex∣cepted quae which conne∣ctuntur are put together in eodem casu in the same case per Appositionem by apposition: vt as opes riches irritamenta the allurements to malorum euils effodiun∣tur are digged out of the earth. Arcent they driue a∣way à praesepibus from their hiues fucos the drones ignauum pcus being a sluggish cattell. Adiectiuum an adiectiue positum put in neutro genere in the neu∣ter gender absolutè abso∣lutely, hoc est that is abs{que} substantiuo without a sub∣stantiue aliquādo sometimes postulat requireth geniti∣uum a genitiue case, vt as paululum paecuniae a little money. Hoc noctis this night Non videmus wee see not manticae that wallet quod which est is in tergo on the backe. Quantum nummo∣rum so much money as quis{que} euery one seruat keepeth in arca sua in his chst, habet he hath & tantū fidei euen so much credit Interdum sometimes genitiuus the ge∣nitiue case ponitur is put tantum alone, nempè that is priore substantiuo the former substantiue subau∣dito being vnderstood, per Eclipsim by Eclipsis: vt as in locutionibus in speeches huiusmodi of this kinde: vbi so soone as veneris thou shalt

Haec demonstratiua these demō∣stratiues hic, ille, iste distin∣guūtur are distinguished sic thus: Hic, demonstrat shew∣eth proximum the nearest mihi unto me: Iste, eum him qui which est is apud te by thee: Ille, indicat sheweth eum him qui est remotus that is remoued ab vtroquè from vs both. Ille, tum then vsurpatur is vsed, cum when demonstramus wee shew rem quampiam any thing ob eminentiam for the ex∣cellencie thereof: vt as A∣lexander ille magnus that same Alexander the great. Verò but iste ponitur is put quando when facimus we make mentionem mention rei alicuius of some thing cum contemptu vvith con∣tempt: ut as Pellito driue vvay istum aemulum this copesmate ab ea from her quoad poteris as farre as thou canst Cùm vvhen hic & illa referuntur are refer∣red ad duo anteposita to tvvo nounes going before, hic debet ought referri to bee referred propriè properly ac and vsitatissimè most vsu∣ally ad posteriùs to the lat∣ter & and propius neerer: Ille ad prius to the former & and remotius furthest off, ut as Propositum the purpose Agricolae of the Husbandman est is contra∣rium contrarie to pastoris the Shepheards. Ille the hus∣bandman quam maximè most of all, gaudet reioyceth

Tamen yet est there is a time, vbi when è diuerso on the contrary in∣venias you may find prono∣men the pronoune Hic, re∣ferri to bee referred ad sup∣positum to the substantiue remotius further off, & and ille ad proximius to the neerer. VErba substantiva verbes substantiues, ut as, Sum I am, forem I might be, fio I am made, existo I am: Verba passiua verbes passiues vocandi of calling: ut as Nominor I am named, appellor I am called, dicor I am said, vo∣cor I am called, nuncupor I am named, & and similia like ijs to them: ut as Scri∣bor I am written, salutor I am saluted, habeor I am counted, existimor I am esteemed: Item also verba verbes gestus of gesture ut as Sedeo I sit, dormio I sleep, cubo I lie downe, ince∣do I goe, curro I run, expe∣tunt require nominatiuum a nominatiue case utrin{que} on either side: ut as Deus God est is summum bonum the chiefest good. Perpusilli ve∣ry little men vocantur are called nani dwarses. Fides faith habetur is counted fundamentum the founda∣tion Religionis nostrae of our Religion. Malus pastor an euill shepheard dormit sleepeth supinus voide of care. Homo a man incedit goeth erectus boult vpright in coelum towards heauen. Deniquè finally ferè in a manner omnia verba all verbes habent haue post se after them nominativum a nominatiue case adjectiui nominis of a Noune adie∣ctiue, quod which concor∣dat agreeth cum supposito with the Nominatiue case verbi of the verbe casu in case, genere gender, & and numero number: ut as Rex the King mandauit com∣manded primus first haere.
sin heresie extirpari to bee rooted out. Pij godly men o∣rāt pray taciti holding their peace. Boni good boies dis∣cunt learne seduli diligently Quoque also infinitum a verbe of the infinitiue moode habet hath cosdem casus the same cases vtrinquè on either side, praecipuè espe∣cially cum when verba verbes optandi of wishing què and similia like eis to them accedunt come neere them: ut as Hypocrita an hypocrite cupit aesiresh vi∣deri to seeme iustus iust: Hypocrita an Hypocrtie cupit desireth se videri that hee might seeme iu∣stum iust. Malo I hadde rather esse bee dives rich quàm then haberi so ac∣counted. Malo I had rather me esse that I were divi∣tem rich, quàm than ha∣beri so accounted. Vivitur men liue meliùs better exi∣guo with a little, Natura naturé dedit hath giuen om∣nibus to all esse to be bcatis happy, siquis if any cog∣nouerit knew vti to vse it. Non licet nobis wee may not esse bee tam disertis vel disertos so eloquent. Expedit it is expedient vobis for you esse to be bo∣nas good. Quo commisso which fact if it had bin com∣mitted non licet mihi I could not esse bee piam a loyall wife. Quamuis al∣though in his postremis ex∣emplis in these last exam∣ples accusativi the accusa∣tiue cases subaudiuntur are vnderstood ante before ver∣ba infinita verbes of the in∣finitiue mood, Nos esse that wee should be disertos clo∣quent. Vos esse that you should be bonas good. Me esse that I should bee piam loyall. SVm postulat requireth genitivum a genitiue case quoties as often as sig∣nificat it signifieth possessi∣onem possession, aut or per∣tinere to belong ad ali quid to something: ut as Pe∣cus the cattell est is Meli∣baei Meliheuses. Est it is the duty adolescentis of a yong man revereri to reuerence maiores natu his elders. Est it is the duty Regum of Kings parcere to spare sub∣jectis
the mecke subiects & and debellare to keepe down superbos the proud. Hi no∣minativi these Nominatiue cases excipiuntur are accep∣ted, meum mino, tuum thine suum his, nostrum ours, vestrum yours, humanum belonging to a Man, bel∣luinum belonging to a beast, & and similia such like ut as Non est it is not meum my duety dicere to speake contra authoritatem a∣gainst the authoritie Se∣natus of the Senate. Eia what soft, haud vestrum est it is not your part esse to be iracundos angry: huma∣num est it is a propertie of a man irasci to be angry. At but hic heere officium du∣tie videtur seemeth subin∣telligi to bee vnderstood, quod which aliquando sometimes etiam also ex∣primitur is expressed, ut as est it is tuum officium thy dutie ut that benè in good sort adsimules thou wouldst make a shew of has nuptias this marriage. Verba verbes aestimandi of esteeming gaudent reioyce genitivis with Genitiue cases: ut as pecunia money fit is estee∣med plurimi very much passim a broade. Pudor shamefastnesse parvi pendi∣tur is little set by. Literae learning habentur is estee∣med nihili vel pro nihilo as nothing. Opes riches sunt pluris are of more value nunc now quam then an∣nis in the yeeres prisci tem∣poris of ancient time Esti∣mo I esteeme adsciscit ta∣keth vnto it vel either geni∣tivum a genitiue case vel or ablativum an Ablatiue: ut as Non aestimo I esteeme thee not hujus thus much. Virtus Virtue est is aesti∣manda to be esteemed mag∣no of great prise ubique euery where. Flocci of a locke of wool, nauci of a nut∣shell or pill, nihil nothing, pili of an haire, assis of a far∣thing, hujus thus much, te∣runtij of three ounces, pecu∣liariter properly adijciuntur are put his Verbis to these verbes, aestimo I esteem, pen∣do I weigh, facio I make reckoning of: ut as ego pen∣do I esteeme illum him floc∣ci as naught: Nec neither facio doe I regard him hu∣jus
thus much qui who aesti mat esteemes me me pili as an haire ista these sunt be singularia speciall phraises: Aequiboni consulo I take it in good part, Aequi boni fa∣cio I take it in good part, id est that is in bonam acci∣pio partem I take in good part. Verba verbes accusan∣di of accusing, damnandi of condemning, monendi of warning, absolvendi of absoluing, & and consimilia such like postulant require genitivum a Genitiue case qui which significat signifi∣eth crimen a fault: ut as Oportet it behooueth ip∣sum him intueri se to looke into himselfe qui which in∣cusat accuseth alterum an∣nother man probri of dis∣honestly. Etiam likewise, condemnat he condemneth generum suum his sonne in law, sceleris of wickednesse. Cupido ô Cupid parce for∣beare damnare to condemne vatem tuum thy Poet sceleris of wickednesse. Ad∣moneto admonish illum him pristinae fortunae of his former estate. Absolutus est he is acquited furti of fello∣ny. Hic genitiuus the geni∣tiue case vertitur is turned aliquando sometimes in ab∣lativum into an Ablatiue, vel either cum Praepositio∣ne with a Preposition, vel er sine praepositione with∣out a preposition; ut as Si es if thou beest in iquus judex a partiall Iudge in me a∣gainst me ego te condem∣nabo I will comdemne thee eodem crimine of the same crime. Grauiter accusauit hee hath grieuously accused vxorem his wife de pudi∣citia of vnchastitie. Putaui I thought te esse admonen∣dum that you were to be put in minde ea de re of that matter. Vterque both nullus none, alter another neuter neither of the two, alius another, ambo both & and superlativus gradus the superlatiue degree, non subduntur are not put nisi but in ablativo in the abla∣tiue case verbis to verbes id genus of that sort: ut as ac∣cusas dost thou accuse furti of theft? an or stupri of dis∣honesty? an or vtroque of both, sive or de vtroque of both? Ambobus of both
vel or de Ambobus of both Neutro of neither vel or de neutro of neither. Accusa∣ris thou art accused de plu∣rimis of very many things simul at once. Satago I am busie, or I doe with speede; misereor I haue pittie on, miseresco I haue compas∣sion, genitiuum admittunt gouerne a genitiue case: ut as is hee satagit hath enough to de about rerum suarum his owne businesse. Oro l pray thee miserêre take pity on laborum tantorum so great labours. Miserêre haue compassion vpon animi a mind ferētis suffering non digna vnworthy things. Et and miseresce haue compas∣sion upon generis tui thine owne stocke. At but mise∣reor & miseresco I haue pi∣ty on, rarius very seldome leguntur are read cum da∣tivo with a datiue case: ut as succurro I helpe huic this man, misereor I take pitty on huic him. Iure of right dilige loue thou bonos good men, & and miseresce haue pitie on malis bad. Remi∣niscor to remember, oblivi∣scor to forget. memini I call to minde, desiderant require genitivum a genitiue case aut or accusativum an ac∣cusatiue, ut as Reminisci∣tur he remembreth datae fi∣dei his promise. Est it is proprium the property stul∣titiae of foliie cernere to see aliorum vitia other mens faults, oblivisci to forget suorum their owne. Faci∣am I will bring it to passe ut that semper alwaies me∣mineris thou shalt remem∣ber mei que both mee, ac and huius diei this day, ac and loci place. Senes old men meminerunt remem∣ber omnia all things quae curant which they regard. Memini I made mention de hac re of this matter, de ar∣mis of weapons, de te of thee, id est that is, feci mentionem I made menti∣on. Potio I obtaine jun∣gitur is ioined aut either genitivo with a genitiue case, aut or ablativo an ab∣latine: ut as Romani the Romanes potiti sunt obtai∣ned signorum the anci∣ents, & and armorum the weapons. Troes the Troianes egressi gone out of
their shippes potiuntur en∣ioy optata arena the wished shoae. OMnia verba all verbs posita put acquisiti∣ve acquisitiuely adsciscunt dativum gouern a datiue case eius rei of that thing cui whereunto aliquid somthing acquiritur is pro∣cured quocunque modo after what sort socuer: ut as ne seritur neither is there sowing, nec metitur neither is there mowing mi∣hi for me istic there. Nescio I know not quis oculus what eye fascinat bewit∣cheth mihi unto mee tene∣ros agnos the young lambes, Verba verbes varij gene∣ris of diuerse sorts appen∣dent belong huic regulae to this rule. Imprimis first of all verba significantia verbes signifying commodū profit, aut or incommodum disprofite regunt gouerne dativum a datiue case: ut as illa seges that eared corne demum at the last respondet contents votis the wisht desires avari agri∣colae of the couetous hus∣bandman. Non potes thou canst not commodare plea∣sure, nec nor incommoda∣re displeasure mihi mee. Incumbite stand stoutly to remis validis your strong oares Fert he acknowledgeth suam eruditionem his lear∣ning acceptam to be recei∣ued tibi of you. Quaedam some ex his of these effe∣runtur are vsed etiam like∣wise cum accusativo with an accusatiue case: ut as Omnes ye all studetis stu∣dy unum one thing, sentitis ye thinke vnum one thing. Si if memorem I should call to minde ea those things quae which conducunt are profi∣table ad victum to the seed∣ing ventris of the bely, mo∣ra est it were teadious. In∣cumbite labour earnestly in haec studia abeut these su∣dies. Naturàne whether na∣ture an or doctrina instru∣ction conferat auaie plus more ad eloquentiam to eloquence, Quies rest iuvat delighteth plurimùm very much fessum the wearied man. Verba verbes compa∣randi of comparing regunt gouerne dativum a datiue
case: ut as Sic so solebam I was wont componere to compare magna great things paruis with small. Adae∣quauit se he hath made himselfe equall fratri to his brother & hoth opibus in riches & and dignatione in dignity. Interdum some∣times ablatiuus an ablatiue case cū praepositione with a preposition additur is ad∣ded; ut as comparo I compare Virgilium Virgil cum Homero with Homer. Aliquando sometimes ac∣cusativus an accusatiue case cum praepositione with the preposition ad: ut as Si if cō∣paratur he be compared ad cum to him, nihil est he is no body. Verba verbs dandi of giuing & and reddendi restoring regunt gouern da∣tiuum a Datiue case: vt as fortuna fortune dedit hath giuen nimium ouer-much multis to māy, satis enough nulli to none. Est he is in∣gratus vngratefull qui which non reponit layeth not vp gratiam thanks me∣renti for him that deserueth benè well Haec these verbes habent haue variam con∣structionē a diuers constru∣ction; Dono I bestow hoc munus this gift tibi on thee Dono I bestow hoc mūere this gift te on thee Imperti∣as bestow aliquid temporis some time huic rei on this thing Gnato impertit Par∣menonem greets Parmeno summum suum his singular good friend plurima salute with very many salutations. Aspersit he sprinkled labē a spot mihi on me: Aspsit he sprinkled me mee labe with a spot. Instrauit hee spread paenulam his cloake equo vpon his horse. Instra∣vit hee spread equum his horse penula with his cloak, ut as piget it grieueth mee consuluisse, id est dedisse consilium to haue counsel∣led vel etiam or alse pros∣pexisse to haue shifted for infido viro thee a faithlesse man. Què and consulit, id est, petit consilium he as∣ked counsll of rectorem ra∣tis the master of the Ship de cunctis astris of all the stars: Cōsulis id est statuis thou dost deermin istuc this pessimè as badly as may bee in te against thy selfe, at què

Timeo tibi vel de te the same, formido tibi vel de te the same Muteo te vel à te I stand in feare of thee scilicet to wit, ne mihi no∣ceas lest thou shouldest hurt mee: Timeo te vel à te the sam, formido e vel à te, the same. Verba verbes pro∣mittendi of promising ac & soluendi of paying rgunt gouerne Datiuum a Datiue case: vt as promitto I pro∣mise tibi thee ac and reci∣pio I take vpon me esse ob∣seruaturum to obseue haec these things sanctissimè most deuoutly: Numerauit hee hath▪ paid aes alienum the deht mihi vnto me. Verba Verbes imperandi of com∣manding, & and nuntiandi of shewng, rquirunt re∣quire dtiuum a datiue case, vt as Pecunia money colle∣cta hoorded vp imperat commandeth, aut or servit serueth cuique euery man.

Go∣tulicus scribit writeth Len∣tulum genitū that Lentu∣lus

Ventosus I being vn constant, amo do loue Tybur Romae at Rome, Romam Rome Tybure at Tibur. Quum when tu thou men∣sas hospitū convomeres didst vomit vp thy hosts good cheere, Narbone at Narbō.

Proprium the proper name loci of a place apponitur is put verbis to verbs signifi∣cantibus signifying motum a motion ad locum to a place, in accusativo in the accusatiue case: ut as Con∣cessi I went Cantabrigiam o Cambridge ad capien∣dum ingenij cultum to get learning: Eo Londinum I goe to London ad merces emendas to buy wares. Ad hunc modum after this sort vtimur we vs us the coun∣trey, & and domus an house: ut as Ego ibo I will go rus into the countrey.

HAec tria impersona∣lia these three imperso∣nals interest it maketh mat∣ter or forceth, refert it skil∣leth or booteh, & and est it concerneth, annectūtur are ioyned quibuslibet geniti∣vis to any genetiues praeter hos ablativos except those ablatiues foemininos femi∣nine. Meâ mine, tuâ thine, suâ his, nostrâ ours, vestrâ yours, & and cuiâ whose; ut as Interest it concerneth Magistratus a Magistrate, tueri to defend bonos the good, animaduertere in malos to punish the badde. Multum refert it is very profitable Christianae rei∣publicae for a Christian com∣mon wealth, Episcopos esse that the Bishops bee doctos learned & and pios godly Est it is the point prudentis of a wise man dissimulare to winke at multa many things: Tuâ refert it is ex∣pedient for thee nosce to know teipsum thy selfe. Ea caedes that murder potissi∣mum chiefly datur is impu∣ted crimini a crime ei to him cuiâ interfuit whom it concerned, non ei not to him cuiâ nihil interfuit whō it nothing cōcerned. Et also illi genitivi those genetiues ad∣jiciuntur are added. Tanti for so much as, magni for much, parvi for little, quan∣ticun{que} how great soever, tantidem for so much; ut as magni refert it is greatly to bee regarded quibuscum with whom vixeris thou leadest thy life. Tanti re∣fert it so greatly behooueth agere to do honesta honest things: vestri parvâ inter∣est it little toucheth you. Et and interest it belongeth ad meam laudem to my com∣mendation. Haec impersona∣lia these impersonals ferun∣tur are carried in dativum into the datiue case: Accidit it falleth out, certum est it is sure, contingit it chan∣ceth, constat it is manifestly knowne, confert it helpeth, competit it agreeth or is conuenient, conducit it is good and auaileable, conue∣nit
it is meet, placet it plea∣seth, displicet it displeaseth, dolet it grieueth, expedit it is expedient, euenit it happeneth, liquet it is cleare libet it contenteth or liketh, licet it is lawfull, nocet it hurteth, obest it hindereth, prodest it profiteth, prae∣stat it is better, patet it is open, stat it is resolued, re∣stat it remaineth, benefit it happeneth well, malefit it happeneth ill, satisfit it is satisfied, superest it remai∣neth, sufficit it is sufficient, vacat pro otium est there is leasure: ut as Conuenit mihi tecum I and thou a∣gree together.

Non vacat Io∣vi Iupiter is not at leasure adesse to be present exiguis rebus at small matters.

Haec impersonalia these impersonals, iuvat it delighteth, decet it becom∣meth, cum compositis with their compounds dele∣ctat it delighteth, oportet it behooueth, exigunt re∣quire▪ accusandi casum an accusatiue case: ut as iuvat me it delighteth mee ire to goe per Altum by Sea. De∣cet it becommeth vxorem a wife curare to looke to ae∣des her house. Dedecet it becommeth not viros men rixare to scolde muliebriter like women▪ Oportet it be∣houeth patrem familias an housholder esse to bee ven∣dacem a seller, non ema∣cem not a buyer: Praepo∣sitio verò but the preposi∣tion, Ad, additur is added propriè properly his to these, attinet it belongeth, pertinet it pertaineth, spe∣ctat it tendeth vnto or lyeth vpon, ut as Visnè will you me dicere▪ that I speake

Accusativus an accusatiue case cum ge¦nitivo with a genitiue sub∣jicitur is put after his im∣personalibus these imperso∣nals Poenitet it repenteth, taedet it irketh or wearieth, miseret it pittieth, misere∣scit it hath cōpassion on, pu∣det i shmeth, piget it grie∣ueth▪ ut as si if vixisset he had liued ad centesimum annum to the hundreth yeer nō poeniteret eum it wold not repent him senectutis suae of his old age.

Quidem inded piget it grieueth, pdetque and ashameth me mee fratris for my bro∣ther. Nonnulla imper∣sonalia some impersonalles remigrant do returne backe aliquando sometimes in personalia into personals: ut as Arbusta the shrubbes humilesque miricae and the low tamyrixses non ju∣vant delight not omnes all men Namque for mollia regna womanish kingdomes decent become animos tuos thy courage. Abor a tree producta ad frugem growne vp to beare fruit de∣lectat delighteth agrico∣lam the husbandman. Ne∣mo no man commiseres∣cit pittyetb miserorum the miserable. Non pudet istud Doeth not this thing shame te thee? Non pudent haec Doe not these things shame te thee?

Debet it ought pudere to shame sacerdotem the priest inscitiae of ignorance. Non potest it is not possible adsummū peruenire that the principall end should bee attained nisi but ex princi∣pijs by the beginnings. Ver∣bum impersonale a verbe impersonall passiuae vocis of the passiue voice obtinet hath similem casum the like case cum personalibus passivis with personalles passiues: ut as pugnatur ab hostibus the enemies fought constantèr without giuing ouer. Qui quidem casus which case indeede interdum sometimes non exprimitur is not expressed: ut as Discumbitur they sit downe strato ostro vpon scarlet spread abroad. Ver∣bum impersonale a verbe impersonall passiuae vocis of the passiue voice potest may accipi bee taken pro singulis personis for euery person utriusque numeri of both numbers indiffe∣renter indifferently ut as statur it is stood, id est, sto I stand, stas thou standest, stat hee standeth, stamus wee stand, statis yee stand, stant they stand: videlicet that is to say ex vi by the force obliqui of an oblique case adjuncti ioyned vnto it vt as Statur à me, id est, sto I stand: Statur ab illis, id est, stant they stand. PArticipia Participles regunt gouerne casus the cases Verborum of the verbes, à quibus whereof deriuantur they are deriued: ut as Tendens holding duplices palmas his two hands ad sidera to∣wards the skies, refert voce hee vttereth talia such things. Capellae the young goates referent domum will come home ubera their vdders distenta stret∣ched out lacte with milke. Diligendus to bee beloued ab omnibus of all Quam∣vis alhugh dativus the datiue case est is utatior more vsed in his in these: ut as Chremes restat
remaineth qui who est is ex∣orandus to be earnestly in∣treated mihi of me. Voces Participiorum Participles cùm when fiunt they are made nomina nounes, po∣stulant require genitivum a genitiue case; ut as Appe¦tēs greedie alieni of another mans goods. Profusus laush¦ing sui of his owne. Cupien∣tissimus most desirous tui of thee. Inexpertus vnexperi∣enced belli in warre. Indo∣ctus vnskilfull pilae at the ball. Exosus hating, pero∣sus bearing a deadly ha∣tred, pertaesus weary, signi∣ficant signify activè actiue∣ly, & and feruntur are carried in accusativum in∣to an accusatiue case: ut as Perosus vtterly detesting immūdam segnitiem foule idlenesse. Astronomus an Astronomer exosus that ab∣horreth mulieres women ad vnum in generall. Per∣taesus wearie of ignaviam suam his owne sloathful∣nesse. Exosus hated & and perosus hated vnto death etiam also leguntur are read cum dandi casu with a datiue ease videlicet that is significantia signify∣ing passivè passiuely: ut as Germani the Germās per∣osi sunt are vtterly deested Romanis of the Romanes. Exosus hated Deo of God. & sanctis and of the Saints. Natus borne, prognatus borne, satus sowne or sprung, cretus come vp or rowne, creatus created or formed, ortus risen, editus brought forth, in ablativum ferun∣tur gouerne an ablatiue case: ut as Bona an honest Dam∣sell prognata borne bonis parentibus of good parents. Sate O thou that art descen∣ded of sanguine the bloud Divûm of the Gods. Quo sanguine of what bloud cretus is he come? Venus o ta mari come of the Sea, praestat mare maketh the Sea better eunti for the pas∣sengers. Editus brought forth of terra the earth. EN & Ecce Aduerbia aduerbs demonstran∣di of shewing adiun∣guntu are ioyned fre∣quentius very often no∣minativo with a nomina∣tiue case, rariùs very sel∣dome
accusativo with an accusatiue: ut as En loe where is Priamus, etiam hic euen heere sua praemia his rewards sunt laudi are his praise. Ecce loe what is status noster our state tibi for thee. En see quatur a∣ras foure altas: Ecce see duas two tibi for thee, Daphni Daphnis, duoque altaria and two altars Phoebo for Phoebus. En & ecce exprobrantis ad∣uerbs of vpbraiding nectun∣tur are knit solum accusati∣vo to an accusatiue case only, ut as En animum see his disposition & mentem and his mind. En habitum see his fashion: Ecce autem but lo alterum another. Quae∣dam adverbia certaine ad∣uerbes loci of place, tempo∣ris of time, & and quanti∣tatis of quantity, recipiunt take genitivum a genitiue case post se after them. Loci of place; ut as vbi where, v∣binam in what place, nus∣quam no where: eò thither, longè by farre, quo whither, vbivis in anie place, hucci, ne what hither? ut as V∣bi gentium in what coun∣trey? Quo terrarum into what part of the world a∣biit is he gone? Inuenitur he is foūd nusquam loci in no place. Ventum est it is come to eò impudētiae that impudence. Temporis of time; ut as nunc now, tunc at that time, tum then, in∣terea in the meane while, pridiè the day before, po∣stridiè the day after: ut as Poteram I could do nil no∣thing tunc temporis at that time amplius more quàm than flere weepe. Inierant they entred pugnā the fight pridiè the day before eius diêi that day: pridiè the day before Calendarū seu Ca∣lēdas the Calends Quanti∣tatis of quātitie: ut as parū a little, satis enough, abun∣dè sufficient: ut as satis elo∣quentiae wards enow, sapi∣entiae parùm little wise∣dome. Audiuimus wee haue eard abundè fabularum tales enow. Instar signifiat signifieth aequiparationem equality or matching, mēsu∣ram measure, aut or simili∣tudinē likenes: ut as Aedi∣ficant they build equum an horse divina arte by the di∣uine
art Palladis of Pallas in∣star montis as bigge as a mountaine Philippus Phi∣lip solus alone mittitur is sent, in quo erat instar omnium auxiliorum who could doe as much as all hel∣pers besides. Sed but hoc scelus this wicked act ha∣bet hath pondus the weight & and instar the measure meriti of a reward. Hic in this place interdum som∣times praepositio the prepo∣sition ad apponitur is put to: ut as Vallis the dale clauditur is inclosed ad in∣star castrorum euen as a campe, Populus Romanus the people of Rome è parua origine from a small be∣ginning emicuit is growne vp ad instar to the likenesse tantae magnitudinis of so great bignesse: a alas minimè gentium no in no wise non faciam  will not doe it: Hic genitivus this genetiue case gentium additur is added festiuita∣tis causa for elegancie sake. Quaedam certaine aduerbes dativum ad∣mittunt gouerne a datiue case nominum of the nounes vnde wherof sunt deducta they are deriued: ut as Ve∣nit hee came obviam illi to meete him Nam for obuius illi to meee him dicitur is spoken. Canit he singeth si∣militer huic lik this man. Et and vivit hee liueth inu∣tiliter vnprofitably sibi to bimselfe. Sedet hee sitteth propinquiùs nearer tibi thee qum than mihi mee▪ Et also hi dativi these da∣tiues sunt are adverbiales like aduerbes: Tempori by time, luci by day, vesperi in the euening: ut as Venit hee came tempore by time quod which est is primum the chiefest omnium rerum of all things. Occidit hee slew hominem a man luci by day. Vidi I saw it af∣feri brought ad vos to you vesperi in the euening Sunt there are some quae which accusandi casum admit∣tunt gouerne an accusatiue case praepositionis of the preposition, unde whereof sunt profecta they are com: ut as Castra the tents moventur are mooued propriùs nearer vrbem the Citie. Mauri the Moores

Cedò fla∣gitantis an aduerbe of one earnestly desiring exhiberi to be giuen or presented regit gouerneth accusativum an accusatiue case, ut as Cedò appoint quemv is arbitrum any arbitratour. Adverbia aduerbs diversitatis of di∣uersitie, aliter otherwise se∣cus otherwie, & and illa duo these two, antè post▪ non rarò inueniutur are not seldome found cum abla∣tivo wh an ablatiue case, ut as Multo aliter much o∣therwise; Paulò secus little otherwise: Multò ante much before: longè secus farre otherwise. Venit hee came longò pòst tempore a long time after. Paulò post, a little after. Nisi ex∣cept & also ipsa they sunt censenda bee to bee thought potiùs rather aduerbia aduerbs. Aduerbia aduerbs comparatiui & superla∣tivi gradus of the compara∣tiue and superlatiue degree casus admittunt gouerne the case assuetos accustomed subservire to bee set after comparativis the compara∣tiues & and superlativis superlatiues, sicut as est it is praeceptum taught ante before: ut as acces∣sit hee came popriùs nea∣rer illo then the other. Dixit hee spke optimè bes omnium of all Legi∣mus wee reade proprius nearer ad deos to the Gods, & and propriùs à terris the lesse spce off from the earth. Paulo plus some∣what more trecenta ve∣hicula than three hndred chariots amissa sunt are lost. Plus more duo mil∣lia hominum than two thousand men, caesa slains eo die that day. Plus more reperitur is found junctum ioyned nomina∣tivo to a nominatiue case, genitivo a genitiue, accu∣sativo an accusatiue, & and ablativo an ablatiue: ut as Plus more quàm than quinquaginta hominum fiftie men ceciderunt were slaine. Acies the armie abierat was gone paulo plus a little more quin∣gentos passus than fiue hundred pases. Fui I haue beene in nave in the
ship triginta dies thirtie dayes at or plus eò more then that. QVibus modis with what moodes verbo∣rum of verbes quae adverbia what aduerhs cō∣gruant do agree. Vbi when postquàm after that, & and cum when aduerbia aduerbes temporis of time apponuntur are put inter∣dum sometimes indicati∣vis verbis with indicatiue verbs, interdùm verò and somtimes subiunctivis with subiunctiues, ut as Vbi when dedit hee gaue haec dicta these words. Vbi when nos wee laverimus haue washed, si if voles you will, lavato wash you. Cùm when faciam vitula I shall sacrifice a yong Cow pro fru∣gibus for corne, ipse venito come thou.

Hîc in this place prius the former videtur seemeth esse to bee aduerbium an aduerbe, posterius the lat∣ter coniunctio a coniuncti∣on. Donec pro for quamdiu so long as gaudet reioyceth indicativo with an indica∣tiue moode: ut as Donec so long as eram I was sospes safe.

Ne pro for non net inseruit caeteris modis gouerns other moods. Aduerbia aduerbes casu accedente if a case bee added transeunt in prae∣positiones are turned into prepositions: ut as vacuus viator the moneylesse trauel∣ler cantabit will sing co∣ram latrone before a thiefe.

Etsi albeit, tametsi although, etiamsi although, quan∣quam howbeit, in princi∣pio in the beginning oratio∣nis of a sentence postulant require indicativos modos indicatiue moodes, in me∣dio in the middle, saepi∣us very often subiuncti∣vos subiunctiues Quam∣vis although, & and licèt although, frequentiùs more often subiunctivos subiun∣ctiues; ut as Etsi although nihil noui no newes affe∣rebatur was brought, Quanquàm although ani∣mus my minde horret is a∣gast meminisse to remem∣ber. mvis although Graecia Greece miretur admires at Elysios campos the Flysian fieldes.
