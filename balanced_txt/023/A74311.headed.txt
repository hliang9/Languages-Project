AN ACT FOR The present Examining and Stating the Accompts of the Officers and Soldiers now in the Parliaments service within this NATION. THe Commons of England assembled in Parliament, taking into consideration the Arrears of pay to Of∣ficers and Soldiers now in their service in this Na∣tion, within the Establish∣ment for England or Ireland, due for their service in any Army, or Garison, or under any General or Commander in the ser∣vice of the Parliament within this Nation (other then in the late new Model under the now Lord Fairfax) and being resolved to have their Accompts for such services forthwith examined and stated, and Debenters, with visible security given for such Arrears (as well as for those under the said new Model, which are already provided for;) and considering, That the said Officers and Soldiers, being many of them engaged for the service of Ireland, and the rest attending daily service within this Nation, cannot without pre∣judice to the publique, leave their Charges or
Colours, to prosecute and perfect severally the stating of their accompts before the Committees or Commissioners authorized for stating the Ac∣compts of the Soldiery; and also considering the delay that would be to the dispatch thereof in any other way then as hereafter followeth, Do therefore enact and ordain, and be it Enacted and Ordained by this present Parliament, and by authority thereof, That the Accompts of the said Officers and Soldiers, for any such Arrears as aforesaid (not stated and certified heretofore by Order or Direction of Parliament) shall be forthwith taken, examined, stated and certified by the several persons, and in the maner and form hereafter expressed; that is to say, For the Forces formed in Regiments; the Field Officers of the respective Regiments, or any one of them, with the respective Captains, or chief Officers present of their several Troops or Companies, shall take, examine, and state the said Accompts, and certifie the said Arrears of the inferior Of∣ficers and Soldiers of the several Troops or Companies under them respectively; and for the Captains, or present chief Officers of the seve∣ral Troops and Companies, and the Staff-Officers of such of the said Regiments as are designed, and do engage to go for Ireland, the respective Field-Officers, or any two of them, shall take, examine, and state their Accompts, and certifie their said Arrears; and the Colonels shall do the like for the Field-Officers under them of their respective Regiments: And for such Officers, and others of the Train of Ar∣tillery as go for Ireland, the Lieutenant General, and Comptroller of the Train, shall examine and state their said accompts, and certifie their said arrears; and for such of the General Offi∣cers
and Staff-Officers of the Army as go for Ireland, the Lord General, or such other persons as he shall appoint and intrust for that purpose, shall examine and state their said accompts, and the Lord General shall certifie their said arrears; But for such of the said Forces as go not for Ire∣land, the said accompts of all the Captains, or present chief Officers of the several Troops and Companies, and of the Field and Staff-officers of the several Regiments, as also of the Train-Officers, and the General Officers, and Staff-officers of the Army, and also the accompts of the Colonels of those Regiments that go for Ireland, shall be taken, examined and stated, and De∣benters shall be given them for their said arrears by the Committee for the Army, or by such other persons as are or shall be by them, or otherwise by authority of Parliament appointed thereun∣to. And for the more certain and effectual per∣formance of this work, Be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That every person claiming any such arrears as aforesaid, and de∣siring to have his accompts stated, and certified for the same, shall produce for every such arrear so claimed respectively, a certificate under the Hand and Seal of his Captain or Lieutenant, or some other Commission-Officer superior to himself, or (in case of Service in particular Counties) then under the hands of two or more of that Committee, under whom he pretends such arrear became due respectively; expressing in what Troop or Company, and of what Regi∣ment, or in what Garison or Counties, and for what space of time, and in what year or years of our Lord such his Service was, and to the best of their knowledge what pay he recei∣ved for the same, or what remained due to
him in arrear at his discharge; and also shall make Oath, that he hath not used, nor is privy to any fraud, deceit, or indirect dealing, in or for the framing or procuring of such certi∣ficate, and that to the best of his knowledge such Certificate is true and just; and that he hath not otherwise had his Accompts stated, or any De∣benter given before for the same Arrear so claim∣ed, other then what he shall then produce, ac∣knowledge and deliver in to the said Officers; and he shall also upon the same Oath, discover whether he or any other for him to his know∣ledge, hath at any time received any moneys, or any thing else since his discharge from that ser∣vice, toward satisfaction of the Arrears claim∣ed thereupon, and how much hath been so re∣ceived; and in the same Oath he shall also dis∣cover, whether he hath at any time received any other money or goods, for or under pretence of the publique service, for which to his best knowledge or remembrance he ought to be, and yet remain∣eth accomptable to the State, and for such mo∣ney or goods (if he hath not already accompted) he shall then discharge himself by a true ac∣compt; to the truth of which accompt, he shall make oath in such form as hereafter follow∣eth; viz. I A. B. do swear, That the Accompt by me given in at this time, is true and just, to the best of my knowledge and remembrance, and that therein I have not wittingly concealed any money or goods, which to my best remem∣brance I have received or taken for the use of the Parlia∣ment or Commonwealth, for which I am justly accompat∣ble to the State; neither have I to my best remembrance wilfully imbezelled, or to my private use or benefit, con∣verted any such money or goods received by me for the
use of the publique, and for which I stand accomptable as aforesaid, other then such, or to such value as I have charged my self with in my said Accompt. So help me God. And such certificates, together with such oathes of the parties producing the same, and claiming arrears thereupon as aforesaid, shall be a sufficient ground for the Officers and others authorized as aforesaid, to proceed upon in the stating of all and every the said accompts respectively, and in the certifying of the arrears thereupon as is hereafter directed: And because it may possibly fall out in some cases, That such certificates as aforesaid cannot be had or pro∣duced, by reason of the death of some, or refusal of other Officers from whom such certificates should be had, or by their being disabled to make such Certificates, either through their defection from the Parliaments Cause, or their departure and absence out of the Land, or else by reason of the loss of Muster-Rolls or Certificates through the many casualties of War; in such cases the Field-Officers, and others intrusted with the stating of accompts as aforesaid respe∣ctively, after strict enquiry into the truth of the matter, and taking the Oath of the party con∣cerned, that his case is such; and after examina∣tion of him, or any other upon Oath, to what other circumstances they shall think fit to satis∣fie themselves, that the case is such, shall or may admit the Oath of the party, and (if he be en∣gaged for Ireland) of one witness, or otherwise of two lawful witnesses, taken either before the said Officers themselves, or before any Iustice of Peace or Committee, and from him or them certified concerning the time of such parties Ser∣vice in any Garison or other Army then the
said new Model; and concerning the arrear due to him for the same, as a sufficient evidence to proceed upon, and state his accompts, and certifie his arrears for the same, the party himself ma∣king Oath also to such other questions & things concerning the truth of his accompt, as is afore in other cases directed; and for the better disco∣very of the truth in or concerning any such ac∣compts as aforesaid, the said Field-officers, and others intrusted in this service, are hereby autho∣rized, to administer an Oath or Oathes to all and every person and persons, with whom they shall have to do, in relation to the stating of any the accompts in all such cases, and concerning such matters or things where any Oath is re∣quired or directed as aforesaid: and all Officers of War, Muster masters, Secretaries, Auditors, Treasurers, accomptants, & other persons what∣soever, that now have, or formerly had relation to the affairs of the late Wars, are hereby re∣quired, upon request of any Officer or Soldier concerned, and addressing himself to them, or upon request under the hand of any the Field-Officers or others intrusted as aforesaid, shall testifie under their Hands and Seals according to their best knowledge, any thing within their cognizance that may further or conduce to the better ascertaining of the said accompts, or any of them.
