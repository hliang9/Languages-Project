Bloudy news from Germany or the peoples misery by famine, Being an example of Gods just judgement on one Harto a Noble man in Germany of the town of Ments who when the people were decayed (by reason of a hard famine) he gathered the poorer sort into a Barn, and burned them (saying these are but as Rats that eat up all and do nothing else) but the all seeing God left not this wickedness unpunished; for he was so sore beset and beat with Rats, that his Castles top was never af∣ter free of them, and at last devoured by them. Tune of, Chievy Chose. WHen as my mind was fully bent some story for to rhime, Amongst all others none I found so fitting for the time, That which hereafter you shall hear may well compared be, Vnto a Song of joyful news in pain and misery. Some write of Cupid and his bow with arrows sharp and kéen, To pierce the tender hearts of them that are but young and green, Another loves of War to prate which is by Weapons done, And acted is by Sea and Land by Ship and roaring Gun. Another saith he was in love once with a dainty Maid, But now he hates her cruelty when's got her maiden-head, Another muse with Hand and Pen describes a baudy rhime, But I will tell by true report what's done in former time. One Harto that in Mentz did dwell a Clergy Man was he, In that same Town Arch Bishop was of famous Germany. His charity was too to cold and nothing did abound, He to the poor a Miser was which made a rumour sound.
Now in his days there happened a famine on the earth And after that there did ensue a very pinching dearth This cruel man began to think he wanted his revennue, And many a Noble Man there was that was not worth a penny. He sent for all the Beggers round and put them in a Barn, And set them all in order strait as though he meant no harm, He sent his servants fire to bring for quickly they should burn, They with a howling noise cry'd out and dolefully did mourn. What ail the men (quoth he at length) like Rats and Mice you be That eat up all my sustenance and nothing give to me, When all my friends through famine want and are gone to decay Why should I give you any more but burn you quite away. These harmless men he put to death as Cain with Able did But from the Lord full true it is there's nothing can be hid: Their bloud did call unto the Lord out of the ground and dust The Lord he hard attentively In judgement pure and just. He burnt them all both young and old both man and Wife likewise, He spared none nor did respect the foolish or the wise, For why his mind was satisfi'd and bloody mind content, To see them all thus on a flame tho others did lament. Yet God above did not forget this wicked unjust deed, For after that from Rats and mice he never could be freed, his Castles top no service did no Cats nor cruel Dogs, For why they came abundantly much like the Egyptian Frogs. They wasted all his cash and pelf which he laid up in store, Tho he so surely locked up by dosen and by score, These Vermine so did multiply encreasing day by day, They haunted all the rooms about the Chamber where he lay. Nay more then that himself was slain as he lay on his Bed, And when his Frinds all did come in they found him to be dead, Thus God did punish him at length That was so bad and cruel, he put their Bodies in the fire and used them for fewel. And they did gnaw his Coat of Arms out of the graven Stone, and ever where they found his name of Letters they left none, This I do wish may be a guide to them that are so high, That never think upon the poor that are in misery. Nay were it but that they were so like Niggards in their Wealth, So they would not defraud the poor or put them unto death, Wherefore let all with one accord think good for to amend, So shall my Pen begin to rest and lastly make an end.
