SERIOVS CONSIDERATIONS for repressing of the increase of IESVITES, PRIESTS, and PAPISTS, without shedding of Blood. Written by Sir R. C. and Presented to King IAMES of happie Memory. Printed Anno Dom. MDCXLI.
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE REPRESSING of Priests, Jesuites, and Re∣cusants, without drawing of Blood. I Am not ignorant, that this later Age hath brought forth a swarm of busie heads, which measure the great my∣steries of State by the Rule of their self-con∣ceited wisdome; But if they would cōsider, that the Common-wealth governed by grave Coun∣sellors, is like unto a Ship directed by a skilfull Pylot, to whom the necessities of occasions and grounds of Reason, why hee steereth the Helme to this or that point of the Compasse, are better knowne, then to those that stand a∣loofe off; they would perhaps be more sparing if not more wary in their Resolutions. For my owne particular, J must confesse, that J am naturally too much inclined to his
opinion, who once said; Qui bene latuit, bene vixit, and freshly recalling to mind, the say∣ing of Functius to his Friend at the houre of his untimely Death: Disce, meo exemplo, mandato munere fungi: Et fuge ceu Pestem, . J could easily forbeare to make my hand∣writing the Record of any opinion, which ne∣verthelesse I protest to maintaine, rather deli∣beratively then by the way of a conclusive as∣sertion; Therefore without wasting precious time any longer, with needlesse Prologue, I will briefly set downe the question in the termes following: Whether it be more expedient to suppresse Po∣pish practises, against the due Allegiance to his Majestie, by the strict execution of the Lawes Touching Jesuites, and Seminary Priests, or to restraine them to close Prison during life, if no reformation following. The doubt propounded consisting of Two Branches, necessarily requireth to be distinctly handled, that by comparing either part the conveniency, mentioned in the Question, may be cleered with more facilitie. 1. In favour of the first Division there are not a few, who grounding themselves on an ancient Proverbe, , A dead man bites not: Affirme that such are dangerous to be preser∣ved
alive, who being guilty, condemned, and full of feare, are likely for puchase of life and liberty, to ingage their utmost in desperate ad∣ventures against their King and Countrey. 2. No lesse is it to be feared, that while the Sword of Justice is remisse in cutting off hai∣nous offenders, against the dignity of the Crowne, the misled Papall multitude in the in∣terim, may enter into a jealous suspence, whe∣ther that forbearance proceed from the feare of exasperating their desperate humours, or that it is now become questionable, whether the execution of their Priests be simply for matter of State, or pretended quarrell for Religion. 3. And whereas in a remedilesse inconveni∣ence, it is lawfull to use the extremity of Lawes against some few, that many by terrour of the Example may be reformed; what hope can there be, that clemency may tame their hearts, who interpret his Majesties grace in Transpor∣ting their Priests out of this Realme to be a meere shift, to rid the Prisons of those whom Conscience could not condemne of any capitall crime. 4. Neither are their vaunting whisperings to be neglected, by which they seeke to con∣firme the fearefull Soules of their party, and to inveigle the ignorant, doubtfull, or disconten∣ted persons; for if the glorious extolling of their powerfull Friends, and the expecting of a golden day be suffered, to winne credit with
the meaner sort, the relapse cannot be small, or the meanes easie to reforme the Errour, with∣out a generall combustion of the State. 5. Let experience speake somewhat in this behalfe, which hath evidently discryed within the current of few yeares; That the forbea∣rance of Severity hath multiplied their Roll in such manner, that it remaines as a Corrasive to thousands of his Majesties well affected Subjects. 6. To what purpose serves it, to muster the names of the Protestants, or to vaunt them to be ten for one of the Roman faction, as if bare figures of numeration could prevaile against an united party resolved and advised aforehand, how to turne their faces with assurance unto all dangers, while in the meane time, the Pro∣testants nestling in vaine security, suffer the weed to grow up that threateneth their bane and mercilesse ruine? 7. Sometimes the Oath of Supremacie cho∣ked their presumptuous imaginations, and yet could not that infernall smoake be wholly smothered, nor the Locusts issuing there-out, be cleansed from the face of this Land. Now that the Temporall power of the King, contai∣ned in the Oath of Allegeance, is by the Papall Sea, and many of the Adorers thereof, impu∣dently avowed to be unlawfull; shall the broachers of such Doctrine be suffered to live, yea to live and be received of us, for whose
destruction they groane daily? 8. To be a right Popish Priest, in true En∣glish sense, is to beare the Character of a disloy∣all Renegade, of his naturall obedience to his So∣veraigne; Whom, if by connivence he shall let slip or chastice with a light hand; what immunity may not Trayterous delinquents in lesser degrees expect or challenge after a sort, in Equity and Justice. 9 If there were no receivers there would be no Theeves: Likewise, if there were no Har∣bourers of the Iesuites, it is to be presumed that they would not trouble this Isle with their presence; Therefore Rigor must be ex∣tended against the Receiver, that the Jesuite may be kept out of doores; were it then indif∣ferent Justice to hang vp the Accessary and let the Principall goe free; namely to suffer the Priest to draw his breath at length, while the entertainer of him vnder his Roofe submits his body to the Executioners hand? Without doubt if it be fit to forbeare the chiefe, it will be necessary to receive the second offender in∣to protection. Wherewith a mischiefe must ensue of continuall expence; and scandalous restraint of so great a number. 10. Reputation is one of the Principall Ar∣teryes of the Common-wealth, which Maxime is so well knowne to the Secretaries of the Pa∣pacie; That by private Forgeries and publicke impressions of Calumniations, they endeavour
to wound us in that vitall part; Howsoever therefore, some few of that stampe being bet∣ter tempered then their fellowes in defence of this present government, have not spared to affirme; That tyranny is vnjustly ascribed there∣vnto, for so much as freedome of Conscience, after a sort, may be redeemed for money; Notwith∣standing there want not many Pamphleters of their side, who opprobriously cast in our teethes, the converting of the Penalty, in∣flicted on Recusants, and refusers of the oath of alleageance from the Kings Exchequer to a particular purse: surely we cannot presume that these Libellers may be disswaded from spitting out their venome maliciously against vs, when they shall see their Priests mewed vp without further processe of Law: For ei∣ther they will attribute this calme dealing to the Justice of their cause, the strength of their party or patience, or that tract of time hath discovered our Lawes importing overmuch sharpenesse in good policy, to be thought fit∣ter for abrogation, by non vsance, then repea∣led by a publicke decree. 11. Moreover it is fore-thought by some, that if these Seminaries be onely restrayned, that they may prove hereafter like a snake, kept in the Bosome, such as Bonner, Gardiner, and o∣thers of the same Livery shewed themselves to be after Liberty, obtained in Queene Maries
dayes; And if the losse of their Ghostly Fa∣thers agrieve them, it is probable, that they will take Armes sooner, and with more courage to free the Living, then to set vp a Trophie to the dead. 12. How soever the Iesuites Band is knowne in their Native soyle, to be defective in many respects, which makes them vnderlings to the Protestants; as in authority, armes and the Protection of the Lawes, which is all in all: Neverthelesse, they insinuate themselues to for∣raigne Princes, favouring their party, with pro∣mises of strange assistance at home; if they may be well backed from abroad; To which purpose they have divided the Inhabitants of this Realme into foure Sects; Whereof Ranking their Troupes in the first place (as due to the pretended Catholiques) they assu∣med a full fourth part to their property, and of that part againe they made a Subdivision into two portions; namely of those that open∣ly renounced the established Church of En∣gland, and others whose certaine number could not be assigned: Because they frequented our service, our Sacramēts, reserving their hearts to their Lord God the Pope. The second party they allot to the Protestants, who retaine yet, as they say, some Reliques of their Church; The third Ranke and largest, was left vnto the Puritans, whom they hate deadly,
in respect, that they will hold no indifferent quarter with Papistry. The fourth and last ma∣niple; They assigne to the Politicians: Huomini (say they) Senza Dio, & Senz ani∣ma: Men without feare of God, or regard of their Soules; Who busying themselves onely with matters of State, retaine no sense of Re∣ligion: without doubt, if the Authors of this partition have cast their account aright, we must confesse, the latter Broode is to be ascri∣bed properly vnto them; For if the vndermi∣ning of the Parliament House, the scandalizing of the King in Print, who is Gods annoynted; And the refusall of naturall obedience, be workes of those that neither stand in awe of God or Conscience; well may the Papists boast, that they are assured of the first number; and may presume likewise of the lasts friend∣ship, when occasion shall be offered; For the preventing of which combination; it is a sure way to cut off the Heads; that should tye the knot, or at least, to brand them with a marke in the forehead, before they be dismissed, or after the opinion of others, to make them vnwel∣come to the faeminine Sexe; which now with great fervency imbraceth them. These are for the most part Arguments ven∣ted in ordinary discourse, by many who sup∣pose a Priests breath to be contagious in our English Ayre; others there are, who maintaine the second part of the question, with reasons
not vnworthy of observance. Death is the end of Temporall woes; But it may in no wise be accounted the grave of memory; Therefore howsoever it is in the power of Ju∣stice to suppresse the person of a man, the opi∣nion for which he suffered (conceived truly or vntruely in the hearts of a multitude) is not subject to the edge of any swor how sharpe or keene soever: I confesse that the Teeth are soone blunted, that byte only out of the malice of a singular faction: But where poyson is dif∣fused through the veynes of a Common-wealth with intermixture of Blood, good and bad, se∣paration is to be made rather by vacuation, then by present incision: The greatest byter of a State is Envie ioyned with thirst of Re∣venge, which seldome declares it selfe in plaine Colours, vntill a Jealousie conceived of perso∣nall dangers breaketh out into desperate resolu∣tions: Here comes it to passe, that when one mal-contented member is grieved, the rest of the body is sensible thereof; neither can a Priest or Iesuite be cut off without a generall murmure of their Secretaries, which being confident in their number, secretly arme for opposition, or confirmed with their Martyrs blood, (as they are perswaded) resolve by pati∣ence and sufferance to glorifie their cause; and to merit heaven. Doe we not daily see, that it is easier to confront a private Enemy, then a society or Corporation: And that the hatred
of a State is more immortall then the spleene of a Monarchy; Therefore except it be de∣monstrated, that the whole Roman City which consists not of one broode, but of a succession of Persons may be cut off at the first stroake, as one entrei head, I see no cause to thinke our state secured by sitting on the skirts of some few Seminaries, leaving in the meane time a multitude of snarlers abroad, who alrea∣dy shew their Teeth and onely waite opportu∣nity to bite fiercely. I will not deny, that whom we feare, we commonly hate; provi∣ded alwaies, that no merit hath interceeded a reconciliation; For there is great difference between hatred conceived against him that will take away the life, and him that may justly doe it, and yet in Clemency forbeares to put it in effect, For the latter breedeth re∣verent awe, whereas the former subjecteth to servile feare, alwaies accompanied with desire of innovations. And although it hath bin affir∣med of the Church of Rome; Quod Pontifici∣um genus semper crudele; Neverthelesse out of Charity, let us hope that all Devils are not so black as they are paynted; Some or per∣haps many of them there are, whom Consci∣ence or in default thereof, pure shame of the world will constrain to confesse, that his Ma∣jestie most graciously distinguisheth the Theory of Popery, from the Active part there∣of; as being naturally inclined; Parvis pec∣catis
veniam, magnis sever itatem commodare; nec poena semper, sed Saepius poenitentia Contentus esse. 2. Mistaking of punishments, legally inflicted, commonly proceeds from fond pit∣ty, or the interest which we have in the same cause, both which beget blind partiality. Ad∣mit then that the Papall side, affecting merit, by compassion may be meerely touched, with the restraint of their Seminaries; that cannot be denyed, I hope, except they had the hearts of Tygers; that in humanity they will pre∣ferre their ease of durance before the Rigor of death: And albeit that PARSONS, BELLAR∣MINE, and the POPE himselfe, constraine their spirituall Children, to thrust their fin∣gers into the fire, by refusing the oath of allea∣geance: Notwithstanding we have many Te∣stimonies in Judiciall Courts, and printed Bookes, that the greater part of them are of that Theban Hunters mind, who would rather have seen his Dogs cruell Acts, then have felt them, to his owne cost. Garnet himselfe also in one of his se∣cret Letters lamented, that after his death, hee should not be enroled amongst the Martyrs: Because that no matter of Religion was objected against him, yet it plainely appeares in his demeanure; That hee would gladly have survived
the possibility of that glory, if any such hope had remained, neither is it to be presumed, that being in prison, he would ever have conceived that we durst not touch his Reverence, or that the Law was remisse, which had justly condem∣ned him and left his life to the Kings mercy, it was the distance of the place and not persons, that interpreted the sending over Seas of the Priests, to be a greater Argument of their in∣nocency, then of his Majesties forbearance: For had Father Parsons himselfe bin Coram no∣bis, his song would rather have been of mer∣cy then Justice. It is truely said, that we are all instructed, Better by examples then precepts; Therefore if the Lawes printed, & indictments recorded cannot controle the Calumniations of those that wilfully will mistake Treason for Religion, By the execution of 2. or 3. of that Backbiting number, I doubt not, but the questi∣on may readily be decided, Nam{que} immedica∣bile vulous ense recidendum est, ne pars sincera trahatur. To dally with Pragmaticall Papists, especi∣ally with those that by their example & coun∣sell pervert his Majesties Subjects, I hold it a poynt of meere Injustice: For what comfort may the good expect when the bad are by con∣nivence freed to speake and imboldened, to put their disloyall thoughts in execution? For ex∣plaining therefore of my meaning, it is ne∣cessary
to have a regard vnto the nature of the Kings Liege people, that are to be reformed by example of Iustice, & other forrayners who will we, nill we, must be censurers of our actions. It hath been truly observed, that the Nations of Europe, wch are most remote from Rome, are more superstitiously enclined to the dregs of that place, then the neare neighbours of Italy: whether that humour proceed from the cōplexi∣on of the Northern bodies wch is naturally more retentive of old Customes, then hotter Regions; or that the vices of the City, seated on 7. Hils, are by crafty Ministers of that Sea, concealed from the vulgar sort, Ilist not now discusse, but most certaine it is, that the people of this Isle exceed the Romans in zeale of their profession: Insomuch, that in Rome it selfe, I have heard the English Fugitives taxed by the name of Pichia∣petti Inglesi. Now as our Countrymen take su∣rer holdfast of Papall Traditions, then others: so are they naturally better fortified with a cou∣rage to endure death for the maintenance of that cause; For this Clymate is of that tem∣perature, out of which Vegetius holdeth it fit∣test, to choose a valiant souldier, where the heart finding it self provided of plenty of blood to sustain sodain defects, is not so soone appre∣hensive of death or dangers, as where the store∣house of blood being small, every hazard ma∣keth pale Cheeks and trembling hands (Angli) say ancient writers, bello intrepidi, nec mortis
sensu deterrentur: And thereunto Botero the I∣talian beareth witnesse in his relations of many strangers, therefore comming out of for∣raine parts, among the Rarities of England, desi∣red to see whether report hath not bin too la∣vish in affirming that our condemned persons yeeld their bodies to death with cheerfulnesse. And were it not that by daily experience, we can call our selves to witnesse of this truth, J could produce the Reverend Judge Fortescue, who in commendation of our English Lawes, made suteable, as he well observeth, to the in∣bred conditions of the Inhabitants of this Soyle, avoweth that the English people in tryall for criminall causes are not compelled by Tortures to confesse, as in other Nations it is vsed, for as much as the quality of the English is known to be lesse fearefull of death, then of Torments, for which cause, if the Torments of the Civill Law were offered to an innocent person in En∣gland, he would rather yeeld himselfe guilty and suffer death, then endure the horror of lin∣gring paines; Insulani plerum{que} fures (saith one) and so true it is, that this Country is stai∣ned with that imputation, notwithstanding that many are put to death, to the end that others, by their fall, might learne in time to beware: if then it doth appeare that terror prevailes not to keep men from offences, which are condem∣ned by Law and Conscience, what assurance can there be to scare those who are constantly sa∣tisfied in their minds, that their sufferings are
either expresly or by implication for matter of Religion and health of their Soules; In such a case to threaten death to Englishmen; Quibus nihil interest humive, sublimive putrescant, is a matter of small consequence, Purpuratis Gal∣lis, Italis aut Hispanis ista minitari, to a set∣led resolution of death, menaces to prolong a wea∣risome life, prevaile much more in such cases. Rightly did Clement the 8th consider that by burning two Englishmen in Rome for supposed Heresie, he rather impaired his cause, then bet∣tered it; Jnsomuch that many present at the resolute death of Mr. Marsh, who was brought to dust in Campo di Santa Fiore, spared not to proclaime him for a Martyr, carried away of his ashes for a Relique, & wished their soules in the same place with his; which newes brought to the Popes eare, caused him (as it was bruted a∣bout in Rome) solemnly protest; That none of the English Nation should publiquely from that time forward, be consumed with fire; On the o∣ther side, if we read the volumes written in praise of their Priests constancy, their Martyrologie or Kalender of Martyrs, and Path way of salvati∣on, as it were chalked out vnto the Papists, by sacrificing their lives for the Pope; we shall find that by taking away of one, we have confirmed and invited many; whereof I could give particular in∣stances, if I thought any scruple were made in that point. As for forraigne parts, which hold with the Papall Supremacy, it is cleere, that they
will be severe and partiall Judges in this cause; For albeit that here in England it is well known to all true and loyall Subjects; that for matter of Roman Doctrine, no mans life is directly cal∣led into question: But that their disobedience in reason of State, is the only motive of their prosecution; Neverthelesse where a great Can∣ton of Christendome is rooted in a contrary o∣pinion, & things in this world are for the most part esteemed by outward appearance; this Land cannot escape malicious scandals, neithet shal there be want of Colledges to supply their faction with Seminaries. Therefore again, and again I say, that if the state of the question were so set that it were possible by a generall execu∣tion of the Priests and their Adherents, to end the controversie, J could in some sort with bet∣ter will subscribe thereunto; But seeing J find little hope in that course, J hold it safer to be ambitious of the victory, which is purchased with lesse losse of blood, and to proceed, as Tul∣ly teacheth his Orator; who when he cannot whol∣ly overthrow his Adversary, yet ought he to doe it in some part, and with all endeavour to confirme his owne party in the best manner that may be. 4. He that forbeareth to sowe his ground in expectance of good winde, or a favourable Moone, commonly hath a poore Crop, and a leane Purse; So shall it fare with this state, if private whis∣perings of discōtented persons, that neverlearnt to speak well, be too nicely regarded; yet ought
they not to be slightly set at nought, lest our credit grow light, even in the Ballance of our dearest friends. The Papasticall Libels informe against vs, as if we were desirous to grow fat with sucking of their Blood, the very walls of their Seminary Colledge at Rome, are bedaw∣bed with their lying phansies, and in every cor∣ner, the Corner-creepers leave some badge of their malicious spleen against vs, crying out of cruelty and persecution: But if the penalty of death be changed into a simple indurance of Prison, what moate can they find in our eyes to pull out; or with what Rhetorick can they defend their obstinate malipertnesse, wch with repaying vs ill for good, deserve to have coales of indignation powred vpon their heads, Visne muliebre consilium, said Livia to Augustus, let severity sleepe a while, and try what alteration the pardoning of Cinna mayprocure; The Em∣perour harkened to her Counsell, and thereby found his Enemies mouthes stopt, and the ma∣lice abated; some there are perchance, that will terme this Clemency, innovation, and vouch the Precedent of that City, who per∣mitted none to propound new Lawes, that had not a Corde about their necks, ready for ven∣geance, if it were found voprofitable: But let such Stoyicks know, that there is great diffe∣rence between the penning of a new Law, and advise given for the manner of executing it; neither by their Leaves, are all Jnnovations to
be rejected; For divine Plato teacheth vs, that in all Common wealths, vpon just grounds, there ought to be some changes; And that Statesmen therein must behave themselves like skilfull Musitians, Qui artem Musices non mutant, sed musices modum. 5. That an evil weede groweth fast, by ex∣ample of the new Catholiques increase is cleerely convinced; But he that will ascribe this generation simply to his Majesties Heroi∣call vertue of Clemency, argueth out of the falla∣cy which is called Ignoratio Elenchi. Was not the zeale of many cooled towards the last end of Queene Elizabeths Raigne, hath not the im∣pertinent heate of some of our owne side be∣reft us of part of our strength? And the Papa∣cy with tract of time gotten a hard skinne on their Consciences; Parva metu primo, mox se∣se attollit in altum: But if we will with a bet∣ter insight, behold how this great quantity of Spawne is multiplied, we must especially ascribe the cause thereof to their Priests, who by their deaths prepare and assure more to their sect, then by their lives they could ever perswade. It were incivility to distrust a friend, or one that hath the shew of an honest man, if he will franckly give his word, or confirme it with a sacred Oath: But when a protestation is made upon the least gaspe of life, it is of great effect, and possesseth those that cannot gain say it upon
their owne knowledge. The number of these Priests, which now a dayes come to make a Tragi∣call conclusion, is not great; Yet as with one Seale many Pattents are Sealed, so with the losse of few lives numbers of wavering spirits may be gained, Sanguis martyrum semen Eccle∣siae; And though these Priests having indeed a disadvantagious cause, are in very deed but counterfeit Shadowes of Martyrs unto a true vnderstanding, yet will they be reputed for such by those that lay their soules to pawne vnto their Doctrine, with whom, if we list to con∣tend by multitude of voyces, we shall be cryed down, without all peradventure; For the gate of their Church is wide, and many there are that enter thereinto. 6. By divers meanes, it is possible to come to one and the selfe-same end; seeing that then the some of our welwishings is all one; Name∣ly that Popish Priests may have no power to doe harme; It is not impertinent to try sundry pathes, which may leade vs to the perfecting of our desires. Politicians distinguish; Inter rempub: constitutā & rempub: constituend: Ac∣cording to the severall natures whereof, Statists are to dispose of their Counsels and Ordinan∣ces. Were now the Rhemists and Romulists new hatched out of the shell, the for∣mer course of severity might soone bury
their opinions with their persons; But sithence the disease is inveterated, va∣riety of Medicines is Judiciously to be applyed. The Romans did not punish all Crimes of one and the selfe-same nature with extremity of death; For some they condem∣ned to perpetuall Prison, and others they ba∣nished into an Island, or some remote Coun∣try, even in the case of Religion, they were very tender to dip their fingers in Blood; For when Cato was Consul, and it seemed good vn∣to the Senate to suppresse with violence the dis∣ordered Ceremony of the Bacchanals, brought by a strange Priest into the City; He with∣stood that Sentence, alleadging that there was nothing so apt, to deceive men as Religion; which alwaies presents a shew of Divinity; And for that cause, it behoved to be very wa∣ry in chastizing the professors thereof, lest any indignation should enter into the Peoples mindes, that somewhat was derogated from the Majestie of GOD. Others more freely, have not spared to place Religion (J meane that Religi∣on which is ignorantly zealous) amongst the kinds of Frensie, which is not to bee cured otherwise then by time, gi∣ven to divert or qualifie the fury of the Conceit; Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum!
Howsoever, in valuing the power of a city, or strength of Arguments, quality, and worth is to be preferred before number: Neverthe∣lesse, where the uttermost of our force is not known, it imports much to have it conceived, that the multitude stands for us; for doubts and suspitions cast in an Enemies way, ever∣more make things seeme greater, & more dif∣ficulty thā they are indeed; we have by Gods mercy, the sword of justice drawne on our behalfe, which upon short warning, is able to disunite the secret Vnderminers of our quiet, we have a King zealous for the house of the Lord, who needeth not to feare lesse successe in shutting up of Priests, then our late Queen had in restraining them in Wisbich Castle; where lest their factious spirits should grow rusty, they converted their Canker to fret upon themselves, and vomiting out gall in quodlibets, shewed that their Disease was chiefly predominant in the spleen. Whattem∣pests they have raised in their Colledge at Rome, their owne bookes, and many Tra∣vellers can witnesse; The storme whereof was such, that Sextus Quintus complained seriously of the vexation, which he received oftner from the English schollers, then all the Vassals of his Triple Crowne. And untruly is the Magistrate noted of negligence, or over∣much severity, that layeth waite to catch the Foxes, and the little Foxes, which spoile the
Vinyard; Though afterwards without fur∣ther punishment, he reserve them to the day, wherein God will take account of their Stew∣ardship. For if Aristotles City defined to be a society of men, assembled to live well, be the same, which in our Law hath refe∣rence to the maintenance of the poore in peace: so long as we taste of the sweet of a peaceable Government; we cannot say, but that we live well, and that the City consist∣ing of Men, and not of Walls, is happily guided. 8. An Oath is a weake Band to containe him that will, for pretended Conscience sake, hold no Faith with Hereticks, or by absolu∣tion from a Priest, thinketh himselfe at liber∣ty to flye from any promise, or protestation whatsoever. Therefore when I remember, that Wat∣sone the Priest, notwithstanding his invectives against the Jesuites, gained liberty to forge his trayterous inventions, and had others of his society in the complot: I judge it safer to make Recluses of them, then to suffer such to dally with us by Bookes, and some idle in∣telligences cast abroad onely, as a Mist to
bleare our eyes: but how shall we find the meanes to apprehend those disguised Roma∣nists, that borrow the shapes of Captaines, Marchants, Gentlemen, Citizens, and al sorts of people, and by equivocation, may deny themselves to be themselves? In answer to this question, I will first shew the Reason, why they are not pursued and taken, and here∣after make an overture, how they may be boulted out of their Hutches. The Nature of Man, howsoever in hot bloud it be thirsty of revenge; in a cooler temper, it hath a kind of Nausea, as I may call it, or a distaste of ta∣king away of the lives, even of the Nocent: Insomuch that in all Assizes and Sessions, an offender can hardly be condemned, whom the foolish pitty of many will not after a sort excuse, with laying some imputations on the Judge, part on the Jury, and much on the Ac∣cuser; and such is their blind affection, that the Prisoner who, perhaps, was never recom∣mended for handsomnesse, will be esteemed of them, for one of the properest men in the company: from hence it comes, that the name of a Serjeant, or a Pursevant is odious, and the Executioner, although he be the hand of Iustice, is esteemed no better then an Enemy of Mankind, and one that lost hone∣sty and Humanity in his Cradle. Reverend Master Foxe was wont to say, that Spyes
accusers, where necessary Members in a Com∣monwealth, and deserved to be cherished, but for his owne part, he would not be of any of that number, or wish his friends to affect such impliments, and albeit that the Law permits and commands every man to appre∣hend a Fellon; doe we not commonly see very many content to stand by and looke on, while others performe that office? Likewise, it is evident, that if such as are tender of their reputations, be very scrupu∣lous, personally to arrest men for civill acti∣ons of debt, they will be more unwilling instruments of drawing their bodies to the Racke, or the Gallowes; especially when their is any colour of Religion to be pretended in their defence; The diversity of mens faces is great, but the difference of their minds in this Case is more variable, wherein the mea∣nest have thought as free as the highest, be∣sides this, there are too many of the blind Commonalty, altogether Popish, though not reconciled Papists, who, in their foolish igno∣rance, will say, it is pitty any should dye for their Conscience, though indeed they make honourable amends for their Treason; verily I know not, what misgiving of their mind? it is, that maketh men forecast the possibility of alteration in matters of Religion, and for that respect, they are exceeding backward, in discovery and laying hands on Seminaries,
yea, and are timorous, in enacting sharpe Lawes against them, as those that silently say among themselves, Sors hodierna mihi; cras erit illa tibi: some also survive, who remem∣ber, that in Queene Maries time, the Prote∣stants alleadged a Text, that the Tares should not be plucked up before Harvest: Nay, shall I speak a Bugges word; there is no small number, that stand doubtfull, whether it be a gratefull worke to crosse Popery, or that it may be done safely without a sowle aspersi∣on of Puritanisme, or a shrewd turn, for their labours at some times, or other: By which unhappy ambiguity it comes to passe, that these, Animalia amphibia, the Priests I mean, that prey on the soules and bodies of either Sex, unattached revell where they list, though they be no more seene, then a man dancing in a net. How much fitter were it for us cou∣ragiously to invite them to our party, by Preaching, or confuting them by writing, and unto the state wherein we stand, wisely to ap∣ply the exhortation of the Assyrian King to his souldiers, you are fooles (quoth he) if there be any hope in your hearts, to redresse sorrow, by flight, or rather endeavour to make them flie that are the causers of your griefe, assu∣ring your selves, that more perish in flight, then in the battle, even as many seeking to meete the Papists halfe way, discomfort our owne party.

It followeth now, according to the Me∣thode prescribed before, that an overture be made, how to get the Jesuites and their shad∣dowes, the Priests into possession: it hath bin heretofore recited, that the unwelcome name of a Blood-sucker, a Busiebody, or a Puritane hath bin shrewd scarecrowes unto many ho∣nest minds, by abrogating therefore of those or such like imputations, many will be stirred up to undertake the apprehending of the Ad∣versaries unto the truth: especially, when for their paines and time imployed, they shall deserve, and have the titles of good Pa∣triots, dutifull Subjects, and zealous Christi∣ans: how ready is every common person to carry a Malefactor to the stokes, rather then to the goale or Execution, and doubtlesse, they will be no lesse forward to attach a Priest when they are assured that the worst of his punishment shalbe a simple restraint within the walls of some old Castle. A certaine kind of People there is, with whom mony playes a more forcible Orators part, then any per∣swasion of the dutifull service, which they owe to their Common-wealth: These men will not be negligent to give intelligence, and also to procure it faithfully provided, that reward may helpe to line their thred-bare purses, and exempt them from need to sell
liberty unto Seminaries: and where assu∣rance of gaine is propounded, for discovery what Master or Housekeeper will trust his servant with keeping of his Priest, or sleepe quietly while he is engaged to the danger of a Mercenary? I remember, that in Italy it was often told me, that the bountifull hand of Sir Francis Walsingham, made his intelligencers so active, that a Seminary could scarcely stirre out of the Gates of Rome, without his privi∣tie: which successe, by mediation of Gold, may as readily be obtained from Sivill, Valc∣dolid, Doway, Lovaine, Paris, and other places, and by forewarning given of their approach, they may be waited for at the Ports, and from thence, soone conveied to a safe Lodging. But whence shall the streame follow that must feed this bounty? It is a doubt easily sa∣tisfied. If some thousands of pounds out of the Recusants penalties be reserved in stock, and committed by his Majesty into the dis∣position of zealous distributers, who will not be afraid to conclude Perdat fiscus ut ca∣piat Christus: neither need we seeke any fur∣ther succour to repaire decayed Castles, and therein to defray the charge of the Priests, with a sure guard to keepe them: then the foresaid forfeitures, that by the Justice of the LAVV may bee collected:
which course, if ever it come happily to bee entertained, and that Recusancy cause to be an ignominous prey to the subjects, the procee∣dings for Religion shall be lesse blamed, and perhaps altogether unjustly accused, by any gracelesse, Gretzerus or Cacodaemon, Johannes, tincting their pennes in Gall, and vineger, For besides occasion of calumniation, given by suites of that nature, it is evident that ma∣ny Recusants that would be indicted for the King, and the effecting of the project afore∣said, shall escape without punishment, and be borne out against the power of a private per∣son, begging them to no other purpose, then hath heretofore bin used, and albeit the pe∣nalty be rated at xxl a moneth, yet was it ne∣ver the Law-makers intent, that such as was not able to pay so great a summe, should goe scot-free. But that according to the proporti∣on of their abilitie, they should doe the pe∣nance of their purses for their disobedience; whereas now (if the voice of the People, which is said to be the voice of God, is to be credited) the poorer sort is skipt over, as if they ought no soules to God, nor duty to their Soveraigne, a poore man, saith one, is to be pittied, if he offend thorow necessity: but he doe amisse voluntarily, he is more severe∣ly to be chastised; forasmuch, as wanting friends, and meanes to beare him out, it shew∣eth that his fault proceedeth from presump∣tion.
10. Let us now presuppose that all the whole Regiment of Iesuites and Seminaries, were lodged in safe custody, may we then perswade our selves that Popery will vanish like a dumb shew? I am cleerly resolved, that though it receive a great Eclipse, notwithstanding, with∣out other helpes, the Kingdome of Anti∣christ will onely lye hidden as a weed, that seemes withered in winter, and is ready to sprout out with the Spring. Temporall Armes are Remedies serving for a time: but the Spirituall sword is permanent in opera∣tion, and by an invisible blow workes more then Mortall man can imagine. The word of God carryeth this two edged weapon in its mouth, which is to be vsed by faithfull Ministers of the Church, whom pure zeale, without respect to wordly promotion or persons, ought to encou∣rage. Of Judges, the Scripture saith Estote fortes, and daily we see that sitting in their ju∣diciall seates, God inspireth them with grea∣ter courage, then whē, as private Persons, they are to give their opinions: No lesse is the power of the holy Ghost in his servants, that out of the Pulpit are to deliver his Embassage. Let them therefore not be dis∣mai'd to speak out plainly, and tell the truth without running a middle course betweene heate & cold. Unprofitable descanting upon the Scripture with an old Postell, or for want
of better matter, waste the poore time shut up in an houre Glasse, with skirmishing a∣gainst the worthy Pillars of our owne pro∣fession. Rumour which is ever ready to take hold of evill, hath raised a secret, though (as I hope) a causelesse suspition; that there should be some secret combination under hand, by changing the state of Questions, to put us in our old dayes, to learne a new Catechisme; and when they haue brought us out of con∣ceit with the Reverend Interpreters of the Word, to use us then, as the Wolves (men∣tioned in Demosthenes Apologie) handled the Shepheards, when they had delivered up their Dogs. Most sacred was that Speech of our most gracious King concerning Vorstius; he that will speake of Canaan, let him speake the Language of Canaan. How can we draw others to our Church; if we cannot agree, where, or how to lay our Foundation? Or how may we cleanse the Leprous Disease of dissension, which the Papists, which are least assured to themselves, and most doubtfull of their salvation, are not ashamed to ascribe unto many of us? I would not have Mini∣sters indiscreet, like Dogs, to bark against all, whether they know, or know them not. I like better the opinion of Aristotle, who adviseth those that stand in guard of a place, to be curst; onely to such as are about to endam∣mage the City. If Pursevants, and other civill Officers, would learne to keepe this rule, they
might goe about their businesse, with much credit. The imagined feare of inviting the Romish faction, by force to deliver their ghostly Fathers out of prison, move me not a whit; For I cannot believe, that they e∣steeme them at so deare a price, that they would runne the hazard, by freeing others out of hold, to put themselves into their places. some will say, that a man of straw is a head good enough for a discontented Multitude. That the Papists are very Cholericke, it ap∣peares sufficiently by their writings: yet it hath pleased God to send those curst Cowes short hornes, that when they could not finde a man of sufficiency to serve their turne, they were faine to doe homage to Garnets straw; forgetfull as they are, that such stubble cannot endure the tryall of fire; but unto us, that ought to be doers, as well as Professors of the Gospell, let this remaine as a memorable Theoreme: Religion is the Mother of good Order; good Order, is the cause of prosperous Fortune, and happy successe in all Counsels, and enterprises; wherefore in what estate soever, their wanteth good Order, it is an evident Argument, that Religion goes backward. 11. I have ever held it for a kind of inju∣stice, to omit the executiō of mean laws, made to prevent the effects of idlenesse, & then to apply main extremity of the sword, whē the proling habit gotten by ye vice comes to light. No lesse is the course uncharitable (with par-don
for this presumption be it spoken, when wee spare them that have no Religion at all, and censure those that can give account of some∣what tending to that purpose. He that is in misery must be borne with∣all if he speak miserably, and when the child from his Mothers Brest hath suckt nothing but Popery, a man had need to be angry with discretion, if he heare him speake in the voyce of a Papist. God calleth some by mi∣racle; but the ordinary meanes in his Word: if that means, in many places of this Land be wanting; of what Religion is it likeliest, the people will be? I suppose, that few men will gainsay my assertion, that outward sense will direct them to Popery which is fuller of Pa∣geants, then of spirituall doctrine. And what is the cause, that after so many yeares of prea∣ching of the Gospell, that the common peo∣ple still retaine a sent of the Roman perfume? The cause is, for that the formall obedience of comming to Church, hath bin more expected, then the instruction of private families; pub∣lique Catechising is of great vse, but the first elements thereof are to be learnt at home: and these, which we learn from our Parents, stick most surely in our minds. What was the cause why the Spartans continued their governmēt so many Revolutions of times, without mu∣tations? Histories record, that learning their Countrie Customes from their infancy, they
would not be induced to alter them; And in this our native soyle, we perceive that the common Lawes which relye on antient Cu∣stomes, are better observed then late Statutes of what worth soever they be: so doth it fare with the poore People, which being once sea∣soned with the old Dregs of Papisme, will hard∣ly be drawne from it: till the Learning of the true Faith be growne to a Custome. I will pre∣scribe no order of affires, to effect this; But I suppose, that the antient laudable course by the Bishops confirmation, will not be suffi∣cient to fulfill so great a taske; the Mini∣sters must and ought, to be the principall and immediate hāds to give assistance to so grati∣ous a worke, and in case, any be defective in their duty, the Reverend Bishops may take notice thereof in their Visitations. Perhaps it will be thought a hard taske to constraine old People to learne the A. B. C. of their Christian Beliefe. But how hard so∣ever it be, I hold it no incivility to prepare people of all Ages for the Kingdome of hea∣ven. By the order contained in the Booke of Common prayer, on Sundayes and Holidayes, halfe an houre before the Evensong, the Curate of every Parish ought to examine Children sent vnto him in some points of the Catechisme, and all Fathers, Mothers, Masters, and Dames should cause their Children, Apprenti∣ses, and servants, to resort unto Church, at the
time appointed: There obediently to heare, and be ordered by the Cutate; untill such time, as they have learnt all that in the said Book is commanded: And when the Bishop shall appoint the Children to be brought be∣fore him, for their confirmation, the Curate of every Parish shall send or bring in wri∣ting, the names of those Children of his Pa∣rish, which can answer to the Questions of the Catechisme; and there ought none to be ad∣mitted to the Holy Communion, untill such time as he can say his Catechisme, and be con∣firmed: many times I have stood amazed, to behold the magnificence of our Ancestors Buildings, which their Successors as this day are not able to keepe up; But when J cast mine eyes upon this excellent Foundation: laid by the grave Fathers of the Church, and perceive their children neglect to build ther∣upon: with exceeding marvaile, I rest almost besides my selfe. For never was their better Ground-plots laid, which hath bin seconded with lesse successe. It was not the hanging vp of the Bull of Pius Quintus on the Bishop of Londons doores, or the forbearing to hang vp Priests, that hath wrought this Apostasie: but the idlenesse, and insufficiency of many Tea∣chers, conspiring with the Peoples cold zeale, that hath bin the contriver of this unhappy Web. Untill the xith. yeare of Queen Eliza∣beth's Raigne, a Recusants name was scarcely knowne: The reason was, because that the
zeale, begotten in the time of the Marian persecution, were yet fresh in memory; And the late Persecutors wat so amazed with the suddaine alteration of Religion, that they could not choose but say Digitus Dei est hic. In those dayes, there was an emulation be∣tween the Clergy and the Laity: and a strife arose, whether of them should shew themselves most affectionate to the Gospell; Ministers han∣ted the houses of worthiest men, where Iesuits now build their Tabernacles; and poore Country Churches were frequented with the best in the Shire. The Word of GOD was pretious, Prayer and Preaching went hand in hand together: untill Archbishop Grin∣dals disgrace, and Hatfields hard conceit of prophecying, brought the flowing of these good graces to a still water: The name of a Papist smelt ranck, even in their owne No∣strills, and for pure shame to be accounted such, they resorted duly, both to our Chur∣ches and exercises: But when they saw their great Coriphaeus Sanders had slily pinned the name of Puritans, upon the sleeves of Prote∣stants, that encountred them with most cou∣rage, & perceived that the word was pleasing to some of our own side, they took hart agrace to set litle by the service of God, & duty to their Soveraign, therwith start up frō among us, some that might have bin recommended for their zeale, if it had bin tempered with dis∣cretion, who fore-running the authority of the Magistrate, took upon them in sundry places
and publikely to censure, whatsoever agreed not with their private conceits, with which crosse humours vented in Pulpits and Pam∣phlets, most men grieve to be frozen in zeale, and in such sort benummed, that whosoever (as the worthy Lord Keeper Bacon observed in those dayes) pretended a little sparke of ear∣nestnesse, be seemed no lesse then red fire, hot in comparison of the other; And as some things fare the worse, for an ill Neighbours sake, dwelling beside them, so did it betide the Protestant, who seeking to curbe the Papist, or reprove an idle Droane, was incontinent∣ly branded, with the ignominous note of a Precisian. All which wind, brought plenty of water to the Popes Mill, and there will most men grind, where they see apparence to bee well served. 12. If without great inconvenience the chil∣dren of Papists could be brought up out of their company, it were a happy turne: But I find it to be full of difficulty; There is provi∣sion made to avoid Popish Schoole-masters, but there is no ward against Popish Schoole∣mistresses, that infect the silly Infants while they carry them in their Armes, which mo∣veth me to suppose that the former propo∣sition to examine how Children and servants are brought up; and truly to certifie the list
of the Communicants, and Recusants, will be the readiest meanes to let his Majesty know the yearly increase or decrease of the church in every Diocesse: And whosoever shall send his children, or any of his Majesties subjects, to be placed in Monasteries, or Seminary Colledges, or Popishly to be brought up in sorraine parts: I thinke that for punishment both the one & the other, worthily might be disfranchised of the priviledges, due to natural English-men; so far-forth, as any good by the Lawes may descend to them: But not to be exempted from the penalties thereof; or the Regall jurisdiction of the Crowne. J know well that contradiction is odious, and makes a man seeme ambitious, to be thought more understanding then others. In which case, the Spanyard useth onely to terme him presum∣ptuous, whom he would call Foole, if civility would beare it. But in my defence, I hope it shall suffice againe, to revive my former prote∣station, that Idiscourse by the way of proposition, rather then Arrogance of defining any thing: with pardon therefore, may I be permitted to say. That the first easie Law of xijd. inflicted on him that could not give a reasonable ex∣cuse, for his absence from Church or Sun∣dayes, was one of the best Ordinances, that hath hitherto bin enacted. But while wee sought to make new Statutes, savouring of more severity, we neglected the old, and were
loath to execute the new: For it is a certaine Rule, that whosoever in policy will give li∣berty, and yet seeme to suppresse a crime, let him procure sharpe Lawes to be proclai∣med, which are onely necessary for some times, and rare occasions to be put in Execu∣tion; but not to be an ordinary worke, for e∣very day of the Weeke. Daily use likewise teacheth us, that it is lesse grievous to punish by an old Law, then by a new: Forsomuch, as Truth it selfe, seldome gets credit without proofe, and it is hard to free the people of suspi∣tion, that new Lawes are not rather invented a∣gainst the particular persons and purses of men, then against the corrupt manners. By force of which reason, I am induced to conceive that the old use of the Church, contained in good nurture, and Ecclesiasticall censures will much more prevaile to muzzell Popery, then any fresh devises whatsoever. Neither doe J thinke it blame-worthy, to affirme that our cause hath taken harme, by relying more on the Temporall, then the Spirituall Armes. For while we trusted that Capitall punish∣ments should strike the stroake; we have ne∣glected the meanes, which would, for the most part, have discharged the need of such severity. The Oath of Allegeance is not of∣fered generally, to servants and meane Peo∣ple; who if they had taken the Oath by ab∣solution of a Priest, might recoyle from it,
or change their opinion at leisure, without a∣ny ready meanes to discover their Leger-de∣maine: that Oath I feare will not bee often pressed, and to them that shift from place to place, how can it be tendered? The principall Papists now cover themselves, in the crowde of the multitude: but if we can discover the affection of the multitude, they easily will be unmasked, and being singled out, rest ashamed of their nakednesse; which under correction of better judgment, may be effected, if every new commer, to inhabit in a Towne, and ser∣vants newly entertained within a Weeke, or xiiij. dayes, be caused to repaire to the Mi∣nister, there in presence of the Churchwardens, and other honest men; to subscribe unto such briefe and substantiall Articles concerning Faith, and Allegeance, as shall be according to Gods Word, and Justice, ordained to distin∣guish the sheepe from the Goates. In forraine Countries, every Host is bound to bring his Guest before an Officer; there to certifie his name, with the occasion of his comming, &intended time of his abode in those parts; and in case he stay longer, he must again renew his Licence, so curious and vigilant: also are they to keepe their Cities from infection, that without a Certificate, witnessing their com∣ming from wholsome places, they may not escape the Lazeretto. No lesse ought wee to be watch∣full to prevent the contagion of our Soules,
then other Nations are of their bodies, every thing is hard, and scarcely pleasing in the be∣ginning: But with time, some such course may be readily put in Execution: which I propound rather as matter for better heads, to worke on; then peremptorily to be insi∣sted on in the same Termes. But lest any charge me with Temerity; that when I desire to know the multitudes incli∣nation, by the meanes aforesaid: I satisfie my selfe with their Parrots Language, pro∣nouncing it knowes not what: I thinke it not impertinent, to put them in mind, that here∣tofore I have required instructions, both pre∣cedent and subsequent; and am ever of the mind, that though all this cannot be done at once; yet it is necessary alwayes to be doing our best: knowing, that not to goe forwards in Re∣ligion, is the ready way to goe backwards. It is not the outward obedience of comming to Church, that discovers the inward thought of the heart: it is the confession of the Tongue that must utter these secrets. And where the Curates are insufficient, or the Parish great, I wish they had Catechistes to assist them, main∣tained by the Purses of the Recusants: which Pension being collected for Gods cause, will free us of scandall; though it grieve them to pay the spirituall Army, waged against their owne Stratagems: surely by giving them way in petty matters, they are growne to be
very masterfull in their party: Plato affir∣meth, that the Popular state proceeded from the Licence, which the people took to make immode∣rate Applauses in the Theaters: when, as by arrogating that immunity, without contro e∣ment, in place of their Governors, and per∣ceiving the Nobility to joyne with them in the same passions, they thought their Heads as worthy to governe, as any of those that were made out of the selfe-same mould: In like manner, while we suffer ignorance o∣penly to maintaine such petty glimpses of Popery, as are thought to be scarce worthy, to be look't at, and in small matters runne an indifferent course, which neither make sure friends, nor feeble Foes; unawares they take the bridle from us, and eate out Religion, as it were by an insensible Gangrena. Principiis obsta, serò, medicina paratur. Cum malaper longas convaluere moras. For by sufferance of breaking smaller Lawes, People are emboldned to set the grea∣ter at nought. To comprehend all things in a Law, which are necessary to the Reformation, I neither hold it profitable nor expedient; yet it is discretion to provide for the most important: smaller matters, whereof the Lawes speake not, are to be commended to the discretion
of Parents, Masters, and other reverent per∣sons, who by example and advice, may pre∣pare younglings, by education and custome, to obey the Lawes: especially such as are in high place ought, in this behalfe, to be like Caesars Wife. Non solum crimine, sed etiam cri∣minis suspitione vacare, and with circumspe∣ction to behave themselves; that the world may conceive, in requiring obedience to God and their Soveraigne, that they hold the multitude rather for companions, then slaves: if great men take another way, they may se∣duce many by example; though by Words they expresse not their concealed opinions; Tace & loquere, said God to Moses, it is the speech of the heart, which utters more then words and syllables: And in our common Lawes, it is held maintenance, when a great Personage, onely by his presence countenan∣ceth a cause. Neither let us secure our selves with this Argument: the Papists are plyable in small matters, ergo, they will yeeld in greater; And because they tooke no Armes in 88. therefore it were needlesse curiosity to suspect them now: for who knowes not, that small baites are used to take the greatest Fish, vt cum esca una etiam hamus devoretur. Warinesse is the sinewes of Wisdome, and nothing is more dangerous, then to be secure in matters of State: Therefore for the Lawes already made, I wish that the most effectuall
of them, which least concernes life, may be executed; For better it were not to make them, then by neglect to set them at liberty; seeing that many offences there are, which men would abstaine from, if they were for∣bidden, but when a strict commandement is avoided without punishment, therout springs an unbridled Licence, hardly to be reformed by any rigour. To conclude, I say freely, that who so en∣deth his dayes by a naturall death, he shall be subject to receive many mens doomes, for e∣very particular offence; But when for Reli∣gions sake, a man triumpheth over the sword, that one eminent vertue razeth out the me∣mory of other errours, and placeth him, that so dyeth, in Paradice; if common opinion may be lawfully vouched; which glory having many followers, and admirers, awaketh even dull spirits to affect their footesteps, and to sell their lives, for the maintenance of the same cause: J need not envy the name of a Martyr to the Jesuit; for his cause if it be rightly weighed, will blanch that title: but I desire to have all those Lineaments defaced, which may com∣pound that counterfeit Image, in prosecuting of which purpose, if J have failed in my ad∣vice, and by confused handling intricated the question, J humbly request, that a wise mans verdit, may mitigate the heavines of yt censure.
It is neither good to praise bad Counsels, be∣cause of their good successe; nor to con∣demne good Counsels, if the Events prove not fortunate; lest many be animated, to advise rashly, and others dishartned, to coun∣sell gravely. Illi mors gravis incubat, Qui notus nimis omnibus, Ignotus moritur sibi. Senec. Trag. FINIS.
