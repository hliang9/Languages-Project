A LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO A Loyal Subject, Where ever he is, in England, Scotland, France, or Ireland, that is Wise and Faithful, Valorous and Couragious, for the great Honour of God and our Royal Sovereign, CHARLES the Second, King of Great Britain. By J. V. LONDON, Printed by Tho. James for the Author, M.DC.LXXX.
A LETTER from a FRIEND TO A LOYAL SUBJECT. Honoured Sir, ALL that do profess the Faith should Countenance and Encourage that Man that can manifest the Power of Faith, for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of many Na∣tions, which will be brought about in a short time, by that Man in whom the Lord of Hosts doth make bare his Arm, to manifest his Wis∣dom and Power among the Sons of Men, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of them; for the Glory of his great Name, and to have the Devil and all the Workers of Evil brought to shame, that so his Gospel, which is the Gospel of Recon∣ciliation, and the glad Tidings of Salvation, may run and be glorified among all Nations where it is not, and may flourish more and more where it is; that so the Heathens may be Converted, and Jews and Gentiles brought into one Fold: that so all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World may cease, and among all People in all Nations a free Trade,
great Joy, and a lasting Peace, which will be brought about in this Generation, for Englands great Honour and Exaltation, and for the great Shame, Contempt and Terror of all them that are for Strife and Contention, Sedition and Trea∣son, for Wars and Confusion, by John Varney, a Friend to the Sons of Men, in the work of Faith, and the labour of Love for them, in such high and honourable Work, that will prove pleasant, profitable, and delightsome to many Persons in all Nations, and Victorious, Glorious and Crown∣ing Work, that will Crown the God of Heaven with much Glory among the Sons of Men, and our Royal Sovereign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, with great Honour and Power over them, over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperors in the World. The words of our Lord and Saviour, when he was upon Earth with the Sons of Men, his words were words of Life and of Power among them; so are the words of that Man in all Generations, that doth believe in him, and can manifest the Power of Faith for him. Therefore let every Soul be subject to the highest Powers, for there is no Powers but of God; the Powers that be are ordained of God. Men and Devils have their Power from God, but the Power of Faith, it is the Power of God, it is not the Power of any Mor∣tal Man, but it is the Power of God in Man, the Power of God with Man, the Power of God for Man, and the Power of God above Man, and a∣bove
all the Powers of Hell, do what they can. The time is come, that all they that are Ene∣mies to the Protestant Religion, and to the Go∣vernment of the Church of England, that have slighted and undervalued Divine Faith, which is better than Strength or Weapons of War, or Silver or Gold, either a Person or a Nation will be ashamed when they come to consider and under∣stand that it is by Faith I stand; I stand in the Love and Favour of God, I stand by the Wisdom and Power of God: Therefore as by Faith I stand, so by Faith I shall quit my self like a Man, and make all that are Enemies to God and Man, throughout the whole World, to tremble, as the Devil and all the Workers of Evil, that are en∣gaged with him and for him, against the Prote∣stant Religion, and the Government of the Church of England, which is for Unity, Peace and Con∣cord, for Piety and Vertue, which would have all the Sons and the Daughters of Men cease to do evil and learn to do well, and in every Grace and Vertue to excell; which is for the ho∣nour of the Protestant Religion, and the Peace and the Prosperity of all Kingdoms. Therefore all that call themselves Christians and Protestants in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, and do not conform to so excellent a Government, which is for Love and Vnion, to prevent Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, Wars and Confusion; they be foolish, proud, stubborn, and rebellious Children; but they that will do
what they should not do, must be made to do what they would not: For though Men are not to be compelled to be Religious, yet they are to be subdued when they Rebellious: By the Laws of the Land, by the Command of them that have Power in their hand, they ought to be made Servants and Labourers to them that do conform, that is, to bear most Burdens, to pay most Taxes, to furnish our Royal and Gracious Sovereign with Men and Money, when he doth require it, and may have occasion to use it. This will be the way for to bring home many that be gone a stay, and to reprove, rebuke, and to condemn them that will not obey; this will be the way for Pa∣pists to become Protestants, and for Protestants and Papists to become good Christians and Loyal and Obedient Subjects. This will be the way for to prevent much Evil, that it may not come upon the Nations, to remove much Evil that is, come, and to procure and secure great Honour, Peace, and Prosperity, to our Royal King and many Kingdoms. This will be the way that we shall become as fair as the Moon, as clear as the Sun, and as terrible as an Army with Banners; so that we shall become a Wonder to our Selves, a Terror to our Enemies, and a Crown and a Glory to all Kings and Kingdoms. This will be the way for the workers of Evil to become workers of Righteousness, so that Righteousness will run down like a mighty stream, and the Wickedness of the Wicked will come to an end, to the great shame, contempt, and terror of the
Devil, who is the Author and Cause of all Evil, among the Sons of Men. He is that Prince of the Air, that is every where to make Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, Wars and Confusion, among all Persons, Families, Cities and Kingdoms: He sets Learned Men one against another, to confound and destroy each other; he sets the Wise against the Strong, the Strong against the Weak, and the Rich against the Poor, to bring Desolation among all Persons and Na∣tions: He sets the Turk against the Pope, and the Pope against him, and the French King a∣gainst them both; and is it not time for me to set my self against them all, for their great shame and down fall; but I shall set my self most a∣gainst the Devil, because he hated Man from the beginning, and did endeavour to destroy him, as soon as he had a Being; he is a Murderer, he caused Cain to kill his Brother Abel, he has caused all Wars and Murders that have been a∣mong all Persons, in all Nations, in all Gene∣rations; he is an implacable Enemy to the Sons and the Daughters of Men; he sets the Church against the State, and the State against the Church, that so there may be neither Church nor State among them; but the Devil shall be deceived of his expectation, to his great shame and condemnation, for I shall set all Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men against him; yea, all People in all Nations, that do love the Peace and the Prosperity of their Souls, and the Comfort of their Lives; therefore I shall set the Turk and
the Pope, and the French King against him, and all that do assist him and them, because he has deceived them with a Religion that tends to their shame, and will be to their ruin, if they do not leave it in due time. Therefore all that have a Soul to save, I hope will leave that Re∣ligion, which makes them the Devils Slaves. He that winneth Souls from the love of the things of this World, and from the service of the Devil, the God of this World, that Man is Wise, and Stronger than the Devil; he is Wise for himself and he is Wise for others, that the Sons and the Daughters of Men may enjoy the greatest freedom, the freedom of the Mind; the greatest Liberty, the Liberty of the Will; and the greatest Power, Power against Sin; and the greatest Victory, Victory over the World. I am at War for them with the Devil, who is the God of this World, who doth do what he can with the things of this World, to deceive the Sons and the Daughters of Men, to win their Souls from them; but before the Devil shall have his will over the Sons of Men, he shall be chained and confined to his Den, and there will I make him shake and quake, by the Power of Faith and the Word of God, which is an Iron Rod, and a sharp Sword, by which I shall smite him and wound him home; I shall not fear him nor spare him, but play and display upon him Hail-stones and Coles of Fire, by the power of Faith and the Word of Gods Power. Sir, It was long before I did begin to make
War with the Devil, but having begun to make War with him in my own Person, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of all Nations; I shall not leave him, but will vex and perplex him, wound and confound him, till all Strife, Con∣tention and Wars, throughout the whole World doth cease, and among all People in all Na∣tions, there be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace; that the Sons of Men may live Conquerors in the World, and die Conquerors over Sin, Death, Hell, and the Devil. They must hate what is Evil, what is Evil in them∣selves, for it is weakness and foolishness to speak gainst Evil in others, and to love and approve of it in themselves; but they that hate what is Evil in themselves, will begin to loath it, and then to leave it, and then to be weary of it; and then the Devil will be weary of them. This is the way for the Workers of Evil to leave the Devil, and the Devil to leave them. This is my great Design, and the labour and travel of my Mind, for the Devil to leave the Sons of Men, and the Sons of Men to leave him, that so he may take up his rest in his Den, and not for to have any lodging among them; but in his Den there let him roar, rage, and swell, but no more cause the Sons of Men for to rebel. They that do hate what is Evil in them∣selves, and do love what is Good in others, will labour to be good in their own Persons, and to do much good in their Generation, for the great honour of God, the King, and the Nation.
They that would overcome the Devil, who is the author and cause of all Evil, they must not slight and undervalue the Publick Prayers of the Church of England, because they be suitable and seasonable, profitable and comfortable, for all Persons in all Nations, for to inform them and to reform them, if they be not wanting to them∣selves; they be such Prayers, that will teach Men to know how to Pray in their Families, and between God and their own Souls, from whom they may have what they can desire, as truth of Grace, strength of Grace, and increase of Grace. The Prayer of the Upright it is Gods Delight, and tends to Mans great Peace, Profit and Com∣fort; it is Faith, Prayer and Meditation, that will drive the Devil from Mens Habitations, so that they will enjoy great Consolation, and be free from Condemnation and everlasting Damnation. Prayer without Faith it is heartless, and Faith without Prayer it is fruitless; Faith and Prayer will purifie the foulest heart, that the Devil can∣not lodge there in any part; they will strengthen the weakest Memory, and comfort the saddest Spirit. Faith and Prayer will make a weak Man strong in the Power of God, as bold as a Lion, for the great Honour of God and the King, and Wiser than the Devil and all the workers of E∣vil, who are Enemies unto him. Therefore what Victory or Conquest any of the Sons of Men do get by the Power of Faith, over Sin, Death, Hell, and the Devil, and over the workers of
Evil, the Glory of it is to be given to the God of Heaven, and the Honour and the Profit of it to the King of that Nation, who is over that Per∣son. Well might I declare in due time, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of Mankind, that our Royal Sovereign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, would be the Chiefest and most Renowned Emperor in the World, and over the World, because I have been at War for him with the Devil, who is the God of this World; but I have not been at War with him with an Army of Men, but by the Power of Faith I have him under my feet, and shall tri∣umph over him, for the Glory and the great Glory of the most High, and the great Honour and Exaltation of Englands Royal Majesty among the Sons of Men, and above any of them; a∣bove all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperors in the World, for the Ho∣nour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, and the Government of the Church of England, and and for the Peace and Prosperity of all King∣doms. Sir, it has been a Sin and a great Sin, of too many, both in Church and State, both Learned and Unlearned Men, that they have not proved and improved their Wisdom, their Knowledge, their Power, and their Courage, for the Honour of our Royal Sovereign Charles the Second, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, as they might have done, but they have too
much improved it against him and his Royal Fa∣ther, our late Royal and Gracious Soveraign; a King too wise, mild, and too good, for a proud, stubborn, and rebellious Generation; but the right hand of the Lord will find out all his Ene∣mies, both at home and abroad. Let the Wise, Godly, and the Learned, of the Church of Christ, in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; yea of his Church throughout the whole World, consider if it be not time for the Lord of Hosts to make bare his Arm, and to make a Man strong for himself and our Royal Soveraign, Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, when that too many have made themselves strong in Parties against him, to undermine and overthrow the Protestant Religion, and the Go∣vernment of the Church of England; but what will they get but Shame and Confusion, for they will be brought down, and that with a Witness, and that without having a Sword in my hand, or Men or Money at command; it will be known in this day of Gods Power, whose word shall stand, the word of God or the word of Man: I say the word of God that will prevail, and all that trust to this Party or that Opinion, to Carnal Wisdom, Power and Strength, their Hearts will fail: Therefore let all that handle the Sword, or draw out the Sword, to undermine and overthrow the Protestant Religion, the Govern∣ment of the Church of England, and our Royal So∣veraign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, under pretence of a better Governour, a better Go∣verment,
and a better Religion, let them perish like Sisera and Jabin, like Pharaoh, Saul, and proud Haman, who became as Dung upon the face of the Earth; but let them that love the Lord and delight to honour the King, our Royal and Gra∣cious Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain; Let them be like the Sun that goes forth in his might, that may give a greater and a better Light; a Light that may shine so clear, as may Revive, Refresh, Counsel, Comfort and Streng∣then Fellow Members, Fellow Labourers, Fellow Travellers, and Fellow Soldiers, and Fellow Citizens in the Wilderness of this World, far and near. The way of the Wicked it is as Darkness, they know not at what they stumble, but the path of the Just it is as the shining Light, that shines brighter and brighter, till it comes to the perfect day. The Lord is my Light and Salvation, whom shall I fear? Not the Devil nor the workers of E∣vil. The Lord is my Light and Salvation, my strong Tower, and most Royal Habitation; whom shall I not make to fear? Them that will not love and fear the God of Heaven, and honour our Royal and Gracious Sovereign, Charles the Se∣cond, King of Great Britain. Whom shall I not make to fear in this day of Gods Power, by the power of his Spirit, and the word of his Power? Will it not be the Devil, and all the workers of Evil, all that be engaged with him and for him, against the Protestant Religion, the Government of the Church of England, and the Person of our
Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain? Will it not be all they that be for Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, for Wars and Confusion; all that make Religion a busi∣ness of Discourse to no purpose; all that have a name to live and are dead, all that call them∣selves Saints and are Devils incarnate? Will it not be all Self-sekers and Men-pleasers, lovers of themselves more than lovers of God, their King and Countrey? It is weakness and foolish∣ness, if not madness, for to make a noise about Religion, for this Party and that Opinion, and do not labour to get power against Sin, and victo∣ry over the Devil. This is the way for to make Rome to shake, and Spain to quake, and all that are Enemies to the Government of the Church of England, their Hearts to ake, more than many Armies of Men. This is the way for the King∣doms of Sin, Satan, and Antichrist, for to grow weaker and weaker, and the Kingdoms of our Lord and Saviour stronger and stronger; so that the whole Earth will be filled with the Knowledge and the Glory of the Lord, as the VVaters cover the Sea; so that the People in most Nations will praise God, yea, all will learn to praise him with new Obedience, because they have their Being from him, and their well Being is in him. This is the way for the Throne of our Royal Soveraign to be established in Righteous∣ness, so that the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience, who are for Strife and Contention, Sedition and
Treason, for Wars and Confusion, will be affraid and ashamed to come into his Majesties Royal Presence, so that his Majesties Royal Court will be the most Renowned'st Court under the Hea∣vens, for Vnity, Peace, and Concord, for Piety and Vertue, for Wisdom, Power, and Strength; for Honours, Riches, and great Glory. So that we shall soon become the Wonder and the Glory of the World, the Crown of Kingdoms, the De∣sire and the Delight of Nations, the Joy of the whole Earth, and the City of the great King: So that most People in all Nations, will be in love with the Protestant Religion, and all Hea∣then and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Em∣perors in the World, will be ashamed of their Religion, and will be ready and willing for to serve and to honour our Royal and Gracious Soveraign Charles the Second, King of Great Bri∣tain, as the Chief Soveraign among the Sons of Men, for Wisdom, Power, and Strength over them; and well they may, because the Lord of Hosts is with him as a Mighty Man, as a Man of War, to subdue his Enemies under his Feet, and as a God of Peace, to cause all Strife, Contention, and Wars, throughout the whole World to cease: Therefore let not any Despise the day of small things, but when and by whom the Lord of Hosts doth make bare his Arm, let all Flesh be silent, as it doth become them; for though the Lord be slow to Anger, yet is he great in Power, who can with his Right Hand and Holy Arm, with one Man, make all his E∣nemies
throughout the whole World to tremble. The time is come, that he will have Inquisition made for the Blood of his Son, Holy Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs; and for the Life of our late Royal, and Gracious Soveraign: All these have been put to Death by unreasonable, bloody, and deceitful Men. But what will they do in the day of Visitation, and where will they fly for help? There is no flying from the power of that Man by Sea or Land, in whom the Lord of Hosts doth make bare his Arm, for his Arm is very long and very strong, and that his Enemies will know to their great shame and overthrow, that be Enemies to the Protestant Religion, and to the Government of the Church of England. Who knows the Wisdom, the Power, and the Strength of that Man, that is strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might? What can he not do? What may he not do in his own Person to serve his Generation, for the Peace and Prosperity of many Nations? Therefore not unto Man, not unto Man, but let all the Glory be given to the most High, from Men and Angels, and that conti∣nually, for his great Wisdom, Power, Glory, and Majesty: And great Honour and Renown, great Joy, Peace and Prosperity, from the most High, upon Englands Royal Majesty, upon his Royal Person, and all his Royal Relations, that so he and they may long live to Reign for God and with God, among the Sons of Men, from Generation to Generation, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of all Nations.
What Victory or Conquest is got by any one Person, or by an Army of Men, the Glory of it is to be given to the God of Heaven, and the Honour of it to the King of that Nation. When David in his own Person did get the Victory and Conquest over Goliah, the Philistins Champion, it was a Honour and a great Honour to King Saul and all Israel. And when Joab with King Davids Men did get the Victory over the Chil∣dren os Ammon, and had taken their Royal City the City of Waters, Joab he sends for his Lord King David, to come and to take the Honour and the Crown, and the Glory of it, which was due to him. Therefore what ever Wisdom, Power, Courage, or any Grace, any Subject in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, hath received from the God of all Wisdom, Power and Grace, it doth become them so to prove and im∣prove them, that they may tend for the Glory of the most High, and the great Honour and Renown of Englands Royal Majesty. Kings are born for Honour and great Honour in this World, therefore it is the Duty of Loyal and Faithful Subjects, to do what they can to uphold their Honour; to maintain it, and to increase it a∣mong the Sons of Men, and above any of them, and not in the least to oppose them and de∣throne them, as the Church of Rome has done too many. There is a Generation of Men that are not for Kingly Government over them, but they would have a King among themselves; such another
Tyrant as Oliver Cromwell was; these are they that make a noise about Religion, of Christs Per∣sonal Reign 'upon Earth; but these will be de∣ceived of their Expectation, to their great Shame and Condemnation. The Reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, it is Spiritual and not Temporal; when he was upon Earth he made himself of no Reputation, but took upon him the form of a Servant; therefore the Jews did flight and undervalue him: so that he has no encouragement to come in his own Person among the Sons of Men, but he will come to Judge the World, and to Condemn them most that would have him come to Reign among them, and will not let him Reign in their Hearts, and to rule and over-rule them by his Word and Spirit. The Kingdom of Christ, it is not in outward Glory, but it is in Righteousness, Joy and Peace in the Heart: It is Righteousness that will ex∣alt a Person, be he High or Low, Rich or Poor, Learned or Unlearned, with an Ornament of Grace and a Crown of Glory, which the Devil nor the World cannot give nor take away; there∣fore in the House of the Righteous there is the richest Treasure and the sweetest Pleasure, be∣cause there is a sound Heart, which is the life of the Flesh. A wholesome Tongue, which is a Tree of Life, and Righteous Lips, which are the delight of Kings, yea, of him who is King of Kings, and the onely Ruler and best Ruler of Princes, because he is the Prince of Peace, the Lord of
Hosts, who doth what he will among the Sons of Men, both with the Government and the Govern∣ing of them, because he has all Power in his own hand, and the whole Creation at command. As the Lord of Hosts is the Prince of Peace, so he is the Son of Righteousness, who loveth the Righteous, and doth preserve them, and layeth up sound Wisdom for the Righteous: He lays it up for them, that they may lay it out for him in due time and season, to prevent much Evil, that it may not come to a City or a Kingdom to remove much Evil that is come, and to procure and secure great Honour, Peace, and Prosperity to King and Kingdom: By him and for him it is that Kings do Reign, and in the World remain; he sets them up and keeps them up, for his own Will and Pleasure; they are not set up for the will and pleasure of Men, neither have they any power for to oppose and depose them, as too many have done, to the great shame and confu∣sion of their own Faces, and much Trouble and Misery of too many Nations; but the Righteous Lord, who is a great God and mighty King over all the Earth, has known the Soul of our Royal So∣vereign in great Adversity; he has been his Strength in time of Trouble, he has brought him out of great Tribulation, and will bring him to great Honour and Exaltation, for the Glory of his great Name, for the Honour of his Holy Gospel, and the Government of the Church of England, and the Peace and Prosperity of all Kingdoms, to the shame of them
that are Enemies to the Protestant Religion, and to the Government of the Church of England. Sir, To lay a Foundation for some stately Ha∣bitation, for a Church, a Temple, or some great Hall for Publick Use and Service, it is com∣mendable, and many will countenance, encou∣rage, and set forward, a Work of that nature, and they do well; but to lay a Foundation by Divine Meditation, for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of many Nations, it is more Ho∣nourable, and at this time suitable and season∣able, profitable and comfortable, and advanta∣gious tomany Persons, Families, Cities and King∣doms: therefore all that do love the peace and the prosperity of their Souls, and the comfort of their Lives, should countenance, encourage, and set forward this high and honourable Work, that is for the Glory, and the great Glory of the most High, and the great Honour and Exalta∣tion of Englands Royal Majesty, our Royal and Gracious Sovereign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, among the Sons of Men, and a∣bove any of them; above all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World; that so all Nations may be freed from Slavery, and throughout the whole World great Joy, Peace and Prosperity; so that in these days of the Gospel will the Righteous flourish, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign there will be abundance of Peace, from the Wisdom and the Power of the Prince of Peace; who can when
he please, and with whom he please, cause all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World to cease; to the great Shame, Con∣tempt and Terror of all them that be for Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, for Wars and Confusion. Shall the Church of Rome mind and regard her Children that be workers of E∣vil? Shall she countenance and encourage them in that which is sinful? Shall she give them great Gifts, and promise them great Rewards to make Strife and Contention, Sedition and Trea∣son, Wars and Confusion, to undermine and o∣verthrow the Protestant Religion, the Govern∣ment of the Church of England, and our Royal Sovereign his Majesty of Great Britain? And shall not that Man be minded and regarded, by the Wise, Godly, and the Learned of the Church of England, that shall deny himself, overcome himself, and lay out himself, to undermine and confound the Devil, and all the Workers of E∣vil; all that are Enemies to the Protestant Reli∣gion, and to the Goverment of the Church of England; but the work of Faith and the labour of Love is regarded by the God of Love, though it may be slighted and undervalued by too many of the Sons of Men: But what our Saviour said, that shall I say, They that be not his Friends are his Enemies; they that be not for him are against him: Who can with one Man wound and con∣found all his Enemies, by Sea and by Land. Therefore they that do not countenance, en∣courage, and set forward this noble Design, that
he has enabled me to make known in time, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of Mankind; they be not Friends but Enemies to the Peace and Prosperity of their own Souls and the Com∣fort of their Lives. Sir, He that handleth a Matter wisely shall find Good, and who so trusteth in the Lord happy is he. As my Faith is from the God of my Hope, so my Hope is in the God of my Faith, who will bring forth the Righteousness of his Servant as the Light, and his Judgment as the Noon-day, to make good what he has enabled him to hold forth in this Generation, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of all Nations; to that end I have declared that our Royal Sovereign Charles the Se∣cond, King of Great Britain, in this Generation will be the Chiefest and the most Renowned'st Emperor in the World and over the World; the time is come, that it is to be made known to all People, in all Nations, that it is already done, and so well done, that it is not all the Powers of Hell, nor all the Powers of the World, that can undo it again: It is done, but not by the Counsel of Men in Parliament, nor out of Parliament; it is done, but not by Strife and Contention, Sedi∣tion and Treason, by Wars and Confusion; but it is done by a secret Decree from the God of Peace, that so all Strife, Contention and Wars, throughout the whole World may cease; that so among all People in all Nations there may be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. This Noble and Royal Decree from the
God of Peace, it is his secret Determination, for to disappoint in due time the Turk, the Pope, and the French King, of their Expectation, that they shall not Rule and Over-rule the Na∣tions, as too long they have done, for the De∣vil and their own Lusts; but the God of Peace, who is the God of Power, will have his Annointed, and our Royal Sovereign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, to Rule and to Over∣rule them and all Nations, by the Word of his Power, which is the Scepter of his Grace, by which he will be known in all Paths and Places of the World , to be the Creator of Heaven, the Earth, and the Sea. Sir, As our Royal Sovereign has this great Ho∣nour to be the Chiefest and most Renowned Emperor in the World and over the World, from Gods Royal Decree and Determination, to Rule and Over-rule the Nations for him and with him, by the word of his Power; so he has this great Honour by way of Conquest, but not by the power of the Sword, but by the power of Faith, between God and my own Soul, over the Devil, the God of this World, who has deceived and destroyed too many hundred thousands of Persons in all Nations, with the things of this World that be uncertain and deceitful. They be like a Bladder, full of Wind, but do not satisfie the Mind: But the time is come, that the Devil that has deceived too many in all Nations, I shall endeavour to deceive him very much in this Generation, but not Sir of Silver or of Gold,
of Houses or of Lands, but of as many Souls as I can; because the Soul of one Man or Woman more worth than all the Kingdoms of this World. Sir, The Soul of a Man is capable of higher Enjoyments and greater Honours than this World can afford; for all things under the Sun is but vanity: Honours are uncertain, Riches are de∣ceitful, and the Pleasures of this World they be more bitter than sweet; they fill many with Pain, some with Shame, and some with a foul and loathsome Disease; but they give the Soul no true Ease: but they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness, will be filled with Grace and enjoy much peace, that peace which the World cannot give nor take away; but there is no peace to the Wicked, to the Workers of Iniquity, what-ever they do, where-ever they go, till they come to be Workers and Lovers of Righteousness, then they will have peace with God and Joy in God. The work of Righteousness is peace, and the effect of Righteousness is Quietness to the Mind, and will prove profitable to Mankind. The La∣bour of the Righteous tendeth to Life, to the Life and Comfort of his own Soul, and of the Souls of many in Court, City and Countrey. The Devil, who is the God of this World, doth labour to do what he can with the things of this World, to deceive the Sons and the Daughters of Men, to win the Souls of them. But Sir, He that can win Souls from the Devil, and the love of this present Evil World, he is Wise
for God and Strong in God, and will be fully and greatly Rewarded by God: For as the Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life, so the Reward of the Righteous, is a Crown of Life, which the Righteous Lord will give to every one that is a lover and a worker of Righteousness. The Secret of the Lord, Sir, is with the Righteous; what he will have brought about for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of a Nation; and it is not all the powers of Hell, nor all the powers of the World that can hinder it. There is a time and a season for every purpose under the Sun, much more for Gods secret Decrees to be made known and done: For what the most Wise God doth Will, before time, he will have it brought about and fulfilled in due time, by that man whom he doth give wisdom and power to understand his mind: for the Will of God is the Master-wheel that sets a work all the powers in man, and all the powers of man, to bring about what he knows that is best to be done, for the great honour, the peace and the prospe∣rity of a King and many Kingdoms. There be many devices in the heart of man, but the Coun∣sel of the Lord that shall stand, and the thoughts of his heart in all generations; what he will have brought about among all Persons in all Na∣tions, to the great shame, contempt and ter∣ror of the Devil, and all the workers of Evil, who are for Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, for Wars and Confusion: But Sir, the
God of Peace knows when, how, and by whom he pleaseth, for to cause all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World to cease; and among all People in all Nations, a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace: to that end this great Lord has enabled me to understand his Mind, and to make it known in due time. They that must wait Sir upon the Lord, must be of good Courage, and then he will strengthen their Hearts, that they shall be able to act for him, and to act with him, in high and honourable Work It is God that has made my Feet like Hinds Feet, to leap over a Wall of difficulty and danger: He has girded me with Strength, and has made my way plain, and will make his work prosperous that he has wrought in me in this day of his power, by the power of his Spirit, which is a Spirit of Light and of Life, of Liberty and of Ability, for to enable them that do en∣joy it, and will be ruled by it, for to attain, re∣tain, maintain, and proclaim, that which is suita∣ble and seasonable, profitable, comfortable and advantagious for all persons in all Nations, that do love the peace and the prosperity of their Souls, and the comfort of their Lives. But Sir, There is a Generation of Men that will be∣lieve no more than they can by their Sense and Reason understand, and such Men be always at a stand, for the good of a City and a King∣dom, to bring Order out of Confusion, Light out of Darkness, Good out of Evil, and Peace out of Trouble: but to him that believes and
knows he believes, all things is possible to be done, that is lawful, commendable and most ho∣nourable under the Sun; what is lovely and praise worthy among the Sons of Men, for the peace and prosperity of them. Is is but reasona∣able for all Men to believe in the Lord of Life, who is the King of Glory and the Prince of Peace; but to Believe in him and to Act for him, it is a∣bove Reason but not against Reason: it is the work of Faith and the labour of Love that can do it. Sir, A Friend loveth at all times, and a Brother is born for Adversity; for a Nation, yea, for many Nations, great Joy, Peace and Prospe∣rity, which will be brought about in this Gene∣ration, for Englands great Honour and Exalta∣tion, and for her Enemies great Shame and Condemnation. Therefore cry out and shout thou Inhabitant of Sion, thou Church of Christ, in Eng∣land, Scotland, France, and Ireland, yea, through∣out the whole World: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the mid'st of thee, for to make thee most Renowned among the Sons of Men, for Wildom, Power, and Strength over them; over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperors in the World, over all the workers of Imquity, the Seed of Evil Doers, and the Children of Disobedience; over all that are Ene∣nemies to the Gospel, to the Protestant Religion, and to the Goverment of the Church of England; and that without making of War or shedding of Blood: This is the Lords doings, who is great in Counsel and mighty in Power, to work in
Man, with Man, and for Man, when Parliaments, Armies and Counsels may be at a stand. Sir, It is the unbelief of Men that doth hinder the God of Heaven from working in them and with them, for the good of themselves and o∣thers. There is nothing too hard for the God of Heaven, who is the God of all Wisdom and Power, for to bring about by that Man that doth Believe in him, and can act his Faith for him: For though Faith be Gods Gift, yet Man must Act his Faith, that will bring Glory to God, Honour and Renown to a Kings Person, and Peace and Prosperity to a Nation. Sir, The Lord Reigneth who made the World, and doth Govern the World as one Man, and can do it with one Man, when and by whom he please to make bare his Arm; and that his E∣nemies will know to their great shame and over∣throw. For this great Lord and King will make quick and powerful Work in this Generation, for the Information, Reformation, and Salvati∣on of many Nations in this day of his Power, by his Word and Spirit of Power; that so the Heathens may be Converted; and Jews and Gen∣tiles brought into one fold; that so all Strife, Con∣tention and Wars throughout the whole World may cease, and among all People in all Nations, a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. So that Sir, it is in vain for the Turk to strive to be greater than the Pope, or the Pope greater than he, or the French King greater than them; our Royal and Gracious Sovereign Charles the
Second King of Great Britain, is Wiser and Stronger, and Greater than them all; but not by the Wisdom and Power of Men, not by the Sword of them, but by the Wisdom and Power of God in Man, with Man and for Man; that so all Nations may be freed from Slavery, and through∣out the whole World, great Joy, Peace and Prosperity, to the great Shame, Contempt and Terror of the Devil, and all the Workers of E∣vil. Sir, Shall the God of all Wisdom and Power enable me to work with him and to work for him, in such High and Honourable Work, Victo∣rious, Glorious, and Crowning Work; and shall not my Person be minded and regarded by the Wise, Godly, and the Learned of the Church of Christ, in England, Scotland, France, and Ire∣land, yea, throughout the whole World. Am I not a Member of the Church of Christ in England, and a Member of the City of London? Am I not a Subject to our Royal and Gracious Sovereign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain? What though I am by Birth, Education, and Trade, in∣ferior to many, and by Nature as bad as any, yet he that is Mighty and most Mighty among the Sons of Men, and over the Angels in Hea∣ven, who has put down many Proud and Mighty Angels and Men from their Seat, and has exalted among the Sons of Men many that have been Humble and Meek; this great Lord and King, who doth Try and will Judge the Children of Men, has magnified me among many of them;
but it is with those Graces that makes me ami∣able in his own Eyes, and serviceable for his Glory. Therefore not unto Man, not unto Man, no, nor to the Angels in Heaven, but let all the Glory be given to the God of Heaven, for his great Wisdom, Power, Glory and Majesty, who can do what he will, and work with whom he will among the Sons of Men, to manifest his Wisdom and Power over the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil. Sir, Men are to be minded and regarded, be they High or Low, Rich or Poor, for their Wisdom and their Learning, for their Power and their Strength; for their Honours and their Riches; for their great and high Places; but most of all for their rich Graces, for their Faith, that works by Love, because it is a wonder-working Grace, for the God of Heaven, and a Victorious and a Glorious Grace among the Sons of Men, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of them. Sir, I hope that the Wise, Godly, and the Learned of the Church of England, will not be offended, that I can manifest the power of Faith, for the Glory and the great Glory of the most High, and the great Honour and Exalta∣tion of Englands Royal Majesty, of his Royal Person, and of all his Royal Relations; which will be for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of all Nitions: To that end let all that can pray, Pray for the long Life and prosperous Reign of our Royal Sovereign Charles the Second, King
of Great Britain, and of all his Royal Relati∣ons, that so he and they may long live to Reign for God and with God, among the Sons of Men, from Generation to Generation, and at last for ever with Holy Angels and Men in his Kingdom of Heaven. Sir, It is in vain for the Ministers of the Gos∣pel in London and about London, to preach the Word of God in season and out of season, if they do not mind, and regard, countenance and encourage that Man who hath believed their Report, and to whom the Arm of the Lord is revealed. What have they to mind? Who should they mind more than such a Man who can set to his Seal that God and his Word is true, and their Doctrine so far as they agree thereto? Has not their Per∣sons and their Ministry for a long time been slighted and undervalued by them who are E∣nemies to the Protestant Religion, and to the Government of the Church of England, that for a long time have made Religion a business of Dis∣course to no purpose? But Sir, It will be known to the great Joy and Shame of many a one, that Religion is a Business of the highest Nature and the greatest Conquest; and that, not by the power of the Sword but by the power of Faith, and the Word of God; which will prevail when all the Traditions and Additions of Men will fail. As a Vertuous Woman, Sir, is a Crown to her Hus∣band and the Glory of the Man, so a Wise, Faith∣ful, Vallorous, and a Couragious Man, is a Crown and a Glory to all the Ministers of the Gospel in
the Land; yea, he is a Crown and a Glory to the God of Heaven: He is a Crown and a Glory to a King and a Kingdom; such a Man is a wonder to himself, and will prove a Terror to the Devil, and to the Workers of Evil, who are Engaged with him and for him, against the Pro∣testant Religion, and the Goverment of the Church of England; and that without having a Sword in his hand, or Men or Money at command. Sir, This is from the power of Faith, which is the power of God in Man, and with Man, and for Man; and will make all that are Enemies to God and Man throughout the whole World to tremble. Let not any therefore slight and un∣dervalue a spark of Faith in themselves, or in o∣thers; but let every one labour to get it, to keep it, to prove and improve it; because it is such a Spark, that in whom it is wrought, it will in due time break forth into a Flame, and put the Devil and all the Workers of Evil to shame, and bring a King and a Kingdom to greater Ho∣nour, Renown, and Fame, than has yet been done, by all the Parliaments, Armies, and Coun∣sels, that have been since England has enjoyed a King. Sir, It was by Faith, that I did understand that our Royal Soveraign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, would be the Chiefest and most Renowned Emperor in the World, a∣mong the Sons of Men, for Wisdom, Power and Strength over them; over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the
World. Therefore I was not affraid nor ashamed to make it known in due time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind, that so the times may be better than they have been in this Generation, and many the better for them in all Nations. This is the way that we shall soon, Sir, become the Wonder and the Glory of the World, the Crown of Kingdoms, the De∣sire and the Delight of Nations, the Joy of the whole Earth, and the City of the Great King; for Unity, Peace, and Concord; for Piety and Vertue; for Wisdom, Power and Strength; for Honours, Riches, and great Glory: Therefore let the people praise God, yea, let all Heathen and popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperors in the World praise him, and give unto him the Glory due to his Name; who can do what he will, and work with whom he will among the Sons Men, to manifest his wisdom and power o∣ver them; that so all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World may cease, and among all people in all Nations, a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting peace. Therefore it will be Rebellion for any persons in any Nation for to make War against the Protestants or the Protestant Religion, the Government of the Church of England, or our Royal Soveraign his Majesty of Great Britain, whom the God of peace did bring to his Throne in Peace in a won∣derful manner, beyond the Expectation of the Wisest and the Learned'st in the Nation. And as the Lord, who is the most Wise and most Strong,
Sir, has done great things for the Preservati∣tion and Restauration of our Royal Sovereign; so he will do great things in this Generation, for his great Honour and Exaltation, for his great Joy and Consolation; because he is a Prince for Peace, and a lover of Peace; and because his Subjects do enjoy the greatest Liberty, and are Men of the greatest Wisdom, Courage, and No∣bility. So that Sir, all People in all Nations will come to know and to understand what a great and mighty King our Royal and Gracious Sove∣raign Charles the Second, King of Great Bri∣tain is, among the Sons of Men, for Wisdom, Power, and Strength over them; who can with one of his Subjects bid Defiance to the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil, to their greater Shame, Contempt and Terror, than an Army of Ten hundred thousand Men can; because the Lord of Hosts is with him as a mighty Man, as a Man of War, to subdue his Enemies under his Feet; and as a God of Peace, to cause all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World to cease, to the great Shame of all them that be for Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, for Wars and Confusion. Therefore let the Righteous re∣joyce and be glad, for Light is sown for the Righteous, and Gladness, Sir for the Vpright in Heart; for in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign will the Righteous flourish, and in his days there will be abundance of Peace, from the Wisdom and the Power of the God of Peace.
So that Sir, The Devil, the Author and the Cause of all Evil among the Sons of Men, will be ashamed and confounded, because he shall not do what he would do, to make Strife and Contention, Sedition and Treason, Wars and Confusion among the Sons of Men, to the Ruin of them; but for all the Devils Fury, Rage and Madness against the Sons and Daughters of Men, the Righteous will live and die in Peace, to the Terror of him. Sir, The Devil knows that I hate him, and will set the whole World against him; for he has made too many Fools of Quakers among the Sons of Men: And is it not time for me to make him shake and tremble in his Den, but not by the power of Men, but by the power of Faith, which is the power of the God of Heaven. I shall not fear him nor spare him, for he shall have no Rest nor Quietness among the Sons of Men, as long as I have a Being among them. Sir, As an Ointment and Perfume doth re∣joyce the Heart, so doth the Sweetness of a Man's Friend by hearty Counsel. It is good Counsel for all the Sons and Daughters of Men for to hate what is Evil, and then they will be free from the power and Dominion of the Devil. Would the Sons and the Daughters of Men be Wise, Strong, Rich, and Honourable in the Sight of God and Holy Angels; then they must not be affraid nor ashamed to be Righteous, and to love Righteousness: For it is Righteousness, and only Righteousness Sir, that will Exalt a Person,
be he High or Low, Rich or Poor, Learned or Unlearned, with an Ornament of Grace and a Crown of Glory, which the Devil nor the World cannot give nor take away: But it is not the Righteousness of Saints, or the Righteousness of Angels that will Exalt a Person; but it is the Righteousness of Christ. Every one by Faith must put him on for him∣self and upon himself, as a Garment, as an Or∣nament, as a Royal Robe, as a Breast-plate a∣gainst the Fiery Darts of the Devil. They must put him on as a Helmet of Salvation, and as a Crown of Glory. They that by Faith put him on, must never put him off; but must own and make their Boast of him, more than the Men of the World can do of their Silver and Gold, of their Houses and Lands, of their Offices and great Places; because they be not satisfying, abiding, nor long lasting. But Sir, They that be clothed with the Sun of Righteousness, have that which is abiding, satisfying, lasting, and everlasting; Peace ever∣lasting, and everlasting Joy; and all the De∣lights and Pleasures that the Mind and the Soul of Man is capable to enjoy. He is the Bread of Life, the Water of Life, the Fountain of Life, and the Souls Spring-Garden for Pleasures and De∣light. All the Delights and Pleasures that be a∣mong all the Sons of Men, and all the Angels in Heaven, are Ten thousand times more in Christ; for in him is all Fulness and all Sweet∣ness; the richest Treasures, and the sweetest Plea∣sures:
Happy be they that do know their In∣terest in him, and thrice happy be they that do make an Improvement of him; because Sir, the Merchandize of him is better than the Merchan∣dize of Silver, and the Gain that comes from him is better than that of Fine Gold; he is more precious than Rubies, and all the things Men can desire is not to be compared unto him. Length of days, Sir, is in his Right Hand, and in his Left Hand Riches and Honour; yea, du∣rable Riches and Honour. They that do love him will inherit Substance, that will for ever last and flourish; but they that do not love and delight in him, will enjoy only Shadows that will soon waste and perish; but the Lord of Life is a Tree of Life, for the Souls Pleasure and Delight, and that not only for a day, but for every day: All the Souls fresh Springs of Joy, Peace and Comfort, is in him and from him. Therefore, Sir, happy be they that do lay hold upon him, and so is every one that doth retain him into the Heart of Love; because he is altogether lovely, and a person most worthy; most wor∣thy to be admired and desired by the Sons and Daughters of Men, because he gave himself for them, and not for the Angels that fell from Heaven. Sir, They that find him, find Life, they find Spiritual Life, and shall have the Comforts of this Life, and a well grounded hope and a full assurance of an Eternal Life. They that find Spi∣ritual Life, will obtain Favour of the Lord,
whose loving kindness is better than life, or all the delights of this World; because Sir, it is the Fountain and the Foundation of all true Honour and Happiness, that Men and Angels are capable to enjoy; yet this great Lord and King, the Jews was so unwise as to slight and undervalue him: They gave him a Crown of Thorns, who only can give them and all the Sons of Men a Crown of Glory. They slighted him, who was a better King than David, a Wiser King than Solomon, a greater and a better Prophet than Moses, a higher and a greater Priest than Aaron. all Kings, Priests, Apostles, Prophets and Martyrs Sir; all Righteous and Holy Men; all Wise, Strong, Rich and Learned Men, that are, that have been, or ever will be in the World; they have their Wisdom, their Power and their Strength, their Honours, their Riches, their great and high Places from him, by his permission, and du∣ring his will and pleasure. To him all must give an account, for their health, strength and liberty, and all the means of grace they have enjoyed; and what improvement they have made of his Word, and of his Spirit, which he has con∣tinued from Generation to Generation, for the Information and Reformation of all Nations. Sir, He is able and willing to save unto the uttermost all that come unto him, Jews and Gentiles, Bond and Free, Male and Female, be they where they will and who they will; for there is no name under Heaven, where by any can be saved from Con∣demnation, from everlasting Wrath and Damna∣tion,
but by him who is the Way, the Truth and the Life: He is near unto all that call upon him in Truth, for the Prayer of the Upright is his Delight. They that seek him, Sir, with their whole Heart, Soul, and Strength, will find him and all good things with him, and in him; that which Eye hath not seen, nor Ear hath not heard; nor the Heart of Man is not able to con∣ceive: For the Heavens, the Earth, and the Sea, and all the Fulness that is in them, they are his, for all things were made by him and for him, that are in Heaven and in the Earth, whe∣ther they be Thrones or Dominions, or Princi∣palities, or Powers; for by his Wisdom and Power the whole Creation doth consist. For it pleased the Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Sir, that in him, in his onely beloved Son, should all Fulness dwell; Fulness of Merit, and of Spirit; Fulness of Wisdom, and of Power; Fulness of Righteousness and Holiness; and Ful∣ness of all Grace and Glory; to make all that come unto him Wise, Strong, Rich, Honou∣rable, and most Happy. But they that will not, Sir, deny themselves, overcome themselves, and lay out themselves, to come unto him; they will not enjoy themselves in the midst of many En∣joyments in the World. But, Sir, Their Lives will be uncomfortable to themselves, and unpro∣fitable to others; because they cannot be fruitful in good Works, till they come to Christ, stay with him, and abide in him; then they will be useful and fruitful in their Generation, for the good of
many in the Nation: then, Sir, they will come to be Plants of Renown, and will flourish in the Courts of Gods House, and bring forth pleasant and profitable Fruit in due time and season, that will revive and refresh the City of God, which is the Church of Christ in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; yea, throughout the whole World. But Sir, Unprofitable Branches, that be in his Vineyard, that will not bring forth the Fruits of Righteousness, which is Faith, Love, and Obedience; he will take away and cut down as Branches and Trees that cumber the Ground. Sir, The Righteous Persons, be they where they will, they be the most Excellent Persons in the Earth; because they be most Fruitful in their Generation, for the great Honour of God, the King, and the Nation. The Lord loveth the Righteous, let who will hate them; he knows the worth of them, they are, Sir, his Plants of Renown, his Glory and his Crown, and the Labour and Travel of his Soul. The Lord that loveth the Righteous doth preserve them, and watch over them as his Treasure; because in them he takes pleasure. Sir, They be a Foundation to a Nation, and do many times preserve a Nation from Desola∣tion. The Righteous Persons, Sir, should be minded and regarded by the Sons of Men, because they be the Light of the World for them. The Righteous Persons are most useful and fruitful, for they be the Salt of the Earth, and a City on a
Hill: They be Men of Wonder, and sometimes Men of Thunder. Are they not as fair as the Moon, as Clear as the Sun, and as Terrible as an Army with Banners; because they be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Sir, In the Righteous Lord that loveth Righteousness, I have both Wisdom and Power, Righteousness and Strength: Therefore let not any be offended, but let every one labour to be amended, that so the times may be the better for them, and many the better for the times; for the Lord he waits to be gracious, and doth not delight in the death of Sinners; but had rather that they would turn and live to him and for him, and then they will for ever live with him; in whose presence is fulness of Joy, and at whose right hand are plea∣sures for evermore; that will make amends for all the Tryals, Troubles, Losses, Crosses, and Reproaches, they can meet withal in this life. Sir, This is high and honourable work, plea∣sant, profitable, and delightsome work; victo∣rious, glorious, and crowning work, that will crown the God of Heaven with much Glory a∣mong the Sons of Men; and our Royal and Gra∣cious Sovereign Charles the Second, King of Great Britain, with great Honour and Power over them, over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperors in the World; which will be for the great Honour, Peace, Profit, and Comfort, of all Loyal and Faithful Magistrates and Ministers of the Gospel in all Nations, that have been for a long time slighted and under∣valued
by a Gain-saying, Proud, Stubborn, and Rebellious Generation, that have acted against Law and Religion; against Gospel and Reason: Out of Pride and Contention, they have caused Sedition and Treason, Wars, and great Confu∣sion; but the Expectation of such Men will in due time perish, because they trust to an Arm of Flesh, and make Lies their Refuge; but the Hope of the Righreous is Gladness, because he trusts in the Lord, in the Lord Jehovah; who can and will in this Generation, for the Peace and Prosperity of many Nations, bring Order out of Confusion, Light out of Darkness, and Good out of Evil; when vain has been the help of Man; yea, of many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, to bring it about; but vain is not the help of the God of Heaven, who has all Power in his own hand, and the whole Creation at command. Sir, It is in vain for Men of this Opinion, or that Opinion, for to complain the times are sad, when that by their strife and contentions they have made them so bad. It is Pride that has caused Contention, and Contention Seperation from the Government of the Church of England, which ought not, and would not have been, if that they had minded and regarded the Peace and the Prosperity of the City and the Kingdom. Great has been the Mischief that Separation has made in this Generation; in three Ancient and Renowned Nations, as England, Scotland, and Ireland, Has not Separation caused Mutiny,
and Mutiny Sedition, and Sedition Rebellion, and Rebellion great Disorder and Confusion, a∣mong many Persons and Families in these King∣doms; to the shame of the Protestant Religion, and the Government of the Church of England; so that the times have been the worse for such Men, and many the worse for them; but there is no time too late for that Man that is wise in Heart, for to cause such Men by the Wisdom and Power of God for to smart. The Heart of the Wise, Sir, teacheth his Mouth, and addeth Learning to his Lips. The wise in heart will be called prudent, now Wisdom dwells with Prudence, which will enable a Man for to hearken unto Counsel, and to attain unto great Counsels; so as to know when and how in due time and season, for to Counsel Councellors, and to inform Senators; not onely what may be done, but what is best to be done; for the great Ho∣nour, the Peace, and the Prosperity of a King and Kingdom. Sir, A King and a Kingdom, may stand in need of a Parliament, and an Army of Men; but the Lord of Hosts, who is the King of Glory, and the Prince of Peace, stands not in need of any of them; but can work with them or without them, when and by whom he please, for to manifest his Wisdom and Power among the Sons of Men; for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Joy, Peace, and prosperity of many Nations; which will be brought about in this Generation, for Englands
great Honour and Exaltation, to the Worlds Ad∣miration. O great is the Wisdom and Power of God in Man, with Man, and for Man; when and by whom he please for to make bare his Arm; that so all the Glory may redound to him, and that no Flesh should glory before him; because all the Sons of Men, have their Wisdom, their Power, and their Strength from him, that is comfortable to themselves and profitable to o∣thers; for both the preparation of the Heart, and the answer of the Tongue, it is from the Lord: For the way of Man is not in himself; it is not in Man that walketh for to direct his steps, much less to order his thoughts; but the steps of a good Man, and so his thoughts are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way; for the way of the Lord is strength to upright, but destruction will be to the workers of iniquity, in this Generation, to their great shame and condemnation; who are for strife and con∣tention, sedition and treason; for wars and con∣fusion. Therefore let all them that be wise, be lovers of peace, and workers of righteousness, and then the Lord, who is a lover of righteous∣ness, will encourage them, assist them, and reward them. Let all labour to be wise in heart, because that they among the Sons of Men, will best understand the Mind of the God of Heaven; they will know how to do his will, and keep in his love and favour, which is better than life, and
all the delights of this World; but the wisdom that is in the World, among too many of the Sons of Men, it is foolishness, and doth many times end in madness, because they do not make the Word of God their Rule, his Spirit their Guid, and his Glory their Aim; but they that do, will never want a wise Councellor, and a most ex∣cellent Comforter. Sir, In the work of Faith, and in the labour of Love, for the Peace and Prosperity of many Persons in all Nations; I shall for the present take my leave, and shall remain your true and loving Friend John Varney, a Member of the Church of England, and of the City of London, a Subject to his Majesty of Great Britain, and Servant to the God of all Wisdom, Power, and Strength; who can do what he will, and work with whom he will, among the Sons of Men, to manifest his Wisdom and PoWer over rhem; that so all Strife, Contention, and Wars through∣out the whole World may cease, and amoug all People in all Naons  Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace: Therefore Glory, and great Glory be given to the most high, from Men and Angels, and that continually; foe his great Wisdom, Power, Glory, any Majesty; and great Honour and Renown, grreat Joy, Peace and Prosperity, from the most High, upon Englands Royal Majesty, upon his Royal Person, and all his Royal Relations; that so he and they may long live to Reign for God and with God, among the Sons of Men, for the great Joy and
Prosperity of them; and at last for ever with him, among the Holy Angels in his Kingdom of Heaven. Amen, Amen, let all Loyal and Faithful Subjects in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, say and pray: yea, all Persons, in all Nations, that do love the Peace and Pro∣sperity of their own Souls, and the Comfort of their Lives. August 30th. 1680. FNS.
