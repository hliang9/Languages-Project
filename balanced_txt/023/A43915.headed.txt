THE EPISTLE TO THE READER. I Need not say much in the praise of this Book, but rather leave it to the censure of the impartial Reader, who I doubt not will find such pleasure in perusing it, that he will never think his time ill bestowed upon that occasion; for in it, as in a mirror, is plainly de∣monstrated all the follies of extravagant Youth, the vanity of aspiring greatness, the trouble, perplexity and hazards, that commonly attend upon Riches; as likewise the malice, subtilty and cunning devices of wicked men; together with the snares that are layed by false and dis∣sembling Women to intrap the too too credulous Youths, and then to plunge them into an Ocean of misery, which many times drives them upon the dangerous Rock of dispair, or causes them to take bad courses to maintain that pride and gallantry from whence they are fallen, which in the end most commonly brings them to shame and disgrace: In it are likewise contained many cautions how to avoid danger, and to fore∣see the same. It being composed of large experience, partly Commical and partly Tragical: giving not only an account of the Life, strange Adventures, and Death of the party from whom it takes its name, but likewise of several as well Kings and Princes as others. As also a de∣scription of many strange Countries, with their manners, customes, and commodities: And to conclude, is so delightful that none of this nature have excelled it; it being written as well for pleasure as pro∣fit.

THE HISTORY OF FORTUNATUS. CHAP. I. Of the Parentage and Birth of Fortunatus. IN Famogosta a Famous City in the Isle of Cyprus, lived one Theodorus descended of Noble Patentage, who by the Decease of his Father, had a plentiful E∣state fell into his hands; but he being of a haughty Mind, gave himself wholly up to the Pleasures and Vanity of the World: He associated himself with the Great Men of the Country, and lived riotously, spending his time for the most part in Gaming, Hunting, Hawking, and Sumptuous
Entertainments, the which in a short time greatly diminished his Estate; which his Friends perceiving, and being much grieved there∣at, thought there was no better way to restrain his Licentious man∣ner of Life, than by matching him to a Wife. This being resolved upon, and he not contradicting the Motion, they sought for a fair, young and vertuous Lady throughout all the Citys of Cyprus, and at last in Nicova found one that well-liked them, she being Daughter to a Wealthy Merchant, and adorned with all the Perfections that appertain to Womankind, her Name being Gratiana: to this Lady by the Consent of her Father, The∣odorus was shortly married, and for a time lived in great Splen∣dor, the first Year having by her a fair Son, whom they named For∣tunatus; but this little or nothing restrained his Extravagancies: Insomuch that in a short time after the Marriage, notwithstanding the large Portion he had with his Wife, he was brought to extream Poverty, which made him repent, though now too late; so that often∣times being hunger-pined, and in great want, he looking upon his Son (who by this time was a comely Youth) would sigh and let fall Tears, which so afflicted the Young-man, that he one day de∣manded the Cause, desiring to know whether he had offended him in ought, the which if he had he would strive to amend it: To whom the sorrowful Father replied, He had never offended him; but it was the exceeding Penury to which by his Extravagancies he was reduced to that maded as he saw: To which the Youth replied, Let not that trouble you, for as for me, I have received such good Education un∣der you, that I can shift for my self in any place of the World; but he perceiving his Father still troubled, and alwaies sigh when he looked upon him, he conjectured it was for his sake, and therefore resolved to be no longer chargeable to him: Whereupon one Day ta∣king his Stick in his hand, he went to the Sea-side, where he had not staied long, but a Gasly put to shore, in which was the Earl of Flan∣ders, who was returned from Jerusalem; they had not been long on shore to refresh themselves, but the Earl caused the Trumpet to sound, to call his men back into the Galley; which Fortunatus per∣ceiving, and being desirous to Travel, went to the Earl and offer∣ed him his Service: When the Earl perceiving him a goodly Youth,
and having by reason of sickness, lost two of his men by the way, he entertained him; when as the Earl and Fortunatus being on Board, they set Sail, and in a short time arrived at Venice. woodcut of Fortunatus and the Earl boarding a ship with two men on it repetitive woodcut of multiple trees CHAP. II. How Fortunatus departed his Country, and how he became greatly esteemed by the Earl. AFter some Contests with the Winds and Sea, the Galley safe∣ly arrived at Venice, where the Earl and his Men landed; and there by the help of Fortunatus (who amongst all his men could onely speak the Language) he bought rich Iewels, and Gold Im∣broderies, in order to his Marriage, he being to Wed the Duke of Cleves Daughter at his return, to whom he had been Contracted before his departure. By these and such other Services, Fortunatus gained the Love of his Lord; insomuch that the rest of the Servants began to envy him: A while after the Earl coming into his own Country, bought all his Servants Horses, and gave to Fortuna∣tus the best next what himself rod on; so that it greatly grieved the rest of the Servants, who wished the Devil had had the Italian before he came into their Lords Service. A while after the Marriage
being Celebrated, a great number of Nobility being present, Tilts and Iusts were prepared, where after the Nobles had done great Feats, the Earl set up two Iewels valued at a hundred pounds, for the Servants who should do best; upon which Fortunatus prepared his Horse, and soon with his Lance overthrew one of them that run against him, whereupon he carried away the Prize; then one Ti∣mothy having won the other Iewel, the Servants urged Timothy to Iust with Fortunatus, who should have them both; but in the Conflict Timothy was born down Horse and Man, so that Fortuna∣tus woodcut of a joust repetitive woodcut of multiple trees got not onely both the Iewels, but the great Applause of the Spectators, and the greater Favour of the Earl, who highly praised him, telling them by what chance he had met with him: whereupon the Nobles and Ladies gave him many Presents; this more and more raised the Malice of his Fellow-servants against him; but when they well perceived that they could do nothing against him fairly, they wrought by subtilty: for there being amongst the rest one Robert an ancient Servant to the Earl, who promised for Ten Crowns to make Fortunatus run away; to this they gladly heark∣ned, and every one paid his Dividend most joyfully: when this was done, he insinuates himself into the company of Fortunatus, ex∣pressing
more than ordinary kindness, carrying him abroad to Treats, and other Meriments, without suffering him to pay ought; this Fortunatus imagining to proceed from the intire good will he bore him, he gave the greater credit to all he said, not perceiving his subtilty: When the Money was almost spent, and the Servants began to put Robert in mind of his Promise, he one day taking Fortunatus into a private Apartment, after several Dis∣courses, he began to sigh and look sad, which Fortunatus well no∣ting, demanded the Cause, who told him it was for his sake: then was he earnest to know the Reason; truly said Robert it was told me by my singular good Friend, who upon a great Penalty enjoyned me Secrecy, but for the Love and good Will I bare to you, I shall reveal it. Then thus our Lord intends to Morrow to Ride to Lau∣san, to wage Law against the Earl of St. Paul, where for the jea∣lousie he had lately conceived of his Chamberlains, least they should either have carnal Copulation with his beateous Wife, or any of her fair Ladies and Gentlewomen that attended her, he is resolved to have them all Gelded, and though he entirely loves you above any of his Servants, yet he cannot serve the rest so while you take part with them in the same, you being chief Chamberlain, and the most comely amongst them, after which he will only reveal it ho his Lady, forbidding her to reveal it; but as the manner of Women is, it cannot be expected that she will keep the Secret long; so that it be∣ing spread abroad, it will redoun to your utter Disgrace, if the cut∣ting do not hazard your Life: this I learned from him who is ap∣pointed to Geld you, he telling it me (as thinking I might be one of the Chamberlains) in requital of some singular Favours I had done him. When Fortunatus heard this he looked as pale as Death; and de∣sired Robert by all the Ties of Friendship, that he would be assisting to him in making his escape; for said he, I would not be Gelded if my Lord would give me his Earldom: When he talked of Flight, the Hypocrite Robert feigned himself sad, and desired his stay, the better to perswade him into a Belief of what he had related, telling him he was sorry that ever he had Imparted it to him; but Fortu∣natus standing as it were upon thorns, thought every hour ten, till
he was gone; then Robert bid him in what place soever he resided, send him a Letter, that when the Earl was supplied with Gelded-men, he might give notice to return: But Fortunatus replied, he would never return, though he endured never such necessity or want. Vpon this Robert inwardly cejoyced, and helping him to a horse, he rod out of the City as if he went on hunting, and having passed the Gate, set on full speed and never looked behind him, till he thought himself out of Danger, and purchasing another horse, he sent back the Earls, lest upon that account he might be pursued. CHAP. III. How the Earl grieved for the Departure of Fortunatus; and what befel him afterwards. NO sooner the flight of Fortunatus came to the Earls Ear, but he was exceeding sorry, musing with himself what should be the Cause; but when he could think of none, he demanded of his Ser∣vants if they were privy to the Occasion of his Departure, but they denied they knew ought: then he examined his Lady and her Gentle∣women who were there at the same time, saying, that the Evening be∣fore he was very pleasant, and had discoursed to them about several Affairs of Women, and other things; at which the Earl marvelled the more, saying, Although he could not then learn the true Cause of his Departing without taking leave of him, he doubted not but that he should find it out, and he would severely punish the Occa∣sioner of it: This terrified Robert, so that he grew very Melan∣choly, lest any of the Servants should betray him; and thereupon he took an Oath of Secrecy of them all, and when they were importu∣nate to know by what means he had effected it, he told them a story of his Fathers Advancement by the King of Cyprus, quite contrary to what he had practised. But to return to Fortunatus: Fortunatus being on his way, made what spéed he could to Calice, where espying an English Ship, he bargained with the Master to Transport him into England, where arriving, he came to London,
where he hapned into the company of two young Cyprus Merchants, who were sent over by their Fathers too, with a Ship laden with costly Wares, for which they had received great Sums of Money: And now Fortunatus being expert in the Manners and Customs of most Countries, became as it were their Tutor or Instructor; so that they spent beyond measure, Rioting it all the Day at Taverns, and at Night sporting it with Harlots, each one striving to out-do the other in Excess; nor was Fortunatus wanting to spend amongst them: but within a while all their Money being spent, their Burom Lasses forsook them, and all their Iollitry came to an end, which made the Merchants bethink themselves of Returning home, which they did in the same Ship they came in, though with heavy hearts and empty Purses, leaving Fortunatus behind them. CHAP. IV. How Fortunatus became a Servant, and how one wicked An∣drew by murdering a Gentleman in the house of Fortunatus's Master, brought the whole Family in great trouble. FOrtunatus being bare of Money and in a strange Country, knew not well what course to take; but at last resolved to get over into France, but wanted Money to pay his Passage; when gorng to a Harlot on whom he spent the greatest part of his money, he desired her to lend him two Crowns, telling her that he was to go over Sea to fetch Four hundred Crowns that his Vncle owed him; but she would by no means lend him any, nor scarcely make him drink, but sent him away with flouts: Then seeing his former Folly, he wished, (though too late) that he had kept his Money, and not have spent it upon such an ungrateful Baggage; so that not having Money to pay for his Passage, he betook himself to the Service of one Jeroni∣mus Roberti, a Florentine Merchant in Lombard-street, where he lived with great Credit, pleasing his Master beyond measure by his Diligence and towardness, and in a short time gained not onely the Love of his Mistris, but of all the Servants: Insomuch that his
Master not onely intrusted him with all his Cash, but employed him in his main Affairs; as taking in his Merchandize, and other things of secret and weighty Concernment, whereby he not onely advanta∣ged himself, but also by his faithful Discharge of the Trust com∣mitted to him; he greatly advantaged his Master, insomuch that he became dear to him; but he had not long continued in his Service, before an Extravagant Florentine came to his Master, whose Name was Andrew, the Son of a very responsible Merchant, who had been fitted out with a Ship and all manner of Merchandize, the which he had sold and imbezled at a lavish Rate; and thereupon was driven to extream Poverty, which obliged him to live by his Wits; so that bethinking himself, he counterfeited Bills of Exchange, and by that means so drained his Father of what Monies he had, that in expe∣ctation of what should be returned by Merchandize, he utterly Im∣poverished him; the which when he perceived, and that no more Mo∣ney was to be had, he betook himself to Shifts, and being at Bruges, the place were he had spent the greatest part of his Money, he began to bethink himself that it was in vain for him to return, by reason of the great Injury he had done his Father, and then again considering that those whom he had spent his Monies upon, began to slight him, and that he could neither borrow any, nor be trusted for such conve∣nient things as were appertaining to the Supply of Nature, he much condoled and bewailed his sad Condition whereinto by reason of his Extravagancy he was fallen, and resolved whatever bety'd him to return to his Father; when in his Travels homeward he came to the City of Turene in France, where by his Host he under∣stood that a Merchant of London, upon a spiteful Accusation, lay in Irons in a dark Dungeon, and that he being very rich, would plen∣tifully reward any One that would go over into England and solicite his Business, so that he might be delivered. At this News An∣drew rejoyced not a little, and thereupon asked his Host whether free access might be had to this Merchant? To which the Host an∣swered, that for a small piece of money he might so far prevail with the Keeper as to admit him to the speech of the Merchant: Where∣upon he resolved to make the best of his time, preparing a Ducket for that purpose, for which the Keeper joyfully let him in; when he
was entred the Prison or Dungeon, by a Light that he had with him, he espied the Merchant who lay fast Fettered in Irons, to whom he addressed himself in English; upon which the Merchant was not a little over-joyed, asking him if he knew such and such Persons, a∣mong whom he named Jeronimo Roberti; to which he replied, that he knew him very well, and that he had not onely been acquainted with him in England, but likewise in the City of Florence; then he shewed him the Cause of his Imprisonment, which was for Forging the King of Englands Pass-port, desiring him out of all love that he would speedily repair to London; and shew unto his Friends in what a sad condition he lay, and how pitifully he had been handled since his coming into that Prison, and to desire them to solicite his Enlargement, for which he would not only think himself Infinitely Obliged to him, but would reward him with Five hundred Crowns. At this welcom News Andrew did not a lictle rejoyce, so that ta∣king some monies of him to bear his Charges, he departed, promi∣sing to do his best in order to his Delivery; and thereupon took Ship∣ping for England, and coming to London, he made it his business to go from place to place to the Merchants Friends, as also to the Court, where he understood he could not be released unless he payed a Fine of Three thousand Crowns, the which Jeronimo Roberti promised to lay down upon Security: So that Andrew going from place to place to get one to enter into Bonds for the Sum, at last understood that the King having married his Daughter to the Duke of Burgundia, resolved to make her a Present of the richest Iewels that might be got, having already caused his Iewellers to make them, and deliver them to a trusty Knight, who was appointed to convey them to her. At this Andrew inwardly rejoyced; and now despairing of getting Security of the Sum of Money demanded, he resolved not to lose his labour of coming into England; and there∣upon by his frequenting the Court, got acquainted with the Iewel-Bearer, and finding out a fit Opportunity, told him that he was by Birth a Florentine, and by Profession a Ieweller; and forasmuch as he heard the King of England was minded to purchase the best Iewels he could get, he had come out of his own Country with a parcel of such Iewels as he believed the like were not to be had in
England; and thereupon desired the Gentleman to let him see those he had in charge, the which he readily did, not dreaming of his de∣sign. When Andrew had well viewed them, and by their fairness could not imagin less but that they were of a great value, he told the Gen∣tleman that many of his exceeded them, not only in Lustre but in Virtue, as being Stones of a different Nature, especially one Lock∣et of Black Diamonds which he had purchased of a Jew, who lately came from the Indies: upon this the Gentleman told him, that if he might but see them, he doubted not but that the King would at least purchase some of them, and thereupon he desired him to stay and dine with him, the which he did, and after dinner, Andrew invited the Gentleman to come the next Day to Jeronimus Roberti's House to dine with him, and that there he should have a sight of them: this he consented to, and leave taken, Andrew went to Jeronimus Roberti and informed him, that he had met with a Gentleman of a good Estate, who for the love he bore to the Merchant would become bound for the 3000 Crowns, and withal told him; that he intended to be there the next Day, and therefore he advised him to prepare a dinner to en∣tertain him, and not to speak any thing to him about his Surety-ship till he should give the Signet; to this Jeronimus consented, as well knowing he should have good Interest for his Money. The next Day the Gentleman came, and the Table being spread, they sat down to dinner, and there discoursed of Divers Affairs, when after they were risen from the Table, Andrew took the Gentleman by the hand and led him up stairs pretending to shew him his Iewels, and there ta∣king his opportunity before the Gentleman was aware, with a Dagger that he had provided for the purpose, he stobb'd him, so that he sunk down dead, and then taking his Signet and his Keys he got away unespyed, and hasted to the Gentlemans House, where meeting with his Wife, he told her that her Husband had received Orders instantly to depart for the Duke of Burgundies Court, and that she must send the Iewels, by the same token there was his Signet and his Keys of his Cabinet, which the Gentlewoman taking of Andrew, went and unlocked the Cabinet, and, not finding the Iewels there, returned and told him, that her Husband must come and look them himself; for they
were not there: upon this Andrew departed much perplexed that he had missed of his aim, and long time he Pondered whether he should return to Jeronimus, or fly; during which space, Jeronimus coming into his Hall, perceived blood to drop through the Sealing, and there∣upon commanded his Servants to run up and find out the cause, where they no sooner came but they found the Gentleman Murthered, at which they were much amazed, and hasted down to relate the same to their Master: who took an hateing that any such thing should be done in his House, and knew not what to do in the business as being but a stranger in England, and not well acquainted with the Laws. CHAP. V. How Andrew returned to Jeronimus's House and disposing of the dead body, afterward made his escape; and how the Murther being found out, Jeronimus and all his Servants were Imprisoned. WHilst the whole Family were in great perplexity about the Mur∣ther, in came the Villain that acted it, to whom Jeronimus said; O thou wicked wretch! what mischief hast thou done in Mur∣thering an Innocent Gentleman in my House; not so, replyed An∣drew, for he was a very Cut-throat, and would have stabbed me, in hopes of getting some Treasure which he supposed I had in a Trunk which I opened; but now the business is past, it cannot be recalled, be therefore advised by me, shew no sad Countenance, nor cause of Grief: for I will so dispose of the Body, that it shall never be found hereaf∣ter, and if any are Inquirers for the Person, you must tell them that he departed from your House about an hour after dinner, and that since that time he returned not. And thereupon Andrew took up the Body, and bringing it down stairs, threw it into the Privy with the Head downwards, and then gave order for the washing away the Blood, after which, understanding that Jeronimus had a design to ap∣prehend him; he privily got over a back wall and so made his escape,
woodcut of Andrew carrying a dead man over his shoulder; woodcut repeated on p. 41 not staying till he came to Venice, where he became a Rower in a Gally or Pirate: and a while after renounced the Christian Re∣ligion. The Gentleman being two days missing at Court, many began to wonder, and the third day acquainted the King thereof, who began to mistrust: that the great value of his charge might have made him false though otherwise, a Gentleman of undoubted Reputation and Fidelity; upon which a Messenger was sent to his House to In∣quire for him, and was informed by his Wife, that she had not seen him in three days: but that at his departure he went in the Compa∣ny of a Florentine, who pretended to have great store of Iewels at the House of one Jeronimus Roberti a Florentine, Merchant in Lom∣bard-street, and that a while after their departure, the same person came with her Husbands Keys and Ring, desiring her to send the Iewels, but she looking for them in his Cabinet, found them not there. With this answer they returned to the King, who was greatly displeased, but that he might not seem over rashly to censure the Fide∣lity of the Knight, although he concluded he was fled, he gave order that nothing more should be done in it till the end of two days, in which space Fortunatus returning from on Ship-board (where he had
been taking an account of the ladeing) perceived not only his Master, but all his fellow Servants very melancholly; upon which, he de∣manded of the Maid what was the cause of such their suddain alterati∣on, to whom she answered (as having before-hand premeditated an ex∣cuse) that her Master had received a Letter of the Death of a dear Friend of his, which had occasioned that sadness in him; and that with him the rest Simpathized as is the Custom of their Country, but that he not being his near Relation, he would not go into Mourn∣ing for him, with which Fortunatus was well pleased. But now the two days being expired, and no tidings of the Gentleman; the King in a great rage sent his Pursevants to search his House, who broke o∣pen as many Trunks, Chests and Cabinets, as they found locked, in it found not the Iewels: upon which, at the Supplication of the Gentlewoman (who said she verily believed her Husband was Mur∣thered) they went to the House of Jeronimus, where having the Kings Warrant, they apprehended him and all his Family upon Suspicion of Murther, but they all denied it, saying: Indeed there was such a man there, but that he departed thence in the Company of the Person who brought him thither, and that since they saw him not: but this excuse availed not, for they all (being nine in number, of which Fortunatus was one) were delivered to the Sheriffs, who carryed them to Newgate, where they were kept asunder, and were strictly examined, but they all declared as before: as for Fortunatus, he was ignorant of the matter and therefore could not confess, upon which the Sheriffs were ordered to search Jeronimus's House, the which they accordingly did, and looked in all the Chests, Trunks, Closets, Cellers, Pantries and Stables, but found not the dead Bo∣dy, and so were about to depart, when one amongst the rest having a Torch in his hand, lighted some Paper and threw it down into the Privy, whereby reason of the shallowness of the Ordure, the Legs of the party Murthered appeared, he being cast in with his Head down∣ward, which he no sooner perceived by the Light, but he called to the rest, telling them that he had found the Murthered Corps, and there∣upon they all coming together drew it out, and after having cleansed it with Water, they layed it in the Street before the Door of Jeroni∣mus, for to be seen of all People, who with great Detestation and sha∣king
of their Heads abhorred the Fact: as also a Messenger was sent to acquaint the King what they had found, upon which he gave order for the Racking Jeronimus, and the rest, to force them to confess where the Iewels were, for he supposed that they had Murthered him for the Iewels; when they being stretched upon the Rack, and in ex∣ceeding torment, confessed the true manner of the Murther as it is before recited. But Fortunatus, although he was tormented with the rest, could not give any account of the Murther by reason of his absence when the Fact was committed; but as for the Iewels, they all protested they knew not any thing of them. CHAP. VI. How Jeronimus Roberti, and seven of his Servants were Hang∣ed for the Murther, and how Fortunatus was saved at the Place of Execution. NOtwithstanding they made their Confession, how and upon what casion the Murther was Committed, it availed them nothing; for the King issued out a Commission to try them, where cheir own Confessions and the finding of the Murthered Corps in the House being proved against them they were found Guilty, and being Con∣demned, were shortly carried to the Place of Execution; a pair of woodcut of nine men and a king at the gallows Gallows being built for that purpose, where they were urged to Con∣fess where the Iewels were, but they declared they never saw them,
nor could they give any account of them. So that first Jeronimus was turned off, and then an other, so one after another till none were left but the Cook and Fortunatus, who now began to make a thou∣sand wry faces, as giving themselves over for gone, but when the Cooke came to be turned off, he desired to speak a word or two, which was the readyer granted because they supposed he might tell what was become of the Iewels; but silence being made, he said Fortunatus was altogether innocent of the Fact as being abroad about his occa∣sions when it was done, and that he knew not of the Body being in the Privy, by reason they all concealed it from him; and therefore if he did dye, he dyed innocently and wrongfully. At the hearing of this, the People prevailed so far with the Sheriff, as to stay till the King might be Advertized of what had been related; who upon the hearing thereof, and at the earnest Suit of some Ladys (who had cast their Eyes upon Fortunatus, and seeing him a goodly Youth, were moved to pitty him) the King sent his Mandate to the Sheriff to save his Life; who thereupon, after he had fastned the rest in Chains to the Gallows, brought back Fortunatus, and in a while after set him at Liberty. At that time also the King commanded Jeronimus's House to be spoiled, where every one took what best liked him; of which the rest of the Florentines hearing they were sore afraid, and least the Multitude who were greatly incenced against them should break into their Hou∣ses and spoil them also, they layed their Heads together and at last con∣cluded to raise a considerable Summ of Money and lend to the King to regain his good Affection towards them, upon which they were re∣ceived into Favour, and a Proclamation put out in their behalfs, for∣biding any to abuse them, but that they should let them freely Traf∣fick as before.
CHAP. VII. How afterward all the ewels were found by the Widdow of the Murthered Gentleman, and by her restored to the King. AFter the Execution, the King supposing the Murtherer to have carried away the Iewels he put forth his Proclamation; offering 1000 Crowns to any that would discover them or return them again. Further, he sent to all the noted deellers in the neigh∣bouring Kingdoms, to stop any such Iewels if they should be offer∣ed to be sould; but after all this they were found under the bed of the Murthered Gentleman; the manner of their being discovered was thus. About a Month after the Murther the Gentleman being de∣cently buryed, several of the Neighbours came to Comfort the Dis∣consolate Widdow, and perceiving her still to be troubled for the loss of her Husband, one amongst the rest who was in the same condition with her but of a merrier temper, bid her chear up, and by thinking of the Livsng put the Dead out of her Remembrance, telling her that the best way to do it, was to remove her Bed into an other Chamber, so that the Remembrance of past pleasures might be forgot, and that by fixing her thoughts upon some lusty young Lover, the Remembrance of her Dead Husband might be done away, adding that she had done the same, and found the greatest Consolation therein; but the Gentle∣woman replyed, O how shall I forget so good a Husband, who ten∣dred me as dear as his Life? had he been bad I might have done it; yet after their departure she went to remove her Bed, and had scarce drawn it two foot, but under it she espyed a little Casket the which she took up, and having opened it, she (to her great joy) found all the Iewels therein; and thereupon sent to a Kinsman of hers whom she could best trust to ask his advice how she should bestow them, and when he came, she first told him the manner of her finding them, and af∣terwards shewed them to him; who after some consideration, advi∣sed her to carry them her self to the King, saying, that if they were offered to be sold they would be stoped, and then her Life might come
in danger: to this advice of her Cosins she gladly consented, so that away thy went, and after some Attendance got to be admitted into the Kings presence, where kneeling before him, she said, Most Gra∣cious Liege, I am come humbly to present you with the Iewels, for which my dear Husband lost his life. As I was removing my Bed this day, I found them under it, and with that she delivered the Casket, which the King opening and perceiving they were all there, he greatly rejoyced; saying, Forasmuch as you have been thus faith∣ful, you shall not go unrewarded: As for the loss of your Husband, I, as well as you are not a little grieved, therefore to repair the loss I will choose you another; and thereupon called a Knight, and com∣manded him to marry her, the which the Knight consenting to, as not being willing to disoblige the King the Ceremonies of their Marriage was celebrated in the Kings presence; and now said the King, I Endow you with my Mannor of Woodstock, with a Thou∣sand pounds a year to continue Yours during both your Lives, and thereupon he dismissed them: so that the Bride departed joyful that such good Fortune had befallen, and went to all her Gossips to ac∣quaint them with the same, giving the Widow many Thanks for her seasonable Advice, saying, If she had not removed the Bed, the Iewels might have stood there time out of mind, telling her that she would always make use of her Counsel for the future. CHAP. VIII. How Fortunatus having got over Sea lost himself, in a Wood in France; and of his Encountring with, and killing a wild Bear that came to devour him. THe dread of Hanging and his narrow Escape, so terrified For∣tunatus, that he did not think himself safe so long as he trod upon English Ground: Whereupon he made what haste he could to pass the Seas, so that having got on Board a Ship in which his dead Master used to Trafick, she set Sail for France, where they set him on shoar; and now he being Moniless, thought the best way
was to get him a Master, but after a long Inquiring, finding none that would Entertain him, he resolved to Travel further; when being belated in a large Forest, where few Passengers travelled, he struck out of the Road into a Cross-way, which led him into further Inranglements: for not being able to find any end of the Wood, when Evening came, he sat him down and began to lament himself, being both Hungry and a Thirst; yet there he sate, not daring to sleep for fear of the wild Beasts, which he heard make hidious noise from many parts, and who in the Night usually range for Prey; but that Night escaping any Encounter with them, the next Day he got up and went onwards, but at last was so intangled in the Thickets, that he could hardly go either backwards or forwards; but at last he found some Water, of which, drinking freely out of his Hat, he made his Dinner of Berries and Cornel, and so passed over that day. The next Night the Moon began to shine, and as he was sitting, and greatly bewailing his Condition, he heard a rustling in the Leaves, looking up he perceived a huge Bear coming towards him, whose ugly sight did not a little terrifie him; whereupon to avoid her fury, he got up the Tree that stood next him, thinking to continue repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of Fortunatus stabbing a bear with a sword there till such time as the Bear was passed by, but she having espied him, began to climb the Tree after him, and withal made such a hi∣dious
noise, that she caused several other Beasts to repair thither; The Bear having got up the hardest part of the Tree, pursued For∣tunatus still as he climed higher, the which he perceiving, plucked up a Courage, and drawing his Sword, was resolved to stand to it Manfully,: The Bear came at him with open Mouth. and he still as she reached at him with her Paws, wounded her in one place or other, till at length she fell down, and in the fall was so bruised, that she lay as dead; which Fortunatus perceiving, and well noting that all the other Beasts were withdrawn, he came down, and thrust his Sword into the Bears Heart, after which being almost starved with Hunger, he flead part of her, and cutting off some of her Flesh eat it, by which being strengthned, he the next Morning got up, and resol∣ved to search his way out; when at last coming into the great Road where he was at first, he met with a Walloon, who directed him the nearest way; insomuch that in an hours Travelling he got out of the Forest and came to the City of Orleance, where he met with some refreshment, but had like to have paid dear for his coming thither, as in the next Chapter will appear. CHAP. IX. How Fortunatus falling asleep in a Porch in the City of Orle∣ance had a bloody Knife put into his Sleeve, and how he being found with it was accused of the Murther of a Gen∣tlewoman, and narrowly escaped; the Person that did the Murther being broken upon the Wheel for the same. IN the City of Orleance in the Kingdom of France, lived one James D'Bret a rich Merchant, who had a fair and beautiful young Gentlewoman to his Daughter, named Mary D'Bret, who being a considerable Fortune, had many Suitors, and amongst the rest, a Merchant of the same place, whose Name was Anthony Mont∣ples; it's true, he was a very comely Gentleman, but being young he was drawn away by lude Company to all manner of Extrava∣gancies, which made the Father of the Damsel that he would not
hearken to the giving him his Daughter, although the Maid could have been well content to have loved him for his Person, but being charged by her Father upon his Blessing and the Ties of her Obe∣dience, not to permit his farther Addresses, she not onely gave him his Answer at his next coming, but also would not from that time forward admit him to see her, unless by accident he met her in the Street, and then as much as in her lay she would shun him, which made him turn his former Love into Hatred, and the studdy of Re∣venge; insomuch that within awhile after, he having certain notice by some of her Servants (whom he bribed to send him word how things went from time to time) that within two daies she was to be Married to a Knights eldest Son, who lived at a Village about four Miles from the City: He being moved by the Instigation of the Devil, resolved to hinder the Match whatever it cost him, and thereupon he disclosed his Mind to one Saggue a bloody Villain, and one with whom he often kept company; who advised him, that since the Gentlewoman had proved false to him in breaking her Promise, and now was resolved by marrying another to frustrate all his hopes, it was but just that since he could not enjoy her himself, to hinder any other from doing the same; for saies he, It will surely grieve you to think what pleasure your Rival enjoyes, whilst you suffer pain and torment; nay more, to think how they will flout and jeer you at their Merry-makings, and often laugh you to scorn for being so foolish to beflow upon her such liberal Gifts, and all to no purpose; nay, and that your Rival should have them at his dispose. This so inflamed Montpess, that he could afterwards talk of nothing but Revenge, and thereupon secretly agreed with this bloody Varlet for 200 hundred Crowns to make her away, either by stab∣bing, poysoning, drowning, or strangling; so that being furnished with fit Instruments of Death, Saggue went to wait about her Lodging for a fit Opportunity, but finding she came not out, he got on a Serving-mans Habit, and having written a Letter in the Name of the Knights Son to whom she was suddenly to be married, he came in the dark of the Evening and knocked at the Door, which the Maid opening, demanded his Business, who told her that he came from such a Gentleman with a Letter, and some rich Presents
which he had order to deliver to none but her Masters Daughter; upon which the Wench went up and acquainted her what the Mes∣senger had said: So that the innocent Lady not dreaming her end was so nigh, came down, and taking him aside into her withdrawing Room, ordred the Maid to bring a Glass of Wine, the which after she had set down, she withdrew, as thinking they might have some private talk which was not fitting for her to hear; when the Maid was gone, he told the Gentlewoman a very formal Story, and then gave her the Letter which she having opened, began to read; whilst he was feeling in his Pockets, as if he had the Presents there that were specified in the Letter: But instead of Presents, he drew out a Knife secretly, and perceiving the Coast clear, whilst she was reading, he with full force struck it to the Haft in her Breast, upon which gi∣ving a shriek she fell down down dead, which the Murtherer percei∣ving, he hasted thence, but had scarcely passed the outward Gate, when the Father of the Damsel coming by, espied her weltring in her Gore, at which he raised such a doleful Exclamation, as Alarm'd all the House; whereupon pursuit was immediately made after the repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of murderer planting knife on Fortunatus Murtherer, who by this time had got ground, and by that means he had some time to look about him; when in a Porch he espying
Fortunatus asleep, upon which he taking the bloody Knife wherewith he had done the Villany, he put it into Fortunatus his Sleeve, and so departed. Now by this time the whole City was Alarm'd with the piteous Out-cries of the Servants, who were upon the pursuit of the Mur∣therers, who ran here and there searching and inquiring, as not be∣ing certain by reason of the many turnings which way he fled; when at last one of them coming to the Porch where Fortunatus lay still asleep, he cried out, Here he is, here he is, I have found him, I have found him; for indeed Fortunatus had the bad Luck to have a Suit of Cloaths on at that time not unlike to the Murtherers, by which the Maid that let him in described him to the rest. At the Noise and Out-cries they made, Fortunatus suddenly a∣woak, when starting up in a great Amazement, the Knife dropped out of his Sleeve, which they taking up, and perceiving to be still bloody, they concluded absolutely that he had murther'd their Mistris; and thereupon dragging him through the Streets, railing upon him, and threatning him with a thousand Deaths, without giving him the least knowledge what it was for, when they were come before the Magistrate, they declared what had hapned, shewing the Knife they had found about him, the Maid likewise swore it was he; whereup∣on the people cried out, Hang him, hang him: Insomuch that though he pleaded Innocence, and made many Excuses, he could not be heard but away he was sent to Prison, and laid in Irons, and in a short time after was condemned to be broke upon the Wheel; when it so chanced that three daies before the Murtherer was apprehended on suspicion of another Murther which he had committed; for which being extreamly wracked and at the point of Death, he did not onely confess that, but this also for which Fortunatus was to suffer, telling the manner, and what induced him to do it, and how that upon his flight he found Fortunatus, and put the Knife into his Sleeve as he slept: This Confession coming to the Iudges Ear, he gave order to stay Execution two daies longer, and in the mean time sent for the Murtherer and Fortunatus, as likewise the Maid who had seen him, and setting them both before her, bid her tell which was the Mur∣therer; upon which after some pauze, she said, She now well percei∣ved
she had been mistaken as to what she had before sworn to, in rela∣tion to Fortunatus, avowing the other to be the man, and that she not only knew him, by his voice, but by a Scar in his Face, and he being no longer able to conceal his Guilt, he told them all the Passa∣ges how he came to the Gentlewoman with a forged Letter, the which he wrote himself, and how he was hired for 200 Crowns by Montpess, upon which the Letter being there, the Iudge ordred him to write again, the which he did; and then they being compared, it plainly appeared to be his hand: Whereupon the Iudge thanked God who had made such a seasonable discovery of the Truth, and thereupon sent and apprehended Montpess, who finding the other, and confessed the whole Matter, for which within a short time after Montpess was beheaded, and broken upon the Wheel; but Fortuna∣tus set free, and the people that a little before had Exclaimed against him, pitied him for his wrongful suffering, and thereupon made a Purse amongst themselves, and gathered him Sir Crowns, the which he taking very thankfully, departed the City, giving praise to God who had so miraculously wrought his Deliverance. CHAP. IX. How Fortunatus travelling through a Forest, was met by Dame Fortune, and how she gave him a Purse that continually sup∣plied his Expences. FOrtunatus being got out of the City of Orleance, took his way towards Paris, when travelling through a huge Forest, he on his right-hand perceived a beautiful Creature in female Habit, sitting under a broad spreading Beech-tree with a Vail over her Eyes, who as he came near, arose and crossed him in his way, at which he rejoy∣ced not a little, for he had thought there had been nought but Bears and wild Beasts in the place, but looking stedfastly upon her he began to ponder whether she might not be a Fary, or bodily shape composed by Delusion: But whilst he was in this doubt, she taking him by the Hand, gently asked him whether he was going, upon which he
told her, desireing her that she would accompany him out of the Wood. To which she replied, she might not go with him, but that she would do more for him than any on earth had ever done: Where∣upon Fortunatus gave her many thanks, and desired to know her Name, and what she was, and her Business, in so desart a place; to whom she answered, my Name is Fortune, and here I am placed by him who made all things, and therefore has power to dispose of them as it best pleaseth him: by his Commission I am here placed, to distribute Six things, according as the Influence of the Stars by his appointment does direct: the which are these; Wisdom, Health, long Life, Beauty, Strength, and Riches: and now is the Moment of Choice, therefore make no delay, for in this case the Op∣portunity being over-slipped, returns not again in an Age: Be free, and take for asking any of these which shall seem most pleasing to you. At this unexpected Offer, Fortunatus inwardly rejoyced, and stood not long to paue, but said, Then if it be in my power to choose, give me Riches, even in such abundance, that I never more may be re∣duced woodcut of Fortunatus meeting Dame Fortune repetitive woodcut of multiple trees to poverty: to which Fortune replied, Thy wish is granted; and thereupon she gave him a Purse, saying, Take this as the Gift of Providence, the Vertue of it being, that in what Country
soever you shall hereafter be, when at any time you shall put your hand into the same, you shall find 10 Pieces of Gold of the currant Coyn of that Nation where you are, and so it shall continue to do during your life, and the life of your Sons, but no longer, This more and more rejoyced Fortunatus, insomuch that he returned her a thousand Thanks, wherefore she rebuked him, saying, That he ought not to thank her for what he had received, but God Almighty, from whose liberal Bounty to the Sons of Men all good things flow, as for me, said she, I am but the Dealer of good Things, and that I do by chance, for I neither see nor have regard to the persons on whom I bestow them, but am always hoodwink'd as you now behold me; therefore had Wisdom been your Portion, she would have taught you far otherwise, even to have rendred thanks where they are most justly due; yet what thou hast so freely received, bestow part upon the Poor as thou shalt see occasion. This said, Fortunatus bowed low, and promised to perform all she had commanded him: And as for this Day I will yearly keep it Sa∣cred, and Liberally bestow Alms; nay, I will moreover bestow a large Portion on some unmarried Virgin, in order to her being dis∣posed of in Marriage: Then he desired her to lead him out of the Wood, which she promised, and thereupon ordred him to follow her; when as she led him into a great Road, and willed him to go straight forwards, neither turning to the right or the left, nor so much as to look back to see what was become of her; whenas she no sooner part∣ed from him, but she vanished: Then Fortunatus travelling about three hours, came to the end of the Wood, where lifting up his eyes, he beheld a fair House, and being desirous to refresh himself there, for he perceived it was an Inn, he put his hand into his Purse, to try if what had been related, were true, and thereupon pulled out 10 Pieces of Gold, at which he greatly rejoyced and entring the Inn, called for Meat and Drink of the best; and by reason the Host began to misteust him, as being mean in Apparel, he pulled out two Crowns and gave him them before-hand, whereupon the Host joyfully spread the Table with such choice Provision as the House would affoard.
CHAP. X. How Fortunatus at his Departure from the Inn, bought three fair Horses which Earl Rodolphus had before cheapned, for which he was Imprisoned, and narrowly escaped his life. WHen Fortunatus had fufficiently taken his Repast, and there∣with greatly refreshed himself after three days continuance in the Inn, he perceived in the Stable exceeding rich Trappins, with all manner of Furniture for a Horseman, and demanded of his Host to what or whose Horse they did belong, to none says the Host, for they are left here to be sold; then said Fortunatus, what is the Price of them; 50 Crowns said the Host, Here is your Money said Fortunatus; and so taking them, he departed; when travelling forwards some di∣stance thence, he espyed a great Village with a Castle in it, standing upon a Hill, and thither he repaired with all speed, as hoping there to light of a good Horse, the which in his former Inn he could not do; when he came thither, he asked for the best Inn in the Town, and being directed to it, he sat him down, and casted for Provision, which his Host brought him, then falling into discourse, he asked him, whe∣ther he knew not of any good Horses that were to be sold thereabouts, to which the Host replyed, that there were three exceeding fair Horses which had been lately brought to that Town by a Merchant, intend∣ing to dispose of them at the Entertainment that was to be made by the Duke of Orleance, upon the account of his Wedding with the fair Issabella, Daughter to the King of Arragon; then was Fortu∣natus desirous to see them, but the Host told him that the Earl Ro∣dolphus had bidden 300 Crowns for them, and that the Merchant refused to take under 300 Crowns; no matter for the Price, said Fortunatus, if so I but like them; and thereupon he desired his Host to go with him to the place where they were, which he did, and smiled as he went, to think how he should lose his labour, for he did not imagine Fortunatus had Money to purchase them; but coming to the Merchant after having well view'd them, Fortunatus drew out the Money, and payed it down, and had the Horses delivered to him,
the which he and his Host conveyed to the Inn, where he gave order for rich Saddles to be made, and such Furniture as was wanting, de∣siring the Host likewise to hearken out for two trusty Servants, whom he would furnish with all things necessary; but whilst he was making these Preparations, the Earl sent as much Money as was demanded for the Horses: When finding that they were gone, he grew exceeding angry, and sent again to enquire who he was that durst buy them out of his hands; and having understood at what Inn they were, he sent his Servants thither, who coming to the Host, de∣manded if such Horses were in his Stables; to which he answered, Yes: Then said they, our Lord has sent to know the man that durst to buy them out of his hands; Why truly said the Host, he is a stran∣ger and came in by accident; when amongst other things, he asked me, whether any good Horses were to be sold thereabouts? and ac∣cordingly I told him; but did not think by his Garb he was able to buy an Ass: As for Furniture he brought it with him, but how he came by it, I know not. Nay, said the Servant, in all likelihood he has robbed and murther'd some Gentleman upon the Road, and there∣upon he departed in a great rage. CHAP. VII. How the Earl caused Fortunatus to be apprehended, and cast into Prison, till he gave an account how he came by his Money; and was obliged to deliver the Horses, and Three hundred Crowns. THe Earl having notice of all that had passed, sent immediately to apprehend Fortunatus in his Inn, who then by the Counsel of his Host, was preparing to depart; but having seized im, they brought him before their Lord, who after many reproachful words, demanded whence he was. and how he came by so much Money, as to buy such high priz'd Horses out of his hands: As to the First, he answered, That he was the Son of a poor Courtier of the City of Famagosta in the Isle of Cyprus: As to the second, he said, What
Money he had, he came honestly by it, and therefore ought not to be questioned about it, unless any could prove to the contrary; adding, that he never yet wronged any body of one Farthing: But the Earl angerly told him, that it was not likely such a Fellow as he should have so much Money, unless he had robbed or murthered some person for it; and thereupon ordred him to be fastned to the Rack, in order to force him to a Confession; yet he resolved rather to suffer the worst Extremity, than to confess the secret Vertue of his fortunate Purse; but being put to exceeding Torture, he desired them to take him from off the Rack, and he would confess; the which they did, and brought him before the Earl from out the Prison, where when he had first begged Mercy, he said, As I Yesterday was travelling in a Forest, so chanced, that I found a Purse with 620 Crowns in it: In what Forest, said the Earl? A Forest about four Miles from this place; Why you Varlet, then said the Earl with a stern Countenance, will you rob me of my Right? for know, that I am Lord of the Forest, it and that whatever is found there, appertains to me: I knew not that said Fortunatus, and therefore humbly crave your pardon; but said the Earl, you shall be made to know it e're you depart, and there∣fore first tell me what is become of the Purse and Money? As for the Purse, replyed Fortunatus, I took the Money out of it, and threw it into a Brook that runs through the Forest; but if it should please your Honour to take the rest of the Money, here it is: That shall not serve, said the Earl, for I will not onely take your Money, but your Life; and therefore against to Morrow prepare for your Execution. This made Fortunatus exceeding sad, and began to wish that he had chosen wisdom instead of riches, by which he easily might have escaped such troubles, but seeing that power and tyranny would have its way, fell upon his Knees, and with tears besought the Earl to spare his ife, and take both the Horses and the Mony; for, said he, what will it avail you to take away my Life that am such a miserable Creature? but if you spare me, I shall ever extole your Clemency and Goodness. This and the intreaty of the Earls Servants, but especially the Countesses Gentlewomen, moved him to relent, so that having taken
an Oath of him never to discover what had passed, he gave him two Crowns back, and sent his servants to see him out of Town, where they left him; at which Fortunatus did not a little rejoyce, foras∣much as he had his dear Companion the Purse to bear him company, then having abjured ever coming within that Earls Iurisdiction any more, he departed towards Brittain; and after some time, came to Angiers, a considerable City of that Dukedom, where at that time was held a great Feast, in Honour of the Marriage of the Dukes Daughter with the Prince of Saxony; upon which occasion a great number of Lords and others, were come thither gallantly attended: upon which, Fortunatus notwithstanding his late bad success by deal∣ing in horse flesh, bought three more horses and put himself in a splen∣did Equipage, and likewise hired two servants, and betook himself to the best Inn, where he kept company and conversed with the best, and so continued in great splendor till the Celebration of the Marriage. CHAP. XII. How an Irish Gentleman was entertained by Fortunatus as his Companion, and what befell them in their Travels. WHilst Fortunatus continued at this City, he spent most part of his time in seeing the pastimes which were made as Pomp∣ous Shows, Masques, Dauncing, Tilt, Turnament, and many other Noble Exercises; and so being used every day to depart from the Inn with his men, the Host began at last to mistrust he would give him the slip as some others had done, and thereupon acquainted him with his thought, at which Fortunatus smiling, put his hand into his Purse, and pulled out a hundred Crowns, the which he gave to the Host: saying, here honest fellow take this, and when thou thinkest we have had as much as it comes to ask for more, I shall not be very inquisitive to know the account. At this the Host began to look very pleasant ever after, shewing great respect to Fortunatus, setting him at the upper end of the
Table, and handing him the choicest dishes of meats, and best wine; though several Noble Persons eyes were present. Not long after, as he was sitting at dinner with six Earls and ten Lords, besides other Gentlemen of good fashion; several Musitianers came and offered to play before them, telling them that they had been Gentlemen, but where now fallen to decay, and were forced to take up that employ for their living; when they had played a good while, an Earl at the Table asked one of them that was more likely than the rest, what Countryman he was? who replyed that he was an Irish∣man, and had spent all his Estate in traveling; for, said he, I have been in most parts of the World, and can name, and have seen most of the Emperors, Kings, and Soveraign Princes in Europe, Asia, and Africa; and can discribe the Splendor of their Courts, the manners and customs of their Countrys, and speak most Languages, with many other things. Then they asked him his name, who told them he was called Leo∣paldus, and came of a worshipful Family, which appeared no less in his Carriage and portly Demeanour; upon which the Nobility and Gentry being moved to Compassion, that so goodly a person should be reduced to poverty, they liberally distributed Money amongst him and his Companions, and desired him to stay and attend them whilst the Feast continued; for which, not onely he, but the rest returned their Honours a thousand thanks: Then one of the Earls asked him if he would be willing to live with him, and become a Tutor, and he should never want; but he excused it, saying, He had left a Wife and Children in his own Country, which he much longed to see. Now Fortunatus who had curiously obferved the Man, began to think with himself, could I but procure him for my Companion in Travel, I should think my self happy; and thereupon when Din∣ner was ended, he sent privately for him to come to his Chamber, where when he entred, Fortunatus Saluted him after the most cour∣teous manner, and told him that he was minded to spend the residue of his Days in Travel, and that if he would become his Companion, he would so provide for him, that he should ever have plenty; as likewise provide a Horse for himself, and another for a man who should wait on him.
To this Leopaldus replyed, That he could be well content with such a Proffer, if it were not that he so much longed to see his Wife and Children, which had been the occasion of his return out of far Countries; to which Fortunatus answered him, That if he would make him a solemn promise, that he would afterwards accompany him, he would go with him into Ireland first, and bear his Charges thither, and then we will return to Cyprus the Isle wherein I was born, and so from thence by Sea and Land, travel into other Coun∣tries and Kingdoms as thou shalt think best fit. At this Leopaldus inwardly rejoyced; but having known the ex∣ceeding Expence of Travel, had thought with himself that Fortu∣natus could never be able to perform what he promised; and there∣upon told him, unless he had great Sums of Money, it was in vain to undertake what he proposed: Let me alone for that, said Fortu∣natus, for I shall have Money in all places where I come; If it be so, said Leopaldus, and thou wilt perform thy promise, I am con∣tent; and thereupon Leopaldus having a Horse provided for him, and another for his Man, which Fortunatus caused to be hired: af∣ter the Host was discharged, they departed the City, and so visiting many fair Cities and Towns, at last they came to Bruges in Flan∣ders, where taking Shipping they came for London, where having stayed awhile, they departed for Scotland, still visiting all Places of note as they passed; and from Scotland they Sailed over Sea into Ireland, where coming to Londonderry, and from thence to Wal∣drink, where was his own House, he was not known, by reason of the Alteration his long Absence had made; but finding his Wife and Children all in good Health, he by many Tokens made them un∣derstand who he was, to their no small Ioy; the next day came thi∣ther Fortunatus and his Men, who perceiving that Leopoldus was but slenderly provided, gave him a 100 Crowns, bidding him go and buy such Provision as was convenient, and Invite the chief of his Neigbours to Dinner, the which he did, and very splendedly En∣tertained them. When Fortunatus had stayed there about a Month, he was desi∣rous to be gone, and acquainted Leopoldus with the same, giving him 2000 Crowns to leave with his Wife and Children, and so af∣ter
Leave taken, and some Tears shed at parting, Leopoldus went with Fortunatus; and as they journied, he told him of S. Patrick's Purgatory which was in their way some Miles distant from Wal∣drink: this made Fortunatus desirous to see; insomuch that when they came to the Abbey, Leopoldus went to the Abbot, and told him that a strange Lord was arrived there, and was very desirous to see S. Patrick's Purgatory, to which he consented, provided the Fees were payd to those that kept it: which Fortunatus not onely did, but likewise presented the Abbot with a Cask of the best Wine that could be got in the Town of Yernecks where the Abby stood: So that in requital the Abbot Invited him and Leopoldus to Dinner, and at their request told them, that the Town wherein the Abby stood was once a wild Desart or Wilderness, and that one Patrick a Devout man, was wont to leave his Monastery and resort thither to Pray∣ers: When one day finding a large Hole in the Ground, over-grown with Bushes, he enter'd therein, and finding the Inside more large and spacious, all arched over with Pumice, and supported with Pil∣lars of Earth; he ventured yet further, when striking into a wind∣ing Path, he lost his way and could not get out again, but was as∣saulted woodcut of monk unlocking door with Fortunatus, Leopoldus, the Abbot and another figure standing behind him; repeated on p. 79 repetitive woodcut of multiple trees with fierce Winds as hot as the steem of a Furnace, and heard many doleful Cries and Groans; upon which he fell upon his
knees, and prayed God to deliver him out of that place, for his Mer∣cies sake, when as he was taken up and carried out of the away, he came in; whereupon it was ever since called S. Patricks Purgatory, and this Abby builded in token of his Deliverance. This made Fortunatus the more desirous to see it, and resting that Night, he got up the next Morning, and having shrieved him∣self, and sayd his Prayers devoutly, he, together with Leopoldus who offered to accompany him, went into a Hole behind the Altar, to which there was a Door, and a pair of Stairs of earth; when they were in, the Monks shut the Door after them, and prayed for their happy return as they used to do for others that had gone in before them, and withal admonished them not to venture too far, lest they were lost, as many Pilgrims had been, who were not found again in three or four days. Fortunatus and Leopoldus being in, went forwards about a 100 paces, and coming into a narrow passage that they could go but one a breast, they turned so often, that they at last were lost in the Labyrinth, not knowing when they went backwards or when for∣wards, so that they continued wandring too and fro for the space of two days, hearing loud Shrieks and Groans, and now and then felt hot Flashes, which so amazed them, that they wished they had ne∣ver ventured in; and besides Hunger began to assault them very grievously, insomuch that Fortunatus began to say, that now his Purse was useless, and that notwithstanding he had Gold and Sil∣ver, yet that would not satisfie Nature, but that they must now starve with Hunger; and thereupon they both fell upon their Knees, and made a Vow, that if God would be pleased to deliver them this once, they would never be so rashly venturous again. Now the third Day came, and the Servants without being very impatient of their Masters stay, called at the Mouth of the Hole, and held in lighted Torches, but in vain; when as not only they, but the Abbot and Priests were in great perplexity, as thinking Fortu∣natus and Leopoldus were either lost or dead; insomuch that they began to fing Mass for their Souls, whenas the Abbot calling an old man to mind who had measured the Hole with Ropes, he sent for him, and willed him to go in and seek for two Gentlemen that had
lost themselvest therein; the which upon the Servants promise, that their Masters should give him a 100 Crowns, he undertook; say∣ing, if they were alive he would bring them thence: Whereupon ta∣king with him a lighted Torch, and a Pipe, he entred; but that Torch soon went out, yet he passed on playing upon his Pipe; and after having gone a thousand paces, began to hollow to them, who with faint Voices answered, till at last he being directed by the Sound. came to them, and informed them that he was come to fetch them out; and taking them by the hand, bid them follow him, which they did with no small content; when they came out, they were exceeding feeble, yet greatly rejoyced at their Deliverance: So that when Fortunatus his men told him how they had agreed with the old man for a 100 Crowns, he gave him 200, and then ordain∣ing a sumptuous Dinner, he Invited the Abbot and the rest, and desired them to return God thanks for the great Deliverance he had sent them, giving 200 Crowns amongst the Priests, and after leave taken, departed; and taking Ship, set Sail for Calice, and from thence went to Paris, and so over-land to Rome, seeing ma∣ny Countries, and strange things in their way. CHAP. XIII. How Fortunatus Travelled from Rome to Constantinople, and what befell him at the Coronation of the Emperor. FOrtunatus and Leopoldus having continued at Rome some time, to take notice of the Splendor and Pomp of the Bishops Court, departed thence for Venice; whereupon News had, that the Emperor of Constantinople, intended to Crown his Son Em∣peror, by reason he was so old that he could not Weild the Govern∣ment as he ought,; the State of Venice resolved to send an Am∣bassador with several Presents to congratulate his Establishment in the Empire: And now the Gallies being ready, Fortunatus so or∣dred the matter with the Captain of one of them, that he got leave for him and his Retinue to pass to Constantinople therein; when
after ten days Sail they came within sight of the City, and were met by some of the Emperors Gallies who were sent to welcom them; and coming on shore, the Ambossador had a stately House pro∣vided him; but as for Fortunatus, Leopoldus, and their Men, they were forced to betake themselves to an Inn, which proved one of the best; for the Host was a Thief, and usually watched his opportu∣nity to rob his Guests when they were sleeping, who dreamed of no such matter; so that the Host perceiving Fortunatus to have great store of Money, he resolved to make bold with some of it; and there∣fore in their absence got into their Chamber through a private Door, and searched all about, but found no Money; so that he concluded they carried it all about them, and so resolved when they payd again, to watch where they put it. A while after Fortunatus came to pay, and putting his hand under the Table, pulled out Money, and gave it to Lpoldus to pay the Reckoning, that it might not be perceived from whence he had it; so that the Host marking him well, supposed it was hidden in his Cloaths, and was resolved the next Night to put in with him for a snack: Now Fortunatus in the midst of his Merriments remem∣bred the time was come wherein he was to perform his Vow made to Dame Fortune, about bestowing 400 Crowns on a Virgin in Marriage; and thereupon he called his Host, and asked him if he knew any honest man that had a fair Daughter to bestow, and he would give her a Portion: the Host told him that a Neighbor of his had one who was marrigable; upon which Fortunatus bid the Host go to her Parents, and bid them bring her the next Morning; which the Host neglected to do, saying, She was gone abroad, and would not return till late the next Morrow-evening: the which he did, be∣cause they should not part with their Money till he had put in for a share; so that when they were in Bed, and sleeping soundly by rea∣son they were tired the day before at the noble Pastimes that were held in the City; about Midnight the Host came through his private Door; and first coming to Leopoldus, he felt and soon found his Purse, and took from thence 50 Duckets; then coming to Fortu∣natus, he felt his Purse likewise, but not putting his hand into it, he could not perceive any Money; for such was the Secret, that to
all those that felt the out-side, it felt empty; whereupon the Host ha∣ving cut it from off his Girdle, threw it under the Bed; and so set∣ting open all the Doors and Windows departed: when about the third Watch Leopoldus awaked, and espying all the Windows open, called to his Servants, as likewise to Fortunatus, fearing what had hapned; when the Servants were awakened, he chid them ex∣treamly for leaving open the Doors and Windows; but they stoutly affirmed, that they shut them fast when they went to Bed: upon which Leopoldus feeling for his Purse, found it gone; and cal∣ling to Fortunatus, told him that he was robbed; Fortunatus starting up between sleep and wake, found his Purse gone also; and thereupon he fell into such extream sorrow, that he swoonded away, which caused no small stir amongst the Servants; so that the Host who all this while stood listning, came in, and angerly demanded why they made such ado to trouble the whole House? Whereupon they told him they were robbed; to which he replyed, Like enough so, perhaps you have Thieves amongst your selves, and have robbed one another: But when he beheld Fortunatus in that condition, he also affisted to bring him to himself again, telling them that they ought to have looked to their Doors and Windows at a time when so ma∣ny Thieves were abroad. When Fortunatus came to himself, he was exceeding sorrowful; upon which the Host asked him, how much Money he had lost? Who replyed, not much; but that he had lost a Purse with a Bill of Ex∣change in it worth 1000 Crowns, though it would do them little or no good that had it; for they could not receive the Money unless he gave his discharge. Now the Host that knew where the Purse was become, bid him search about; for, said he, it may be thrown some∣where in the Room, for few Thieves care for an empty Purse: Whereupon Fortunatus his Men began to look about very diligently, and at last under the Bed espyed the Purse, which they took up, and delivered to their Master, who did not a little rejoyce that he had re∣covered it; but fearing least by its being cut from his Girdle, it might have lost its Vertue, he secretly put it under the Bed-cloaths, and then thrusting in his hand, drew out Money as formerly; then he began to rejoyce, and putting on his Cloaths, caused a Fire to
be made, and Wine to be brought: when the Morning was far gone, his Horses being made ready, he rode abroad, and in his way ordred Leopaldus and his Servants to stay at a Tavern till he went to his Exchequer, and took Moneys thence sufficient for his purpose; so that having bought Five new Purses, he put in one of them 100 Crowns, the which he gave to Leopoldus to buy Neces∣saries, and into the rest 10 Crowns apiece, the which he gave to his Men every one, bidding them be careful of Thieves for the future; then went he and took out 400 Crowns; which he had promised to bestow upon the Maid in Marriage, and so returned to his Inn, and willed his Host to go again to the Parents of the Maid; which he did, and finding her likewise at home, he told the Father upon what account he came,: How that a Gentleman that lodged at his Inn, desired him to bring his Daughter thither, and he would do good for her in order to procure her a happy Match: but the old man thinking it was a Trap to get his Daughter thither to Debauch her, would by no means consent; saying, That his Daughters Virginity was all she had to set her off in Marriage, and if by any means she should lose that, she would not only undo her self, but be a stain to all her Kindred; and said he, I know there are many slip∣pery Blades abroad, therefore I will not trust my Daughter from home amongst them; but if the Gentleman has any good meaning, and intends to see my Daughter, let him come to my house and he shall be welcom, but to let her come to any Gentleman abroad, I will not. At this the Host being much displeased, departed, and told For∣tunatus all that had passed, endeavouring to incense him against the Virgin, and to bestow his Money upon some other; but Fortuna∣tus very well approving of the Fathers blunt and well-meaning, cau∣sed his Servants to make ready his Horse, and to attend him thi∣ther; the Host being there when they came to the Door, the Host knocked hard, and the good man opening the same; he told him, that since he refused to let his Daughter come to the Gentleman, he was come to her: which the good Woman hearing and perceiving his Splendid Equipage, she run and caused the Wench to put on her best Cloaths, and prick up her Ears after the best manner she
could; and so with as much trouble as it is to bring a Bear to the Stake, brought her into the Room where Fortunatus was; who taking him to be a Prince at least, fell down on her knees before him, but he gently raised her, telling the Father on what account he came; therefore said he, if there be any young-man that is deserving of her hereabouts, let him come and I will give him a good Portion with her. At which the Mother told him, Yes, there was a Neigh∣bours Son who loved her intirely, and would have wedded her long ago, had not his Parents restrained him, by reason her Portion was no ways answerable to his: Then Fortunatus asked the Maid, if she liked the Youth? to which she replyed, She would be ruled by her Parents, and what they thought fit should be a law with her: Nay, nay, says her Mother, and it shall please yout Majesty, she likes him well enough, and has upon my Faith and Troath a Months mind to him, but that the Bagage is shame-fac'd: Then Fortunatus order∣ed the Youth to be sent for, and found that they were of a fit age to be coupled; whereupon Fortunatus asked him, if he could like to take that Virgin for his Wife, if he would give her a Portion? to which he answered, With a very good will, if he would give her any thing considerable; for I love her well enough, but dare not marry her without a Portion, least my Friends should disinherit me: And then he asked the Maid if she was willing, who modestly replyed, Yes; then the Friends being had, he sent for a Priest, who having joyned them in Matrimony, he delivered to the young-man a Purse with 400 Crowns, who with many scrapings and cringings received the same: He also gave Money to the Parents of the Maid to buy them Cloaths, and provide the Wedding-Dinner; for which they gave him a thousand thanks, and praised God that had raised them up such a Friend in time of need. Then Fortunatus departed to his Inn and went to Dinner; Leopoldus and the rest not a little won∣dring how he came by so much Money.
CHAP. XIV. How Leopoldus slew the Thievish Host, and how he and For∣tunatus made their Escapes afterward. NOw the Feast being almost at an end, the Host began to Plot how he might come in for some more money, as well-knowing Fortunatus would be gone as soon as the Sports were over; and thereupon he resolved as formerly he had done, to come in at the privy Door and rob them; but when he understood that they burnt Wax Tapers all Night, he was somewhat fearful of being discovered: but had not long cast about for a Project, but he found one; which was this: He getting in when they were all abroad, bor'd holes in the Tapers, and putting Water therein, stopped them close again; so that when Fortunatus and the rest after Supper were gone to Bed, he watched till the Light went out, and then he entred the Chamber as formerly; and came first to Leopoldus his Bed, where by his too much tumbling the Cloaths to find out his Money, he was wa∣ked; repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of Fortunatus and Leopoldus in their beds, swords drawn with the host falling next to Leopoldus' bed when as Leopoldus whose Sword lay ready, espyed him by the light of the Moon, he struck at him with such force, that giving him
a Cut over the Neck, he fetched a great groan and fell down dead; then he called to the Servants, asking them why they had put out the Lights? saying, Here are Thieves in the Room, therefore stand upon your Guards and suffer none to go out: Vpon this Fortuna∣tus awoke and caused the Servants to strike fire, the which no sooner appeared, but they found their Host weltring in his blood, and gasp∣ing for life; whereupon they were sore abashed: but especially For∣tunatus, who said, O Leopoldus, what hast thou done? now for this Murther shall we be all hanged; had not we better have lost our Money, than Life and Money both, as now in most likelihood we shall: To which Leopoldus replyed, that he did not doubt this was the Thief that robbed them before, and that it not being light to dis∣cern who he smote, he knew it not to be his Host; nor as it is, said he, is it any other than a Thief I have killed? therefore if the truth were known, we should not be in danger. Nay, but replyed Fortu∣natus, We may say what we will, we shall not be believed in our own Case, I have had experience of that once before; and he up and told him the Story of the Murther in England, wishing secretly that some rich Merchant of the City knew the Vertue of his Purse, that so he might get him with a great Sum of Money to Bribe the Iudge for his Delivery; but then, thought he, if he get such an inestima∣ble Treasure into his hands, he will not lightly part with it, but rather incense the Iudge to dispatch us, that he may enjoy the Treasure. Whilst he was in these and such like Perplexities, Leopoldus bid him be of good Courage; for, said he, I will soon rid you of your fear: I would you could, said Fortunatus, and that I was far e∣nough hence; why then said Leopoldus follow my Advice, and in so doing you shall be safe before Night comes again: Then Fortuna∣tus and the Servants promised to do what ever he should counsel them: Said he, whilst it is yet dark and none are stirring, let the Body be conveyed into the Court-yard, and there cast it into the Well, and afterward wipe up the blood; then all of you shew mer∣ry and pleasant Countenances, and so as soon as it is light we will pay our Reckoning and depart: This they agreed to, and immedi∣ately two of the Servants took up the Body and carried it to the
repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of man carrying a body over his shoulder; repeated from p. 12 Well, where they threw it in head foremost, as Leopoldus had dire∣cted them, cleansing the Chamber of the blood; and when it was Morning got up and ordered their Horses to be made ready, being all very chearful, after which they called for Wine, and paying what they had had the day before, they gave to every one of the Servants two Duckets, telling them they were sorry they had not the oppor∣tunity of drinking with their Host; but notwithstanding they would shortly return and thank him for his kindness: So the Servants dismissed them with many thanks, not dreaming their Master's be∣ing murthered. When they were got out of the City, they rod towards Turky with all speed, not stopping till they had rid about 30 Miles, and then only Baiting a little, they set forward again, and were so swift to avoid pursuit, that they rod 100 Miles that day; the next day they set forward again, and came to Achipania, a City garrison'd with Turks, and governed by a Bashaw; there they were not fuf∣fered to pass through without a Pass-port from the Governor, which Leopoldus for 24 Crowns obtained: then had they an experienccd Guide alotted them, who had for his Wages a Crown every day; this Guide conducted them to the Great Turks Palace, and then, and not till then, could Fortunatus be out of fear lest he should be pursu∣ed:
here they stayed a Month to behold the Splendor and Magnifi∣cence of a Palace which for Riches and stately Building surpassed the Courts of all the Christian Princes, had they been united in one; but seeing that they were for the most part Heathens, and consequently God's enemies, they would have no Discourse, nor keep company with any of them: from thence they, crossing the Country, passed through Bononia, Hungaria, Bohemia, Saxony, Dalmatia, Swevia, Den∣mark, and many other places, viewing the Monuments and stately Buildings as they passed, and at last went into Italy; where passing through the Dukedoms of Millain, Florence, Ferrara, Mantua, and the Kingdom of Naples, they at last came to Venice, which was then a place for Merchandize, the Richest in the World; there he bought many costly Iewels, Pearls, Gold Fringe, and Gold Imbroderies, with Velvet and other costly Stuff. Now after 16 years absence, re∣solving to return into his own Country to visit his Parents; when he came to Famogosta, he heard they were dead, for which he greatly sorrowed; and being shewed the place of their Burial, he stately Monument to be erected, with this Inscription; Under this Marble Pile these Victims lie, Whose Names Death has not pow'r for to destroy; But unto after Ages they shall live, And an Example to true Lovers give. Fam'd Theodorus, Fortunatus's Father, And beauteous Greciana his dear Mother Lie here Intomb'd, their Bodies here do lie, But their great Souls are wrap'd above the Sky. After this he built him a fair House, and entertained several Maid-servants, bought him a Coach and other things necessary; so that the Gentry began to wonder how he came by such vast Sums of Money, when as all of them knew he departed extream poor.
CHAP. XV. How Fortunatus, by the Kings Command, was married to fair Cassandra, Daughter to the Lord Nemina. WIthin a while after his Arrival in Cyprus, he purchased the greatest part of his Fathers Estate, which was Sold and Mortgaged; then built he a fair Palace, a Church and Chantry, with Houses for 12 Priests, endowing them with 1400 Crowns a year; made stately Parks, Gardens, Fountains, and Fish-ponds, with many other rare Devices; Insomuch that most of the Noble-men of Cyprus were proud of his Company, and many were very desi∣rous to match their Daughters to him: Insomuch that the King himself taking notice of it, and being in discourse with the Lord Ne∣mina, who had three fair Daughters; he asked him what he thought if Fortunatus should request one of his Daughters in marriage? Why truly, replyed he, and it may please your Majesty, I do not think it fit, for I perceive he has no great Estate, and although he has ready Money, he is so prodigal both in Expences and Building, that it cannot last long; and therefore I believe your Majesty would not advise me to match any of my Daughters to him, least, as his Father did, he at last should come to poverty, notwithstanding his Riches: Indeed, said the King, he has built a fair Palace, and many other stately Edifices, yet his Estate is not at all Impaired; for I have been informed that he has Iewels by him worth 100000 Crowns, and yet he will not sell one of them; therefore if you will take my Advice, offer him one of your Daughters, and I will second the matter. By this the Earl perceiving that Fortunatus was highly in the Kings Favour, he said, Well, if it please your Majesty, I will com∣mit my Daughters to your dispose, and with whatever your Majesty shall do, I will be well satisfied: to which the King answered, That since he reposed so much trust in him, he would not only give her in marriage, but give her a Dowry likewise; and thereupon ordered the Earl to send his three Daughters to the Queen: Whereupon he went
home and acquainted his Wife with what had hapned, with which she seemed at first displeased, but after he urged it was the Kings plea∣sure, she was contented; and thereupon sent her three Daughters well attended, and in costly Earbs to the Queen, who received them joyfully. The King having notice that they were come, he sent for Fortu∣natus, telling him, that he understood he had a design to take him a Wife, and that he being loath any of base Extraction should possess so fair and costly a Building, himself would, if he thought fit, provide him One of Noble Birth, and such an One as he doubted not but would please him: Whereupon Fortunatus bowing low, gave his Majesty many thanks, saying, That indeed he intended to seek out for a Wife; but since his Majesty had so far condescended as to give himself the trouble of providing him One, he would not look any further, but wholly submit to what his Majesty thought fit: Then said the King, I have in my Palace three fair Virgins, Daughters to the Lord of Nemina, of those you shall take your choice; there∣fore say whether you will see them separate, or altogether: At this For∣tunatus paused not, but replyed, If it may please your Majesty, I would see them together, and hear them speak one after another; that you shall, said the King; and thereupon sent one of his Pages to the Queen, to get the Ladies in a readiness, for that he was to bring a Guest into the Presence-Chamber; and having notice that they were prepared, he took Fortunatus by the hand, who likewise desired that Leopoldus might go with him, which the King consenting to, they went all three together; when being come, the King sate down and caused the Ladies to be brought before him, and placed in order according to their years, the eldest being named Germania, the next Marcepia, and the youngest Cassandra.
CHAP. XVI. How Fortunatus havjng his choice of the Lord Nemina's three Daughters, chose the youngest, whose Name was Cassan∣dra, to whom he was married in the presence of the King of Cyprus. THe Ladies being placed in order, the King demanded of the el∣dest, whether she had rather continue at Court and be one of the Queens Maids of Honour, or with her Father and Mother; to which, with a modest Deportment, she answered; That may it please my So∣veraign Lord the King, it is not seemly that I should dispose of my self, but rather that I submit to what your Majesty or my Father shall think most convenient; then said the King to the next, tell me Marcenia which from your heart you love best, the Earl your Father, or the Countess your Mother: to which she replyed, That is a hard Question, and therefore I must humbly beg your Majesties pardon to excuse me, if I answer not directly to this Point; because I love them both so well, I know not how to incline to either hand, and therefore must be silent as to my report in that Affair; then the King said, Cassandra prithee tell me, should your Father and Mother be here, and several young Nobles were dancing, and if your Mother should bid you Dance, and your Father forbid the same, which would you choose to obey: Indeed my Gracious Soveraign, said she, that Ouestion is unanswerable, especially upon such short warning, and by one whose tender years are not capable of discerning things as they are, for should I obey one, I should disobey the other, and on either hand prove disobedient. The King having asked them thus far, ordered them to withdraw; and then he asked Fortunatus which he best approved of: truly my Gracious Lord, I like them all so well, that on a sudden the Choice is difficult; therefore if your Majesty will permit me to retire for an hours space to consult with my Friend about the matter, I will return your Majesty an account of my Choice, which the King con∣sented to; and thereupon they retired into the withdrawing Room;
where Fortunatus asked Leopoldus what he thought, and how he would advise him to make his Choice? but Leopoldus declined it, saying, That in matters of Love there could be no direct Choice made but by the Party who was to enjoy the Lady; for says he, What may seem most beautiful to me, may in your opinion seem o∣therwise; and therefore pray excuse me in this particular: but when Fortunatus urged, he said, Well, seeing you will have it so, do you sit at one end of the Table, and I will sit at the other, and there we will write the Name of Her, who we best like; you as you think fit, and I according to my opinion: This pleased Fortunatus well, and when they had both written, they compared the Names, and they were one and the same; so that Fortunatus sweetly rejoyced that Leopol∣dus had approved of his Choice, and then went he joyfully to the King, and told him he had chose Cassandra; whereupon the King ordered her to be brought, and sending for his Chaplain instantly, caused them to be married, though to the no little surprize of the La∣dy, woodcut of a split scene: seven people around a table with three others in the balcony; the wedding of Fortunatus repetitive woodcut of single tree who was not above 14 years of age, and the rather by reason her Parents were absent at the Wedding. After the Celebration of the Marriage, Fortunatus and his Bride were joyed by the King, Queen, and Nobles, but the Sisters of Cassandra wept for madness that their younger Sister should be
chosen and they neglected; which Fortunatus perceiving, comforted them in the best manner, and sent for his Casket of Iewels which he had purchased at Venice, and after having presented the fairest to the King and Queen; he bestowed the rest upon his Bride and her Sisters, as likewise upon the Queens Ladys and Maids of Ho∣nour: he also sent Leopoldus with a present of 1000 Crowns to the Countess of Nemina, as also to desire the Earl to repair to Court. The Countess when she understood he had chosen her youngest Daughter, whom she entirely loved, was somewhat displeased, but dissembling the matter, she and the Earl come to Court in the most splendid manner they could: and at their arrival were welcomed by the King and Queen, and all the Nobility; as likewise by For∣tunatus, who bestowed richer presents on them than before, which quite dissolved the Countesses displeasure; insomuch that they thank∣ed God and the King, that they had provided her Daughter so brave and rich a Husband, especially when she perceived how highly Fortu∣natus was in the Kings Favour. Then said the King; I think it convenient that the Wedding Feast be kept in our Pallace; nay, said Fortunatus, I beseech your Maje∣sty let it be at my own House in Famogosta; it would content me, said the King, that it should be there, were it not for the excessive charge it will put you to; no matter for that, said Fortunatus, for there is nothing that can be had in all the Isle of Cyprus, but it shall be there at your Majesties service; and if it shall please your Majesty to ordein Tilts and Turnaments, I shall be exceeding glad, that I may prove my self a man before your Majesty; to all this the King consented, and ordered his Nobles to be ready within two days, to de∣part for Famogosta; as likewise the Ladys that waited upon the Queen, and others: and for that day the Bridegroom and Bride dined privately with the King and Queen.
CHAP. XVII. How Fortunatus and his Bride, were accompanied by the King and Queen to Famogosta, and what happened there, during the Wedding Feast. FOrtunatus having the Kings consent to go with him to Famo∣gosta; sent Leopoldus with 2000 Crowns to buy provision for the entertainment, who so well managed the matter, that at the Kings arrival all things were in a readiness; there was he met in the great Court by all manner of Musitians playing Melodiously, and entring the Hall, presented with Gorgious sights: brave Dancing and Odoriferous smells, Seeling being frested with Silver Shells, wrought in the Curiousest manner: and the sides of Cedar, Guilt with Gold; as likewise several Lamps of Silver, burning Spicecy Oyl, that cast a fragrant smell. When the Table was spread, the King, and all the Nobility won∣dred at the store, saying, that they had not seen the like in Cyprus be∣fore, and all that day continued they exceeding merry: but when night came, Fortunatus was desireous to go to Bed with his Bride, for as yet he had not bedded her; whereupon the King, Queen, Lords, and Ladys, accompanied them to their Chamber, and there used such Diversion as is usual upon the Wedding Night; which made the young Bride blush, but they retireing, left her to the imbraces of For∣tunatus, who, 'tis to be supposed, in the like case would have been. The Feast lasted 14 days, and then urgent business at Court cal∣ling the King away, he sent for Fortunatus, as likewise the Earl his Father-in-Law, and the Countess; and gave them all thanks for his entertainment, but the Countess appearing somewhat Melancholly, the King asked the cause: when as she told him, that she feared her Son-in-Law would soon waste all he had, so that her Daughter would be reduced to Poverty; therefore she should not be content unless he would settle some Dower in Land upon her; to which Fortunatus replyed, that he confessed his Lands were small, but as for ready mo∣ny, I will give 8000 Duckates into my Father-in-Laws hands to dispose of as he shall think fit, for the good of my Wife; which the
King no sooner heard, but he told them it was very opportunely hit; for said he, the Earl of Litgorn is about to sell a Lordship, with a Castle and other Appurtenances, being necessitated for ready mony, and if you think good I will send for him; to this they all agreed, and when the Earl was come, the King acquainted him with the matter: upon which to the great content of all parties, a bargain was driven, the Earl of Litgorn in lieu of 7000 Duckets deliver∣ing up his Title to the said Lordship, with the Government of the Village to Fortunatus, who delivered the Charge thereof to his Father-in-law for the use of Cassandra, which pleased the Countess beyond measure. CHAP. XVIII. How after the Departure of the King, Queen and Nobility, Fortunatus ordained a Feast for all the chief Citizens. DVring the Kings stay, Fortunatus set up three Iewels of great price, the first the Nobility Tilted for, he that did best being to possess the same; the second was provided for the Esquires and Gentlemen; the third for the Citizens, Yeomen and Servants, which caused them to Iust for nine days; which Pastime exceedingly pleased the King and all present. Now the time came that at the end of Fourteen days, the King and Queen with the rest of the No∣bility would depart, Fortunatus with all his Attendants accompa∣nied them Ten Miles outward of their way, and then the King de∣siring him to return, he came back to his Bride, and calling his Ser∣vants together, gave order that within two days they should provide another Feast for the Citizens and Gentlemen thereabouts; which was accordingly done, it holding Four days with great plenty of Mirth. The Feast ended, Fortunatus taking Leopoldus aside, said; For∣asmuch as thou hast faithfully served me hitherto, I will now propose to thee three Things, take thy choice of either: First, if thou art minded to return into Ireland, I will give thee four Servants to
attend thee, and as much Money as shall maintain thee during life. Secondly, If thou wilt live in the House with me (for I am not now mindful of Travel) I will maintain thee to thy hearts content. Thirdly, If it shall otherways like thee, I will give thee a Horse in this City, and maintain Servants to wait upon thee, and thou shalt lack nothing during life: For these kind Offers Leopoldus greatly thanked him, saying, he was unworthy of them; As for the first, I being now spent with Age and Travel, by reason of the tediousness of the way, shall hardly get thither; and for the second, seeing you have a fair Lady to accompany you, and many Servants, my being in the House will be needless; therefore if it shall so please you, I will imbrace the latter: with which Fortunatus was content, and bought him a Horse provided him Servants, and all Necessaries, allowing him 20 Duckets a week: Then Leopoldus prayed that he might be still of his Councel in all weighty Affairs, and that he would not suffer his love towards him to decay, which he solemnly swore to ob∣serve. In awhile after, Leopoldus sent into Ireland for his Wife and Children, acquainting them by Letters of the prosperous Condi∣tion he was in, and wished them to sell off what they had and come to him; but before their arrival, he, by reason of a grievous sickness, died, to the great grief of Fortunatus and his Lady, who caused him to be buried in a fair Tomb in the Chancel of the Church which he had built,: and upon the arrival of Leopoldus his Wife and Children, he entertained them courteously, comforting them in the best manner, and placing them in the house he had given to Leopoldus, and there maintaining them so long as they lived. CHAP. XIX. How fair Cassandra was brought to Bed of two fair Sons, whom Fortunatus caused to be Baptized, naming the elder Ampedo, and the younger Andolocia. NOw Fortunatus being in the height of Ioy, dasly solacing with his fair Bride the beautiful Cassandra, he wanted nothing but
Children, the dearest Pledges of mutual Love, for which he often pray∣ed, and cau ed the Priests to pray; till at last God heard him, and the tender Bride grew big with her fist Son, which afterwards was Christ'ned with great Solemnity, and called Ampedo; scare had they made an end of rejoycing for this Son before the teeming Lady perceived her self quick with another Child, which proved a Son also, and was named Andolocia; this brought a double Ioy, and the ra∣ther, because Fortunatus remembred the words of Dame Fortune, which were, That if he had no Issue, the Vertue of his Purse should fail with his Life: but Cassandra knew not of this nor of the Purse; Fortunatus not thinking it convenient to trust a Woman with so weighty a Secret. After they came to years of Maturity, he caused them to be brought up in Learning, providing for them the ablest Tutors he could get; as likewise to Fence, Iust, play upon Musick, and all other Arts and Sciences that belonged to a compleat. Gentleman, for these were all the Children he was likely to have by the fair Cassandra. CHAP. XX. How Fortunatus prevailed with his Wife to Travel again, and what befel him during his being abroad. WHen Fortunatus had lived with his Wife about sixteen years, he began to think of his former Travels, considering that for the most part they had been in Europe; whereupon he had been deprived of seeing such strange Rarities as other Countries in Asia did pro∣duce, he thereupon resolved to travel once again, but durst not for a long time disclose his Mind to his Wife, for fear of driving her into a Fit of Melancholy; but at last as he was walking with her in the Garden, he began to discourse her about his former Travels, and at last told her, that seeing it was not likely that he should have any more Children, he was purposed to see the Indies, Egypt, and Palesti∣na, for that he had already travelled over one half of the World. This drew Tears from the fair Cassandra, who with tender weeping and
many Intreaties besought him out of love to her and her Children, and by all the mutual Ties of their Conjugal Love, not to leave her: for in his absence her life would be altogether comfortless: Then he comforted her, telling her, he would make but a short stay of it, reck∣oning to return within a year; but this nothing pacified the discon∣solate Lady, who demanded of him in what she had offended, that he who was the Ioy of her Life, would leave her? and that if she had transgressed in ought, she would double her Obedience for the future: To which he answered, that she never offended him, but that he lo∣ved her as dear as his life, yet he was resolved to go, and nothing but Sickness or Death should hinder him; then she desired him if he would needs go, that he should travel into a Christian Country, and not expose his life to the Cruelty of Heathens, who most of all envy Christians and seek their blood; to which he replyed, That he had seen all the Christian Countries already, and that now he resolved to see both the Indies, and the places he had before named: But when she perceived she could not prevail with him neither by Tears nor Intrea∣ty, she fell down in a Swound, which moved Fortunatus to Compas∣sion; when coming to her self, she sighed bitterly, saying, O what have I done that I must lose the Ioy of my Life so soon? Then she sent to her Father and Mother to come and intreat him to stay, but they prevailed not: So that when she saw there was no way to pre∣vail, and that he had made a Vow to depart, she began a little to be contented, and upon his promise of a quick return, unwillingly yield∣ed; when as Fortunatus leaving her 10000. Crowns, he promises himself a Ship, and with his Purse went on Board only accompanied with two Servants. CHAP. XXI. How Fortunatus set Sail from Cyprus, and travelled into many strange Countries, and of the Adventures he met withal. FOrtunatus having hired many skilful Mariners, he commanded to loose their Anchor and Sail for Alexandria, a City in Egypt,
where in short time having a prosperous Wind they arrived; when coming into the Port, the Soldan's Officers demanded who was Master of the Ship? To which the Mariners answered, one Fortu∣natus a Noble-man of the Isse of Cyprus; then they said, he must appear before the Soldan, and make his Present, which was the Cu∣stom of them that came into that Port: Fortunatus hearing this, took with him several rich Iewels, and so went to the Soldan's Court; being conducted thither by the Guards that usually wait upon the Sea-Coast on the like occasion, where when he was arrived, he ord'red them to set a fair Table; which being done accordingly, he set many fair Iewels thereon, but had scarce time to place them before the Soldan came attended with his Nobles, and a great Guard, and perceiving the Iewels, he supposed they were set for Sale; and thereupon began to inquire their Price; upon which Fortunatus demanded whether he liked them? to which the Soldan replyed, Very well; forasmuch as they were the fairest that he had seen: then said Fortunatus, they are at your Highness's Service, take them and dispose of them as you please: When the Soldan heard him say so, he marvelled greatly that one Merchant should make a Present richer than any Twenty had formerly done, the Iewels not being esteemed less worth than 5000 Crowns; yet he accepted them, and promised Fortunatus that they should not be given in vain: and was as good as his word, for he sent him the next day three Carts laden with Pepper; this did not a little grieve the Merchants, who said amongst themselves, we have made many Presents to the Soldan, but never received any return, but we perceive this upstart Merchant is greatly favoured. Within awhile after the Soldan sent to Invite Fortunatus to Dinner, providing a very costly Entertainment, and in a while after the Lord High Admiral invited him likewise, which greatly offended the Merchants, forasmuch as they had given him great Summs of Money to turn Fortunatus out of Favour with the Soldan; but Fortunatus being thereof advertised, out-gave them, so that he ever had the Admiral on his side: so that he had the first choice of the rich∣est Merchandize which he ever bought. But now the time being come for the Ships departure, he gave the Master of her order to go to Spain, Holland, England, and other places, and unlade the Mer∣chandize,
which for the mot part consisted of Spices; and at the end, of one year, to return to Alexandria again, where he intended to be: but in the mean while he would travel into many Countries, and if they found him not there, then they should conclude him dead, and carry back the Ship and Goods to Cyprus, and there deliver them up to the use of his Wife and Children: this they promised to do, and thereupon they departed the Master to steer his Course, and Fortu∣natus to Travel. CHAP. XXII. How Fortunatus took his leave of the Soldan, and departed for India, and how he sped there. FOrtunatus having procured Letters from the Soldan to many Kings and Princes, through whose Countries he intended to tra∣vel, he departed with them joyfully, and taking Ship, he sailed into Persia, where after he had beheld the Splendor of the Emperors Court, he departed to Cathia, where the Cham of Tartaria bears Rule there; he likewise staied not long, by reason of the Barbarity of the People, who use Strangers very rudely; from thence he went through many Desarts full of wild Beasts, which put him oft in peril of his life, especially a Tyger which lay in ambush behind a Tree, waiting for some Traveller; who as soon as she espied Fortunatus coming, she set up such a Yelp as made the Forest tremble; and there∣upon came at him with an open Mouth, stretching out her dreadful Paws to grasp him to her, which Fortunatus perceiving, he drew his Sword and stood upon his Guard, as also did his Men: and as the Tyger made at him, Fortunatus with a full blow smote off one of her fore-legs, which yet inraged her the more, so that she came at him again, when he watching his opportunity, thrust his Sword down her Throat; and so reaching her Heart she fell down dead; then he exceedingly rejoyced, and travell'd on; where by the way he found the Remains of dead mens Carkasses which had been torn to pieces by the wild Beasts, and caused his Servants to cover them with earth;
this Forest was exceeding long, and therefore although they travelled Day and Night, it was two Days and two Nights ere they could pass it; then riding through many Cities, they came into India, or the Country of Pester John, who is Almighty Monarch, and has under him 62 Kings, being Lord of 30 Islands, besides what he possesses on the Continent or main Land. Here Fortunatus met with an old Hermit who was travelling to the Holy Land, and gave him 10 Crowns to bear his Charges; this Hermit conducted him and his men the nearest way to the Court of the Emperor, and gave them an account of the Customs of the Country, saying, That he had passed it many times, and that in his youth he had been a great Tra∣veller: then Fortunatus requested him to accompany him in his Tra∣vels, but he refused, saying, He was under a Vow to depart straight∣ways to the Holy Land, and so giving Fortunatus many thanks for his courteous Benevolence, he departed on his way, and Fortunatus rode to the Emperors Palace. CHAP. XXIII. How Fortunatus arrived at Prester John's Court, and was speedi∣ly entertained, and how he met there with two Conjurers, and how they sent two Witches to steal away his Purse, with many other strange Adventures. WHen Fortunatus from the top of an Hill beheld the Palace which glittered with Gold, so that by reason of the reflection of the Sun-beams it shone like a Comet, he greatly admired it, say∣ing, That since it was so fair without, it must needs be very beau∣tiful within, and so by Noon he approached it; at which tune the Emperor and his Lords were returned from hunting of wild Beasts, whereupon he had the opportunity of seeing them clad in warlike Ha∣biliments, which was after so strange a manner, that he greatly won∣d'red; when they were all entred, he came to the Porter, and demand∣ed if he and his Companions might not be admitted to behold the Palace, and take a view of the Emperor's Magnificent Entertain∣ment,
that so they might report it to his Praise, when they returned into their own Country: The Porter perceiving that they were Gentlemen and Strangers, freely admitted them; upon which For∣tunatus gave him a Ruby worth 30 Crowns: then coming into the Emperor's Presence, he signified to him, thet he had some Presents for him, and thereupon drew forth his Iewels, which were very rich, for he always bought the fairest; which the Emperor accepting of, gave him many thanks, and ord'red his chief Officer to feast them no∣bly, and to shew them all the Riches of his Palace, which were such as Fortunatus had never seen before; for the Walls some were pla∣ted with Silver, wherein were ingraven Stories of Knights and Battels, with the valiant Atchievements of the former Emperors; others were hung with Panthars Skins, which cast a fragrant smell; the Pillars that supported the Hall they were of Cedar over-laid with Gold, and imbossed with precious Stones: This pleased For∣tunatus so well, that he gave the Officer a Iewel worth 100 Duckets. Now when Dinner-time was come, Fortunatus and his Men were set down with the chief Officers and Noble-men; for such is the Cu∣stom of the Country, that none but the Princes of the Blood may Dine with the Emperor: Now in the midst of their Mirth, For∣tunatus perceived the Bottles and Flagons begin to dance upon the Table, at which he began greatly to wonder; when one that sate by him whisper'd him in the Ear, and told him it was done by Magick, and that the Emperor kept two Necromancers to make Pastime for Strangers; now after the Bottles had done dancing, there sprung up a Tree full of fair Oranges, which several Blacks came and plucked off, and then the Tree vanished; after that a large Stag came running in, and after him a Pack of Hounds at full Cry, who taking a Course or two round the Hall vanished; then several fair Women in strange Attire came in playing upon Lutes, and after having danced a turn or two, vanished: At this Fortunatus was greatly amazed, but well considering with himself it was only a De∣lusion of the Devil, and no real Substance, he rested the better con∣tent: Now when Dinner was ended, the Emperor sent for For∣tunatus to ride a Hunting with him, which he gladly did, and com∣ing into a Forest about six Miles from the Palace, there they rouzed
a Lyon who was sleeping in the Thicket, who shaked his brindled Mane, and reared so loud, that all the Forest trembled; upon which the Dogs were uncoupled, of which he roar several in pieces, and fought against several of them for the space of an Hour; when the Indians came running with their Lances, and run him into the body, so that he fell down dead, then took they off his Skin as a Trophy of Victory: After that the Dogs found out a great wild Boar, upon which they fastned, notwithstanding he gored many of them with his horrid Tusks, which were at least a foot long, & then the Iavelings be∣ing darted thick at him, he at last was killed, and his Head being cut off, was carried before the Emperor upon a Spear, as likewise the Lyon's Skin. By this time Sun was set, which made the Emperor hasten to his Palace, where, at Supper-time, Fortunatus drew a great deal of Gold out of his Purse, and gave amongst such as attended at the Table, which the Necromancers perceiving, who were also sitting at the Table, they thought with themselves this Stranger must needs be exceeding Rich, that can thus liberally dispence with his Money, therefore it will not be amiss when he is in Bed, if we use our Art, to get some of him; so that when all was done, and every one gone to their Chambers, they began to mutter over their Charms, and by that means raised their Familiars, commandig them to tell them who the Stranger was, and how he came by such quantities of Gold and Iewels; to which they replyed, He was a Merchant of Cyprus, and that he had a secret Mine which they were forbidden to reveal, which could not be emptied during his Life, and thereupon they vanished: Now the Conjurers sent for their Wives, who had familiar Spirits likewise, to attend them, and could trans∣form themselves, to appearance, into any shape: they being come, the Conjurers commanded them, in the shapes of Monkeys, to enter Fortunatus his Lodgings, and bring thence what Treasure they could find; the which they readily obeyed: when opening the Case∣ments, they entred; but by clapping them to and again, Fortunatus awoke, and supposing that they had been Thieves, drew his Sword, and striking at a venture, cut one of their Fore-feet off, whereupon they got out at the Window again, making such a lamentable Noise
as wakened a great many of those that lodged near, next morning Fortunatus getting up, espyed a hand lying on the ground, at which he was sore dismaid: but as he went to take it up, it was snatched from him he knew not how, so that he never saw it after: yet so it happened, that the next day one of the Conjurers Wives had lost her hand, which accosioned her Husband to fall out with his fellow, for putting her upon that exploit; insomuch that falling to Words, they both vowed revenge one of the other, when as he that had his Wife hurt, taking his opportunity when the other was leaning out at a window, he fixed a great pair of Stags Horns upon his head, so that he could by no means draw it in, but was obliged to stay there till the Charm was dissolved, which caused great laughter to such as beheld it, but in him it caused a desperate resolve of revenge: so that one day he having drawn the Figure of a Man upon the Wall with small cole, he compelled his adversary, notwithstanding all the in∣treagues he used to stand up against it, when immediately the Wall opened, and he sinking into it, was never heard of afterward. These Projects, and Hellish arts so affrighted Fortunatus, that he having got together abundance of Merchandize, and the Emperor's Letter of free Traffick in such Countrys as he came into, under the Emperor's Iurisdiction; he took his leave and departed, travelling towards Jerusalem, where he no sooner arrived, but he found an old Hermet, who shewed him the Holy Sepulchre, the pieces of the Cross, the Apostle, St. James's Tomb, and many other Relicks, which Pilgrims go thither to see; when he had viewed as much as he thought fit, he began to remember the promise he had made to his wife, and thereupon taking leave of the Old Man, he journyed to Alexan∣dria. CHAP. XXIV. How Fortunatus was well-comed by the Souldan, as he return∣ed to Alexandria, and what befell him, during his stay. FOrtunatus being now within eight miles of Alexandria, he sent one of his servants to acquaint the Admiral of his approach, and
to desire the Souldan's Letters to enter the City with his Camels, of which he had about 20 loaden with the riches of India, having hi∣red Natives of the Country to drive them, and to have the stronger guard, for fear of robbers: when the servant had done his hellish mes∣sage, the Admiral ordered his Horses to be made ready, and rode to meet Fortunatus, who lovingly embraced him, and asked him how he had faired, during his travelling in strange Countrys; whereupon Fortunatus told him all that had happened from time to time: then he conducted him to the Souldan, who was glad of his return, and caused a Feast to be made for him; when within three days after his coming thither, his Ship arrived from Famogosta, with Letters from Cassandra, who earnestly desired his return; so that having put his Merchandize on board, he would have set Sail: but going to take his leave of the Souldian, and to make him a present, he would needs have him stay and dine with him, which he could not deny him; yet he sent one of his servants to the master of the Ship, to require him to be in a readiness to set Sail; for that he intended as soon as he had dined, to come on board: the master was obedient. and put off the Vessel, ready to Sail, all her Anchors being weighed; yet the time of Fortunatus his coming was prolonged, by reason that the Souldan held him in discourse about his late travels: the which Fortunatus was obliged to relate, thanking the Souldan for his Letters, by which means he told him he had found kind Reception in many places, espe∣cially from the neighbouring Princes, who speak very well of him. Then would Fortunatus have taken his leave, but the Souldan pre∣vailed with him to stay supper also.
CHAP. XXV. How Fortunatus going with the Souldan into his Treasury to see his Jewels, understood the secret vertue of his wishing Hat, and how wishing himself on Ship-board, was he brought thither through the Ayr, and set Sail for Cyprus, with the wishing Hat. FOrtunatus being impatient of delay, least he should break his pro∣mise with his Wife; after supper was ended, he drew out a great deal of Gold, and bestowed it freely upon the servants, and again demanded leave to depart: but the Souldan seeing his infinite riches, thought that unless he shewed him his, he might boast in his own Country that he had the greater wealth: whereupon he desired him to follow him; and so led him into his Treasury which was all hung with Cloath of Tinse, and the Tables spread with Iewels, Rings, and Vessels of Gold and Silver, Gold Chains, and huge Pearls, with many other things of great price, which Fortunatus had ne∣ver seen the like before: then he had him into another Room, where he shewed him on infinite mass of mony; and now, says he, I have one thing more that I esteem above all that you have yet beheld, this made Fortunatus wonder: for, thought he, it must be of an inesteemable price if it exceed what I have seen already, and thereupon he grew impatient to have a view of it: when as the Souldian taking him by the hand, led him into another Chamber; and there taking down an old hat, said, this is the Iewel; at which Fortunatus smiled, telling him that was an old hat, and might be bought for a small matter: yes, said the Souldian, if it was only a hat, it was of no value, but there is such a secret retained in it, that for all the hats in the World, I would not leave it; nay, should I loose all my Iewels, I could purchase more, but should I loose this hat, such another the World affords not: then was Fortunatus very desireous to know the secret it retained; then said the Souldan; since you are my friend, I will impart it to you; which is this, that having this hat on, where ever you wish your self to be, thither shall you be conveyed almost as swift as can be
thought: so that when my Nobles are gone a Hunting, it is but wish∣ing my self with them, and I am there: when my armies are abroad, I can be with them, and in my Pallace almost in a moment; as like∣wise upon any occasion, 'tis but putting this hat on, and I can be carryed into any Country with a wish, and so back again. At this strange report, Fortunatus stood amazed, but yet secretly pondered with himself, that if it were true the Souldian said, he would by any means possess it, if he might; for thought he, my Purse and that Hat, are enough for the richest Emperor in the World: and thereupon he asked the Soldian, by reason of the qualities it retained, whether it were not heavyer than any other hat? no, said the Souldan, but rather lighter than any other: therefore for your satisfaction, try it on your head. This was what Fortunatus wished for, which made him that he could scarce forbear smiling; saying, he thought it had been much heavyer, and withal, that he did not think that the Sol∣dan, knowing the vertue on't, would be so unadvised as to trust him with it; and thereupon stepping to the Window, he wished himself on board his Ship; and thereupon before the Soldan could prevent him, he flew out at the Window, and was in his Ship in a moment, woodcut of Fortunatus sitting in the window with the sultan standing, arms in the air repetitive woodcut of multiple trees then Commanding the Marriners to clap up all their Sails, they steered their course before the wind with such speed, that although the
Soldan Commanded his Gally that lay in the Port to make after them, they could not come near the Ship of Fortunatus, upon which the Soldian was yet the more inraged, swearing by his Gods, that if he could take him, he would put him to the cruelest Death that ever man dyed; but the Merchants that usualy traded there, greatly re∣joyced when they heard what was done, though they durst not shew it openly: for, said they, now this Interloper will come no more amongst us, to spoil our Traffick. The Soldan being greatly perplexed in his mind for the loss of his Hat, was resolved to asend after Fortunatus into Cyprus; there to make him large offers, if he would either send or bring it; where∣upon he sent for Marcholandus a Venetian, that served under him, and acquainted him with what had passed, and willed him to take one of his best Ships, and follow Fortunatus into Cyprus; and first per∣swade him by intreaty and promises to restore the Hat, and if that would not do, to complain of his Treachery to the King of the Island, and if he refused to do Iustice, to denounce a War against him; this the Venetian gladly undertook, as well knowing, if he could recover the Hat, the Soldan would greatly favour and reward him; and so having all things in a readiness, he set Sail. CHAP. XXVI. How the Soldan's Ambassador came after Fortunatus to Cy∣prus, for the Wishing Hat, and how he complained to the King; but was sent away without it. FOrtunatus after two months departure from Alexandria, arri∣ved at Cyprus, where he was joyfully met by a great number of Nobility, and conducted to the Kings presence; who welcomed him home, and asked him of his travels, the which he at large related, and then taking his leave, put on his Wishing Hat, and going without the City, wished himself at his own House, and was there in a trice: when coming in, he met Cassandra, who run to him, and clasping him in her arms, could not speak to him a good while for joy; then he ha∣ving
saluted his Sons and Servants, he commanded meat to be set before him; and the next day invited a great number of his neigh∣bours to dine with him, whom he feasted after the best manner. Now when he had been at home about eight days, on the 10th of his arrival in the Island, Marcholandus, who was sent by the Sold∣an, came to his House, and desired to speak with him; who coming to him, he desired that they might be in private: whereupon Fortunatus took him by the hand, and led him into the Dining Room, and then willed him to declared his business; whereupon he delivered him the Sol∣dans Letter, and therewithal informed him how ungreatful he had been, in taking away the Hat, yet the Soldan would forget it all, and highly reward him, if he would restore it; I must confess, said For∣tunatus, the Soldan has cause to be offended, but let him thank his own folly in putting it upon my Head, I knew not the vertue of it before he declared it; and therefore since I ran the hazard of drowning, by flying on Ship-board with it, I am in the mind never to part with it. Then Marcholandus told him what offers the Soldan had made him, if he would restore it: and therefore out of all love desired him to let him carry it with him, or that he would carry it himself; but Fortunatus told him he would not part with it for the Soldan's Kingdom, and therefore willed him to cease his suit. Vpon this, Marcholandus growing impatient, began to threaten him; saying, that he would complain to the King, and if no redress could be had there, the Soldan would right him by Arms: at which Fortunatus smiling, bid him do as he pleased, and thereupon Marcho∣landus departed to the Court, where procuring to be admitted to the King's presence, he grievously complained of Fortunatts; telling all that had happened concerning the Hat, and desired his Maiesty to use his Prerogative Royal, in compelling him to restore it; but the King said that Fortunatus was his dear friend, and he would not in any wise use compulsion towards him; but if he would deliver it up of his own accord well and good, but if not, the Law was open, and he must take his Regular Course. But Marcholandus well knew that Fortunatus was too powerfull in his own Country, for a stranger to wage Law against him: whereupon he told the King, that upon the re∣fusal of delivering the Hat, he had a Commission to denounce War, e∣ven
as you please for that, said the King; and tell the Soldan, that although I esteem his friendship, yet I fear not his anger, but shall defend my self as well as I can; upon this, Morcholandus return∣ed very heavy, and told the Soldian all that had passed, who thereupon conceived such an inward grief for the loss of his Hat, that in a short time he dyed. CHAP. XXVII. How Fortunatus finding himself in a declining condition, prepared himself for another World. FOrtunatus being now about 60 years of Age, began to bethink himself that his thread of Life was almost at an end, and there∣upon he resolved to prepare himself for a future state, greatly lament∣ing the loss of so much precious time as he had spent in frivilous and vain trifles, wishing that he had chosen wisdom rather than riches; for, said he, they are ever cumbersome, troublesome, and full of danger: how often have they destroyed both Soul and Body, and what wicked∣ness is there in the World that will not be done for mony? What hor∣rid Bloodshed, Massacres, and Civil Wars, does it stir up? Well! I must confess, for the greatest part of my Life, I have had exceeding plenty, but have not lived so free and truly merry, as when I had no∣thing but what I worked for: how often has my life been endanger∣ed by reason of my Purse? nay, past doubt I had been murthered long since, for if it; any had known its vertue; but now I will earnestly re∣pent me of my former folly; and upon that he let fall many tears: at which instant, Cassandra coming in, demanded the cause of his hea∣viness, to whom he imparted it without any dissimulation; and she on the other hand strove to comfort him: but at last his Melancholly drew him into a Consumption, which soon occasioned his Death, as shall in the next Chapter be shown.
CHAP. XXVIII. How Fortunatus falling sick, made his Will; and declared to his Sons the virtue of his Purse and the Hat, with a Comm∣and not to disclose them to any, as likewise of his Death. FOrtunatus being sick unto death, and perceiving his end to be nigh, called his Sons to him and blessed them, biding them to live lovingly and peaceably together: and that he would leave them a suf∣ficient Competency to maintain them both in a most splendid conditi∣on; but, said he, it is such a secret, as will loose its vertue if once discovered, therefore take my Counsel in all points, and so you will prosper, or otherwise be in perpetual danger, for seldom is it seen, that disobedient Children prosper: when he had said thus much, he called for his Purse and Hat and advertised them of the secrets they contain∣ed, saying, that no Mortal ever yet knew the vertue of the Purse, but himself excepted: but as for the Hat, said he, I got it from the Soldan of Babylon, who offered me many rich presents for to have it again, he repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of Fortunatus in bed with two men standing next to the bed esteeming it more worth, than all his inestimable Treasure, therefore as you tender the enjoying of them, do not in any wise disclose the se∣cret virtue of either of them, lest in so doing, you either loose them or
your lives; and farther, he advised them not to part the Iewels, but to live together lovingly, and when he had so said, he cryed with a loud voice! Lord receive my Spirit, and so yielded up the Ghost: after which, his Sons and his Wife made great Lamentation for him; and caused him to be buried in the Chancel, near his Father and Mo∣ther in a new Tomb, which he had caused to be built in his life∣time. About a month after, Cassandra, for the exceeding sorrow she con∣ceived at his Death, fell into a violent Feavour, and dyed likewise: and was, by her Sons, buried in the same Sepulcher with her Hus∣band. Now after the days of Mourning were over, Andolocia, Fortunatus his youngest Son, being inflamed with a desire to Tra∣vel; upon reading what adventures his Father had met with in strange Countrys, he thus bespeak to his Brother. Dear, Brother, since we are both in our Youth and Strength, 'tis not fit that we should spend our time in idleness, therefore let us travel, and see strange Countries; but this nothing liked Ampedo, the Eldest, who was given rather to the rest of a quiet Life; whereupon he an∣swered. Dear Brother, if you are minded to travel you may, but as for me, I will stay in this Pallace, and spend my days in my Na∣tive Country. Then said Andolocia, let us part the Iewels, give me my Portion and let me be gone: not so said Ampedo, know you not that it was our fathers strict Command when he dyed, that we should not part them; no matter for that, said Andolocia, now he is Dead, he will never repine at what we do; then said Ampedo, take you your Hat and be packing; no, said Andolocia, I will have the Purse, if any: upon this, there arose a hot dispute between them, till Andolocia said, then if you needs will have Mony, fill two Coffers out of the Purse, and take the Hat and the rest of the Iewels, with free possession of all the Houses and Pallaces, and give me the Purse only; and at six Years end, I will return and deliver it you again; to this Ampedo consented, lest in the heat of Quarrel, the secrets of the Purse should be revealed, and so the difference between them was ended,
CHAP. XXIX How Andolocia went with his Purse into the French Court, and what entertainment he foun. there. ANdolocia, having got the Purse, departed joyfully, and after having passed through many Countrys, at last he came into France, when repairing to Paris the chief City, he went to view the splendor of the Kings Court: where attiring himself after the best manner, he accompanied himself with the Nobility and Gentry, spend∣ing even to admiration; for such was his liberality, that he exceeded most of the Nobility; and kept such stately entertainment, and such costly Garbs, as the Country did afford: but long he had not stayed there, before Iusts were ordeined, and a Challenge made by certain Noble Personages against any that durst Encounter them: upon which Andolocia prepared for the Combat, and unhorsed three Earls, one after another: of which the King took great notice, and ordered that he should be entertained in his Pallace; when night came, the Ladys and Gentlemen were disposed to Dance; amongst which, the King would have Andolocia make one, where he so well behaved him∣self, that all the Eyes of the Ladys were upon him; and from that time forth they highly esteemed him, and he, by often conversing with them, at last fell deep in Love with one of them, who was a beautifull Lady, and Wife to a Courtier of Andolocia's acquaintance: and so passionate he was, that finding a fit opportunity he told her his desire, saying, that if she would consent to lye with him but one night, he would give her a 1000 Crowns; but she being a Virtuous Lady re∣fused his proffer, and acquainted her Husband what offer Andolocia had made: who considered what a great help a 1000 Crowns would be to him in his necessity, yet was very loath to be a Cuckold; so that casting about, they at last agreed to get a Neighbour of theirs to sup∣ly her Room, and so to deceive him in his Expectation; this liked them both very well, whereupon, when Andolocia importun'd her a∣gain, she gave him hopes, telling him that such an Evening her Hus∣band would be abroad about earnest business, and then if he would
come and bring with him the Mony he should be entertained to his wish. This rejoyced not Andolocia a little, who thought every hour a day till the happy Lover was come: now in the mean time, she went to her Neighbour and told her, she should have a 100 Crowns if she would but prostitute her Body to a Gentleman in her stead, so that it might not be discerned; for, said she, I would willing∣ly do it, but that my Husband so narrowly watches me that I have no opportunity; to this the Neighbour freely consented, without any Scruple of Conscience, as being used to the Trade, and so at the time appointed Andolocia came and brought the Mony, which the Lady took, then biding him sit down, she conveyed her Neighbour in at a back Door, and put her into her own Bed, and when it was dark, Andolocia, was by the Chamber-Maid whom he bribed with 20 Crowns, led to the Bed, and there pulling off his Cloaths in he went, and imbraced the Gentlewoman with abundance of kindness, sporting it by times till it was almost day; when as his Bed-fellow would have risen, but he would not suffer her: so that she knowing when light appeared, she should be discovered, for fear freely confessed the whole matter: which greatly grieved him that he had been so deceived, for instead of a beautiful Gentlewoman whom he thought he had in Bed with him, he had imbraced a common Strumpet; yet dissembling the matter as well as he could, gave the Baggage a 100 Crowns, telling her what he had given the Gentlewoman before; and ordered her as soon as he was departed the City, to sue for them, seeing the Gentlewoman had not performed her promise; which she being arm∣ed with impudence did accordingly, and put the Lady to great shame and disgrace CHAP. XXX. How Andolocia went to the King of Spain's Court, and of the noble entertainment he received there, and what Atchieve∣ments he made. ANdolocia having had this Female cheat put upon him, resolved to stay no longer in the French Court, lest it should be noised
abroad to his disgrace: but immediately taking Horse, he rode with his Servants to Navar, from thence to Aragon, and so to the Spa∣nish Court, which in those days greatly flourished, where, for the bet∣ter entertainment, he put himself into a Spanish Garb, for such is the humour of that Nation; that they will, by their good wills, sort themselves with none but such as comply with their fashion. At that time there were Wars with Portugal, so that Andolocia raising a 100 men payed them himself, and rid at the head of them in the King's Service; where by his Valour and undaunted Courage, he got himself great Praise, insomuch that the King taking notice of it, not only Knighted him, but likewise bestowed many rich presents on him, and proferred to Marry him to the Daughter of an antient Earl; with whom after the Father's Decease, he should have the Earldom: but Andolocia humbly thanked his Majesty, saying, that he was not disposed to Marry, for that he was resolved to see many Countrys. Within a while after the Wars ceasing, Andolocia dismissed his Souldiers, and took leave of the King, who was very loath to part with him; yet, Andolocia urging him, he bid him farewell, and when ever he came into Spain again, to make use of his Court, as freely as if it were his own: after he had left the King, he took Ship∣ing and sailed for England, when coming up the River of Thames, he landed at the Tower of London, and much admired the strong and stately Building; when coming to the Court, and having ta∣ken a view of the same, he searched for a stately House as near to it as possible: which he having found, furnished it after the best man∣ner, and retained many Men and Maid-servants, keeping a very plentiful Table, insomuch that a great many of the Courtiers re∣sorted dayly thither, and were by him feasted; of which the King hearing, he sent for him, and asked him what he was, who according∣ly told him; then said the King, will you be content to have a Com∣mand under me in the Wars against the Scots? Yes, with a very good will said Andolocia, and will raise and maintain a hundred men at my proper cost and charges: at this the King was greatly pleased, and made him a Captain, so that going against the Enemy, he fought so manfully that he broke their Ranks, and greatly disordered
them, insomuch that fresh forces coming on, they soon put them to the rout, and although many did bravely that day, yet Andolocia did best, which yet the more indear'd the King to him. CHAP. XXXI. How Andolocia being at Dinner with the King, fell in Love with a Agrypina the Princess, and what happened after. ANdolocia was no sooner returned from the Wars, but the King sent his Stewerd to invite him to Dinner, as likewise several of the chief Commanders were likewise present, many Ladys and Gentlewomen, and amongst the rest, the Princess of Agrypina, who, for beauty, surpassed all her Sex: on her Andolocia fixing his Eyes, so surfrited on her beauty, that he could never eat nor drink to any purpose, but still kept his Eyes fixed on her: and wished that he was a Prince for her sake, though, said he, I am as well able to keep her, as ever a Prince in Christendom; yet, I not being of Royal Blood, it will be but in vain for me to flatter my self into a belief, that she will condescend to my request, should I ask her yet; 'tis but trying: and from the time forth, Andolocia attired himself in Pur∣ple and Gold, and would ever be the formost in Tilts and Iusts that were to be before the King, Queen, and Princes, where he won great Applause; after which taking his opportunity, he invited the Queen and her Daughter to Dinner, and so splendidly entertained them, that they had not beheld the like in the King's Pallace; and at their de∣parture, gave each of them a Rich Iewel, which they very readily ac∣cepted. At Andolocia's next coming to Court the King met him, and told him that he heard how he had entertained the Queen and Princess to their content, saying, if he had but known of his Feast, he would have been there in Person; whereupon Andolocia excused himself, saying, he durst not presume so high, as to invite His Maje∣sty; but that if he would so far Honour him with his Presence, he would be infinitely obliged to him for so great an Honour: to this the King consented, and appointed the next day to come, whereupon
Andolocia provided a more costly entertainment than before: inso∣much that the King marveled how he could live at that rate: several Fires he made of Ceder and Spices, which cast a fragrant smell, so that the King and several of his Nobles sat down, and were exceed∣ing merry; continuing there till Evening, and then departed: at whose departure, Andolocia gave mony amongst the Guards, and humbly thanked the King for the Honour he had done him. When the King came to the Court, he told the Queen and Prin∣cess how bravely he had been entertained; and that he did not a little wonder how Andolocia, having neither Lands nor Subjects, to ap∣pearance, could spend so liberally; therefore he said, he believed he must be some Priest in disguise: truly, said the Queen, I can but wonder as well as you! and have had a longing mind to know how he comes by so much mony, and of late I have bethought my self of the means: he has, for some time past, he professed great Love to our Daughter, the which by many Simptomes I well perceive is unfeigned; where∣fore I intend to Advertise her of my Purpose, and if she shew him but a little kindness, I know he will not deny her any thing; this well pleased the King, and thereupon he ordered Aggrypina to search out the matter, who promised to use her utmost diligence therein. CHAP. XXXII. How the Princess came to know the secret of the Purse, and how she deceived Andolocia of the same. THe next Morning Andolocia coming to the Court, was ad∣mitted into Agrypina's Chamber, a favour that he never be∣fore enjoyed; at which he exceedingly rejoyced, thinking with himself that this was a happy opportunity, and prosperous; he had not long been there before the Princess came, and with a merry Countenance, wished him a good Morning; at which he humbly thanked her Grace, and then she caused him to sit down by her, and fell to discourse about divers Affairs: as of his Travels, Birth, and Parentage, so that in such like discourses, they spent much time; then began Andolocia
to express the passion he had for her, and that how for her sake, he would adventure any hazard. Alas! said she, I am not at my own dispose, for if I were, your Estate would soon decrease at the rate you live, and then I should come to poverty; fear not that my Love, and dearest part of Life, my Estate can never grow less then it is, al∣though I should spend a Million a week: then belike said Aggrypina, your Father is some Puissant Prince: not so, said Andolocia, my Father is Dead, nor was he, neither am I, a Prince; his Riches and mine were equal, and though we both have spent to excess, yet had we never the less. This made Aggrypina wonder, and therefore she was the more desirous to know whence this infinite Treasure should flow, and be∣gan to shew better Countenance than ever, saying, you have often told me you loved me Andolocia; and in that, said he, I have not said amiss; for I protest by all that's sacred, I admire and adore you a∣bove all Women kind, esteeming you, as indeed you are, the fairest of your Sex: many Ladys have I seen in Forraign Courts, but your bright perfections as far excells them all, as the Sun does the paler Lustre of the Moon; therefore vouchsafe dear Lady to cure the Wounds you have made, and pardon my boldness. Then said Aggrypina, if it be true, that you love me as you say, pray tell me from whence you have such abundance of Treasure, in which when I am better satisfied, you may expect my favour, but not till then? At this, Andolocia was almost extasied, being drunk with Love and doating upon her Beauty, he was resolved to satisfie her desire, and thus began. Madam, could you but keep it secret, I would lay open to you all the secrets of my Soul, and unfold what my Dying Father charged me not to do, though at this Instant his Ghost should rise and blast me; nay, said Aggrypina, if you loved me, you would not doubt my keeping your secrets, but your scrupling my Fidelity, shews you love me not: by Heaven! said Andolocia, I do, and will reveal the secret, and thereupon in an unlucky hour, he drew out his Purse, saying, here is my Exchequer which can never be emptied, and thereupon he pulled out 300 pieces of Gold, and gave
woodcut of a woman standing, Andolocia and the King sitting at a table repetitive woodcut of multiple trees them to Aggrypina, and then the Purse seeming empty, he put in his hand and pulled out as many more, and so he did several times; saying, thus can I do for many years together, and yet can never empty this Purse during my Life; this was left by my Father, and given to him by Dame Fortune, in a Wilderness, as he was tra∣velling to see strange Countrys. Aggrypina having now under∣stood what she most desired, she began to Plot how she might get the Purse into her possession; and therefore told Andolocia, that if he would promise faithfully to marry her, he should lie with her before∣hand, for that the King and Queen lodged that night in a Summer House at the upper end of the Garden, and that by bribing her chief Woman, he might be admitted into her Chamber: this made him leap for joy, promising to gain admittance what ever it cost him; and so taking his leave of her, with a thousand thanks for that she had vouchsafed to pitty him, he departed: then went Aggrypina to the King and Queen, and declared all that had happened, and how she had given him hopes of enjoying her that night, with a design to be∣reive him of his Purse: the Queen commended her Wit, and order∣ed a Purse to be made like to that Aggrypina had described. When they had done, they prepared a sleepy Potion; ordering the Cup∣bearer to put it into the Wine that Andolocia should drink: which
being done to the Life, about eight in the Evening, Andolocia came and inquired for the Princesses Woman, as if he had a Letter to de∣liver: and when he had found her, he gave her a Purse with a 100 Crowns in it, telling his purpose; of which she made something strange, though she knew it from the Princess: yet she shut him in∣to the Princesses Chamber, where he had not stayed long, before Ag∣grypina came and bid him welcome, then she sent the Matron for two Bottles of Wine, one for Andolocia, and another for her self: telling him, in token of the Love she bear him, she would drink off a full bowl, and hoped that he would do the like; now the Woman had notice to put the Drugs into that he was to drink, which she did accor∣dingly: after Andolocia had drunk it off, he began to grow drousiy, so that within a while, Aggrypina and her Woman talked him fast asleep, then she sending her Woman away, turned aside his Coat, and took off the Purse, in the Room of which, she placed a Counterfeit one, and then went to the King and Queen; who with much impa∣tience expected her coming. She was no sooner come but they demanded how she sped, to which she answered, she had sped as she wished, for here says she is the Gol∣den Purse; and with that, putting her hand into it, she pulled out several handfuls of Gold, at which the King and Queen greatly re∣joyced: then the King demanded her to give it into his keeping, but the Queen said, since she had ventured for it, it was but Reason she should keep it. Now whilst this discourse held, Andolocia awoke, and starting up as one amazed, found that he had slept in the Chair all night, which did not a little perplex him; when in the midst of his trouble, in came the Old Woman, of whom he demanded where Aggrypina was? she told him that she having layn alone all night in expectation of his waking and coming to bed to her, she was now risen, being ve∣ry much grieved that he should so disappoint her. And farther she told him, that although they jogged him, and used many endeavours, they could not wake him; then concluded Andolocia, it was done by the Inchantment of some that envyed his happiness, and thereupon departed pensive to his House, as having lost so happy an opportunity; that he was out of all hopes of regaining such another, but little dreamt his Purse was gone.
CHAP. XXXIII. How the King sent to Andolocia to prepare a Dinner for him, and how when he found his Purse was lost, he left his House in great heavyness, and departed for Cyprus. NOw the King being desirous to try how Andolocia would be∣have himself after the loss of his Purse, sent his Steward to him to acquaint him, that by reason a stranger was come to Court, he purposed to bring him to his House, and therefore willed him to provide accordingly, which Andolocia promised, as not yet having essayed his Purse. After the Messenger was gone, he called his Steward, and bid him provide for the King's entertainment, such things as he thought most fit; to which he replyed, his mony was spent in the late costly Banquets, and to furnish a new one he must have more mony; with that Andolocia put his hand into his Purse as formerly, but to his great amazement found nothing in it; then be∣gan he to turn it and look upon it, but found it was not the same: then he waxed exceeding sorrowful, and much repented him of his folly, that, contrary to his Fathers Command, he had declared the se∣crets of his Purse: as likewise, how he had been deceived by a Wo∣man not long before, which might have been a fair warning to him how he again trusted any of that treacherous Sex; and in utter dis∣pair ever to gain it by fair means, he called all his Servants about him, telling them that he had heard of the Death of his Brother in Cyprus, and must instantly depart thither to take Possession of his Land, and therefore willed them to take what wages was due: besides their Horses and the furniture of the House he would freely bestow upon them, and then leave them to shift for themselves, for that it would be too great a trouble to carry Servants over the Sea. At this suddain news they were all dismayed, telling him that they would venture their Lives and Fortunes with him wherever he went: but he told them it must not be, but that if ever he returned to England, he would find them out, and entertain them as former∣ly; and so taking his leave of them, he rid to the Sea, all alone, and there taking Ship departed for Cyprus.
CHAP. XXXIIII. How Andolocia arrived at Cyprus, and declared to Ampedo, all that had happened. ANdolocia sanding in the Isle of Cyprus, hasted to Famogosta and entring the Pallace, where he meeting his Brother, they kindly embraced, and asked of each others Welfare; for now Ampe∣do thought to have his turn of the Purse: but when he beheld his Brother pensive and sad, he much doubted the event, and there upon began to ask him what was become of his men? nay, says he, as for them I take no farther care, but am glad my self is returned with Life. Then Ampedo began to ask him about the Purse, who an∣swered in a mournful tone, that by disobliging his Fathers Command, he had lost it; how! said Ampedo, by fraud or force? nay, said he, by fraud; for falling in Love with a fair Lady, her beauty so far bewitched me, that at her intreaty I told her the secret virtue of it; in∣somuch that when I was asleep, she got it from my Girdle, and pla∣ced a false one in the Room of it. This it is, said Ampedo, to be diso∣bedient, had it not been better for you to have stayed at home, without running any hazard, then thus to loose the best Treasure the World can afford? now, if we come to poverty, shall we be the laughing stock and scorn of all that have formerly known our manner of li∣ving. Good Brother, said Andolocia, do not aggravate my sorrow, for I grieve sufficiently, and repent me of my folly; insomuch that I fear it will cast me into some dangerous sickness, of which I shall dye: when Ampedo heard him say so, he began to leave off chiding, and strove to comfort him, saying, well! since it is lost, let it go, I have yet 3000 Duckets left, besides the Wishing Hat, for which I doubt not to get a great summ of mony, when some Puissant Prince shall know the vertue of it. CHAP. XXXV. How Andolocia deceived his Brother, and got his Wishing Hat, with which he came into England, and carried away Aggrypina and the Purse, into a desart place, and what there befel. NOw when Andolocia had continued a while with his Brother, he one day told him, that if he would lend him his Wishing
Hat, he did not yet doubt to recover the Purse: but Ampedo would by no means consent thereto, saying, that he was wiser than so, and that the best way was to sit down w th the first loss; for, said he, I doubt not but to get 10000 Duckets for the Hat when our mony is spent: so that when Andolocia perceived he would not part with it for an English Voyage, he let him alone a good while, and then ta∣king his opportunity when his men were gon a Hunting, he desired him to let him have the Hat only to get amongst them, that he might see the sport: to this Ampedo consented, but Andolocia had no sooner put it on, but he wished himself at Venice, and was instantly conveyed there through the Ayr: where he enquired for several Jews who were wont to trade in Rich Iewels, and desired that he might see their Iewels, the which they consented to, in hopes of a Chapman; but Andolocia had no sooner got them in his hands, but he wished himself in England, and was suddenly carryed thither, the Jews imagining him to be no other than the Devil; and blessed themselves that they did not take any of his mony. When he came into England, he disguised himself in an Italian habit, and getting on a long Gown, went to the Court, and there pretending himself to be a Merchant, he insinuated into the Compa∣ny of Aggrypina's Gentlewomen, by giving them small presents, that so they should perswade the Princess to buy his Iewels, which were very rich; with which they soon acquainted her, and willed him to spread them abroad as she passed by, which he accordingly did, and she casting her Eyes upon them, asked if he would sell any of them? yes, and if it shall please your Highness, I am come from a far Country for that purpose; then she chose out several of the best, and asked him the Price, who told her she should have them for 6000 Crowns, whereupon she bid him 3000 Crowns; but he immagin∣ing that she would bring out the Purse, bargained with her for 4000 Crowns, and then she ordering him to bring them into her Cham∣ber, went to a Coffer, and taking thence the Purse, tyed it fast to her Girdle: which was what Andolocia looked for, who whilst she was telling out the Mony, clasped her fast by the Arm, and throwing her upon his back, he wished himself in a Solitary Desart: and imme∣diately they were both carryed out of sight, to the great amazement of
those that beheld it, and were not let down till they came into Ire∣land; then Aggrypina being faint, Andolocia placed her under a Tree, on which were many Apples, exceeding fair to appearance: when∣as she made her request to Andolocia, that if he had any pitty of a poor distressed Virgin, he would get her something to quench her thirst, or she should faint; with that he taking pitty of her, as loving her still, although she had so misused him, he got up the tree, and through carelesness left the Hat upon her Head, and the Iewels in her lap, who whilst he was plucking the Apples, said, Woe is me! how came I hither into this forlorn and desart place? O! how unlike is this to my Father's Country, I would to God I were in my Father's Palace again: the which when Andolocia heard, he hasted down the Tree to stay her flight, but she was gone, past recovery, in a moment, with the Purse, Hat, and Iewels, which vexed Andolocia worse than before: whereupon he began to Curse the Destinies, and the Hour wherein he was borne, saying, that now he was quite undone, and his loss unreparable! When he had bewailed his misfortune a good while, he being faint and dry eat the Apples, upon which he felt a suddain pain in his Head, which made him suppose they were infecti∣ous; but it continued not long, before a large pair of Goats Horns sprung up, at which he was sore affrighted, and would have fled from repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of two men standing and one flying him t had it been possible; and began more than before to exclaim against his hard Fate, saying, that now such a misfortune was befel
him, as would exclude him from the Honour and Society of men; then began he to Curse the time when he first came into England; and wished that he had died in the Womb, or as soon as ever he beheld the light: Cursing and Railing against the Inchanting beauty of Aggrypina, which had wrought him all this disgrace, and misery; vowing, if possible, to be revenged; and was grown so desperate, that he resolved to sell his Soul to the Devil, rather then she should go un∣punished. And in this mad mode he ranged the Forrest, for two days space, without meeting either Man or Beast: till at last he came to a Cave under a spreading Oak, wherein lived an aged Hermet, who not only calmed his desperate resolves, but likewise cured him of his Horns, as shall in the next Chapter he shown at large. CHAP. XXXVI. How Andolocia, by the advice of an Hermet, was eased of his Horns, and how he came into England, and grafted a pair of Goats Horns upon the Head of Aggrypina. WHen the Hermet perceived Andolocia, he came out of his Cell, and demanded what business brought him into such a discon∣solate and desart place? and withal smiled when he beheld the Horns upon his Head, as well knowing what had caused them: to whom Andolocia replyed with a doleful tone, truly, I was brought hither by the Ayr, and remained here full sore against my will; but yet, I woodcut of a man unlocking a door with four men standing behind him; repeated from p. 32 repetitive woodcut of multiple trees must thank God that I have found you here to be my comfort, for I never intend to go to any Town, unless I can be rid of this deformi∣ty,
which proceeded from eating Apples in this Wilderness; at which the Old Man laughed heartily, and the rather, to see what a piteous wry face Andolocia made; at which Andolocia being somewhat displeased, told him, that he ought rather to comfort him than to in∣crease his affliction: Yes, said the Hermit, I shall comfort you, and therefore come into my house, and in two hours space I'le cause thee to shed thy Horns. At this Andolocia greatly rejoyced, and told the Hermit, that if he would do so, he would give him 10 Crowns; keep your Money, said the Hermit, and corrupt not me with it, for if I had delighted in Riches I had not come to this place, neither need I now to live here: then Andolocia asked the old man for something to eat, who brought him out Roots, Nuts, Field-Apples, and a cruise of Water, which was all the fare he lived on; then desired he would begin to cure him of his Horns; at which the Hermit went out of his Cave, and returning again about half an hour after, brought six Apples of a very fair colour with him, and wished Andolocia to eat two of them; the which he had no sooner done, but his Horns dropped off, at which he was exceeding glad, and asked the Hermit how those Fruits came to be of such different qualities? to which he answered, The Wise Creator and Soveraign Lord of all things had so dispo∣sed his bounties, that seldom there is any thing hurtful, but there is likewise another thing to cure the hurt that it causes; but in all the Earth I believe there is not two Trees that retain the like qualities of these Trees. Now after they had held a long discourse about the business of the World, the Hermit bid Andolocia be mindful of the future state of his precious and immortal Soul: and so guiding him to the next Town, he dismissed him with his Blessing; and Andolocia on the other hand, returned him a thousand Thanks. Then went Ando∣locia to the next Inn and called for Meat and Drink, afterwards he departed thence toward the Sea-side, studying all the way how he might be revenged on Agrippina; and having some of the Hornify∣ing Apples in his Pocket, as likewise four of the contrary quality, which the Hermit had given him, he resolved to go for London, and if possible, to graft a pair of Horns upon the head of Agrippina, by which means he doubted not to recover his Hat and Purse; in order
to which, he agreed with the Master of the Vessel to carry him into England; when coming to London, he disguised himself, and so went to the Court, and there putting his Apples in a Box, he set them forth just as the Princess was coming by: and when any one asked him what Fruit they were, he told them they were brought from Jerusalem, and that they grew in the Holy Garden; which made ma∣ny inquire the price, but he held them so dear that none would buy; it not being his intent that any should experiment the secret; he had not long continued before Agrippina came by, and casting her eyes upon them, she not being accustomed to see such kind of Fruit, demanded what they were? then her Gentlewoman told her; whereupon she made towards Andolocia, and takeing one up in her hand, asked the price? which he told her was 3 Crowns the least; for, says he, I have not above Twenty of them, and it has cost me a twelve-months Travel to fetch them; some, 'tis true, I dispos'd of in the Court of France, where they are highly approved for their vertue. Well, and what vertue, said the Princess, do they contain? Such, said Ando∣locia, that if you were old they would restore both Youth and Beauty; they are not only pleasant to taste, but have such a miraculous secret, that they once being eaten, preserve health for 7 Years after; but how many, said Agrippina? only Two, said Andolocia. Vpon this, the Princess, who was sometimes troubled with Fits, bought Two of them, but would give him no more than two Crowns a piece and putting them in her Handkerchief, departed; which did not make Andolocia a little rejoyce; so staying about the Court, he perceived by the melancholly temper of her waiting-Gentlewoman that the pro∣ject had taken effect; for so it was, that when the Princess came into her Chamber, she eat one of the Apples, and finding it had a luscious taste, eat, in a while afterwards, another; then lying down to sleep, as was her usual custome, she found her self somewhat indisposed, but yet slept for half an hour; during which space, she Dreamed that a great He-Goat came running at her, and butted with his Horns; whereupon she striving to flye, found her self turned into a Goat also; at which being much affrighted, she awoke, when starting up, she felt a more then usual weight upon her head; when looking in the Glass, she espyed a great pair of Horns fixed upon her head, whereat
she shrieked out, so that her Gentlewomen came running, and when they beheld her, they shrieked also; but the old Matron who was her Tutor, being wiser then the rest, bid them keep silence; for, said she, if this be noised abroad, the greatest Beauty upon Earth will loose her credit amongst Men; but the best way will be to procure such a∣ble Physitians as may take them away: then asked she of Agrippi∣na, which way she deemed that they happened? to which Agrippina replyed, I know not, unless it be some immediate judgement shewed upon me for my too great opinion of my beauty, or the effects of the strange Fruit I bought of the Merchant; but however they came, I pray you seek some means by which I may be rid of them, whatever it cost me, before it comes to be blazed about in the World; where∣upon the old Woman went to all the noted Physitians, and acquaint∣ed them what had happened to a fair young Gentlewoman, but told them not her name; then many of them desired to see her, but she told them that might not be, unless unsight or unseen they would promise and oblige themselves in an obligation of 2000 Crowns if they per∣formed it not; but they looking upon it as a strange and unheard of matter, would not undertake it upon such conditions; so that the old Matron was returning home sad and heavy that she had not sped: when Andolocia who had watched her all the while, meeting her at a turning, being now in the habit of a Doctor with great false, Whisk∣ers, and other disguises, drew near and saluted her, saying, What makes you so sad, is not some one of your friends well? for so I do guess, because I see you come out of such a Doctor's house: Truely, said she, there is something more than ordinary that makes me thus: then said Andolocia, be not afraid to discover it, for by my skill and God's blessing, I have done miraculous Cures, left off by other Physitians. When the Matron heard him say so, she greatly rejoyced, and de∣clared to him in all points what had happened, which was to him no news; and desired him to stay till she went and acquainted the young Gentlewoman with it, and she would return to him within an hour: the which he promised to do; so that when the Old Gentlewoman re∣turned, she enjoyned him to keep secresie, and to promise the payment of 2000 Crowns if he did not perform the Cure, and then she led him up a back way into Agrippina's Chamber.
CHAP. XXVII. How Andolocia, by undertaking to Cure Agrippina of her Horns, first recovered his Wishing-Hat, and afterwards his Purse, with what happened during the time. NOw when Andolocia was brought into Agrippina's presence, and beheld her Horns, he inwardly rejoyced, though to appear∣ance he seemed sorry; then, said he, fair Lady, be not dejected, for I shall surely Cure you of your Horns: if you do, said Agrippina, I will bountifully reward you; fear it not, said Andolocia; in the same case was an Earl's Daughter in Flanders for making false vows to her Lover and never performing them, yet I cured her: then be∣gan Aggripina to sigh, as imagining her breach of Faith with An∣dolocia might have brought upon her that disgrace, then she desired him to keep it secret, and so gave him a 100 Crowns, upon which he went to the Apothecaries, and there, for fashions sake, bought se∣veral Drugs, with which he mixed some slices of the Aples, whose quality it was to take away Horns: which working with her, she soon perceived her Horns to diminish; at which she greatly rejoyced: but Andolocia was resolved not quite to rid her of them, till such time he found opportunity to recover his Hat and Purse. A while after he caused an Ape to be killed, and wrapped the skin about her Horns, which she patiently indured: then he gave her more of the Aple, which made them sink so far, that they were scarce a handfull long; so he ordered her to go to sleep again: when as he taking his opportunity, searched about to see if peradventure he could chance on the Hat or Purse, and had the good luck to find his Wishing Hat where it was carelesly layed under the bed, Aggrippina not in the least knowing the secret vertue that remained in it; at which good hap Andolocia greatly rejoyced, and took it as a happy Presage that he should recover his Purse likewise; for now, thought he, I will take another airy Voyage with her and the Purse, to see if he could be more circumspect then formerly. Whilst he was thus debating, he, unseen of the Princess, took up the Hat and put it under his
Coat, and thereupon began to relent of the intended Cruelty he de∣signed to use toward wher; which was, That when her Horns were almost gone, he would give her two Hornifying Apples that should make them rise again larger than ever, and then to depart from France, and from thence to send her a Letter, who he was, and upon what occasion her Horns were grown, and that unless she would come to him and bring the Purse, she should never be cured of the same; whilst thus he was considering, Aggrypina waked, and feel∣ing on her brows, found that her Horns were almost gone, at which she rejoyced exceedingly: and for Andolocia, desiring him to perfect his cure as soon as possible, but he told her it was not so easily done, for that the greatest part was yet remaining, which was the taking the root of the Horns out of the Skull; for which he must use many costly Drugs, rarely to be got, and then told her she should appear more beautifull and splendid, then ever: this made her rejoyce the more, and promised him any reward he would ask: for, said she, if this disgrace continue by me, I shall be ashamed ever to appear in publick. Well, said Andolocia, as for the taking them away, I do not in the least doubt, but the Drugs will cost a great deal of mony: no matter for that, spare for no mony, said Aggrypina, for whatever it cost, I care not: nay, but said Andolocia, I have not mony enough to pur∣chase the third part of them, of my own, therefore your highness must disburst 500 Crowns at least, for there must be many ingredients; as, Pearl, Corral, Rubies, Amber-Greece, Civit, Opopanax, Gal∣banum, Frankensence, Mirh, and other costly things; upon which Aggrypina not knowing whom she had to deal withal, putting on her Cloaths, went to a large Cabbinet, in which all her treasure lay, and after she had unlocked it, took out the so much desired Purfe, and fastened it to her Girdle as she was wont upon the like occasion; An∣dolocia well noteing, drew her towards the Window, and there set open the Casement, telling her that he was dim-sighted and could not well see his mony in a dark room: whereupon, as she began to tell out the mony he claped on his Hat, which till then he had held privately under his Coat, and clasping her fast, wished himself in a solitary Desart: the which he no sooner had done, but they were hoisted up the Ayr, and carried invisibly over many Citys and Towns till
repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of Aggrypina in bed with horns, Andolocia bowing before her; Aggrypina and Andolocia running together they came to a Desart in Scotland, where he set her down: and then, that she should be no longer ignorant by what means she had been thus conveyed away (for she thought certainly the Devil had carryed her) he pulled off his disguise, and told her plainly who he was, upon which she was not able to speak, for a good space. Now when she was carryed away, her Women were in great perplexity, some weep∣ing, and others tearing their hair, insomuch that their Lamentati∣ons being heard, the King and Queen supposed the Princess was Dead, for that they had notice she was sick some time before: where∣upon they came into her Lodgings, and demanded the cause of such extravagant sorrow; whereupon the Old Woman with much sob∣ing and sighing told them, that the fair Aggrypina was again car∣ried away, as before: by one that pretended himself a Physitian, and undertook to cure her of certain Horns, which by a strange accident grew monstrously out of her Head: at this, they were both grieved, but comforted themselves in hopes she would return as she had done before: but when several days were over, and she came not, they be∣gan to despair of her recovery. Then said the King, I wish I had never perswaded her to bereave Andolocia of his inchanted Purse: for had he kept that still, we had had our Daughter: for past doubt, he is a Negromancer himself, or deals with such as are, and by that means has these two times con∣veyed her away: and I am verily perswaded, that the Merchant and
the Physitian were no other than Andolocia under disguise; but I well trust, that he is of so courteous a temper, that he will do our Daughter no harm: but when he hath obliged her to return him his Purse, he will send her home again: for it is certain, that Purse can∣not be quietly enjoyed by any but the true owner, which is Andolo∣cia; therefore were my Aggrypina here, I did not care she should any more be troubled with it; but if I might get it, I would send it to Andolocia, and excuse her taking it from him. After this, the Queen urged him to send forth messengers, not only into all parts of his own Dominions, but likewise into Forreign parts, which he commanded to be speedily done, and so departed sorrowfully to his Chamber: where I must leave him, and return into Scotland, to Andolocia and Aggrypina. When Aggrypina was come to her self, and able to speak, she fell upon her knees, and besought Andolocia to have mercy upon her: for that she confessed she had greatly injured him, for which she was heartily sorry: and it was true, it lay in his power to revenge it, but that such a revenge would stain his Glorious Deed in Arms, if once it came to light, as it was most likely it would; for, said she, Murther is not rarely concealed long, the guilty conscience of the Murtherer being often constrained to discover it; but this did not abate Andolocia's anger, who fiercely replyed, well may you blush with shame and confusion of face, since you have so treacherously dealt with one, who loved you beyond all earthly things; discovering to you that secret, which all the Racks and Tortures upon Earth, could never have obliged him to have done: tremble therefore at your guilt, for see revenge is written in my brow, and upon that, he layed his hand upon his Sword; which Aggrypina perceiving, that no other, but that he intended to dispatch her, and therefore through fear and grief, she fell into a swound, which moved Andolocia to pitty; so that he gently raised her from the ground, and she recovering, began to beg him to pitty her, pitty you! said Andolocia, what pitty can there remain in my brest for such an one who so treacherously and un∣gratefully rewarded me for all the hazards that I underwent for your sake? and know you shall ware the infamy on your front, as an e∣verlasting Memento of your Infidelity. Then said Aggrypina,
I desire you to place me in some Nunnery, thereby to keep me from the sight of People, to which Andolocia consented. CHAP. XXXVIII. How Andolocia put Aggrypina in a Nunnery, and departed with his Hat and Purse to Famogosta. ANdolocia having found a Nunnery, knocked at the Door, and desired to speak with the Matron, who after some time, came and demadded his business? who told her, that he would gladly speak with her in private, whereupon she took him by the hand, and led him into the Lodg; where he told her, that a strange accident had hap∣pened to a Lady of great birth and beauty, which was, that she had two Horns growing out of her head, upon that the Matron wonder∣ed, and was greatly desirous to see her: whereupon he went and fetch∣ed: Aggrypina (who waited for his return, not far thence:) when he brought her: the Abbess wondered yet more, but did not seem to take any notice of the Horns, for fear of displeasing Aggrypina, but went to her and imbraced her, biding her heartily welcome: per∣ceiving her partly demean, and that she had been exceedingly well bred: then did they demand of Andolocia 200 Crowns, which she said was the Custom of the House, when any Young Lady first en∣tered, and that afterwards they had servants assigned to attend them after the best manner: upon this Andolocia took out his Purse, and gave her 300 Crowns, saying, there is one hundred more than you asked; therefore let the Lady be carefully looked to, which the Ma∣tron promised. CHAP. XXXIX. How Andolocia returned to his Brother Ampedo, with the Hat and Purse: and how at the request of the King of Cy∣prus, he freed Aggrypina out of the Nunnery, and took a∣way her Horns. ANdolocia being rid of Aggrypina, departed joyfully with his Purse and Hat, and being out of sight, he wished himself in Flanders, whether he was conveyed in a trice; and there for some time solacing himself in pleasure, he fell in love with an Earl's daugh∣ter, to whom he imparted the secret of his Hat, which she privily in∣tended to steal from him by night: but he having notice of it from
one of her Virgins; to whom she had revealed it by reason of his often repeated liberalities towards her, he took the opportunity to prevent her by wishing himself in Cyprus, which he instantly accom∣plished; where he no sooner arrived, but he hired him servants, and bought both himself and them Horses, and then in a most splendid manner rode to Famogosta; the which when he approached, his Brother Ampedo espying him from the Batalments of his Palace, he did not a little rejoyce; and withal, called to his servants to make ready his Horses, and so rode out to meet him; when they came near each other, both of them alighted and embraced each other, neither, for a while, being able to speak, for joy: after which, Ampedo asked Andolocia how he had sped, who with a chearful countenance replyed, that he had recovered his Purse again, which did not a little rejoyce Ampedo. After much discourse relating to their Travels, they came to the Pallace, where Ampedo ordered a sumptuous Feast to be prepared, to welcome his Brother, to which they invited several of their friends, to rejoyce with them, and continued in great merriment for two days; at the end of which, Andolocia offered his Brother the Purse, but he refused it, saying, he had enough, and that it caused great perplexity to such as kept it; and therefore he willed Andolocia still to detain it, which did not at all displease him; for although he offered it his Brother, yet he was in hopes that he would not accept of it. When he had Revelled in the Pallace for a while, he took leave of his Brother, and went to the King's Court, where he no sooner arrived, but the King had notice thereof, and sent one of his Chamberlains to bring him to his Presence; where, when he was come, he made a low obeysance, after which the King wel∣comed him, and asked him of his Travels, of which he gave a large account, relating to the customs and fashions of the Countries through which he had passed: Then the King demanded of him, whether he had been in the English Court; to which he replyed, he had: And have you, said the King, seen the Princess Agrypina? I have, said Andolocia: But do you know whether she be found or not, since the news I received that she was carryed away by Ne∣gromancy? for I have a great mind to lay down the ponderous
waight of Government, if I could match my Son to that Princess: Truly, said Andolocia, I must confess I know where she is, and if your Majesty will send an Ambassage with the Prince's Picture, I will so order it, that she shall be at her fathers Court before the Am∣bassador arrives. At this the King greatly rejoyced, and highly honoured Andolocia, promising all things should be done according to his directions, and desired him to make good his word without delay; upon which he took his leave of the King; and after having departed a mile from the Pallace, he put on his Wishing-Hat, and was immediately conveyed to the Nunnery, where knocking at the Gate, desired to speak with the Matron, who no sooner came to him, but he shewed her that he was desirous to speak with Aggripi∣na; whereupon she caused her to be called, knowing him to be the person who had brought her thither: When Aggrypina, came, she could not refrain from weeping; whereupon he taking her by the hand, led her into a private Chamber, and told her, that he had been ranging the world about, to find fit Medicines to cure her of her Horns; and demanded of her, that if she were cured, whither she would wish her self to be? Why, said she, with my Father, to en∣joy my former Freedom in his Pallace: Then, said he, be it accor∣ding to thy wish; and thereupon he gave her two Apples, which he had reserved, the which she had no sooner eaten, but she shed her Horns; then he called the Matron, and told her, that Aggrypina was a King's Daughter, and that e're long she should be Marryed to a beautiful young Prince, and that, he having cured her of her Horns, did now intend to take her with him. The Abbess or Ma∣tron perceiving the wonderful change, greatly rejoyced, and praised God that he had wrought such a miraculous alteration: Then An∣dolocia giving the Matron 200 Crowns more, and to Aggrypi∣na's waiting Maid, a hundred, he departed with Aggrypina; and when he was come into a Forrest, he put on his Wishing-Hat, and taking her in his arms, wished himself in London, where he imme∣diately arrived; and there setting down the Princess Aggrypina, without any word speaking, wished himself as Famagosta, and was there in a trice: Now Aggrypina perceiving that she was at Lon∣don, enquired the way to her Father Pallace, where she soon arri∣ved, by the directions of the Citizens.
CHAP. XL. How Aggrypina came again to the King and Queen; and how an Ambassador came from Cyprus to demand her in Marriage; together with her Marriage to the King of Cyprus. AGgrypina no sooner arrived at the Pallace, but she was met by some of the Ladies that had formerly waited upon her, who could not speak to her for joy, but immediately run to the King and Queen to inform them what they had seen; upon which the King ordered a hundred pieces of gold, to be given to the first bringer of the news, and immediately went to meet Aggrypina, greatly rejoycing that he had recovered her; upon which occasion, he proclaimed a great Feast throughout all his dominions, which was kept with great rejoycing; in the mid'st of which, an Ambassador came from Cyprus, of which the King having notice, caused him to be nobly entertained, and the next day he was introduced to his Audience, he being attended by many Nobles of Cyprus. When he came into the King's presence, he declared his Ambas∣sy, and delived his Masters Letters; shewing likewise, the young Princ's Picture, which greatly pleased the King and Queen; then was the Picture ordered to be carryed to Aggrypina; as likewise the Relation of what had passed; the which, when she beheld, she at first, with feigned Modesty, disapproved of; but casting to mind what Andolocia had said, she consented; then were the King's Ships made ready, and a great number of Noble Ladies appointed to carry her over; when taking leave of the King and Queen, she departed, though not without some tears on either side; for that ha∣ving a prosperous Gale, within two months they Landed in that Island; whereof notice being had, the King, his Queen, and all the Nobles of that Kingdom, came to welcome her on shore, with all manner of Musick, and what ever could he invented, to entertain one of such Noble Birth; all the people rejoycing that they had so fair
a Princess to be hereafter their Queen; then did  conduct her to the City of Medusa, where the King's Pallace was; against whose coming, a stately Banquet was prepared; and the more to de∣light repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of a feast and hunting the company, a Conjuror caused a Tree to grown on the Table, and a Hunting to pass along, for their Diverisement. Likewise, Andolocia attended, but would by no means take any notice of Aggrypina, for so it was secretly agreed between them; but he spent so Royally, that all the Nobility envyed him, by reason he ecclipsed their Honours, in doing so far beyond their Abilities, by giving the Prince and Princess a Present of Iewels worth a hundred Crowns; as likewise sending in such store of choice Vsands and Wine, that the King greatly maruelled. CHAP. XLI. How at the Sports and Pastimes ordained to grace the Wedding, Andolocia won the praise; which caused some of the Nobility greatly to envy him. DVring the Feast the K. ordained several Sports, as  T∣nantenes, and fighting at Borets; wherein Andolocia
prevailed, th won the praise of all Ladies and Gentlewomen, and was by the Princess Aggrypina often Crowned with Gar∣lands; which raised the envy of many of the great ones against him, insomuch that two Earls, viz. the Earl of Limose and Armandalia, secretly conspired his death, because he had obtained the Wreath se∣veral times, by putting them to the foile; so that they resolved to y wait for him in a Wood, through which he was to pass; for at tht time he had not brought with him the Wishing-Hat, and resolvd to kill all his Men, and by putting him upon the Rack, oblige him to confess from whence he had such store of Treasure: Whereupon the day before the Feast ended, they took their leave of the King, as if they intended to go a Hunting; and having got about 200 armd men, they placed themselves behind certain Trees in the Wood, near to the way he was to pass, and furiously setting upon him at una∣wares, they killed all his Men, which were 6 in umber, and took him Prisoner, though not without loss on their side, for Andolocia draw∣ing his Sword, so laid about him, that he killed ten of their , and wounded the Earl of Limose. CHAP. XLII. How Andolocia was Imprisoned and Racked, and how Ampedo burned his Wishing-Hat, as imagining his Brother slain. WHen the Earls had taken Andolocia Prisoner, they carryed him to a Castle of theirs not far from thence, where they put him into a dark Prison, and rode again to Court, carrying with them 4 fat Bucks, which they pretended to have taken by hunting. Soon after their arrival, news was brought of the death of Andolocia's men, and how that he was thought to be taken Prisoner, by reason his body was not found amongst them, upon which, the King was exceed∣ing angry; and immediately sent out Messengers into all parts of the Kingdom; to hear of him: As likewise Ampedo offered a 1000 Duckets to any that could discover where he was; but when no ty∣dings could he had where he was, he supposed him dead, or in some dis∣mal
prison; for the sake of his Purse; and thereupon left he should come to some ill end, by reason of his Hat, he cast it into the fire, and there let it consume to ashes, and for grief, within a short time after dyed. Now when the Earls had been at Court some time, the Earl of Limose went to see what was become of Andolocia, and at his arri∣val, found him in the prison where he left him, and there began to exa∣mine him where he had so much money to spend at the rate he did? he told him, that if he would let him go to the Pallace at Famagosta, he would show him by what means he obtained his Riches; but he would not consent to it, but caused him grievously to be Racked; in∣somuch that he was obliged to discover the secrets of his Purse, and he delivered it to the Earl in hopes, by that means, to be set free; but he having proved it, left him in Prison, and rode to his Companion, and shewed him all that had happenned; whereupon they, after some contest agreed to keep it monthly by turns; then the Earl of Ar∣mandolia said, I hear that Andolocia is a Negromancer, and can flie in the ayr: therefore we cannot be safe till he is dispatched out of the way, to which they both agreed, and the Earl of Armandolia rode to the prison, and offered the Keeper 200 Crowns to strangle Andolocia, but he refused it, saying, he was a just and honest man: whereupon the Earl went in himself, and after having asked whe∣her he had any more Purses of the same sort, and he affirming he had none, the Earl with his Girdle, strangled him, as he sat fast in a large pair of Stocks, and so returned to the Earl of Limose, to ac∣quaint him with what he had done.

How the Murder of Andolocia was discovered by the two Earls falling out about the Purse, and how they were put to death for the same. ANdolocia and Ampedo being dead, the Purse lost all its vertue, and would yield no more Money than any common Purse; so that it falling to the Earl of Armandalia's turn, he taxed the Earl of Limose as a Cheat, saying, he had changed it; so that there happened a dispute between them; whereupon they drew their Swords and wounded each other; when as the people coming in to part them, the Earl of Limose said; Ah Villain! then wouldest have Murthered me as thou didst Andolocia for his Purse; which words being told to the King, he suspected them to be the Murther∣ers: Whereupon he commanded they should be Apprehended and Racked; during which, they freely confessed all that had passed, and were Condemned to be broken upon the Wheel, their Chattels and Goods to be spotted, and so many as were consenting or privy to the Murther, to be Hanged; which Sentance was accordingly put in Execution: After which, by reason Andolocia and Ampedo had left none to possess their Pallace at Famagosta, the King took possessi∣on thereof, and found in it infinite Wealth, placing the Prince and Princess therein, who lived there in great Splendor, till the King's Death, and then took upon them the Rule of the whole Kingdom. FINIS.
