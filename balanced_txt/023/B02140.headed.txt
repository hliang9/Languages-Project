The Chearful Husband: Or. The Despairng Wife. In a Dialogue between a loving Couple, about the Cares and Crosses of these troublesome Times. To the Tune of, The Jealous Lover. Woman. SWeet kind and loving Husband dear, We shall be ruin'd now, I fear; Such Times before, I never knew Since I was born, what shall we do? Our Charge is great and Profit small, And Charity grows cold withal; This fills my Heart with grief and care, I nothing see but sad despair, Man. Chear up, my kind and loving Wife, The joy and comfort of my Life, And do not in the least complain, I hope to see good Times again. Let us the while with patience wait, Submitting to the hand of Fate, Which will in time our Joys restore; Then what can we desire more? Woman. Dear Love, I know you hope to see Once more the Land's prosperity, That Fortune will upon us smile, But pray how shall we live the while? Our Family is something large, Six Child ren is no little charge, For to be fed and cloath'd also, Whether we have imploy or no▪ Man. My Children they are Blessing's Love, Sent from a gracious God above; Then do not murmur in the least, Content is a continual Feast. God's Providence does comfort yield, He cloaths the Lillies of the Field, And feeds the Ravens of the Air, Then why should'stthou and I despair? Woman. But, Husband, Husband, she reply'd, When I was made your lawful Bride, I brought two hundred Pounds in Gold, As good as ever Merchant told: Yet, since the Times have been so bad, Through many Losses we have had, It's wasted, therefore I complain, I ne'er shall see so much again. Man. Perhaps you mayn't, yet ne'er the less, If God does but our Labours bless, We may be furnish'd with content, Then do not in the least lament. Love, let not Losses make thee sad; When Job was stripp'd of all he had, His Sorrows he with patience bore, And grew far richer than before. He in his Sorrows thus did say, God gives and likewise takes away, And blessed be his holy Name, From whom his greatest Comforts came▪ Then let us learn of him, my Dear, To bear with Faith and Patience here, The Sorrows which we undergo, For God is merciful I know. Then dry thine Eyes and do not weep, For, while I live, I hope to keep, With Pains and Care, my Family, Our eldest Son shall work with me. Woman. Well, loving Husband, since I find, That thou art so exeding kind, God's Providence I'll not distrust, For he is merciful and just. Henceforward, with a chearful heart, With thee I'll strive to bear a part; Thy chearful Words, like Cordials fin Has cur'd this drooping Soul of mine. Licensed according to Order.
