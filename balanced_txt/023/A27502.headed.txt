Of GOD. ALbeit Davids Psal 53. 1. Foole hath said in his heart that there was no God: and the Psal. 10. 4. Atheist lives in life and conversa∣tion as if there were no God. And although the proud man Exod. 5. 3. with Pharaoh questioneth who is the Lord? making ho∣nour his Idoll, Eph 5. 5. the Covetous man his gold, Phil. 3. 19. the Volup∣tuous man his Belly their gods, and the Heathen wor∣ship Gal▪ 4. 8. 2 King. 21. 13. Eze. 8. 16. Zeph. 1. 5. the Sunne, th Moone and such like in steed of God: And notwithstanding re be some wicked persons, that thinke there are no Diels, becaus they never saw any of them, so others, that there is no God, because they cannot see him: Yet let all such Fooles, Atheists, Proud ones, Covetous and Voluptuous men, Heathens and wicked persons know, that they Math. 22. 29. Exod. 3. 20. erre and are deceived not knowing the Scriptures. No man can see God and live: Io. 1. 18. No man indeed hath eene God at any time with the bodily eye, (and yet there is a God) who as he will be Iob 4. 24. worshipped with the worship of the spirit spiritually, so will he be seene with the eyes of the spirit inwardly. Thou hast a Soule Gen 1. 1. and yet thou seest it not, there is a winde, and yet thou perceivest it not. So there is a God though thou see him not The which to averre (contrary to the Fools sayin, Atheists living, Proud mans questioning, Covetous and Voluptuous mans making, Heathens▪ Worshipping, and wicked persons thinking) there are sixe things that doe manifestly and apparently prove that there is an Everlasting and Incomprehensible One, o wit, Elohim, E, Ejeth, Shaddai, Psal 83 18 & 86. 0. Deu 4. 3. Chp 6 4. 1 Cor. 8 6▪ Iab, Iehoah, God Psa. 68 4. alone in Prsons three, but in Essence only one, 1 Io. 5 7. 1. Gods Psa. 1. 1. Rom. 1. 20. workes of Creation, Which is a long volume, and especially above all the rest, the soule of man breathed by God in him. 2. The Word of the Lord, The holy Bible, being a briefe Compendium, wherein thou myest reade of Gods nature and being. 3. The Incarnation of the Sonne of God, An ingraven Table, in which thou shlt see Heb. . 16. God himselfe ma∣nifested in the flesh of man. 4. The Consent of all Nations who worship any God rather then no God. 5. The Terrours of Conscience, Which maketh the most xod▪ 8. 19. Rom 2 15. Dan 4. 4. Dan. 5. 6. ungodly miscreants, will they, nill they▪ to acknowledge him, and to • tremble at his judgements sent upon them. 6. His Power in susteyning, Prov. 16. 33. his Providence in mainteyning, his Love n correcting, his Bounty in promising, his Faithfulnesse in performing, his Gra in giving, and his Mercy in taking away, maketh the faithfull to confesse him, and in all his proceedings to justifie his Wisedome. Now albeit no Creature can define what God is, (because he is incomprehensible, Psa 115 3. 1 Tim. 6. 16. dwelling in the Heavens that none can attaine unto) yet it hath pleased himselfe n his word revealed unto us, to reveale himselfe so farre, as our weake capacitie cn con∣ceive him, and that by giving himselfe many Names, Titles and Attributes, to shew what a one he is, who being a most simple 1 Cor. 8. Essence void of all composition, not subject to any accident, or qualitie, useth in the Scriptures to entitle himselfe by many qualities, the which we must so understand, that whatsoever he is, whether Good, Wise, Power∣full,
&c. He is the same by Essence not by qualitie. Therefore describing himselfe to Moses what a God he is, He first calleth himselfe xod 6. 3. Iehovah, noting thereby his simple Essence, after saith he is xod. 34. 6. Strong, Mercifull, &c. Teaching thereby that he is such a God, not by reason of any qualitie, but by Essence. Attributes given unto God are of two sorte Nominall, or Reall. Nominall Attributes are of 3. Sortes. Signifying 1. Gods Essence, such is the Name Iehovah.Exod▪ 6. 3. 2. The Persons in the Essence, such is the Name Elohim.Gen. 1. . 3. Gods essentiall workes, such is the Name Omnipotent.Apoc. 19. 6. Reall Attributes are of two sortes, Absolute, or Relative. Absolute, Are they only that are proper unto God, shewing his Divine essence, such is, Deut 3. 27. Eternitie, Immensitie, &c. Relative, Are such as may (though not in that sort as they are in God, yet in part, and by comparison) be given to the Creatures, as Wisdome, Iustice, &c. In part, Because these are Essntiall to God, and accidentll to man, infinite in God, and finite n man. By Com∣parison, Because we are made Collos. 3. 10. like unto him in righteousnesse and holynesse, and so shall be with him in the Heavens. Now for the better understanding of the Names, Titles and Attributs, given by God to himselfe, as also by man uto him; these things are to be observed following, God is called Exod 6. 3. Isa. 2. 8. Psal. 83▪ 18. Iehovah, A name given by himselfe, thereby to poynt at and to shadow out unto us his Essence: for that no man can comprehend the same, being incompre∣hensible. Gen. 1. 1. Elohim, Mal. 1. 6. Father, Luk▪ 1. 35. Sonne, Act 2. 4. Holy Ghost, To shew unto us thereby, the distinction that is to be made of the Persons in Trinitie. Immortall, Col. 1. 15. Invisible, and Iam. 1. 17. Immutable, And they are negative names, that by them we may know what he is not. Nehem. 9. 17. Mercifull, Deut. 32. 4. Just, and Gen 49 24. Powerfull, And they are names appointed, to signifie unto us his Essen∣tiall properties. Isa. 40. 28. Creatour, Isa 6. 5. A King, and a Psal. 2 1. Shepheard. To shew unto us, that relation that it hath pleased him to have to his Creatures. Psal. 27. 1. Light, Deut. 30. 20. Life, and 1 Chro. 6. 5. Salvation, And they are names affirmed of him in the Abstract, to note his most simple Essence, and so Christ is called, 1 Cor. 1 30. Wisedome, Righ∣teousnesse, &c. Iosh. 3. 10. Living, Ier. 4. 8. Saviour, Deut. 32. 4. Just, Rom. . 24. Justifying, And they are names affirmed of him in the Concrete, that by them we might know that hee hath of himselfe a true substance. 2 Sam. 22. . A Tower, Psal▪ 115 11. A Shield, and Deut 4 Consuming fire, And they are Attributes given unto him figuratively and by a similitude. And so he is called. A Buckler. That he is our defence in all dangers.Psal 8. 2. Psal. 18 2. Psal. 90. 1. & 71.  & 18. 2. The Horne of Salvation. That he doth defend us as the hornes of the Beastes do desend them¦selves withall.

TH HOLY GHOST s the Instructor which teacheth us, the Spirit of life which quickneth us, the Water wh reneweth us, the Fire which inflames us, the Comfortor which helpes us, the Advocate which speakes for us, and the everla∣sting Fountaine and Spirit of Truth, fro whom all Rom. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 3. 16. Truth and Celestiall Riches doe flow unto us: And is called by the Name of Spirit, Ioh. 15. 26. proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, to shew the Essence and Nature that he is of: For as the spirit of Man must needes be truly of Mans nure; and is the most formall and Essentiall part of Man: So and much more it must b thought of the Spirit of God, upon whom no Composition falleh And his i Effect is the Apostles Argument, 1 Cor. 2. 11.

Grieve not then the holy Spirit, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of Redemption.Ephes 4. 30. Reade Gal. 5. 6. Attributes of the Trinity, with a description of the Unity. THe Names and Titles that are common to the whole Trinity, are of foure sortes or orders. 1. Some signifie their Essence, as Iehovah. 2. Others their Persons in generall, as Elohim. 3. Divers their Essentiall properties, as Almighty. 4. Many are in generall affirmed of each Person, as they have relation to Creatures, and such is the Name, Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier, &c. Albeit the word Creator is given to the Father, Redeemer to the Sonne, and Sancti∣fierNote to the Holy Ghost, yet in truth they are common to all the three Persons in one Essence. Now a Person is a distinct subsisting of the whole God-head, and an individull un∣derstanding,Iohn 1. 1. Chap. 5. 31. Cha. 14. 5, 16. Col. 2. 9. and incommunicable Subsistence, living of it selfe, and o susteyned by another: So that the three Persons in the Trinity, are not three severall Substances, but three distinct Subsistences, or three diverse manner of being of one and the same Sub∣stance and divine Essence. The Divine Essence is one and the selfe same thing truly subsisting in the Three per∣sons: Now the Essence doth not beget an Essence, but the Person of the Father be∣gettethPsal. 2. 7. Hb. 1. 5. Iohn. 5. 26. the Person of the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne by an eternall and incomprehensible Spiration. And thus the Three per∣sons make all one Divine Essence, and one God, being in Nature Cossentiell, in Dignitie Coequall, in time Coeternall, in measure unmeasurable, in Majesty in∣scrutable, in Nature incomprehensible, in Power irresistible, in Will unchangeable,
in place not Circumscript, in Tim indefinite, in love immutable, in favour unspea∣keble, and in Promise inviolable, Good without qualitie, Great without quantitie,August. Medic. cap. 2. Creatour without want, in Act without Motion, every where present without sight: The First and the last without time, making all things Mutable, without any passive Mutability in himselfe. In this Mistery of the Trinity, how in that most simple and single Essence of God, there be certaine Substances of God or Persons truly subsisting, Three in one, and One in three, differing but not divided, severall but not sunded, many and yet the same; All one for their Nature, all distinct for their Persons, is a Secret o all Secrets, passing all reach and understanding of Man, rather reverently to be adored then too curiously to be searched into, for that Secret things belong un∣to the Lord, and things revealed unto us. Saint Augustine walking by the Sea side,Deut. 29. 29. meditating of the Trinitie, looking aside, saw a Childe powring the waters of the Sea into a shll, having a hole in the middest thereof, demanded of the Child what he was doing, I am putting (quoth he) all the Sea into this shell, the Father said, thou playest the Child, Can a Shell comprehend thinkest thou all this Sea? And so said the Child good Sir doe you, who would by Reason comprehend the Trinitie. The Child vanished, the Father was instructed, and he saw in the end that it was an Angell. Thus Augustine with all his deepe Divinty, was not able to die into this Mystery, much lesse can wee. Simonides being demanded concerning the Essence of God, answered, that the more he thought of the sme, the lesse he knew. To search then too farre is curiosity, toProv. 15 27. beleeve the word it is security, climbe not too high then for falling, dive ot deepe for drowning; and soare not too high for dazeling: Labour to know so much as s revealed in the Scriptures, which we are to search for all points, much more for this. A remarkeable Note. THe Name (GOD) is written with foure Letters in all Languages, in which we are to observe, that the word GOD, comming from the German is written with a double D. (to wit) GODD.

All Gods Attributes may be reduced to these 3. Heads Power Mercy Justice The use of all which is two fold. 1. First by knowing of them we know what a God our God is, and by them discerne betwixt the rue Iehovah and false gods. 2. We learne both what we have received already from God, and what we may looke for hereafter to receive from him. The Lord is called Omnipotent To shew his Power: which is both profitable and necessary for us to know both in prosperity and adversity: in Prosperity toExod 6. 3. keepe us from abusing his blessings, seeing he is of power to de∣prive us: in Adversitie to keepe us from despaire, because he is able to helpe us.

Father, Let us then behave our selves as children towards him, not sell ourPsal. 103. 13. inheritance▪ let us love hi house, desire his presence, bewaile his ab∣sence, love his children  bretheren, hate his enemies, seeke to honour him, and be sorry f he be dishonored. 2 Let us imitate a good Sonne (who as a learned Divine observeth) is desrous to know the Nature of his father, that so he may the better resemble his Father. Hee will know His Pedigree, From whence he is descended. Hee will know His Dignitie, How he is reputed. Hee will know His Estate, At what he is valued. Hee will know His Nature, How he is affected. Hee will know His Love, How himselfe is favoured. Hee desires to looke into His Will what he will leave him. Hee desires to looke into His pleasure what he will have done by him. Hee desires to looke into His purpose what he will doe with him. And If hee see him Ale Hee will Depend upon him. If hee see him In Authoritie Hee will Beare himselfe upon him. If hee see him Gratious Hee will Be thankfull unto him. If hee see him Angry Hee will Seeke to please him. If hee see him Righteous Hee will Feare to offend him. If hee see him Mercifull Hee will Pray for pardon to him. If hee see him Powerfull▪ Hee will Hope for protection from him. The like may be said of the Knowledge of God, seeing he is able to doe all things for us, and is the only true God, and in Compassion a Father, willing to doe for us, let us mbrace him and depend upon him: and in so doing we shall be thankfull in prosperity, patient in adversity, and joyfull in victory.

AS it maketh neither for the Ornament, nor the use of an House to have all vssels of one sort, as 2 Tim. 2. 20. all of gold, or all of silver, but rather of divers and of sundry matter. And as in a mans body the manifold members thereof, are of greater both use and dignitie, then i all were one member: So in the body of the Church, God would not have all elect, or all reprobate, but some Elect, some Reprobates, some good, others bad, because this would make most for Gods glory, as the other for the good of the whole body. Gods Decree is that by which God hath necessarily, and yet freely from Isa. 46 10. all Eter∣nitie determined all things. Howbeit the Decree of God is the first and principall cause of all things, yet it doth not take away freedome of will in Election, or the Nature and properie of Eph. 1. 12. Mat. 10. 29. Rom 9. 21. Isa 46. 10. second causes, but brings them into a certaine order (tht s) it directeth them to the determinate end, whereupon the effect of things are contingent and necessary, as the nature of the second cause is. Predestination is the Decree of God, in as much as it concernes Man, (being so cal∣led) by which God hath ordeyned all men to a certaine and everlasting estate (that is) some  Thes. 5 9. to salvation in his Sonne, others to Rom 9. 22. Condemnation, for his owne glory and their sinne. Election is a Decree in which God according to the good pleasure of his will hath certainely Eph. 1. 4, 5. chosen some men to life eternall in Christ, and that for the praise of the glory of his Grace. Reprobation is Gods Decree, in the which because it so pleased him, he hath Prov. 16. 4. 2 Cor. 13. 5. pur∣posed to refuse some men by means of Adams fall and their owne corruptions for the manifestation of his Justice. Hath God made man to condemne him?Ob. Nothing lesse: God is not the cause of condemnation, but man himselfe, accordingHose 13 9.An. to the Prophet Hosea saying: O Israel thy destruction is of thy selfe: God useth allIsa. 5. 4. Meaning his Vineyard. meanes to save soules according to Isaiah saying: What more could have beene done for it, then I have done? God Eze 18. 23. Isa. 50. 1. Cha. 59. 2. Psal. 104. 35. Ps. 51. 4. Ps. 62. 4. Prov. 29. 6. Psal. 59. 12. will no the death of a Sinner?Ob. God willeth not simply and absolutely the Death of a Sinner, as it is the destructionAn. of▪ his Creature, but as it is a meanes to declare his Justice, and to set forth his glory: Now these which are ordeyned to just Damnation, are likewise ordeyned to be left to themselves in this world, in 2 Thes. 2. 11▪ blindenesse of minde, and hardnesse of heart, so as they shall not, nor will repent of their sinnes; So that their sinnes shall be thereby the cause of their condemnation, and God not the Author of the same. Sinnes are not the
cause of rejection, yet they are the cause of Damnation, whereunto the Reprobate are ordeyned and destined. If God predestinate every man to his end, how then can it be said that Adam fellOb. into sinne, without Gods ordination and predestination, seeing he gave him occasion to sinne whilst he made a Law, which he knew he would not keepe: Created the Serpent and Divell, whom he knew would tempt Eve, gave him Eve to wife, that would entice him, as also permitted him to abuse his owne Free-will, that was gi∣ven him. In the state of Mans innocency in Paradise, Good and bad was propounded to mansAn. will, and his will stood inclinable to that which the minde (or sences) first assented unto (for the minde conceiveth before the will subscribes freely) and the minde (or sences) then were enabled to judge and determine rightly, so that there was in man, helpe unto good, not infirmitie unto evill: Adam therefore sinned freely, and un∣constrainedly. 1. In neglecting their Law and Calling. 2. In opening eare freely unto lewd counsell. 3. In eating the forbidden fruite. Now there were three things concurring to the fall of Adam. 1. Gods permitting. 2. Sathans tempting. 3. Mans yeelding. First, God permitting not by Iam. 1. 13. 1 Ioh. 2. 16. instilling into him any evill, or taking from him any ability unto good, but by suffering Sathan to tempt him. Secondly, By lea∣ving man to the liberty and mutability of his owne Will, not hindring his fall by sup∣ply of Grace, and by 2 Sam. 24. 1 1 Cho. 21. 1. Sathans tempting, who being himselfe fallen, envying Gods glory and mans happinesse, subtilly addressed himselfe into the Serpent. Thirdly, Mans yeelding, who being left to the mutability of their owne Will, Eccles. 7. 29. voluntarlyGen. 3. 1. enclined unto that evill whereunto they were tempted. Howbeit we deny not, but that the will of God is the first and true cause why Adam fell, as also why he hath chosen some, and hated others, (for if God would simply not have had him sinned, he had not sinned, for that nothing can be done against his Will and Counsell) But we deny that it therefore followeth, that God can be accused of sinne or of any injustice, because his Will is Just, and the rule of all Justice, so that none iniquity can be found in him. Besides which there are many more just Reasons of the Judgements of God, in God himselfe, although they be unknowne and unsearcheable unto us wret∣ches, that cannot of our selves neither see such Reasons, because we are blinded, nor know them by the Scriptures, because they are not revealed. Isa. 40. 28. There is no searching of Gods Wisdome, it cannot be comprehended: if the Creature could swallow up all the Reason of the Creator, God should be finite, and God no God. Iudg. 13. 18. An Angell bid Manoah not to enquire after his Name which was secret. Deut▪ 29. 29. Secret things belong unto God, revealed to man: Search not then for those things that are hidden, and Dive not too deepe for feare of Drowning. If God Decree every thing, why punisheth he any thing? Punishment commeth from God by the just desert of the ranchor Lam. 3. 39. of mans sinne, Rom. 11. 5. Election of Gods free grace. Rom 9 19. Who hath resisted the Will of God? Why is he angry? What art thou oh Man, which pleadest with God Iob 33. 13. who giveth not ac∣count of his matters, Darest thou to expostulate with God thy Authour? Isa. 45. 9. Woe be to him, that contendeth with his Maker: S. Augustine handling this matter saith, Oh thou man that lookest for an Answer from me, let us both heare him which saith, Rom. 9. 20. oh man who art thou which reasonest with God? Faithfull ignorance is better then rash knowledge: Seeke for merits, thou shalt find nothing but punishment: O Altitude, Peter deny∣eth, the Thiefe beleeveth O Altitude▪ askest thou the reason, I will admire, and be astonished at the Altitude, reason thou, I will marvell, dispute thou, I will beleeve: I see the Altitude, but I come not to the bottome; Paul rested because he found admiration: He calleth them Rom. 11 33. Gods inscru∣table Judgements, and commest thou to search them? He calleth them wayes investigable, and seekest thou to finde them? And in another place,Cui hac re∣sponsio non places & quae∣ra doctiores, sed caveat ne invenia praesumptuo∣res. speaking of the same matter (saith) if any man will binde us, and presseRom. 11. 33. us to search, and sound the profunditie, why one is perswaded, another is not, I have only two things to answer: Rom. 1. 33. Oh the depth of his Riches, &c. Cha. 9. 14. And is there iniquity with God? He that liketh not this Answer, let him seeke more learned Teachers, but let him looke that he finde not them that are more presumptuous. If I be predestinated to eternall life I shall be saved how wickedly soever I live, I will therefore live as I list? Men predestinated to the end, that is Glory and eternall life, are alsoa Ths. 2. 13. Rom. 8. 30.

We must Ioh. 7. 24. not judge according to the appearance, saith Christ, 1 Cor. 4. 5. judge nothing be∣fore the time, untill the Lord come, saith S. Paul. To conclude this Poynt. God from everlasting by his Decree appointed first to create all men, then to permit them to fall into sinne, and for sinne to be guilty of Death: And after by Christ to deliver some, but to leave others, and to punish them for their sinnes, and this appoyt∣ment is very redestination, Election and Reprobation.

GOds Providence is a most sure and powerfull action of God by which he hath rom all Eternity fore-seene and fore-ordeyned unto every thing both the end whereunto, and the meanes whereby they shall be brought to their ends: As also moderatth and governeth the whol World, and every thing both great and littl therein contayned. And although God take care for all things without any meanes, yet that all things are ordinrily governed indeed not by1 King. 19. 5. Dan. 3. God only, but by meanes thereunto ordayned by God himselfe, notwithstan∣ding that often times also Gen. 1. without, yea, and against meanes he effecteth the same. And althugh Gds Providence be immuable, yet that imposeth not simply a necessity unto things, but that every Secundary cause worketh accor∣ding to its owne Nature some necessarily, other some accidentally, and yet that this also dependeth on the Divine Providence, in respect whereof all things necessarily come to passe. Gods Providence hath two parts Knowledge, and Government. Gods Knowledge Is that whereby all things from the greatest to the least arePsal. 11 4. manifest before him at all times (so saith David.) Gods eyesPsal. 113 6. will consider, his eye-lidds will try the children of men: (And againe he saith) God bseth himselfe to behold the things thatActs. 15. 16. are in Heaven and Earth: From the beginning of the World he knowth all his works.

Spoken against by the mightie Ones? So was David by Princes.Psal. 119. 23. Meanes and Second Causes used. ORdinary Meanes are to be used of every man in his Calling carefully, and when they beat hand we must not look for any help without them: though the Lord be able to doe what he will without Meanes. Ioab when the Ara∣mites2 Sam. 10. 12. came against him, heartened his Souldiers, though they were but few, bid∣ding them to be strong and valiant for their people, and for the Cities of their God, and then let the Lord doe (saith he) what is good in his eyes. And our Saviour Christ avoucheth that to be flat tempting of God, for him to leape downe from the Pinacle of the Temple to the ground, when as there was an ordinary way at hand to descend by Staires. Lst therefore we to our de∣struction contemne the use of Second Causes which are ordained for our good, God hath himselfe first used them in the worlds government, when as hee might as easily doe it by himselfe alone, as with Second Causes: I will, saith the Lord, heare the Heavens, and they shall heare the Earth, and the Earth shall heare the Corne, the Wine, and the Oyle, and they shall heare Iezreel: So for the converting of David, the Lord used the Prophet Nathan: And to deliver Peter out of Prison he sent an Angel: and to convert the Eunuch he sent Philip unto him: And thus the Lord doth, that he may honour his Creatures as Fellow-workers with him: And to that purpose he hath ordained meat and ap∣parell, to cover the body and to maintaine life: Phisitians and Physicke to re∣cover health: honest exercises and sleep to conserve health: Princes and Magi∣strates to conserve publike Peace: Msters of Families for domesticall governe∣ment. Preaching and reading the Word, receiving the Sacraments, workes of Charitie, Prayers, Discipline, &c. for exercising of Faith. These and such like Meanes and Second Causes then are not to be contemned, or neglected, as though God would governe the world, or save us by himselfe without them: for so to doe, were nothing else but to tempt God, and to hinder, as much as in us lieth, the execution of his Providence, which is forbidden by the Lord, saying, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, which they doe, who neglecting the Meanes or∣dained by God, expect Miracles from Heaven. If Gods Providence be immutable, what need Second Causes, &c? He that shall be amended, shall so be without correction or admonition. The Answer is, that those things are separated which are to be joyned toge∣ther. God in his eternall Counsell had ordained to make Davids will good of evill: and to incline the same from sinne to repentance; had ordained also Meanes, by which his will should be changed, namely Nathan. Used Meanes to Adam and Eve Cover their nakednesse by sewing together of fig-leaves, and theGen. 3. Lord by making them coverings of beasts skins.

And to preserve his Father and Mother from Saul's wrath, being againstChap. 22. them kindled, he placed them with the King of Moab, andChap. 23. to deliver himselfe from evill that might befall him by King Achish, knowing who he was, he feigned himselfe to be madChap. 21. before him: and going against the Philistines slew all of them, that not any of them might carry tydings thereof to the King, being supposed to have gone out against the Israe∣lites by him: And to overcome the Philistines he turned behinde them over against the Mulberry-trees, as the Lord2 Sam. 5. had commanded him: And to confound Abithophel he used Hushai's counsell.Chap. 17.

Q Esther Preserve the Jewes from Hamans plot intended against them,Esther 1. and that by inviting the King to a banquet, and by praying.Chap. 5. Chap. 6.

Ioseph Bring his brethren to remembrance that they had done him wrong, and that by reprehending and imprisoning them,Gen. 44. their Conscience thereby accusing them: And to be freedChap. 45. out of prison intreated Pharaoh's Butler to remember him:Chap. 40.

Of Prayer. PRayer is the Messenger of the faithfull Soul, being the Request of an hum∣ble and sanctified heart, together with thanksgiving offered up by the spirit of Prayer, as a speciall service unto God, in the Name of Jesus Christ, in the behalfe of our selves and others, with assurance to be heard, in what we pray for according to the will of God revealed in his Word, the Spirit making request for1 Tim. 4. 8. us with groanes in the heart unspeakeable, the Lord accepting the inward mour∣ning and desire of the heart for a Cry, as we see in Moses, who prayed to God inExod. 14. 15. Psal. 119 15. Lam. 2.  Syr. 21. . & 35. 16. Ecclu. . 7. Exod. 32. 10. Ir. 7. 16. Chap. 1. 14. the behalfe of the Israelites, the Lord answering him, saying, Why cryest thou unto me? when s Moses indeed cryed not in voyce, but in the earnest affection of his heart: And is of such force, as that it goeth through the clouds, and cea∣seth not untill it come unto the Lord, and will not depart, untill the most High have respect thereunto; yea, it doth as it were binde the Lord, and hinder him from executing judgements, overcomming him that overcommeth all things: as we see by the Lods owne words unto Moses▪ saying, Suffer me▪ that my wrath may waxe hot against them: (to wit) the Israelits, and to consume them, and I will ake of thee a mightie people. And again, by the Angels words unto Lot, saying, Haste thee, get thee hence: for we can do nothing till thou be gone, the Lord beingGen. 19. 5. then about to destroy Sodome. And is truly, Consolatio flntium, Cura dolentium, & Sanitas aegroorum: A Comfort for them that mourne: the Joy of the sor∣rowfull: and Health for those that are sick; being the chiefest remedie for every kinde of M, and the only Odours that were offered upon the golden Altar before the Throne spoken of in the Revelation.Revel. 3. 8. Prayers are of two sorts: Mentall: Prayers are of two sorts: and Prayers are of two sorts: Vocall. Mentall, consisting in the Heart without voyce, such was Moses.Exod. 14. 15. Vocall, conceived in the Heart, & pronounced with the tongue, such was Christs.Heb. 5. 7. In Prayer these three things are to be seriously meditated upon:Eccles. 5. 1. Gods Majestie, from whence ariseth Humilitie in spirit, Gods Promises, from whence ariseth Confidence to be heard, Our own vilenesse, from whence ariseth Fervencie of Affection. In Prayer also these Properties are to be observed: Thy Prayer must be secret without ostentation, and zealous without doubting. Thy Prayer must be briefe without much babling, and constant without intermission. By Prayer Abraham Obtained favour in the sight of God for Ishmael his sonne▪Gen. 17. Chap. 18. Chap. 20. Chap. 14. Had saved Sodome, had there been found therein ten just men: Was heard for Abimelehs wife, and others being barren, so that they bare again; and had a childe by Sarah, when she was past childe-bearing.

At his raising of Lazarus from death, and for all them that should live in him by faith: for Peter that his faith might not faile him: and that his Fa∣ther would glorifie him with all that beleeved in him. for his enemies that crucified him: and now in Heaven for those that belong to him: willing his Apostles to pray for them that hurt them: And all in secret shutting their doores to pray unto him, as he taught them. In the Lords Prayer, whether we regard the Brevitie, Perfection, Autho∣ritie, Method, Efficacie, or Necssitie of it; it is to be beleeved that no SaintMatth. 6. 8. or Angel is able to match the Flat-forme thereof, being large for Mattr, shrt for Phrase, and sweet for Order. OUr Father, By right of Creation, Merit of Mercie, Gratious Provisour. Which art in Heaven: The seat of thy Majestie, The inheritance of thy children, The Kingdome of Blisse. Hallowed be thy Name: By the thoughts of our hearts, By the words of our mouthes, By the works of our hands. Thy Kingdome come: Of Grace to inspire us, Of Power to defend us, Of Glorie to crowne us. Thy will be done, In weale and woe, In fulnesse and want, In life and death. In earth as it is in heaven: In us as it is in thine Angels, Willingly, readily, faithfully, Without murmure, let, deceit. Give us this day our dai∣ly bread: For the nourishing of our bodies For the feeding of our Soules, For the relief of our necessities. And forgive us our debts, Wherby thou art dishonoured, Our neighbours wronged, Our selves endangered. As we forgive our debters: That have hurt us in our bodies, Hindred us in our goods, Wronged us in our good name. And lead us not into tem∣ptation: Of the wicked world, The enticing flesh, or The envious devill. But deliver us from evil: Forgive that is past, Remove that is present, Prevent what is to come. For thine is the Kingdom: To rule and governe all, To command and doe all, In all, by all, All in all. Now and for ever. At this present, In this world, In the world to come. Amen. As thou sayest, so is it; As thou promisest, so it shall be: As we pray, So be it Lord. Sinne what it is. SInne it is the Corruption or rather the deprivation of the first integritie of Man, as also a falling or turning from God, binding the offender by the curse of Gods Justice to undergoe the punishment. And properly of it self it is not any thing, but rather the absence of that good, which ought to be in the Creature, being a
fleering enemy before the action, a sweet porson in the action, and a stinging ser∣pent after the action; and may well be termed a poison, in that it poisoneth all parts of a Man: to wit, The Head with lightnesse, The Hert with falshood, The Eyes with adultery, The Tongue with blasphemie, The Hands with oppression, The Body with intemperance, Beautie with wantonnesse: Strength with violence: Will with wilfulnesse: Learning with dissention: Devotion with superstition: Religion with treason. And if there be greater gifts in men it poysoneth them with pride, putting Cantharides into the Oyle pot: If meaner, it poysons them with hypocrisie, put∣ting Colocinthis into the porridge pot: So that there is venenum & exitium; poi∣son and death. Sinne is before God execrable, detestable, and intollerable: Execrable, because it repented the Lord that he had made Man. Detestable, because God destroyed dumb Creatures for the sin of Man. Intollerable, because God spared not his own Son for the offence of Man. All sorts of sinne are comprehended In the word Iniquitie in which is includ naturall corruption. In the word Transgression in which is includ every actuall sinne. In the word Sinne in which is includ presumptuous sinne. Sinnes are of three sorts: Imputative from Adam, by whose sin we are all guiltie of death.Rom. 5 17. Rom. 7. 18. Iob 14 4. Rom. 7. 11. 14. Rom. 5. 14. 1 Ioh. 3. 4. Gen. 6. 5. Originall from our corruption, consisting in Enmitie to Good, and Pronenesse to evil. Actuall from our life, either by omitting or committing of Good, Evil. By Omission of dutie required inwardly in the understanding, will.Matth. 15. 19. By Commission of evil forbidden outwardly in word, or deed.Isai. 3. 8. Which to do is a particular breach of Gods law, leaving a staine in the Soul, which polluteth the sinner, and disposeth him to further evil, in that it hardeneth the heart, gnaweth the Conscience, fighteth against the Soul, maketh ashamed, procureth plagues on Body and Soul with death eternall: Stipendium peccatimorsRom. 6. 23. est: The Reward of sin is death. Sinne against the Holy Ghost. SInne against the Holy Ghost, is the resisting of the knowne Truth, not of infir∣mitie for teare or favour, but of meet malice and hatred. Such are they that the Apostle speaketh of: The steps unto which Sinne are these: 1. PresumptionHeb. 6. 4. Chap. 10. 26. of Gods mercy: 2. Despaire of forgivenesse: 3. An impugning of the Truth, more freely to sinne, envying others spirituall good: 4. Obstinacie in sinne: And lastly, to dye without repentance for sinne. Mans sinne compared with the Devils sinne. THe Devil sinned once and no more; Man sinnes daily more and more. The Devil sinned before the Stipend of sinne; Man after notice and experience of sinne. The Devill persisted in malice being of God rejcted; Man continues in hatred against God being by him recalled. The Devils heart was heardened against God that punished him; Man is obdurate against God that assumeth him.

They cover with a covering, not with my Spirit: (saith God) that they may adde sin to sin: They will not take counsell of me, &c. Use. Seeing one sin begets another, let us take heed how we accustome our selves inEcclus. 7. 8. sinning: for that sin which may be conquered of us when it is young, will easily conquer us when it is old.

Sinne excused by Godly and wicked TO excuse sinne is to derive and translate a sinne committed by us, to another; thereby to ease ourselves wholly, or at the least, by having a partner, that it may be th more lighter upon our shoulders.

Nosce teipsum: Know thy selfe: IT is no small point of wisdome (saith a learned Father) for a Man to know himself: If he know his Bodie, he will say with the Prophet, I am fearfullyPsal. 139. 14. Gen. 2. 7. Psal. 8. 4. made: If he know his Soul, he will say with Moses, It is a breath of Life: If he know his Condition, he will say with David, What is Man? But for a man to know what belongs to a Man, to dwell as they say within himselfe, to descend into his own bosome, and to keep himself within his own Scantling, is the part of a most wise man, and is indeed Nosce teipsum. He that knoweth not what he should know, is a Beast among Men. He that knoweth no more then must needs, is a Man among Beasts. He that knoweth All that he may know, is a God among Men.
MAn is composed of the foure Elements, of Fire, Water, Earth, and Ayre, and of all their qualities; in that his vitall spirits agreeth with the fire, his hu∣mours with the water, his body with the earth, and his hearing with the ayre, be∣ing a Creature fearfully, and wonderfully made by God of the clay of the ground, fashioned wholly round about, clothed with skinne and flesh, and joy∣ned together with bones and sinewes, having his breath from the Almighty, and his Creation after his own image and likenesse (that is) in righteousnesse and holinesse, as the Apostle witnesseth: Which Image being lost by Adams trans∣gression, his Conception is now in sinne, and his birth in Iniquitie, his Father is Corruption, his Mother and Sister Wormes, his habitation is a house of Clay to dwell in, as his foundation is in the Dust, during his time of abiding.

And his AgePsal. 39. 5. Is nothing in respect of God, his yeares are but as a thought, his dayes but for∣rowes,Psal. 90. 9. and they are few and evill, his time being but seventie yeares (saith David:)Eccles. 2. 23. and is to be numbred by dayes not by yeares, saying, Few and evill have the dayesPsal. 90. 10. of my life been. And so did David, saying, Teach me, O Lord, to number my dayes,Gen. 47. 9. not yeares.Psal. 90. 12. And his Birth Is unto Travell, and his travell unto griefe, in that heIo 5. 7. Man is borne in Corrupti∣on and Sinne, weeping and wailing: To shew his Miserie. Man liveth in Miserie and Labour, Laughing and Toiling: To shew his Follie.Wisd▪ 7. Man dieth in Griefe and Anguish, Sighing and Sobbing: To shew his Simpliciti. So that his Birth is in teaes, life in sweat, and death in sorrow. His Mans Infancie is a Dreame, rashnesse, and foolish simplicitie. Mans Youth is a Frenzie, rage, and vain heat. Mans Manhood is a Combate, covetousnsse and pinfull carefulnesse. Mans Old age is a Sicknesse, weaknesse, and noisome languishing. Mans Life is a Miserie, vexation, and full of Troubles. Mans Death is a Horrour, dread, and fearfulnesse. So that Teares and Complaints are his beginnings. Travels and pains-taking are his progresse and proceeding. Dread his death, and corruption in the grave his ending. Thus, as Iob saith, Man that is borne of a woman is full of trouble, and hath but a short time to live: He commeth up, and is cut downe like a flower, having his be∣ginningIob 14. 2. and ending in nakednesse, being condemned as soon as conceived, and before he is borne, to eternall death judged. His Mans Breath is in his nostrils. Strength, labour and toiling.Isai. 2. 22. Mans Beauty is as a Moath. Abiding, is as the Grashopper.Psal. 39. 11. Mans Memory is forgetfulnesse. Glory, as a Flower.Psal. 109. 23. Mans Eares are floud-gates to let in sin. Eyes windows to behold vani∣ties.1 Pet. 1. 24. Mans Heart an Anvill for Satan to work on Sences, matches to kindle lust.2 Sam. 11. And Hath within him, sinne rebelling against him: without, the world to allure him: on the right▪ hand, Prosperitie to inveigle him: on the left hand, adversitie to vex him: Before him, Satans snares to entangle him: behind, Conscience to dog him: under his feet, the grave to swallow him: over his head, Gods judge∣ments to fall on him. Thus the Orient and Occident, Prologue, and Epilogue of Mans life is no∣thing but Misery and Vanitie, having nothing assured him, but the assured Cer∣taintie and Uncertaintie of Death. Certain, because no man can stop it. Un∣certain three manner of wayes: 1. In regard of Time: No man knowes When he shall dye. 2. In regard of Place: No man knowes Where he shall dye. 3. In regard of the End: No man knowes How he shall dye.

REpentance is the hatred of sinne, and an earnest desire of Righteousnesse, by which we are continually stirred up to abhorre our vices, and are moved to do good works, not for feare of punishment, or hope of reward, but for that love we beare unto God, which worketh in us that with a joyfull heart we are moved to his obedience, and with griee goe astray from his Commandements. And therein is the Promise fulfilled made unto us of God by the Prophets, namely that he willIer. 31. 33. Ezek 36. 26. Psal. 119. 17, 47. take from us the ony heart, in stead whereof he will give us a heart of flesh, wherein he will ingrave his Law, that we may walke in his Commandements. Hence it commeth that the Law of God which in former time was grievous, and hated of us, is not only not grievous, but most acceptable and delightfull. Repentance is a Work of Grace arising of a Godly Sor∣row. Godly sorrow, whereby a man turnes from all his sinnes unto God, bringing forth fruits worthy amendment of life: Of which sorrow for sinnes there are two inds,* Godly and Worldly.2 Cor. 7. 11. Godly For sinne, because it is sinne, a breach of Gods will, and an offence to his Majestie: Which sorrow was In David, Fainting, Psal. 6. 6. In Hezekiah, Chattering, Isai. 38. 14 In Ioh, abhorring himself, Ioh 42. 6. In Manasseh. humbling himself, 2 Chron. 33. In Ezra, in his heavinesse, Ezra 9. In Daniel, in his Sorrowfulnesse, Dan. 9. In Ephraim, smiting the thigh, Ier. 31. 19.
In Peter, weeping bitterly, Matth. 27. Numb. 12. 11. In The Father, bewailing his unbeliefe, Mark 9. 24. In Magdalene, washing of Christs feet, Luke 7. 38. As also in Paul crying out, Oh miserable man that I am, who shall deliver meRom. 7. 24. from this body of sinne? So that the Spirit of heavinesse goeth before the Garment of gladnesse, for that there is no reaping in joy without sowing in teares.Psal. 126. 5. Worldly Worldly sorrow. Gen. 4. 13. Sorrow is a griefe and passion of the heart for worldly things, or spi∣rituall things in worldly respects, and often a feare of punishing for committed sinne. Such was King Ahab's, for his oppression And Felix, at Paul's preaching.1 King. 21. Gen. 7. Natth. 27. Act. 4. Natth. 14. Exd. 4. Esau's, for his blessing. And Herod's, at Iohn Baptists. Iudas, for his betraying. And Pharaoh's, at the Almightie. Yea, such is every wicked man, when they see or feel the fearfull Judgements of God to overtake them, and fall upon them: Then every Sorrow is not repentance for sinne, for so should worldlings Repent. Then every Pant for sin is not repentance for sinne, for so should Pharaoh Repent. Then every Confession is not repentance for sinne, for so should Iudas Repent. Then every Little humbling is not repentance for sinne, for so should Ahah Repent.Heb. 12. 17. Then every Weeping is not repentance for sinne, for so should Esau Repent. Then every Good word is not repentance for sinne, for so should Sick men Repent. Then every Cry to God is not repentance for sinne, for so should Every foole Repent. True Sorrow then is the Godly Sorrow, spoken of by St Paul, that causeth2 Cor. 7. 10, &c. Repntance unto Salvation not to be reprented of. Whereas worldly sorrow causeth death, after which repentance, in the nextHeb. 5. 7. place will follow Fasting, teares, and crying. Of Fasting. FAstings are of divers kindes: and diversly used. There is a Constrained Fast, For want of food.2 King 6. Act. 27. 33. There is a Sickly Fast, Having food, and cannot eat. There is a phisicall Fast, For recovering of Health. There is a Civill Fast, Commanded by Magistrates.Ionab 2. There is a Miraculous Fast, Such was Moses, Elias, and Christs. There is a Daily Fast, By abstinence. There is a Religious Fast, Used by the Godly.2 Car. 6.6. The Benefits that Fasting brings to man are very great: Fasting Strengtheneth the Memorie. Preserveth Chasticie. Fasting Cleareth the Minde. Preventeth sicknesses. Fasting Illuminateth the Understanding. Continueth Health. Fasting Bidleth the Affections. Delivereth from evils. Fasting Mortifieth the flesh. Procureth all blessings. And they shew Our sorrowes for sinne past: So did the Israelites fast.Iudg. 20. 26. Ionah 3. 1 Cor. 9. Psal. 35. 14. Our fear of punishment to come: So did the Ninevites fast. The castigation of the bodie: So did the Apostles fast. The humiliation of the Soul: So did the Prophets fast. True FastingMatth. 9. 15. 1 Cor. 7. 5. Ioel 2. 12. Dan. 9. 3. Isai. 1. 16. Chap. 58. 6.Is when a man perceiving the want of some blessing, or suspecting and seeing some emment calamitie upon himselfe or other, abstineth not only from flesh for a season, but also from all delights and su∣stenances, that he may thereby make a more diligent search into his sins, and thereby make his prayers more humbly unto God, to with∣hold his plagues threatned, to take them away being fallen on him, and to bestow such things as are wanting to him. So did the Nine∣vites: Queen Estker for the Jewes, and Israelites for themselves.
Of Teares. TEares are noted to proceed of an ardent Affection, as in Ieremiah: The voiceIer. 31. 15. of heavinesse, weeping and Lamentation was heard, Rachel mourning for her Children.

Psal. 106. Reade 2 Chron. 7. 13. Isai. 58. 6. Psal. 35. 13. 2 Cor. 7. 10. Repentance how said to be in God. WHen the Scriptures attribute Repentance unto God, it is not that he doth contrarie to that he hath ordained in his secret Counsell: But when he threatneth, it is a calling to Repentance, and when he giveth man Grace to repent, the Threatning (which ever containeth a Condition in it) taketh no place. And this the Scripture calleth Repentance in God, because it so appeareth to the judge∣ment of man. The Lord repented 1. That he had made man: and that he had made Saul King.Gen 3. 1 Sam. 15.

Ps. 135. 14. Ps. 135. 24. Ier. 26. 3.  18. 8. 6. Saith David, in remembring his Covenant made to the Israelites, and that according to the multitude of his mercies. The Lord is said not to repent: 1. ecause they have forsaken him, and gone backward, because they haveIer 15 6. Chap. 18. 10. Ezek. 24. 14. Hos. 13. 14. done evil, and would not hear his voice, therefore according to their own works he rewarded them. 2. But saith, That repentance is hid from his eyes, and that because of the wic∣kednesse they had committed against him. 3. The earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall be darkened, and that becauseIer. 4. 28. Chap. 15. 6. the people have forsaken him.
The Lord cannot repent.1 Sam. 15. 29. Mal. 3. 6. Rom. 11. 9. Iam. 1. 17. Ps. 1 27 Num. 23. 19 Pa  4 Isi 4. 1. . 11. 8. Heb. 1. 12. Io, 13. 1. Jer. 18. 8. The strength of Israel will not lye: He is not a man that he should repent. I am the Lord, (saith God) I change not. All the gifts and Callings of God are without repentance. With him there is no variablenesse, nor shadow of turning. He hath said, and it shall be done, he hath spoken it, and shall accomplish it. His coun∣sell shall stand. Gods mercies Mans iniquities. GOds mercie i Gods meere good will, and readie affection to forgive a peni∣tentPsal. 103. 8. sinner, notwithstanding all his sins and ill deserts, and is nothing else but his Essence, which is One, and by which he is Wise, Just, and Mercifull alto∣gether:Tit. 3. 4, 5. He then that will be a searcher of his Mercie shall be overwhelmed with his Glorie: Now his Mercy proceedeth from his free Love towards us, whichProv. 25. 27. although it be extended towards all men in Misery, yet it is otherwise extended towards the Elect, then towards others; but yet it is so great to all, that it can neither be expressed, nor comprehended by us. Salvation and all the parts thereof are from the Mercy of God, his Mercy from his free Love, and his Love from his Goodnesse. So that there is nothing in us to move God to Mercy, but that it proceedeth wholly from his meere Love and Goodnesse, which is unspeakeable in that he forgetteth not his Mercie, neither will continue his Mercie in wrath, and yet he forgetteth our iniquities.Psal. 77. 9. By his Mercie he ministreth food to the hungry out of the earth: Beasts skins to the cold and naked to clothe them: Herbes and fruits out of the earth for me∣dicinePsal. 104. for the sick: Thaweth things frozen in winter by the Suns heat: Modera∣teth things too hot in the day, by the coldnesse of the night; so that whatsoeverPsal. 147. good thing is in the world, the same dependeth wholly on the Mercie and Good∣nesseMatth. 5. 45. of the Lord; by which then it is plain and manifest, that all our merits and worthinesse are excluded, so as that no other thing can be in us, but things mise∣rable and sinfull. There is a seven-old Mercie in God: A Preventing Mercie: By which the Lord preserves the Elect from grosse sin. A Forbearing Mercie: Whereby the Lord waiteth for the sinners Conversion. An Altering Mercie: Which makes a man setled in resolution of Holinesse. An Imbracing Mercie: Whereby God assureth the Convert of his Mercies. A confirming Mercie: Which strengtheneth the Righteous in his Goodnesse. A Hopefull Mercie: Which sets man in Glories Expectation. A Crowning Mercie: Wherein is Livery of the Kingdome, and Possession. Note. After this life, notwithstanding the great Mercie of God, there is no place for Mercie in God left by which sinnes are remitted: For that Justice, whereby eve∣ry one receiveth according to his deserts, doth possesse all things there at the end of the world, both in them that are saved and destroyed. Adam and Eve disobeyed Gods Commandement, being but one only, in eating; and having eaten fled from God calling them, and in stead of confes∣sing their sin, the one laid it upon the Serpent, the other as it were on God himselfe, saying, The woman thou gavest me, gave me, &c. The serpent gave me, &c. and I did eat. Such yet was Gods Mercie towards them, that he clothed them, being naked in body; and promised them the Righteousnesse of Christ Jesus to clothe their naked soules. Abraham By the perswasion of Sarah his wife lay with Hagar her hand-maid,Gen. 16. Chap. 25. Chap. 12, Chap 20. 9. Chap. 11. kept divers Concubines, denyed his wife two severall times: was the son of an Idolater among the Caldeans, proceeding from the Hittites and Amorites. Such yet was Gods Mercie towards him, as that he was the Father of the Faithfull called, and the man in whose seed all Nations of the earth should be blessed.
Aaron committed Idolatrie by making the molten Calfe, spake against Mo∣ses,Exod. 32. Numb. 12. Ch. 10. 10. &c. and beleeved not the Lord at the waters of Meribah. Such yet was Gods mercy towards him, that he was made the High Priest unto the Lord, and so his posteritie succeeded. Ahab That wicked King consented to the death of Naboth, took his Vine∣yard from his posteritie, said the prophets prophesied not good un∣to him, called them his enemies, reared up an Altar for Baal, fol∣lowed1 Kin. 21. idolatrie as the Amorites and Heathens: sold himselfe to doe wickednesse in the sight of the Lord, angring the Lord more1 King. 22. 1 King. 16. then all the kings of Israel did before him. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, that humbling of himselfe, the Lord with-held his plagues threatned. The Apostles Forbad those that brought children to Christ, were hardened inMatth. 19. 13. Luk. 18. 15. Matth. 16. 5. Ioh. 6. Matt. 26. 40. Mark 9. 38. Matth. 28. 17. Act. 1. 6. their hearts, not considering Christs miracles: were of little saith: some disdayned the sons of Zebedem, others reasoned who should he greatest, some demanded what they should have for fol∣lowing Christ, shewing their covetousnesse; others forbade them that in Christs Name cast out devils, shewing their envie; some could not watch when he was betrayed, all forsooke him, when he was apprehended, all made question for preferment, most of his resurrection doubted. Such yet was Gods mercie that they were all again received by Christ. The Co∣rinthians Some of them were fornicatours, others Idolaters, some Adulterers, others wantons, some buggerers, others theeves, some drunkards,1 Cor. 6. 10, 11, &c. 1 Cor. 6. 5. others covetous persons, some railers, others extortioners, and such like; not a wise man to be found almost among them, saith Saint Paul. Such yet was Gods mercie towards them, as that they were in Christ sanctified, and justified by the Spirit of the Lord. David 1. Made a Lye to Ahimelech the Priest, took Shew-bread, and Goliah's1 Sam. 21. sword, by meanes whereof Ahimelech with fourescore and five others that wore the  Ephod were put to death by Saul. HeChap. 22. 14. companied with men of all sorts, being captain over them in his trouble. He feigned himself to be mad unto king Achish, lying un∣to1 Sam. 27. him, and living with him being an Idolater, dissembled with him in his pretence to goe to battle against the Israelites: He di∣strusted God, saying, he should dye by the sword of Saul: He swore1 Sam. 29. Chap. 27. 1. he would not leave one of Nabals house to pisse against the wall. Such yet was Gods mercy that he delivered him out of the hand of Saul, and made him King over all Israel. 2. He committed Adulterie wth Ʋriahs wife, caused Ʋriah to be made drunk, thinking thereby that he would have layen with his wife, and so his shame should have been covered: He caused Ʋriah to be slain, by commanding him to be placed in the forefront of the bat∣tell,David &c. Being slain, he dissembled the same to the Messenger that brought him tidings thereof, saying, The sword devoureth one as well2 Sam. 11. 25. as another. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, that he no sooner said to2 Sam. 12 13. Nathan, I have sinned: but Nathan said, The Lord hath put away thy sinne, thou shalt not dye. 3. He was angry with the Lord for slaying Ʋzzah: He gave the land of2 Sam. 6 8. 2 Sam. 19. 30. 2 Sam. 24. 2 Sam. 15. 16. Psal. 30. 6. Psal. 116. 11. Psal. 31. 22. Psal. 77. 10. Mephibosheth unto Zba Mephihosheths servant without just cause: He numbred his people in his pride, and said he should never be moved: He had ten Concubines besides severall wives: He said in his affliction that all men were lyars, and that he had cleansed his heart in vain: and in his haste that he was cast out of Gods sight, and that God had forgotten to be mercifull, &c. yea so, as he said in despaire, This is my death, &c. Such yet was Gods mercy towards him, as that he never took his lo∣ving kindnesse from him.
Elijah Being sought after by Iezebel, impatiently said that It is now enough: Oh Lord, take my Soul, I am no better then my fathers; as also wrong∣fully condemned many of Gods children, saying, I only am lest and1 King. 19. 4. 10. they seek my life to take it away; whereas God himselfe confessed to have many thousands, &c. and so desiring to dye. The Lord in mercie sent his Angell to relieve him, and by his owne voice and presence, shewing himself, comforted him. Hezekiah Gave all the silver that was in the Lords house unto king Ashur, with the gold that the doors and pillars were overlaid withall;2 Kin. 18. 15. shewed in his pride all his treasures to the king of Babels Messen∣gers:Chap. 20. 13. was restored to his health, and was not thankfull having fifteen yeares added to his dayes.2 Chron. 31. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, that God threatning his Treasures and posteritie should be carried into Babel, promisedIsai. 39. that there should be peace in his dayes. Iacob Lyed three times to his Father, saying, he was Esau, changed hisGen. 27. garments, dissembled with his Father, and by deceit got the bles∣singChap. 31. from his brother, stayed twentie yeares from his Father un∣dutifullyChap. 29. without visiting him: had two wives, besides his wivesChap. 30. handmaids. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, that he made choice of himRom. 9. before Esau his elder brother before he was born,Mal. 1. Ioseph Undutifully stayed from Iacob his Father twentie yeares, forgetting his fathers houshold, he dissembled with his brethren, making asGen. 31. 38. though he knew them not, he termed them Spies: he imprisonedChap. 41. 51. them three dayes: he swore again and again by the life of Pharaoh (forgetting God) he dealt deceitfully with his brethren, by causingChap. 4. his silver cup to be put into Benjamins sack: He accused them of Theft: he said he could divine by his Cup: he was angry withChap. 44. his father for blessing his younger son before the elder.Chap. 48. 17. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, as that he lived and dyed in gypt land, a man in great favour and reputation. Iudah Lay with Tamar his daughter in law, judging her to be a whore, by whom he had Pharez: from whose descent Christ by the greatGen. 38. mercie of God unto mankinde descended.Matth. 1. Ioshua Envied Eldad and Medad, because they prophesied: he rent hisNumb. 11. 27. clothes, impatiently demanding of the Lord, why he had brought the Israelites over Jordan to deliver them into the hands of the Amorites: and wished that he had been content to have dwelt on the other side of Jordan; such was his infideline, that he questioned if the Lord would give the Israelites, as he had promised, the land of Canaan.Iosh. 7. Such yet was Gods mercy that he encouraged him to go over Jordan, and gave him courage to prove a valiant captain. Ionah, and Ionahs Marriners Fled from Gods presence to Tarshish, for which being cast into the sea; the Lord in his mercie provided a Fish to save him, and inIonah 1.

He said that God was his enemie, charging him injustly.Chap. 16. 21. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, as that he blessed his latterChap. 3. 21. Chap. 32. 2. Chap 4 5. Chap. 4. dayes, more then the first.
Ieremiah Complained that the Lord had filled him with indignation, and that he was unto him as a lyar, and as waters that faile, said that God had deceived him, and that he was deceived, and that he wouldIer. 15. make no more mention of the Name of the Lord: He cursed the day wherein he was borne, and the man that told his father thatChap. 20. 7. a man-child was borne unto him: He wished that his motherChap. 38. might have been his grave, and her wombe a perpetuall conception. And lyed unto Zedekiahs princes as Zedekiah willed him.Ch 39. 11. &c. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, as being in Captivitie he continued a Prophet, and was well intreated by the enemie. Iehoahaz The son of Iehu wrought evil in the sight of the Lord, and followed2 King. 13. the sis of Ieroboam. Yet such was Gods mercie unto him, as being in Captivitie, he no sooner called on him, but he delivered him. The Israelites Were continually murmuring against God: They caused Aaron toIer. 3. 1, 13, &cEzek. 16. 8 make them a golden Calfe to worship, which they worshipped:Exod. 23.Isai. 4. 3. Seved the gods of the Heathens and Zidonians, daily provokingIudg. 2.Isa. 10. 25. & 43. 24. the Lord by their abominations.Chap. 3. 10. Such yet was Gods mercie towards them, that whensoever they wereIer. 31. 3, 4.Ier. 3. 1. 5. 7. in Tribulation, calling upon him, he delivered them, yea, and saidIudg. 10. 16. that his soul was grieved for them.Psal. 78. 0. The Jews Persecuting Christ, mocking, reviling, and crucifying him. Such yet was his Love and Mercie towards them, that he prayed hisLuk. 23. Father in his passion to forgive them. Jerusalem Stoned the Prophets, and slew them that were sent unto her, was full of iniquitie and sin: Such yet was Gods mercie towards her, that if one man had been found therein that did execute Judgement,Ier. 5. 1. and seek after the Truth, he would have spared it.Ezek. 22. 30. And Being foreseen by Christ that it should be destroyed, yea so, as that the enemie should not leave a stone upon a stone: Such was his mercyLuk. 19. 41. towards it, that he wept for it, and gave them forty yeares, to see if they would repent, before it was destroyed by Titus and Vespasian. Cain Being wroth with his brother, because his deeds were good: being admonishedGen. 3. from heaven to take heed of sinning, regarded not the word of the Lord, but slew his brother, denying, being demanded1 Ioh. 3. 2. of the Lord, that he knew what was become of him. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, as that he spared his life, ha∣ving for his act deserved present death, accusing God to have aidChap. 4. 24. more on him then he could beare, his punishment was but such as that wicked Lamech boasted of Gods sufferance towards him. Miriam Speaking against Moses, became leprous. Such yet was Gods mercie that Moses no sooner intreated God, but sheNumb. 12. was cleansed. Magdalene Was a sinfull woman possessed with seven devils.

Believed not that God shouldChap. 5. 22. feed the people with flesh, as he had promised, or that he couldNumb. 1. 11. bring waters out of the rocks, as he had said.Chap. 20. 10. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, as that he had eye-sight cleare to behold all the land of Canaan from the top of NeboDeut. 34. mountain: with naturall strength at his end not abated: and so dyed, and was by an Angell buried.
Manasseh Did evil after the abomination of the Heathen, who worshipped the hoste of Heaven: Caused his sonnes to passe through the fire: gave himself to witchcraft and to Sorcerie, caused the people to do2 King. 21. 2 Chron. 35. more wickedly then the Heathens: Shed much innocent bloud, replenished Jerusalem from corner to corner, making Judah to sin besides his own sinne. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him being in Captivitie, that he2 Chron. 33. no sooner humbled himselfe for his sinne, but the Lord heard him, and restored him to his KIngdome againe. Matthew A publicane at the receipt of Custome, was by Gods mercie called byMatth. 9. Luk. 5. Luk. 19. Christ to be an Apostle, and Zacheus another PUblicane had by Christ Salvation brought unto him. Nebuchad∣nezzar Did set up a golden image to be worshipped: caused the three chil∣dren to be cast into a fiery fornace for not worshipping his image: In his pride boasted of great Babel that the had built: & proudly de∣mande,Dan. 3. Chap. 9. 9. Chap. 4. 24. who was that God that could deliver out of his hands, &c. Such yet was Gods Mercie towards him, that being cast out of his Kingdome to live with the beasts for a time, the Lord at seven yeares end restored him to his kingdome again.Dan. 4. Naaman By the mercie of God was of all the Lepers in Israel cleansed.2 King. 5. Nineveh By the mercie of God had fortie dayes given, and they repentd.Ionah 2. The Old World By the mercie of God had 120. yeares to repent, ere he brought the floud.Gen. 7. The Prodigall Consumed his goods ritously on harlots; yet no sooner returned,Luke 15. but that he was by his Father met, embraced, received and enterteyned. The Patriarchs Hated Ioseph casting him into a pit; sold him to the Midianites;Gen. 38. Chap. 37. Chap. 34. Chap. 39. perswaded their Father that he was slaine by some wilde beast: Reuben the eldest lay with his fathers Concubine: Iudah with his daughter in law: Simeon and Levi slew the Shechemites, and the rest of their Brethren consented thereunto carrying away their goods. Such yet was the mercie of God towards them, that hee chose them to be the heads of all the Tribes of Israel. Pharaohs Heart being hardened, so as he would not let the Israelites depart, ha∣vingExod. 8. severall plagues brought on him: Questioning to Moses, Who was the Lord? Such yet was the mercie of God towards him, as he no sooner said, heChap. 9. Chap. 10. 19. had sinned, requesting Moses to pray for him, but the Lord took away the plagues brought upon him. Peter Rebuked Christ, foretelsing of his death: denyed him, swore thatMatth. 14. 28. Chap. 26. 56. he knew him not againe and againe. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, as that Christ prayed that his faith might not faile him.Luk. 22. Paul Persecuted the Christians, shutting them up in prison, punished them throughout the Synagogues, compelled them to blaspheme Christ, was a blasphemer, a persecuter, an oppressour; breathed out threat∣ningsAct. 22. 4, 19. & 26. 11.Act. 26. 101 1 Tim. 1. 13.

Such yet was the Mercie of God towards him as that Christ from Heaven called him, converted him, and of a bloudy persecutour, made him a faithfull Preachet.1 Tim. 1. 13, 16. Publicans and Sinners By the Mercie of God were permitted to sit and eat with Christ,Luk. 9. 11. Luk. 15. 2. though the Pharisees were offended thereat with him: Christ coming to call them. Rahab A common harlot was of all Jericho with hers preserved.Iosh. 6.
Rachel Stole her fathers idols, hid them, made a lie in concealing them: gaveGen. 30. Chap. 31. Chap. 35. her handmaid unto her husband: to whom she said, Give me chil∣dren, or else I dye: boasted of her evil in giving her handmaid unto her husband, &c. The Lord in mercy yet gave her children, after that she had been a long time barren. Sodome and Gomorrah Abounded in fulnesse and idlenesse, burning in lust one with theEzek. 16. other, of which Saint Paul saith, that the men left the naturall use of the women, and man with man wrought filthinesse, so thatRom. 1. 27. their cry went up to Heaven. Such yet was the mercy of God, that he would goe down and set, if they had done according to the cry that came up unto him, before he would destroy them: As also heard Abrahams request seven times for them, so that if ten righteous persons had been foundGen. 19. therein, the Citie had been spared, and not destroyed. Salomon Had many outlandish women to his wives of nations that God had forbidden the Israelites to take in marriage, to the number of se∣ven hundred, with three thousand concubines: his heart was not perfect with God as was David his fathers: He followed Ashte∣roih the god of the Zidonians, and Milcom the god of the Amo∣rites:1 King. 11. Chap. 12. He wrought wickednesse in the sight of the Lord in building high places for the god of the Zidonians and Ammonites. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, that he promised that he would not rent his kingdome from him in his dayes; neither2 Sam. 7. 14. would rent all the kingdome from his son that succeeded him. Samson Kept company with a whore called Delilab: to whom he revealed where his strength lay, whereby the vow of a Nazarite made by him was broken. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, being fallen into the hands of the Philistines, as that he heard his prayer, and increased hisIudg. 16. strength, so as he pulled downe the house on the Philistitues his enemies. Thomas Forsook Christ when he was betrayed: beleeved not that he was risen from death, unlesse it might be on condition, that he mightMatth. 26. 69. put his finger into the prints of his nailes. Such yet was Gods mercie towards him, that Christ granted the Con∣ditionsIoh. 20. 24. made by him, to save him. The Thiefe On the Crosse no sooner said, Lord, remember we when thou commest into thy Knogdome: but Christ in mercy answered, This dayshaltLuk. 23. thou be with me in Paradise. The Vineyard That yeelded not fruit, albeit all was done to it, that could be done, yet the Lord in Mercy would forebeare yet three yeares more, toLuk. 13. see if it would bring forth, re he would pluck it up, and destroy it. The Woman Taken in adulterie, and brought before Christ by many, who accused her, thereby to have moved Christ to have condemned her.Iohn 8. 3. In mercy Christ put all her accusers to silence, and sent her away without condemning her. Zacharias Beleeved not that his wife should beare a son, as he was told by the Angel of the Lord. And yet God in mercy according to the time appointed, gave him a son called Iohn.Luke 1. All Mankinde Having deserved death and damnation by the fall of Adam.Rom. 8. 32. Ioh. 3. 16. Gal. 3. 13.& 4. 4 1 Tim. 1. 13.1 Iohn 3. 1 Ioh. 4. 9. Such yet was the unspeakable mercie of God and love towards man, that when nothing could make satisfaction for the sin of Man, he sent his own only Son to dye to tendeem mankind, who also mostTit. 3. 3. willingly in compassion of man took death upon him to save all those that would beleeve in him.Lam. 3. 22. Use. 1. The mercie of God is from his free love towards us; then by no merit. 2. We should not grieve at any calamitie, seeing God hath a care of our miserie. 3. Seeing the name Mercy is given to God, none can be more mercifull then God.
4. It should teach us in our calamitie, to flie to no other but to God.Iob 33. 27. 5. Our Salvation is to be ascribed to Gods love as the Fountaine of Mercie. 6. Seeing his Mercie is from his Love, we should never despaire in our sinnes; which men would not, if they did but perceive his goodnesse unto them. 1. By his hearing of them before they cry: I will answer, saith the Lord.Isai. 65. 24. Ezek. 18. 31, 32. 2. By making s though he saw not the sins of men, that they might amend. 3. By his unwillingnesse in striking: He taketh no pleasure in the death of a sinner. 4. Lastly, seeing his Mercie is but for this life to the pardoning of sis, we ought not to abuse the same by deferring our Repentance: The spring of Repen∣tance may be dryed up, the hand of Faith may be withered, the ye of hope blind,Isa. 55. 6  Hb. 3. 15. the foot of Charitie lame: To day hear his voice, and make him thine: Yster∣day is lost, to day may be gotten, but that once gone, and thou with it, when thou art dead and judged, it will be too late.

Christ Healed corporally, Lame, blinde, lunatique, leprous, &c.Matth. 14. 14. He cleanseth leprous men by contagion of sin, by the merits of his death. He clotheth poore needy and men want of help with his grace. He enableth lame men by imperfection: by the strength of Hope. He illuminateth blinde men by ignorance: by the light of Faith. Hee corporally fed the multitude with bread and fishes.Matth. 15. 32. He spiritually feedeth Hungerers after Righteousnesse with his Body. He willeth all that are thirstie, to take of him the water of life freely. He stands and knocks, if any will open, he will sup with him. He knockes Christ is in By his Mercies, but they are abused.

He hath born our infirmities, and carried our sorrowes: He was wounded for our transgressions, and broken for our infirmities; the chastisement of Peace was upon him, with his stripes we are healed. His Love and Mercie, in a word, was such towards man, as that his pitie was ever pardoning, his wisdome ever teaching: His Liberality ever giving: and his Compassion ever helping. And therefore saith, Come unto me all ye that are laden, &c. and I will ease you.Matth. 11. 28. Chap. 29. 10. Luk. 19. 10. I will have mercie not sacrifice: I came to call sinners, &c.

Gods Justice mans Heart how hardened by God. THe heart hath three Cells or little Rceptacles, that the three Persons of the blessed Trinity, Father, Sonne and Holy Ghost may dwell therein, and that by three Theologicall vertues, to wit, by Faith, Hope and Charity. The word Heart in Latine is COR, written with these three letters: COR Signifying Camera, a Chamber. The first letter of Omnipotent. The first letter of Rex, a King. So that the Angram, as some would have it, importeth that the Heart is the Chamber of the omnipotent King of Heaven and Earth; and so the heart is the Seat of Sanctity, or else it must needs be a Cage of uncleannesse, a Chappell for the Trinity, or a Den of Theeves. Hardnesse of heart is the fountaine of ignorance, and is when a man is setled in a resolution never to yeeld from the state of sinne, wherein he liveth, whatso∣ever shall or may be said against the same: which sinne is a most wilfull and mali∣ciousEph 4. 8. resolution of sinning, yea such as that the heart cannot be brought by Gods justice or mercy to reformation or consolation. 1. There are some albeit they well know, that they are amisse, yet for some worldly respect or other, they will not yeeld nor change their course doe, say, or prove what you will or can: Such was Pilates, who albeit he knew that he con∣demnedMat 27. our Saviour Christ wrongfully, yet not to loose the favour of the Iewes, or incurre displeasure with the Prince, he proceeded and gave that most wicked sentence against him. Such also was Pharaoh's; the like was in King Agrippa and Felix, governours of Iury, who thought in their owne consciences, that Saint Paul spake truth unto them; yet not to hazard their credit in the world, they continued still in their owne wayes: And so likewise doe all persecu∣tours. 2. The second degree of obduration is in them, who have not this obduration in so high a degree, as to persist in wickednesse, directly against their owne know∣ledge, but yet they have it in another sort, so that they are setled in firme pur∣pose to follow the trad, which already they have begun, and vvill not under∣stand the danger thereof, but doe seeke other meanes▪ to perswade themselves, quieting their consciences therein, and nothing is so offensive unto them, as to heare any thing against the same: Of these men Iob speaketh (saying) DepartIoh 21. 14. from us, wee desire not the knowledge of thy wayes (to wit) the wayes of God. 3. A heart that is hardened, is ingratefull for Gods benefits, disobedient to his counsels, feares not it selfe, because it feeles not it selfe Bernard. l. de Consed. ad Eug. cap. 2.: is not rent with compunction, nor softened with pity, is not moved vvith prayers, nor yeeldeth to threats, growes tough with scourges, and unthankefull for benefits, is un∣faithfull in counsels and cruell in judgements, is impudent in vilenesse, and un∣fearefull in dangers, is uncourteous to the gentle, and unreverent in Gods wor∣ship, is unmindfull of things past, and negligent of things present, is improvi∣dent of things to come: and in a word, is like the unrighteous Judge, that earedLuk. 18. 22. neither God or man. The hardest creatures are flectable to some agents: Flints to the rine: Iron to the fire, stones to the Hammer, but the heart to nothing:Rom. 9. 18. Isa. 19. 14. 1 Kin. 22. 23. Isai. 63. 17.

Psal. 81. 12. 1 King. 22. 23. the stones of mercy, Hammer of reproofe, or fire of judgements cannot soften the same. 1. Now the action whereby God is said to obdure, to blind, to deceive, to deli∣ver into a reprobate minde, o worke by wicked persons, as his instruments to impell, to excite to evill, &c. is not an action, or infusion, or positive produ∣ction, such as he useth in the just, when he causeth vertue and grace, and doth illuminate and sanctifie them: but a worke of desertion, permission and order, whereby first God leaveth man to himselfe, and forsaketh him, (that is) affor∣deth not actions apt and congruous to reforme him, and suspendeth or denyeth the concourse of his speciall helpe and grace. 2. God suffereth man to be tempted above his strength, or to be ruled by his errors and transported by his own concupiscence, permitting Satan to exercise his subtil∣ty and malice towards him. 3. God ordereth objects and meanes in such sort, as that they may be incentives by way of occasion to provoke the wicked to exercise that wickednesse, which is in and of themselves, where and how God will have it breake out for punishment, correction, example or tryall. These two namely Entity or Substance, and the pravity of the actions, going
inseparably together, and the latter cannot be without the tormer. Say not thou then, It is through the Lord that I sell away, for thou oughtestSyr. 15. 11, 12. not to doe the things that be hateth. Say not thou, He hath caused me to erre, for he hath no need of the sinfull man. Through hardnesse of heart Agrippa beleeved not altogether that which Paul concerning Christ hadAct. 26. delivered unto him. The Disciples considered not the matter of the Loaves with which ChristMark 6. 52. had fed the multitude following him.Act. Idolaters, 24. 26. Isa. 44. 20.

Pharaoh would not let the Israelites depart, untill the Lord had broughtExod. 4. Chap. 6. &c. Mark 3. 5. Matth. 27. Jude 7. Sodomites 1 Kings 12. 15. a Chron. 10. 15. many plagues upon his, and him. The Pharises envied Christ; for which he mourned for them. Pilate would not set Christ at libertie, albeit he found no cause of death at all in him.

GOd permitteth evill by a certain voluntary permission, in that he forsaketh theRom. 1. 26. 2 Tim. 2. 23. second cause in working evill, and his Creature, either by detracting the grace it had, or not best owing that it wants. Now that which is evill hath some re∣spect of goodnesse with God for three causes: 1. First, in that it is the punishment of sinne. 2. Secondly, As it is a new Action or Act. 3. Thirdly, As it is a Chastisement, a triall of ones faith, a Martyrdome, and pro∣pitiation for sinne, as the death and passion of Christ (as the Apostle saith;) Him, I say, being delivered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God, ye haveAct. 2. 23. taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.
1. If we observe these Caveats, God is not only a bare permissive Agent in an evill work, but a powerfull effectour of the same, yet so as he neither instilleth anNote. aberration into the action, nor yet supporteth or intendeth the same; but that he most freely suffereth evill, and best disposeth of it to his owne glory. As for Ex∣ample let a man spurre forward a lame horse; in that he moveth forward, the Rider is the cause, but that he halteth, the horse himself is the cause. The like may be said of Gods action in an evill subject. 2. Observe that there is Malum poenae, & malum culpae: The evill of punishment,Ier. 39. 16. and the evill of sinne: Now the Lord is the Authour of the evill of punishment for sinne, but not of the evill of sinne, &c.Chap. 49. 37.

Pray with David that thy heart be not inclined to evil, to commit wicked actions.Psal. 14. 4. Gods Tempting and How God is said to tempt. TEmptation is nothing else but the inticement of the soule or heart, either by the corruption of Mans Nature, the allurements of the world, or the devill, to any sinne. In this manner God tempteth not, for he cannot be tempted to evill, neither tempteth he any man to evill: for out of the mouth of the most HighIames 1. 13. proceedeth not good and evill, but we are drawne on to the same divers wayes, but especially three wayes: 1. By the devill who waiteth to work out overthrow and damnation. 2. By our concupiscence in consenting to Satans suggestion, and 3. By vitious companie, being seduced by ill persuasion. Now God may be said to leade into Temptation of Probation. 1. By universall probatory precepts; such was Abrahams to kill his sonne.Gen. 22. 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, &c. 1 Kin. 22. 2. By sending extraordinary measure of prosperitie, or adversitie. 3. By letting Iose of Satan (his Bn-dogge) to buffet and molest the Godly, as Paul was; or to seduce the wicked, as Ahabs prophets were. 4. By offering occasions and objects, to trie whether a man will sinne or not; like a master suspecting his servant, which in word professeth sidelitie, layes a purse of money in his wayes, to try if he will steale it, now the trying of him is no sinne, though his servant sinne in stealing. In the same manner God tempteth his owneDeut. 13. 3. servants, to prove and trie them, to know whether they love him or not. 5. By withdrawing his grace: yet this can be no sinne in God, because he is bound to no man to give him grace, and here is a difference between the temptingHos. 5. 15. Rom. 1. 26. Act. 5. 3. of God and Satan: God holds back Grace when he tempts: the devill suggests evill motions in his tempting. 6. In every action, so farre forth as it is an action, the same is good, and of God, for in him we live, move, and have our being: As for Example, one man kils an∣other,Act. 17. 28. the very moving of the body in doing of the villanie is of God, but the wic∣kednesse of the action is from man, and the devill who thrust him forward to doe the same. 7. By correcting and humbling his servants for their sinnes, to try how they will abide the crosse: so he afflicted the Israelites and king Hezekiah, to see what wasDeut. 8 2. 2 Chron. 31. in his heart: whereas the devils end in tempting is only to bring the partie unto destruction.
The Lord trieth Abraham, by commanding him to offer up Isaac his sonne.Gen. 22. Exo. 16. 4 2 . 32. 31. Exod. 20. 2. Iudg. 2. 22. Chap. 2. 1. Psal. 81. 7. The Lord trieth The Israelites By causing bread to rain from Heaven. By thunder and lightning at the giving of the law unto them. The Lord trieth The Israelites By suffering idolaters among them. The Lord trieth David, by his knowing of him in his down-sitting, and up▪ rising.Psal. 130. 1. The Lord trieth Iob, by afflcting him, even as gold is tried by men.Job 23. 10. Gē. 39. 7. The Lord trieth Christ, as he was man, by suffering Satan to tempt him.Matth. 4. Christ trieth Peter, by willing him to come on the waters unto him. 33. 1. Psal. 3 2. Christ trieth Philip, by asking him where he should have bread enough to feed all theMatth. 4. Ioh. 6. 5. mutiude that followed him. Christ trieth Saint Paul, and other Godly persons, by mockings and scourgings, and2 Cor. 11. Heb. 1. 36, 37. by bonds and imprisonment, that they might obtain by him the first Resurrection. God Trieth the Godly as silver is tried, but delivereth them again.Psal. 66. 10. God He provth men to see if they love him entirely.Deut. 1. 3.

There is no temptation hath taken you, (saith Saint Paul) but such as is common1 Cor. 10. 13. to men: But God is faithfull, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able: but wll with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to beare it. God will trie the righteous, (saith David:) and knoweth how to deliverPsal. 1. 5. 2 Pet. 2. 9. them out of temptation, (saith Saint Peter.) Gods Justice One sinne punished.

And if the justice of God be so great against sinne, that he spared not the Elect, though they be justified by Christ, but chastened them; what then shall the wicked and impenitent sinner looke for? If God have punished one sinne so severely in the Angels, in Adam, and in o∣ther godly men, what shall we looke for that have committed so many sinnes a∣gainst2 Peter 22. Iudg. 6. him? If God have damned so many for lesser s then ours are, what will he doe to us for greater? If God have borne longer with us, then he hath done with many other, whom he hath cut off without giving them time of Repentance. What reason is there that he should beare longer with us? If God have not spared the naturall branches, let us then dread for whom these1 Cor. 10. 11. ensamples are written to admonish us.

Gods Mercie Man comforted in the place he sorrowed. In the same place where Adam heard sentence of punishment: he heard a sentence of comfort, saying;Gen. 3.

Hagar was in the Wildernesse with her son; the Lord comforted them. Hezekiah was by Senacherib threatned; Senacheribs host was destroyed, and being sicke unto death, had fifteen years added to his life. Isaac confessed himselfe to be in povertie; he was made wealthy. Iephtah was banished; he was made captain by th Elders o Gilead. Iohn was exiled; He had heavenly mysteries, being ravished. Iob was by Satan tormented; he was at the last double blessed. The Israelies were most by Pharaoh vexed; the more they increased, and being sorrowfull by bondage, were with joyfulnes delivered Mordecai was by Haman with the Jewes disgraced, they were advanced. Iehoshapha feared most the enemy; the Lord gave him the victory. Ruth in her poverty gleaned corne; she was made rich by her kinsman. Steven was stoned; he was comforted; seeing the Heavens opened. Christ was tempted, the Angels came to him and ministred, and from the Moun Olivet going to his passion, he ascended to glory in Heaven. Heavinesse may endure for a night: but joy commeth in the morning. They that sw in teares shall reape in joyfulnesse. The Lord will turne sorrow into gladnesse, and will give beauty in stead of ashes: Ioyfullnesse for sighing; and pleasantnesse for heavinesse. Gods Justice Sinne of one punished in another. Children punished for the Sin of their Father. HOw can God in Justice punish the children for the Fathers fault? Seeing theOb.Ezech. 18. 20. Ier. 31. 29. Gal. 6. 3. Lord himselfe saith, The Sonne shall not heare the iniquity of the Fa∣ther. Man consisteth of a bodie, which we have from our Parents, and a souleDeut 4. 16. 2 King. 14. 6. Gal. 6. 5. which is given us immediately from God, both subject to corporall and tempo∣rall, spirituall and eternall punishments: Of vvhich spirituall and eternall pu∣nishment, thou at to understand that of the Prophet (saying) The soule that sin∣neth shall die: The Sonne shall not heare the iniquity of the Father: But for corpo∣rall and temporall punishments, God visiteth the iniquity of the father upon the children: And so God judged the house of Eli for ever, because his sonnes ran in∣to a slander. And so the whole body of the people is punished for the sinne of one1 Kin. 2. 27. Iosh. 22. 20. Deut. 21. or many, unlesse the sinne be satisfied. So God plagued the Israelites for the sin of Achan: and so threatned to doe if any murtherer escaped. 2. To this we may answer, as the Lord doth in Hosea, speaking to the Jewes, he bids them plead with their mother, comparing himselfe to a husband, shewingHos. 2. 21. that there is no fault in him, but that all the blamelies on the adulterous mother. For as an husband may without any fault put away the wife that hath dealt trea∣cherously, and her adulterous brood also, because they be none of his children▪ So may God justly plague and forsake both the Parents and the wicked children of wked Parents. 3. T punishment is fullfilled on the wicked children, when the Lord with∣holdeth  meanes of grace and the spirit of grace from them; as also in letting the children  their fathers evill vvaies to imitate the same, as also in giving them up to blindnesse f mind, and hardnesse of heart, and such like, whereupon no∣thing else can be looked for, but that the children being forsaken of God should live most wickedly, and so move God to take vengeance upon them So the poste∣rity of wicked Ahab, and also of Cham, heare the curse upon them, for the iniqui∣ty of their wicked fathers. 4. God dealeth herein, as man dealeth with the Serpent, who destroyeth both young and old, because they are enemies unto him, as also because he seeth they can doe nothing else but evill. So the Lord cutteth off the children of the wic∣ked,
for that he seeth if he should suffer them to remaine, they would be as bad as their fathers before him. 5.

FEare is a timeous apprehension of an evill to come, being nothing else but the betraying of the succours which reason offereth, and is two-fold: Godly and wicked: Godly, fearing to displease God. Wicked, fearing the punishment of God more then God in sinning. Feare agin in the Godly is before AfflictionsWisd. 17. 11. come, and when they are come then their fear is pst. Feare in the wicked is not before afflictions come, but when they are come, then they feare too much: For impietie triumpheh in prospritie, and trembleth in adversitie, but Pietie trem∣bleth in prosperitie, and triumpheth in adversitie. There are five kinds of Feare: 1. Naturall: Which is one of the affections of the Soul created by God, with which Adam was endowed in the state of Innocencie. 2. Carnall: The object whereof is flesh, or at the least, that which flesh mayMatth. 14. 26. Isai. 24. 13. 2 King. 17. 32. Ier. 3. 16. 1 Ioh. 4. 18.

Filliall: That is proper to the Sons of God; they doe not only feare hisJer. 6. 18. Mar 5. . Act. 9. 31. Judgements, but love and feare him for his mercie. 5. Diabolicall: The devils know there is a God, therefore they feare and trem∣ble, having received the sentence of condemnation.Iude 6. True feare breeds in us a marvellous humilitie, as we saw in Iacob, who was much afraid of his brother Esau, and therefore coming towards him, bowedGen. 33. 3. himselfe seven times unto him. It is very credulous: This again we see in Iacob, for when one told him that his brother came against him so well furnished, he feared greatly, yet disputed not long in the matter.Gen. 32. True feare causeth diligence, this also we see in Iacobs Example, who was marvellous studious to salute his brother: disposing wisely of that he had, to pre∣vent his brothers fury. Feare hath painfulnesse: (saith St John) There is no feare in love: for perfect love casteth out feare: He then that feareth is not perfect in love.1 Iohn 4. 18.

For that he that vvorshippeth God after an overthwart and unlawfull manner, adoreth an I∣doll. Therefore in the service of God, and in all things belonging to the wor∣ship of God, all things ought to be done according to his vvord, as Christ him∣selfe commanded, saying: Teach them to observe all things as I have commanded: speaking to his Apostles. And Saint Paul saith, That which I have received of the Lord, I have delivered. And againe he saith, Let all things be done honest∣ly, &c. Are there then no Ceremonies to bee used? Did they all die with Christ? No, some were typicall, prefiguring Christ, those are dead: other some are of decency and order, those are not dead. Christ came not to dissolve order: men consist of bodies as well as soules, God must be served with both, now bo∣dies cannot srve God without externall rites. The Spouse of Christ cannot be without her borders and laces, on necessity there must be some outward observan∣ces; but thus qualified. They must be for number few and farre from ostentation. They must be for signification plaine and from They must be for observation simple and farther from superstition.

In Hearing Attention, Speciall to the Word delivered, proving the Doctrine,Isai. 55. 3. Psal. 119. 113. with keeping that which is good and wholesome. After Hearing Meditation, And Practice, in that we must not onely be hearers,Heb. 2. 1. Iam. 1. 21. but doers also.

This should teach us to follow the counsell of the Wise-man, (saying) In allSyr. 34. 8, 9. thy gifts shew a joyfull countenance, and dedicate thy Tithes with gladnesse, accor∣ding as the Lord hath enriched thee, and looke what thy hand is able to give, give with a chearefull eye, for the Lord recompenceth, and will give thee seven times as much: Diminish nothing of thy Offering, for if thou doe, he will not receive it: Abstaine from wrongfull sacrifices, for the Lord is the judge and regardeth no mans person. The willingnesse of these people in building and repairing the Lords house, as also in rendering to the Lord his tithes, doe condemne many in these our dayes, that seyle their owne houses, and let the Lords house be waste, yea that doe rui∣nate the same, and with the spoyles thereof doe build themselves goodly houses, not at all regarding to pay any tithes due to the Lord: Fight the Lords battell they may that will, that which other left to the Church a number take away: Such Sauls are many, few Pauls, many Hornets, few Bees, much gall and al∣loes, few honey Combes, nay scarce a poore Hive left for many to put their heads in. A fearfull example was the judgement of God on those that ruinated the house of God, not rendering their dues to the Lord. How then shall even the proud Pharisees condemne many in these our dayes, vvho paid tithes of all that they had, not a pot-herbe, but they tithed it: Sacrilegious Patrons, the merchants of soules, the pirates of the Church, and enemies of Religion, they tithed all, you nothing; they paid the Levites, the Levites must pay you. Your cures must be purchased, your tithes abated, or compounded for. Your Fathers cloathed the Church, you dispoyle it, their ignorant devotion shall rise in judgement against your ravenous covetousnesse: Yea king Pharaoh, who provided for his Priests shall condemne many of you: The Lord open your eyes to see your miseries.

Old things, saith the Apostle, are passed away, all2 Cor. 5. 17. Rev. 21. 5. things are become new. He that will be in Christ must be a new Creature. There is New Knowledge,Col. 3. 10. 1 Pet. 2. 10.

And therefore of necessitie there must be in stead of the old a new Sabbath, and day of rest for the people of the Lord, according to Pauls saying, There remaineth a rest to the people of God.Heb. 4. 9.

Noahs Arke rested on the mountaine of Ararat after the floud. Circumcision was by the Lord unto Abraham first ordained, The Israelites were from the bondage of the Egyptians delivered. The Law was first given to the Israelits on the Mount by God. The Cloud of Gods Majestie on the children of Israel first rested. The Tabernacle with all his appurtenances was by the Israelites reared. Aaron, and his children executed first their Priest-hood. Fire first from heaven consuming the Israelites sacrifices descended. The Isralites were first solemnely by the Lord himself blessed. The Princes of Israel first publikely unto the Lord offered. Christ Shewed his first miracle in Cana of Galilee: Rose from death: and appeared to his disciples after his Resurrection, shewing them things to come. Saints that slept arose out of their graves, appearing. The Holy Ghost came down upon the Apostles, together praying. The Apostles usually among the people assembled, used Preaching. The people laid up for the poore, as the Lord had prospered them. Saint Iohn being in the Isle Pathmos had a Revelation.
All shdowing that it should be the first and chiefest Holy-day of the new Te∣stament that should be kept holy by all Christians to the Lord, and to his Son Christ. The Jewes kept their Sabbath in remembrance of the worlds Creation. Christians celebrate the Sabbath in remembrance of the worlds Redemption. They as a figure of Grace when they should rest frō servitude of sinne. Wee as a figure of Glory when wee shall rest frō occasions of sinning. They had bodily sacrifices of beasts: we Spirituall Sacrifices of Prayer. Heb. 7. 12. Heb. 10. 8. They the Leviticall Priesthood of the law: we Christian ministerie of the Gospel. They Jewish Temples and Synagogues: we Christian Churches. They Sacraments of Circumcision, Passeover: we of Baptisme, & the Lords Supper. They the Jewes Sabbath so called; we the same into the Lords day changed.Rev. 1. 10. The Heathens called this day Dies Slou, as dedicated tothe Sun: we from the Resurrection call Sunday as dedicated to the Service of God; which said day was constituted by the Apostles (Authour against whom no except on can be taken) and so celebrated by Christians to this day. Concerning the alteration whereof the Prophet Hosea might seeme to speake (when he saith) I will causeHos. 2. 11. the Sabbath and Feasts to cease. Now to keep holy a Sabbath to the Lord is to celebrate an holy rest unto God, not only abstaining from all labour of the body, but also practising all godly Exercises, as Prayer, Hearing the Word, receiving the Sacrament, &c. And to prophane the same, is to labour in servile works of our ordinary callings, to tra∣vell about ordinary businesse, to keepe Fayres and Markets on that day, to use sports and recreations, or any thing else more then things of necessitie. By Prophanation The man that gathered sticks on that day was stoned.Numb. 15. Ezek. 22. Ezek 20. Ezek. 23. Ne. 13. 17, 18. The Priests neglecting GOds service on that day were plagued. The Israelites Prophaning the Sabbath were not suffered to enter into the land of promise, but died in the wildernesse: they were de∣livered into the hands of their enemies being heathen na∣tions, who stoned them, and slew them with their sonnes abd daughters with utter destruction. The person that defileth and worketh on the Sabbath shall be cut off.Exod. 31. 14. Chap. 35. 2.

He commanded that they should kindle no fire on that day, forbade them to gather Manna thereon, willed them on the contrarie to offer double unto him on that day what they did on any other in their sacrifices, oblations. &c. 3. He promised that if they would sanctifie the Sabbath, they should haveLevit. 26. 2, 3, &c. Isai. 56 2. Chap 58. 13.

He promised the Eunuch that sanctified his Sabbath a place, and a name,Isai. 56. 5. even an everlasting name that should not be put out. 5. He promised that person that kept his Sabbath, calling it the pleasant, holy, and glorious Sabbath of the Lord, giving him the honour, not do∣ing after his own imagination, to bring him to his holy hill to make himIsa. 58. 13. &c. joyfull in the house of Prayer, and to accept his offering. Use. 1. Let all Magistrates take Example by godly Nehemia, who protested against those that carried burdens on the Sabbath day: reproving the rulers for suffering wares to be sold on that day, commanding the gates to be shut, and set servants toNehem. 13. see that none should carry burdens on that day; As also protested to lay hands on the Chapmen that stayed all night withiout the wals of the Citie, whereupon they came not again to buy and sell as usually they had done. 2. Seeing God hath promised so many blessing to those that sanctifie the same, let it move us not onely to remember to keep holy the Sabbath day, as God hath commanded, but also to keep it holy, as he hath willed, &c.
Gods Justice Swearers punished. SWearing is not onely when the Name of God is sworne by, but also when in common and ordinary talke men fill up their sentences with needlesse oathes, as to sweare by the Crosse, Masse, &c. Swearing is both Godly, and Ungodly. Godly When men are called by Magistrates to depose the truth; or in a privateExod. 12. 11.

Hos. 4. 2. and that without truth, and this sinne is so great that the Prophet ranks it before lying, killing, adultery and stealing, as the capitall sin of all of them. The man that blasphemed the Name of the Lord was stoned to death.Lev. 24. 16. & 5. 1. Zech. 5. 3, 4, &c. Shall be cut off (saith the Lord,) the curse is gone forth, and it shall enter into the house of him that falsly sweareth, and shall remaine in his house, and shall consume it with the timber and stones thereof. Swearers And they Cause the land to mourne, and every one that dwelleth therein to beHos. 4. 3. Ie. 23. 10, &c. Chap. 5. 7. cut off, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of Heaven: As also they cause the fish to be taken away in the sea, and the pleasant places in the wildernesse to be dryed up. The man That useth much swearing shall be filled with wickednesse, and theIsraelites, Ier. 5. 2, 7. & 8. 14. plague shall never goe from his house, when he shall offend, his fault shall be upon him, and if he sweare in vaine, he shall not beEcclus. 13. 11. found righteous: his house shall be full of plagues.

David. to strengthen our selves against some sinne, or the better to performe some dutie, we binde our Consciences to avoide all occasions that may draw us to the one, and use all good meanes, that may further us to the other. These things are to be considered before Vowing: 1. To vow that which is lawfull. 2. Not to vow that which is contrary to our Vocation. 3. Vowes must be of that which we can doe. 4. They must be farre from so much as a conceit of merit, or worship of God. 5. It must be to Gods glory: and lastly, the event is to be considered, for the Vow being made, it will be in vain to plead before God it was mistaken of thee. Having vowed deferre not to pay it, but be sure to performe it, yet so as they incroach not upon the libertie of Conscience which Christ hath given us, and therefore look how the probable causes thereof do remaine, or are taken away, so accordingly stands our libertie in keeping of a vow. King Saul Vowed That no person should taste of any food till he were avenged of his enemies: Ionathan his son not hearing the vow made, finding hony1 Sam. 14. did aste thereof, for which the Lord was displeased with all Israel. Jewes Vowed That they would set at libertie their servants, they performed not the same, for which the Lord sent among them the Sword, Pestilence,Ier. 34. 11. and Famine. Samson Vowed To performe the vow of a Nazarite: by shewing Delilah where his strength lay, he brake the same, for which he lost his haire, eyes,Numb. 6. 5. Iudg. 16. strength and life.

It being the nst and root of many vices, as we may see by the example of David,2 Sā. 11. & 12.

Ebrietas est blandus Daemon, dulce venenum, & suave peccatum. August. DRunkennesse is a flattering Devil, a sweet poison, and a delightsome sinne, which who so hath in himselfe, hath not himselfe, and he that useth it is not himselfe in the Concrete, but sinfulnesse it selfe in the abstract, being a voluntarie Devil, the common shame of Nature, and the prodigious disgrace of mankinde, staggering in the robes of good-fellowship, shrouding it selfe under the wings of Merriment, being like the man that sleepeth in the middest of sea, and upon thePro. 23. 24, 29. top of a Mast; as also the foolish Marriners which needlesly let in the water to their ship, whereby they are forced to labour hard to pumpe it out again. 1. Drunkennesse is when men drink either in wine or strong drinke beyond measure, so as there followes an intoxication of the powers of the soule: and is a sinne that procures plagues both to body and soule, in that it inflames the bloud with an unnaturall heat, ingenders unnaturall thirst, which ingenders immode∣rate drinking, whence comes Dropsies, Consumptions, and cold diseases with un∣timely deaths: so that many by drinking healths to others leave no health to themselves. 2. Drunkennesse confounds the Memory, duls the understanding, distempers the bodie, defaceth beauty, and hurts the minde: for the spirits of the heart and brain, being the mediate instruments of the soule are by drinking distempered and inflamed, and thereupon riseth wicked imaginations, disordered affections, and and such like; whence also cometh stinke of breath, rednesse of eyes, diminishing
of strength, woes, sorrowes, contentions, wounds without cause, and such like;Prov. 23. 21, 29. Ecclus. 9. 2. &c. Chap. 31. 27. being the fruits thereof. 3. Drunkennesse corrupteth the bloud, drowneth the spirits, beggers the purse, enricheth the Carcase with surfets, turnes bloud into water, bread to drinke, rea∣son to poison, and the very Soule to Froth, by an intollerable iniquitte; Swinish∣ly disanimating the understanding power of the same, and in a word corrupteth the whole world, it being the capitall cause of many and unspeakable diseases, be∣sides of other sinnes, which as handmaides are attendants on it, ad daily experience sheweth. 4. Drunkennesse causeth vomiting and filthinesse, of which the Lord himselfe complaineth by the Prophet Isaiah against the priests and others, and thereby theyIsai. 28. went astray, so that they failed in prophesying, stumbled in Judgement, and be∣came ignorant.

Gods Justice Murther punished. ACtuall Murther is either secret, or open. 1. Secret is in poison, or some cunning device: such was Ahabs, who would1 King. 21. not openly murther Naboth, but yet consents thereunto. Such likewise was Da∣vids, who would not slay Ʋriah with his owne hands, but caused him to be put2 Sam. 11. into the battell that he could not escape. 2.

Open murther is committed when one layes violent hands upon himselfe, and this is noted of most impious persons, as Iudas and Achitophet were, which first were cruell to others, then to themselves. Samson slew himselfe, was he guilty of his owne death? Samson when he saw his misery was dishonourable to God, pulled downe the house on the Phlistines, and dyed himselfe with them, yet can hee not be said properly to kill himselfe, yet it is granted that he dyed, but he purposed not his owne end to himselfe that he might die, but sought to be avenged upon his ene∣mies, which by this meanes he knew vvould come to passe▪ So the ApostlesIudg 16. thought among themselves: If vve preach Christ unto the people, vvee shall dye, yet could not they be said that they killed themselves, when they preached the Gospell, which was the cause of their death. Samson was a figure of Christ, who vanquished more a his death, then in all.Heb. 11. his life: and to cleare him from all suspition, the Authour to the Hebrewes saith, that he did it of faith, numbing him with the Saints. Ionah willed the Marriners to cast him into the sea, was he not guilty of his own death, seeing he consented to what they did.

COvetousnesse is an inordinate desire of any thing, unto which evill the man that is subject unto, is the servant and slave of all other sinnes: For that the covetous person can never be satisfied, but is provoked and enflamed more andProv. 15. 27. more by how much the more he hath, like the man that hath the Dropsie, the more he drinketh, the more he thirsteth: So that although he have, yet he al∣wayes coveteth that which he wanteth, so that the miserable and wretched heart of the covetous man wandereth throughout all the things of this world, and is wearied, but never satisfied; drinketh, but his thirst is not quenched; he esteemeth not those things which he hath, unlesse he possesse in like manner those things which he hath not, and he hath no lesse trouble for things which he compasseth not, then he hath pleasure in the things which he possesseth; neither is his heart more satisfied with gold then the bodie with winde and ayre; This Viper hath divers heads with which it snatcheth at the trash of the world (to wit) fraud, un∣quietnesse, perjuie, bribes, sacriledge, theft, usurie, rapine, and Symonie.

In a word, there is nothing worse then a covetous man, nor a more wicked thing then to love money, for such an one would even sell his soul to get wealth unto him: The Covetous person is An infidell For he loveth not his brother, and he that loveth not his bro∣ther walketh in darknesse, and knoweth not God.1 Ioh. 1.

Gods Justice Usurie punished. VSurie is the Devils Alchimistrie, which turnes silver into gold, and Chymically projects money out of the poores bowels: it is lucre by lending: It is a sin that hath many advocates and patrons: it is (as Aristotle saith) a monstrous thing by the very light of Nature, for money to beget money: and thereupon the hea∣then by the light of reason stiled Usurers, ravenous usurious Vultures, being infa∣mously guiltie of that sinne of which a converted Jew, an honest heathen, or tol∣lerable Turke would be ashamed and remorsefull: being stigmatized by joynt consent of charitable hearts, and strongest current of best Divinitie with a brand of extraordinary bruitfulnesse, hard-heartednesse, and crueltie: in that he is like a fretting Canker with a plausible invisible consumption, wasting day▪ staies, sucksProv. 22. 7. the bloud, eates the lives of many, fils townes and cities with improfitable persons, and the countrey with miseries and inhumanities. Now Usurie is a gain exacted by Covenant above the principall, only in liewEzek. 18. 8. and recompence of the lending, which is quite contrary to Gods Word, and therefore may sitly be called biting Usurie. The Law of England doth permit Usurie to raise two shillings in the pound, therefore Usurie is not unlawfull? It is one thing to permit Usurie, and another to allow thereof, by our positive Lawes is meant, that those men, who cared not how much they exacted out of poore mens hands for the loane of their money, should be limited within certain bounds, lest they should overflow reason. So that the Lawes doe but mitigate the penaltie, which if it were possible would restraine men from it. The Person that Hath given forth upon usurie, and hath taken increase, he shall not live, heEzek. 18. 13. hath done abominably, he shall surely dye. Hath taken usury and increase, and hath greedily gained of his neigh∣bour by extortion, the Lord will smite his hands at his dishonest gaine,Ezek. 22. 12, 13. which he hath made, and will scatter him among the heathen: and he that putteth his money to usury, and taketh reward shall not rest on hePsal. 15. 5. Prov. 8. 8. Chap. 20. 21. holy hill of the Lord. And that increaseth his substance by usurie and unjust gain, he shall gather it for him that shall pittie the poore, and the inheritance that he hath gotten hastily, the end therof shall not be blessed. Iudas By evill gotten goods purchased shame, and a field with the reward of ini∣quitie,Act. 1. 18, &c. who falling headlong burst asunder in the midst, so that all his bowels gushed out. The Lord thy God saith, Thou shalt open thy hand wide to the poore, and shalt lend him suf∣ficientProv. 28. 8. Hab. 1. 6. Deut. 15. 8. &c. for his need in that which he wanteth. If thou lend to any that is poore, thou shalt not be to him an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usurie. Thou shalt not lend upon usurie to thy brother, usurie of money, usu∣rie of victuals, or usurie of any thing whatsoever, unto a strangerDeut. 23. 20, &c. thou maist lend on usurie (meaning that the Israelites might lend to the Canaanites, &c.) whom they might lawfully murther, toExod. 22. 25. those they might lend upon usurie, to murther them therewith by little and little. Christ thy Saviour Commanded to lend freely, looking for nothing againe (that is, forMatth. 5. 42. the use or gaine thereof) to every man that asketh of thee: and of him that taketh away thy goods, aske them not againe, and in soLuk. 6. 84. doing thy reward shall be great. The Remedie of Usurie. To abstaine from Usurie remember the Lords Promise, saying, The man thatEzek. 18. 8.
hath not given upon usury, neither hath taken any increase shall surely live and shall not die. The man that putteth not out his money to Ʋsury, nor taketh rewards against thePsal. 15. 5. innocent, shall rest on the holy hill of God. Use. 1. Seeing thou seest the way to Heaven, learne to follow it. 2. Let godly Magistrates learne to tread the steps of good Nehemiah, who remedi∣edNeh. 5. 1. &c. 10. the oppression of many by usury, and that by causing them to leave off that burden, and by making them to restore the land, vineyards, houses, &c. as also to remit the hundred part of the silver, corne and wine that was exacted by any of the Jewes. 3. For admonition: Let racking, extorting usurers, whose inclosures hath woun∣ded whole villages and friended only two or three with the plaister of their boun∣ties by an Almeshouse, not thinke that a sufficient satisfaction for their wrong. 4. Let all covetous hunger starved Usurers, who sell wheate and eate beanes, who have many in their debt, and yet are most in their owne debt, for not paying their belly and backe a quarter of their dues, learne to make better use of Gods Creatures.

First his mind is estranged from the affection of Christian charity, yea he is rather mooved to that wickednesse by a desire of speaking ill, or else that he may get himselfe praise by the dispraise of a∣nother, which appeareth by that he passeth over all the vertues of his neighbour, reckoning up all his faults, and often times enlarging them.

A Lye is made when we speake the contrary to that we thinke, with an inten∣tion to deceive, wherein there be foure things that confirme it to be a Lye: 1. To avouch and affirme that which is false and untrue. 2. To speake with a double heart, that which is against knowledge. 3. To have a minde to deceive, being forbidden in the ninth Commandement. 4. To speake that which is a false testimonie upon a vanitie of minde without reasonable cause: such is boasting and lattering. There are three kindes of Lyes, which proceed from Covetousnesse, from In∣firmitie, and from Lightnesse for pleasure sake. From Covetousnesse: And they are hainous, because they most hurt our neigh∣bour: and such was Ziba's to David.1 Sam. 16.

Gods Justice Deceit and Guile punished. SUch is the corruption of the Nature of man in this age, that they convert that into Deceit which God gave them for good reason, whereby it falleth out that one deceit bringeth another, and so consequently cousenages are heaped upon cou∣senages. There are two kinds of Deceit or Guile: The one Carnall▪ The other Spirituall: Carnal Is that wherein men defraud one the other by bargaining, selling, changing, and such like; in things promised to be good that are bad,Hos. 12. 7. &c. to be of better value, then found: as also by false weights and mea∣sures forbidden by God; together with all kinde of cunning used con∣traryDeut. 25. 11. Levit. 19. 35. to Gods Word. And 1. Spiri∣tuall Is a double kinde of dealing betweene God and mans owne selfe in the things which concerne the soule, springing from Godly duties, and good actions, which sinne hath many branches, and was found in Paul, saying, Once was I alive without the Law, &c. and in the proud Pha∣riseeRom. 7. 9▪ Gal. 1. 14. Luk. 1. 11. Matth. 9. 1. praying, I thanke God, &c. and in the man whom Christ called righteous in the Gospel. 2. It is to extenuate and lessen sinne: So did King Saul.1 Sam. 13. 11. 3. To place Religion only in outward observances: So doe Papists. 4. Is a wrong reasoning from the Example of Gods Children falling into sinnes: Many will say, Was not David▪ an Adulterer, &c? Why should not I satisfie my lust? It may be as well with me as with them: whereas the Holy Ghost hath set them down, that men repenting might not despaire by their Example, not that men should thereby presume to sinne more freely. 5. It is a misle-interpreting of certain gracious places of Scripture, to wit, that God will spare the Elect: That he will accept the will for the deed; which in∣deed God doth in their beginnings, but hereupon the wicked run on in their grosse Cor. 8. 12. sins and wicked courses, abusing Gods mercies. 6. Is drawn of a false conclusion out of Gods long-suffering, saying, that sen∣tencesPsal. 50. 21. Eccl. 8. 11. against evil works are not executed speedily, therefore Preachers (say they) perswade that God is more severe, then he s indeed. 7▪ Is a hope to satisfie and make amends for many evill courses by a little devo∣tion, or by some shew of Charitie, and this is the conceit of Papistrie. 8. Is to look no further then to the shew of Godlinesse, thinking to be religious enough if they have learned the art of seeming, and can make an outward sem∣blance,2 Tim. 3. 5. of which Saint Paul speaketh.

Ieroboam Erected two calves that the people might follow him. Sent his wife disguised to the Prophet to enquire of him. Iezebel pretending friendship to Gedaliah and others, slew them. Certain Jews Perswaded the people that Paul did preach unlawfull ordi∣nances,Act. 16. Chap. 19. Chap. 23. Gen 29. Chap. 31. 7. &c. as also did lie in wait to have slain him, under pretence of great matters they had to object against him. Laban gave Leah the elder sister for Rachel the younge, as also changed his wages for his service often. The Patriarchs took Iesephs coat, and dipping it in bloud, sent it to their father, affirming that some beast had slain him.Gen. 37.
Certain Princes To take away the life of Daniel made a law that noneDan. 6. should make a petition for certain dayes, but to the king They were by their own law devoured in the lions den. Pharaoh promised to let the Israelites depart, so that Moses would pray forExod. 7. Chap. 8. Exod. 8. him, whereas no such matter was meant by him. Pharaohs for ceters wrought strange things before him, which deluded him. Old Prophet telling a lie to the seduced prophet made him to go with him. The Pharisees asked Christ, if it were lawfull to give tribute to Cesar or not,Matt. 22. 15. thinking thereby to have entangled him.

FIdelity is the closet of the secret of another, which stands in two duties: The one to make conscience of a lye, and to speake the truth, yea such as we thinke it is, and not to speake one thing and thinke another: The other when a man hath made a promise that is lawfull and good, to keepe and performe the same.

Gods Justice Of Pride and Ambition punished. PRide is the beginning and end of all sinnes, because it is not onely a sinne, butEcclus. 10. 7, 12, 13. Pro. 13. 10. & 30. 10. Chap. 11. 2. Psal. 10. 3. Luke 18. that no sinne is, or hath been, or shall be without it: This sinne causeth a man to think he hath a thing, when he hath it not, which cometh of selfe-love: As also it causeth us not to acknowledge from whence we have that we have, making us to glory in the Gift not in the Giver, with the Pharisee. There are two sorts of Pride: The one of Opinion, There are two sorts of Pride: The other of Action. Of the first sort are they, who say not with Moses, Lord, who am I?Exod. 3. 11. But they say in their own Pride, Lord, what am not I? The other sort are they who once being conceited, lash out their riches in excesse of diet, in vanitie of apparell, and such like, and then they will be proud as an Italian, new-fangled with the Spaniard, drunke with the Grecian, gluttonous with the Muscovites, and cruell with the Tartarians. So that often-times in one and the same Creature, we have the English speech, the Spanish fashion, the Italian behaviour, a manly shape, and a beastly life. From these two former kindes of pride there springethIsai. 10. 12. Chap. 16. 6. 1 Ioh. 2. 17. 2 Ki. 20. Prov. 28. 11. Rom. 12. 16. Prov. 10. 7. Psal. 52. 7. Prov. 16. 18. Arrogancie, Pride of life, Pride of gifts, Pride of sinning, which is in high lookes, and indignation of spirit. in glorying in friends, money, &c. to thinke himselfe wise in conceit. in committing of great evils, and that against knowledge, conscience notwithstanding accusing; together with presumption, obstinacie, hypocrisie, boasting, ingratitude, contempt, disobedience and curiositie, which brings a man to finall destruction. The Description of a Proud Man. The ambitious man is bred out of the dust, yet he catcheth at Lordships and Honours, ransacks the citie, forredges the countrey, scoures it through the Church,Adams Serm. but his errand is at Court: He is the Maggot of pride, begot out of corruption, and lookes into an office, as the Ape did when he had got on the robes of a Senatour. Now for his pride that pleaseth no body, because he himselfe is acceptable to no1 Pet. 5. body: He doth not please God, for that he is contrarie to him, for he resisteth the proud: He doth not please the humble, for that they altogether abhorre pride: He pleaseth not proud men, because they cannot abide any greater then them∣selves: His pride onely pleaseth the devill, who is delighted with those that are like himselfe.
Through Pride The Angels were cast out of Heaven: Adam or Paradise Eden.Iude 6. Gen. 3. Ahimelech, Absalom, Adoniah, and Athaliah aspiring were slain. Ashur said, Are not my Princes altogether Kings?

Hagar bearing Ishmael, despised Sarah, being barren. Hezekiah shewed all his treasures to the men of Babylon. Haman was hanged on the gallowes provided for Mordecal. Herod was stricken with wormes, so that he died suddenly. The Israelites said the brickes were fallen, but they would build them of hewen stones: God moved adversaries against them. The women of Israel had their heads made bald, their secret parts discove∣red, their ornaments taken away, in stead of sweet savour they had stinke,Isai. 3. for a girdle a rent.

HUmilitie is an Appeaser of wrath, a Quencher of envie, and a Mother to Peace and sacred Union: And an acknowledging of our selves to be utterly voide of all Goodnesse, like the Publican. Also it is the setling and quieting of the minde, freeing it from perturbations, especially in repressing revengefull affecti∣ons1 Pet. 3. 4. (so as the Apostle saith) a meeke and quiet spirit are joyned together, of which we have a notable Example in Moses, who being provoked, in stead ofNumb. 12. anger shewed Meeknesse. The signe of Meeknesse and Humilitie is willingly to suffer our selves to be taught of our inferiours, and to suffer admonitions, &c. Humilitie is seen three wayes: 1. By lowlinesse of minde, which is when a man is not conceited of himselfe,Iob 37. 24. but retaines a sense of his own unfitnesse and unworthinsse, so did Ioh. 2. By silence from our own praises, whereof Salomon speaketh.Prov. 27. 2. 3. By avoiding jangling, which ariseth out of envie, and contempt of others. The ground or cause of Humilitie is affliction and povertie of spirit, for hardly1 Cor. 4. 21. can he be meeke and patient in spirit that hath not beene acquainted with theIsai. 53. 7. Crosse.Luk. 23. 9.

Love Mercie and Charitie. LOve is a passion of the minde, whereby we are so affected towards any man, as that forgetting our selves we are wholly carried towards him, for that it transformeth the lover into the thing loved, and so joyneth them together, as that the lovers minde may be truly said to be there where his love is. And hence ari∣seth a sympathie and feeling, by which they are mutually affectionated one with an others good or evill. Love seeketh, not her own.1 Cor. 13. 5. Mercie in man is a certaine compassion of anothers miserie in our heart, by which we are compelled to helpe if we can. And it is called Mercie, for that it makes the heart miserable, grieving for anothers evil, according to the Poets saying, Ha ignara mali miseris succurrere disco:Virgil. The troubles of mine own have learned mee, To pitie others that in trouble bee. Through Love, Mercie, and Charitie Abraham entertained three Angels in stead of men, inviting them.Gen. 18.

Obedience. OBedience is two-fold: the one Voluntarie, the other Constrained. Voluntarie: When the Creature doth Gods Command without compul∣sion. This Adam did before his fall, and all holy Ones doe that are justified and sanctified (in part in this life) by the Grace of God assisting them. Constrained: When the Creature is made to obey, will he, nill he, like to Sa∣tans obedience after that Christ had rebuked him: as also rebels obedience, whoMatth. 4. being attached, and arraigned for their treasons, are made to obey in their suffe∣rings. Obedience to man is the keeping of the lawfull Commands of our Superi∣oursCol. 3. 23. 1 Pet. 2. 3. and Rulers, and this is to be done in the Lord.

Ingratitude and Unthankfulnesse. INgratitude is a forgetfulnesse of good received, either from God, or Man; which towards God was first found in Adam and Eve, who being created after Gods own likenesse, shewed themselves ingratefull for the same by eating the forbidden fruit: and so the Example of▪ Adam and Eve are imitated of us, who forget Gods exceeding Love, who spared not his only begotten Son, but gave him even to the shamefull death for our Salvation. Ingratitude of man to man is forgetfulnesse of good turnes received: Such is Childrens towards Parents, Scholars towards their Teachers, &c. This sinne was counted so horrible a thing among the Persians for benefits received, as that such persons as were found to be ingratefull, were not counted worthy to live.

Thankfulnesse Is a gratefull acknowledgement of a kindnesse recieved by remembring of it, by publishing it, and by recompencing it; Now a kindnesse done is the object of Thanks-giving, yet unlesse the kindnsse done be accepted, and withall acknowledged to be a kindnesse, the heart of him to whom kind∣nesse is done will not be affected to give him that did it thanks for it. So2 Sam. 25. David did kindnesse to Nabal. yet he acknowledged it to be no kind∣nesse. Thankfulnesse is to be given to God, and that for that (as St Iames saith) Every good gift is from him: Good things are from God, therefore he is toIam. 1. 17. be praised: Every good thing cometh from him, therefore all praise is due to him.

Of sinfull Anger and Godly. ANger is both sinfull and Godly: Sinfull anger is an inordinate desire to be revenged of him whom we sup∣pose to have wronged us for any cause whatsoever: And is a secret pride concei∣ved in the minde, which hindereth one from doing good to the person with whom he is offended: And is also when it is conceived without sufficient cause, or ex∣ceedethMatth. 2. 21. Ephes. 4. 26. Prov. 10. 11. 1 Sam. 18. 7. 2 Sam. 16. 5. Luke 9. 49. either in the time, or in the measure, whereupon the Holy Ghost admo∣nisheth that the Sunne should not goe down upon our wrath. And lastly, it is when it makes us to forget our dutie towards God and man, and so to fall to brawling. Of this sin there are many branches, to wit, malice, fury, impatiencie, malediction, blasphemie, reproch, revenge, contention, threatnings, cruelties, and often-times muthers. Godly anger i that when a man is angry not upon his own private cause andExod. 16. 20. Chap. 32. 19. Num. 16. 15. 1 Ki. 19. 14. Nehem. 5. 6. Ier. 6. 11. quarrell, but upon his own sinnes, and upon whatsoever hindereth the glory of God: And this anger hath three markes whereby it is known. 1. A right begin∣ning, or motiv. 2. A right Object. 3. A right manner of being angrie, &c. 1. It must be  just and weightie cause that must move us, namely upon an of∣fence to God: Such was the Anger of Elijah, and others. 2. It must become a man, and that upon counsell and deliberation.1 Sam. 20. 32. Prov. 20. 18. Iam. 1. 19. 3. It must be kindled by God, and holy affections, as namely to desire to main∣taine the honour and praise of God by love of vertue, and hatred of vice. A Description of a sinfull angry man.

His teeth are as speares and arrowes piercing. His words are like unto Hammers striking. His bodie, when he is moved, trembleth. His heart within him as fire burneth, and His throat as a Sepulchre gapeth. And thus the image of God being a Microcosmus for beautie, a little world for excellencie, is made a confused image, and ugly: So that there is not found among all creatures living such a monster so deformed as an angrie person.Prov. 17. 12.

Nature hath given weapons to all living Creatures to fight, hoofes to Horses, hornes to Buls, tuskes to Boares, stings to Bees, clawes and beakes to Birds, but man is created to peace, being created unarmed and naked, that he might not have to hurt withall, therefore it is unnaturall by seeking weapons to revenge which are without thee, being by nature denyed unto thee. 5.

The spirit of a man will sustaine his infirmitie, but a wounded spirit who can beare? The discretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to passe over a transgression. Murmuring. MUrmuring is between secret backbiting, and open railing, a smothered ma∣lice, which can neither be utterly concealed, nor dare be openly vented, and is a repining, whereby we doe complaine of the providence of God, either that he doth too much oppresse, or else that he dealeth more mildly with others then with us, and this proceedeth from infidelitie, and is perceived to be in man, when he is more grieved for the want of such and such like things, then thankfull for that the Lord hath given him; and freed him from such and such like troubles that others are fallen into: or else when God hath given him sufficient to live upon, wherewith he is not content, though others want the same.

Consider the generall providence of God in creating all things, and in pre∣serving all things: for if we beleeve the Lord made all things of nothing, shall we not beleeve he will preserve them? Doe we beleeve that God made all men, and shall we stand in feare of men? 2. To beleeve that God preserveth all as well as he created them, yea the small Sparrow doth not fall upon the earth without his providence, yea, and his care is greater over the beasts of the field, much more will he provide for man, for whom all things are made. 3. Consider the Lord hath made nothing in vaine, he hath made all things for his glory, he hath made our bodies, he will then provide for them, seeing the Creation of them is more wonderfull then the preservation. The Lord hath care of the wicked, more of the Godly.Psal. 29. 4. Adde unto the former a patient minde, by which we must be content with whatsoever God sendeth, acknowledging Godlinesse to be great riches, and so to commit every thing to Gods protection, waiting on him; The which that we may doe the Lord grant. Amen. Doe all things without murmuring, (saith the Apostle.)Phil. . 14. Wisd. 1. 11. For murmuring is unprofitable, (saith the Wise man.) Infidelitie and Incredulitie. INfidelitie is the sinne wherein every man is conceived, and the seed thereof remaineth still in the children of God, whereby men do not beleeve often-times that which the Lord promiseth to bring to passe; as also causeth men to feare authoritie of the Creature, more then the glorious Majestie of the eternall God: which proceedeth from this, that men consider not of God as he extendeth his providence over all things, and as he is a mightie Judge, taking revenge upon all sinne and wickednesse. This sinne taketh hold of a man chiefly in time of some danger, afflictions, temptations, sicknesses, and often at the time of death. In a word, this sinne is the cause of all sinne, in that it maketh the wicked not to beleeve, but in part; and see but in a glasse, in that although they consent gene∣rally to the truth, yet when they come to particulars, they reason thus with them∣selves: How can that e? By what meanes possible should this be? by reason whereof the Lord suffereth them to miscarry, and punisheth them in their own affections.
The fruits of Infidelitie are impatiencie, such was in Ieremiah; tempting ofIer. 20. 4. Matth 4. 7. 1 Cor. 10. 9. Gen. . Psal. 116. 11. 1 Thes. 4. 13. &c.

It is the only instrument, and excellent gift of God to man, where∣with he doth receive all the Divine Graces, the gifts of the Spirit, all whatsoever good, Christ, or whatsoever blessednesse he hath wrought for us, for our Salva∣tion. Doth Faith only justifie? Faith only justifieth before God: we are saved by Grace through Faith, not through works, saith the Apostle, lest any man should boast himselfe: Workes justifie before man (so saith Saint Iames) shew me thy faith by thy works, &c. for Faith without works is dead. Faith is like a Rock, the gates of Hell shall not prevaile against it: the mysterie whereof is strange to carnall reason, dark to the work, Learning cannot reach it; Wisdome is offended at it, Nature is astonished at it, the devils do not know it, men do persecute it, few only attain it. As there is no way for life so easie, so is there none so hard: easie to whom it is given from above, hard to carnall sense not yet inspired. Hope is a patient expectation of Gods presence, and an affiance in all thingsPsal. 37. 5, 7. Prov. 16. 3. whatsoever art for to come. Faith and Hope how differing. 1. Faith is a spirituall Prudence: Hope is a spirituall Fortitude: Faith resteth in the Understanding: Hope resteth in the will: Yet cannot they be separated,Exod. 37. 9. the one having respect to the other, as the two Cherubims of the Mercie seat which could not be covered. 2. They differ in respect of their office, that is, of their working: Faith tels what is to be done, it teacheth, prescribeth, and directeth, and is a Knowledge. Hope stirrth up the minde, that it may be strong, bold, and couragious, and is an Expectation. They differ as touching the Object, that is the Matter whereon they look. Faith Hath for her Object the Truth, teaching us to cleave thereunto surely, looking upon the Word and Promise of things promised. Hope Hath for her object, the Goodness of God, looking upon the things promi∣sed in the word, that is upō such matters as Faith teacheth to be hoped for. 4. They differ in Order. Faith is the beginning of life before all Tribulation.Heb. 11. 17. Rom. 5. 5. Hope cometh afterwards proceeding from Tribulation. They differ in diversitie of working. Faith Is a Teacher and a Judge, sightinig against rours and heresies, JudgingMartin Luther on Galat. spirits and doctrines.

Secundum Dictum, Nascitur ex studiis praetoritis Somnium. What man desires in the day, he dreames in the night. 2. Spirituall Have been such as have been knowne, either of the party, or of some other, who have had the true interpretation thereof, such was Iacobs, Pharaohs, &c. 3.

Of Angels and their Apparitions. ANgels are called Spirits, and Angels: By the word Spirit their Essence andHeb. 1. 7. Nature is signified, to shew that they are incorporeall substances. By their name Angel, their office is noted out, which is as much to say a Messenger, or an Ambassadour in English. For their Essence, they are true both subsistances and substances, yet such kind of substances as are not corporeall, but incorporeall. For their Creation it was in time, they were not from Eternitie. For their Apparitions it is so that they doe truly come unto us, when they are sent of God to that end, which thing we may plainly see by divers examples in the Word of God: as that they appeared unto Abraham in true bodies, but fromGen. 18. whence they doe take those bodies, and what becommeth of them, when they do lay them aside, seeing that the Scriptures do deliver no certaintie of it, we are not to enquire. Now the Lord useth both good and evill Angels to doe his will.Heb. 11. 14. Psal. 34. 7. Psal. 11. 21. 2 King. 1. Matth. 18. 10. 2 Sam. 24. 1 Chron.  . 6. 12. 1 King. 22. 1 Cor. 4. 4. Luke 12. 2. Ide 6. Good Angels Are imployed to be as a Guard and Garrison to the Elect of Man∣kinde, and that for their Comfort, Defence, and Protection at all times: And are such as behold the face of God in Heaven. Evill Angels Are imployed for the triall and exercising of the Godly, and for the seducing and tormenting of the wicked and ungodly: And are such as are reserved in everlasting Chaines.
Use. 1. Hence we may learne to acknowledge how great the favour of God is towards us, who hath created so divine Servants for our sakes, placing them in office to rule, govern, and keep us. 2. We may learn to love God, because he is so gracious unto us that he will have the Angels to serve for our good and welfare. 3. We may learn to feare God, because he hath Angels to punish. 4. To blush to commit wickednesse, because that the Angels do behold and ob∣serve our actions done here on earth by us. To fortifie our selves in Faith in all adversitie, because the Angels are alwayes present to help us, remembring the comfortable words of Elisha to his servant,2 King. 6. 16. saying, They that are with us, are more then they that are against us.

Abound in love towards his people, and towards his brethren. Approve himselfe the Minister of God by Patience and affliction. Be a Barnabas the son of Consolation, to divulge Gods mercies to the broken hearted. Be a Boanerges, the son of thunder to denounce Gods judgements to the ob∣stinate. Behave himself holily, justly, &c. binding up the broken-hearted. Blesse the people in the Name of the Lord, being assembled. Blow the Trumpet, to lift up his voice like a Trumpet aloud. Bring forth out of his Treasurie things both new and old. Care for the flock not by constraint, but of a readie minde willingly. Cherish the people as a Nurce doth her children continually. Comfort all that mourn, to give them beautie for ashes, oile of joy for mourning, and garments of gladnesse for heavinesse. Deale not only the Gospel, but his soule for the people. Divide the word aright; and to doe the work of an Apostle. Declare the decrees of the Lord, fulfilling the ministrie taken on him. Drop the word of the Lord, and his Doctrine as the rain.

Preach The preaching that God commandeth: The Gospel of Jesus Christ, Good tidings to the poore, Libertie to the Captives, the opening of the prison to them that are bound, the acceptable yeere of the Lord, the kingdome of God, the word of the Lord; Peace by Jesus Christ, the day of vengeance, the Lords message, the words of this life, the words that God puts into his mouth, not his own words. Preach the words of Exhortation, to edifying, repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, testifying unto the people that Christ is Judge of quick and dead, together with all that God hath commanded; teaching precept upon precept, line unto line, here a little and there a little, and that not with inticing speech of mans wisdome, but in plain evi∣dence of the Spirit of the Lord, without giving Titles to any, that is, flat∣tering

Dumb Ministers who cannot preach the Word of God, let them heare the Apostle: Darknesse and Damnation is for them prepared.2 Pet. 2. 3, 1. 2. Able Ministers who make themselves dumb, being able to preach, yet doe not preach: such the Scribes and Pharisees shall at the last condemne, who taught diligently, and kept Moses his chaire warme, compassing sea and land (Satans walk) to make a Proselyte: these sit still and frieze in zeale, and by their dull and wilfull neglect lose Proselytes. The Master of the vineyard also when he comes shall find thē loytering in the publikeMatth. 23. 15. Chap. 20. 6. market place, & shall shake them by the shoulder with a Quid statis otiosi? 3. The Temporizer who measures his Sermons by his Lords humour and his Ladies, and therefore dares not speake Against Oppression, Because it is the fault of his Lord. Against Pride, Because it is the fault of his Ladie. Against Riot, Becaust it is the fault of his Young Master. Against Drunkennesse and Swearing, Because it is the fault of his Lords Followers. Against Drunkennesse and Swearing, Because it is the fault of his And young masters Companions. So that whiles he is their servile Chaplain he must learn Turkey-work to make thrumbe Cushions of flattery for their elbowes: Thus he serves three masters, his Lord, himselfe, and the devil.

The Titles and Dutie of Magistrates. MAgistrates are the eye of the Common-weale, and therefore there ought to be in them both Learning and Vertue for executing of the Law, to take ven∣geance of the wicked, and to defend the upright: in that their office is not only holy and lawfull before God, but also the most holy, and honourable degree in all the life of man: most holy, in that God hath made them an Image of himselfe, set his stampe upon them, and given them his own Name, to speak for him, to rule for him, to defend for him, and to punish for him, And that they are most honou∣rable, is also proved by divers other Titles, wherewith the Scriptures do set them forth, as also by the Example of holy men, who have born civill power among the Israelites, and that in good Orer, which is the mother and preserver of things.

So that he fitteth his temptations to every ones inclination: If he see one in∣clined unto Covetousnesse, he will offer him Naboths vineyard: If unto vain∣glorie, he will make him to thirst after the life of Mordecai: and if to ambition, he will stirre up meanes for him to drive out David of his Kingdome. Note. The power that the Devill hath whereby he thus prevailes against man is from God, therefore of it selfe good: but the tempting and Gods power abused is from the Devill, who converteth that which was good from God into evil. And thus the Lord permitted him The L. permitted Satan To tempt Eve in Paradise: and Christ in the wildernesse.Gen. 3. Matt. 4. 1 Chron. 21. 2 King. 22. 1 Sam. 16. Iob 1. Matt. 16. Zech. 3. 1.

The L. permitted Satan To enter into Saul, Gods Spirit being departed from him. The L. permitted Satan To afflict Iob in body, and to slay all his children. The L. permitted Satan To perswade Peter to rebuke Christ, speaking of his Passion. The L. permitted Satan To stand before the Angel of God at his right hand. The L. permitted Satan To goe into the swine, by reason whereof they ran headlong, &c. The L. permitted Satan To have a seat in Pergamus, and to prevaile often with the just.

Of Tyrants and their Tyrannie. TYrannie is a thing base and inhumane, and therefore by the Latines called feritas, because it maketh us to forget all humane Mercie and Compassion, and causeth us to delight in bloud and murther, not respecting the weaknesse or un∣worthinesse of the enemie, nor yet the equitie of the cause. Tyrants are of two sorts: The one in Title. Tyrants are of two sorts: The other in Action. In Title, that without lawfull Title usurpeth the government of any place. In Action, that having lawfull principalitie behaveth himselfe cruelly. Crueltie of Tyrants are likewise of two sorts: The one fiercenesse in afflicting of punishment upon cause. The other a certain madnesse with delight in crueltie without cause. Causes of crueltie are three: Covetousnesse, Violence, Ambition, naturally ingraf∣ted in the will of Tyrants wanting reason, in that they often against reason, as also common equitie and honestie, execute their Tyrannie (their will being only a law) according to the old common proverbe: Stat proratione votuntas. Tyrannically and cruelly Adoni-bezk cut off seventy kings thumbs & great toes of their feet & hands.Iudg. 1. Iudg. 9. 2 King. 11. Mat. 2. Exod. 1. 1 King. 21. Ier. 41.

Of Feasts and Feastings. THe name of a Feast importeth the living, conversing, and familiaritie of one man with another, for that men are not made like wilde Savages to eate their morsels apart, but in civill manner to repast with others: for that Feasting is the Mother and Nurce of Amitle, the Salve and Repairer of continued Love, and theExod. 5. 1. Chap. 10. 9. Rev. 3. Luke 14. 8. Ioh. 2. Isai. 25. 6. signe of never intermitted friendship: To which purpose our Saviour speaketh, promising to come in and sup with us, assuring us that all displeasures are forgot∣ten, and all offences forgiven. And to shew the honour of Feastings, Christ shew∣eth it by a Parable: as also at a Feast did his first miracle in Canaan, turning wa∣ter into wine: and the Lord himselfe is said to make a Feast unto all people of dainis and pleasant things. Again, Feastings are not amisse, so that they be used in remembrance of Gods benefits, for maintainance of mutuall friendships, and for reliefe of poore diseased persons; only we ought to take heed that we use not cuious diet, but mirth at meales in stead of delicates, because Sine arte mensa & plus salis quàm sumptus: Great Feasts are not without dangers, they serve not to suffice nature, but to nou∣rish corruption. Observable it is, that Ioseph kept Christ twelve yeeres, but at a Feast lost him, but found him again in the Temple. Iobs sonnes were banquet∣tingLuke 2. 44. when the house fell on them, Io said they had sinned. Let us therefore take heed especially of these three feastings: To feast in Rioting and drunkennesse, that is to feast with the World. To feast in Chambering & wantonnesse, that is to feast with the Flesh.Rom. 13. 13. To feast in Strife and envyings, that is to feast with the Devill.

There are two sorts of death: The one Corporall. There are two sorts of death: The other Eternall. Corporall death Is the separation of the soul from the bodie, with all the evils Gen. 9. 13. Eccl. 12. 7. Deut. 28. 15. that attend thereon, to wit, sorrowes, griefes, sicknesses, diseases, and such like. Spirituall death Is the finall separation of the whole man in Hell for ever, from2 Thes. 1. 19. 2 Tim. 2. 26. Ephes. 2. 2. Heb. 10. 27. Isai. 33. 14. Gods favourable presence and fellowship, together with present bondage under Satans hellish horrours, and such like fore-runners of damnation. There are three other kinds of death defined, to wit, Death In Sinne: Such are they that are Reprobates.Rom. 8. 6. Exod. 22. 12. Rom. 8. 13. Death For Sinne: Such are they that are Malefactours. Death To Sinne: Such are they that are Gods elected Ones. There are three Heraulds or Messengers going before Death: 1. Casualtie, which tels every one of a Doubtfull End. 2. Sicknesses, which tels every one of a Painfull End. 3. Old age, which tels every one of a Certain End. Constitutum est omnibus semel mori. Heb. 9. 27. It is appointed unto all men once to die. Heb. 9. 27. What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul fromPsal. 89. 48. the hand of the grave? Selah.

Pilgrimage not knowne: the dissolution of every one: of the dead a companion: the beginning of Eter∣nitie, and the end of those that die. And is compared unto an Archer making Man his But, or Mrk, who when he shooteth, striketh in this manner following: In shooting over us, he strikes our Ancestours. In shooting behinde us, he strikes our Servants. In shooting on our right hand, he strikes our Wives and Children. In shooting on our left hand, he strikes our Friends. In shooting in the middest, he strikes our Our selves. So that no one can escape him, for as St Paul saith, Constitutum est omnibus semel mori: It is appointed unto all men that they shall once die: Omnibus semel, pleris{que} is: toHeb. 9. 7.

Now as Iob saith, Mans time is appointed, his months determined, and his dayes numbred, yea, and (as Christ saith) his very last hour is limited: He was made of the mould of the earth, he shall return again to the earth; And as all have one entrance▪ into life, the like going out shall they have to death: Nothing we brought in, no∣thing shall we carry out.
A Change then shall come, which of the wicked is to be feared.Eccl. 7. 2. the Godly is to be desired. all people is to be expected. For Vita citò avolat, nec potest retineri. Mors quotidiè ingruit, nec potest resisti. Life fleeth away speedily, and cannot be retained.Psal. 89. 48. Death cometh on hastily, and cannot be resisted. Better (saith Salomon) is the day of Death, then of Birth: and yet The Athest dares not die for fear nō esse, to be no more remembred. Usurer dares not die for fear malè esse, that he shall be damned. and dares not die for fear An sit, an non sit, an damnatu sit. Doubtfull dares not die for fear Whether he shall be, or not be, or be condemned, or saved. conscience dares not die for fear The Faithfull only dares die, because of his Election he is assured. Comforts against Death. THe Remembrance of Death (saith the Wise man) is bitter to a man that see∣kethEcclus. 41. rest and comfort in his substance, unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath prosperitie in every thing. It is bitter to the Infidell, that looks for no life after this, and to them that never tasted of the Crosse, as also to them that are strong and lustie in bodie, but sweet unto the contrary, acceptable and good unto the needie, to them whose strength faileth, that is in his last age, that is full of cares, and without Hope and Patience. The parting with the world, the pang of death, the horrour of the grave, and consideration of Judgement maketh death to seeme formidable to many an one. Against all these arme thy selfe with this: 1. That death freeth the Godly from the tyranme of Satan, from sin, the world, the flesh, and ternall damnation, placing them with Christ in Heaven.Phil. 1. 2. 2. Christ by his death sanctified unto us both Death and the Grave. 3. The Consolations of Gods Spirit to the Soul, surmount the dolours of death. 4. The dsire of the beholding of God should make us willing to lay down our lives, and with Paul to dere to be dissolved.Phil. 1. 1 Corinth. 2 Cor. 5. 5. In stead of earthly bodies we shall be clothed with unspeakable glorie, and have an habitation not made with hands, but eternall in the Heavens. 6. The sting of death, namel, sinne is then fully taken away so that it can no more hurt us. 7. That neither death, or any thing else, is able to separate the Godly from Christ in whom they are elected.Rom. 8. 8. We should not so much think of the feare of death, as to take an exact account of our life, for that that man canot die ill, who hath lived well; but seldome dieth well, that lieth evill. Then live well, and dye never: Dye well, and live ever. 9. Remember them that have been before thee, and that shall come after thee, that this is the judgement of the Lord over all flesh to taste of death.Ecclus. 41. 3. After which Bona opera sequuntur bonos to crowne them. Mala opera persequuntur malos to torment them. The dreadfull death of the wicked.

Beter to the Godly is the day of death, then the day of birth: Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their labour. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, for the trump shall blow, and the dead shall be raised, and shall beare the voice of the Son of God, and they shall live, and be saved▪ But as there is great difference1 Cor. 15. 5. 52. Iob. 5. 5. betwixt the death of the godly and of the wicked, so shall there be in their Re∣surrection in three respects, to wit, in their Cause, Manner, and End of rising.
In their Causes, the wicked riseth by Gods citation, the Godly by Christs union.Dan. 12. 2, 3. 2 Cor. 5. 10. In their Manner, the wicked riseth with sorrow, the Godly with joy. In their End, the wicked riseth unto shame, the Godly unto glorie. Reade 1 Thes. 4. 16, 17. Revel. 20. 6. Isai. 57. 1, . The Resurrection of the Godly and ungodly.
