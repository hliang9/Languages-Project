A SATYR. HIS Holiness has Three Grand Friends On Great Britain shore, That prosecute his (and their own) ends, A D. a Judge, and a Whore. The D. is as true as Steel To the Pope, that Infallible Elf; Therefore no Friend to the Common Weal, Nor no Friend unto himself. The Judge is a Butchers Son, Yet hates to shed innocent Blood, But for Ten thousand pound has done The Pope a great deal of good. He that Villain Wakeman clear'd, Who was to have Poyson'd the King, As it most plainly appear'd; For which he deserves to swing. Portsmouth, that Pocky-Bitch, A Damn'd Papistical-Drab, An ugly deformed Witch, Eaten up with the Mange and Scab. This French Hag's Pocky Bumb So powerful is of late; Although it's both Blind and Dumb, It Rules both Church and State.
