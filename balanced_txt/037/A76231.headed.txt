TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL, And my much honoured Christian Friend, TOBIAS FRERE Esquire, Justice of Peace in Norfolk, and now a Member of the High and Honourable Court of PARLIAMENT. R. B. Wisheth all Grace, Health, and Happinesse in this life, and eternal Bles∣sednesse in the life to come. Right Worshipfull, MAN, who is called of the Phylosopher , or the little world, being an Epitome or Map of the great Universe, although he be of the most beautiful form, and fairest shape, excelling all other living creatures upon earth; being styled of Hermes or Mercurius, A great miracle, a creature like the Creator. Of Pythagoras, , The measure of all things. Of Plato, , The wonder of wonders. Of
Theophrastus, , The pat∣tern of the whole Universe. Finally, that Ancient Zoroaster, having long admired the singular workmanship shining in the frame of man, at length cryed out; , O man, the glory of nature, even in her chiefest ruffe and pride, and her Master-piece, when she durst contend with heaven it self. The Divines call him Omnem creaturam, because he is in power (in a manner) all things; not for mat∣ter and substance, but by participation or re∣ception of the several species or kindes of things. Others call him the royal temple, but I am sure he is the image of God. For as in coine, the picture of Caesar, so in man the Image of God is apparently discerned. The Kingly Prophet David full of heavenly in∣spiration, Psal. 8. desciphereth the dignity of man on this manner; Thou hast made him little lower then the Angels, Thou hast crowned him with Glory and Honour, and given him Dominion over the works of thy hands. Plato saith, (and Aristotle from him) that in the soule of man are three especial fa∣culties. 1. The first he calleth , The vegetative faculty, which of others is called Virtus naturalis, the natural vertue of increa∣sing; and the seat of this in man, he saith to
be the liver; the properties whereof are to nourish, and to beget, &c. 2. The second he calleth , The sensitive faculty, whose seat (he saith) is in the heart; and to which he ascribeth the vital vertue, and the motions of the sensitive ap∣petite. 3. The third he calleth  the reasonable faculty, whose seat (saith Galenus) is the head; and whose operations are to imagine, to remember, to understand, to judge, and to guide all voluntary motions. In the reasonable soule, is a lively resem∣blance of the ineffable Trinity, represented by the two principal faculties, the under∣standing, and the will; with the intellective memory. But alas, who can describe the es∣sence of the soule? Hippocrates calleth it, , The inaspectable or invisible nature, which can no more be described by us; then our eye is able to see it self. For could the soul be discerned with the eye, or conceived by the mind, how would it ravish us, and lead us into an excessive love of it selfe. This only is indivisible, and immaterial, this alone is incorporeal, immortal, , or immutable; and may be called the receptacle, promptuary, or storehouse of all the species or kinds of things, being a crea∣ted
substance, and wholly in every particu∣lar part of man. These are excellent com∣mendations, which man hath partly from his soule, the most excellent of all forms; and partly from his body, which is, as it were, the measure and exemplary pattern of all corpo∣real things; Also he is rightly indued with goodly gifts of nature, so that by him are wrought and invented marvellous things. And as the natural influences of the high lights (moveable and fixed in the firma∣ment) be known unto mankind; even so be the vertues of every creature here in earth: as Beasts, Foul, Fish, Serpents, Trees, Plants, Fruits, Flowers, Herbs, Grasse, Gumme, Stone, and Mettal: There is nothing so se∣cret, hidden within the Minerals of the earth, or lurking so low under the flouds of the Sea, but by means and policy they are brought to use. Their Names, Qualities, and Natures, are known unto mankind; To this end, that he should serve his Creator in righteousnesse and holinesse all the dayes of his life, for these his gifts: Although, I say, man was thus gloriously created by the wise God of Nature, at the first, good and health∣ful; God communicating to him wisdom, and holinesse; and all the perfections of other creatures being summed up in him; and the rule, and dominion of all the works of God
delivered up into his hands; Though he were thus happy in his first estate, and should have continued so for ever, if he had conti∣nued in obedience: Yet by disobedience, eating the forbidden fruit (tempted thereun∣to by the old Serpent who envied his happi∣nesse) he brought a ruine upon both worlds; upon the great world calamities, &c. upon the little world, diseases and death. So that the whole life of man is full of misery, and there be more wayes of death, then there be means to preserve our life: for as the Poet saith, Mille modis lethi miseros mors una fatigat. Though there be but one way for all men to come into the world, yet there are a thou∣sand wayes for every man to go out. And so we find, some have perished with sudden death, as Ananias and Saphira; Some with gluttony, as Domitius Afer; others with drunkennesse, as Attila King of the Hunnes; others by waters, as Marcus Marcellus; Some with hunger, as Cleanthes; others with thirst, as Thales Milesius; some were stifled with smoak, as Catulus; others died with a fall, as Nestorius; others with overwatchings, as M. Attilius; some with poyson, as Phocion; others choked with flies, as Pope Adrian; And Anacreon with a kernel of a Raisin;
others torne in pieces by wild beasts, as He∣raclius, Lucan, and Acteon by dogges; Hy∣politus, by wild horses; Licus the Emperour by Lyons; Ancaeus King of Samos, by Bores; and Hatto Bishop of Mentz, by Rats; And so some with joy, as Chylo the Lacedemonian; And Diagoras the Rhodian; who seeing his three sons crowned Champions in one day, he rejoyced so much, that he died for joy in the same place, more die with griefe; Quia spiritus tristis exiccat ossa; because a broken spirit drieth the bones; But most men die with sicknesses and diseases, Feavers, Fluxes, Gouts, Dropsies, Plagues, and 1000. more, they being so many, that neither Galenus nor Hippocrates, Bosq. de fi∣nibus bno rm dr inal pag. 31. & 32. nor all the best Physicians in the world can number them, saith Bosquierus; the generations of men here on earth, being as Homer saith, . Like unto the leaves of the tree, whereof some do perish, and others spring in their places: They spring, they flourish, they waxe old, and soon wither away; Et tum quoque cum crescimus, vita decrescit, and our life then decreaseth, as our years increase. Ut rosa manè viget, & serò vespere languet, Sic modo qui fuimus cras levis umbra sumus. That is, in the Prophets phrase, we
bring our yeares to an end, as a tale that is told. So that for all the excellent commen∣dations, and singular vertues given to man, yet he doth decay, die, and return unto the dust, and become as though he had never been; Although he be never so honourable, yea, or poor, death doth make equality be∣tween them. Every mans course is appoin∣ted, they cannot prolong their time: not∣withstanding God hath ordained sundry means, by his ministers to help mankinde in time of sicknesse, to ease their paines, and heal their diseases; And I being a child of the common-wealth, am bound unto my Mother, that is, the Land in which I am borne, to pleasure it with any good gift, that it hath pleased God to bestow upon me: Not to this end, to instruct the lear∣ned, but to help young and greene Stu∣dents in Physick and Chyrurgery; That they may resort to this Enchiridion medi∣cum, which I do dedicate unto your Wor∣ship, as an argument of my good zeale and love that I beare unto you: Which bold attempt of mine, I hope your wis∣dome will pardon; for I do plainly con∣fesse, that I have not thought this Book of mine worthy to be perused by you, as well because of mine owne unabilty
to performe any thing that your Wor∣ship may like of, as also in respect of those manifold Graces wherewith the Lord hath filled you: by the vertue of which you could in a tongue farre more eloquent then this, discerne and know the secrets of Physick. Yet neverthe∣lesse, when I consider with my selfe that it was not the affectation of any popu∣lar praise, but an honest zeale to bene∣fit my countrey-men, which begat in me this desire to publish this Work, as likewise an earnest willingnesse which I have alwayes had to commend some piece of service unto your Worship: I say, these causes meeting together, did especially induce me with such a bold confidence, as it were, to rush into your presence, and to demand, without any shew of me∣rit, your Worships most favourable Pro∣tection, that this Book of mine (unable of it selfe) may runne under your Pa∣tronage. The Lord God (who hath made you a notable instrument to work the advancement of his glory, the fur∣therance and propagation of piety and good learning by your example) lengthen and protract your life beyond your fatal period, and give you a will to live, a
desire still to bear up that burthen, which the Countrey hath laid upon your shoul∣ders; and with these, all good successe in this world, and sempiternall happinesse in his most glorious Kingdom. Your Worships most humble Servant, ROBERT BAYFIELD. From my study in Norwich, Decemb. 11. 1654.
TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, I Have for thy benefit collected out of sundry Ancient and Modern Authors, as it were a breviary or Abridgement of Physick, and to∣gether with those deductions, I have enterlaced many experiments of mine own, which by continual use and practice, I have ob∣served to be true. But I may seem to some over∣bold in setting forth this book, when as the works of so Honourable and Learned men, who have laboured in this kind, are so learnedly penned, and highly esteemed. In truth I must, and do most willingly confess, that neither in learning or experience, I am to be compared with the least of them; nay unfit to carry their books after them: yet notwithstanding, because many industrious Students want an estate to purchase such Au∣thors, their several prizes amounting to so much, and also considering the great utility of an Epitomy of Physick, whose matter is mani∣fold, and use general; and that no English Au∣thour (I am sure in this volume) as yet extant,
hath the Definitions, Causes, Signes, and Cures of so many diseases, amounting to the number of one hundred and fifty, besides all those particular diseases that are handled disperstly in this book, I have thought it good therefore, I say, to epito∣mize, and contract the learned works of the lear∣nedest and best Authours in England now ex∣tant with us, into a portable Enchiridion. Now what profit this my book will bring to young Stu∣dents, and such as thirst after knowledge, I leave to the event: If none, I hope Godwill esteem my labours, Non ex eventu, sed ex affectu, not ac∣cording to what it did, but according to what I desire it should do. I know it will passe under the censure and judgement of divers sorts of men; some are ignorant and cannot judge; Et ideo grave judicium est ignorantis, and the igno∣ranter man, the severer Iudge. Others are too rash, and are ready to censure it before they read it, or at least do read by starts, and judge by par∣cels, and so must needs be partial in their judge∣ment. Others are malicious, maligning, and de∣praving other mens labours; and I know many about this City that can hear all, but can speak well of none, being full fraughted with jeeres, and can so well dispute and craftily reason, that they will easily make Candida de nigris, & de candentibus atra. But to such I say, as one lately did to the like, Cum tua non edas, carpis mea carmina Leli:
Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua. Sloth sits and censures what the industrious teach, Foxes dispraise the grapes they cannot reach. Therefore I intreat thee who ever readest this Work, that thou wouldest give thy mind, as well to pardon failings, as to know the truth. If thou meetest with any faults escaped, either through forgetfulnesse or non-understanding; I desire thee either with thy pen to correct them, or in courtesie to conceal them; Remembring that the first editions of young Writers may have some faults: If my endeavours want strength, thou canst not in equity deny me pardon, seeing thou thy self mayest run upon the same Rocks in other difficulties: for, Nemo sine crimine vivit. Now Courteous Reader, expecting thy favourable acceptation of these my labours, which expectation of mine, if it be not de∣luded, I shall be further encouraged to con∣secrate the residue of my studies to thy com∣modity. Thine ever to his power, ROBERT BAYFIELD.

ENCHIRIDION MEDICUM: Containing The Causes, Signes, and Cures of all those Diseases, that do chiefly affect the Body of MAN, &c. CHAP. I. LIB. I. APOPLEXIA is a disease that, . in the strength of it, is mortal, and admits no cure but by Di∣vines: but in a small Apoplexie there may be some small hope, and the cure is not altoge∣ther impossible. The cause is a dull, slow, grosse, flegme, Causa. filling the ventricles of the brain, and the Ar∣teries of the Rete mirabile, that the spirits cannot passe from the heart, into the ventricles of the brain, which is called by Hippocr: Hippocrates . The Metropolis or chief seat of cold and glutinous moystures. The signe is, Signa. when there is a sharp pain in the head: brightnesse before the eyes: the veins in the neck swell: and a gnawing of the teeth while they sleep: their urine is little in quan∣tity,
black like rust, and canker in mettal, and a residence like Meale, they lack sense altoge∣ther, they lye as they were asleep with their eyes shut, and do snort. A strong Apoplexie is, when the breathing is so diminished, that it can hardly be perceived; and that is almost evill, when the breath is stopped for a while, and then fetched out with great violence. Hippocrates saith, Hippocrates it is impossible to cure a ve∣hement Apoplexie, and not easie to cure a weak one, for it threatneth speedy death; be∣sides, if it chance by medicines to be taken away, for the most part it leaves a palsie behind it, either in the whole body, or in some part thereof: but if it be a weak one, it may perhaps be cured, as experience hath proved in some. If you perceive plenitude, Curatio. Venae-sectio open a veine, but not without the counsel of other Physitians, for it either kills or delivers, if they do joyn in it, open the Cephalica vein, and then this clyster following. ℞. Clyster. Betonicae, Salviae, hyssopi, centaurii, Aristo∣lochiae, florum stoecados, arab-Mercurialis. ana. M.j. florum camomelae. Anisi, ana. M. ss.

Then without any further expectation, to di∣gest the matter (for if it be not looked unto the same day, the patient dieth) we give these
pills following: or if the patient be so stupid, that he cannot swallow them, they may be dissolved in a sufficient quantity of Sage-water, and so give it him in the form of a potion. ℞. Pilularum Cochiarum, Pilul. foetidarum, Pilulae. ana ʒ.ss. Pil. aurearum, ℈.j. misce cum syrupo de Stoecade. f. pil. No. 5. Then it is good to apply cupping glasses on the calfes of the legges, Cucurbitu∣lae. and afterwards below the buttocks, and ascending upwards till we come to the shoulders, let his drink be oximel compos. If he cannot swallow syrups, put into his mouth a dram or two of the best Methri∣date, for it is very profitable in this disease: Methrida∣tum. both before and after evacuations, keep his body loose, and he may drink of the palsie drink, which you shall find in the following Chapter; Lastly ℞. Succini albi ℥.ss. pulp. elect. diarrhod. Pulvis. abba∣tis ʒ.ij. radic. poeniae ʒ.i.ss. fiat pulvis, de quo capiat ʒ.j. in aqua conveniene ante no∣vi-lunium. River. Riverius. CHAP. II. PARALYSIS, is a deprivation of sense, . and motion, but not of the whole body, as hapneth in the Apoplexie, but one side; or all the parts of the body, are infected; besides the head: as the jaw, the tongue, the eye, the foot, the hand, the arm, and sometimes the lip: The cause are gross, and clammy humours, Causa. stopping the sinews, & hindring the animal fa∣culty,
that it cannot come, from the fountain to the members. For the cure; Curatio. if you see cause, open a veine of the sound side, and draw blood by degrees, because that nature may thereby send the mat∣ter from the part that is hurt, Venae sectio to the part that is sound: after bleeding, or if perhaps the pati∣ent have not bled, yet neverthelesse frictions and rubbings must be used on the sound part, whereby the matter is diverted, and also light rubbings and frictions to the part affected, whereby natural heat may be stirred up, then purge with such things that purge the flegm, as these Pils following. ℞. Pilulae. Pilularum de hiera Simpl. ℈.ij. Agarici troch. ʒ.ss. misce. cum syrupo de stoecade, & fiant pil. 5. which must be given to the patient at mid∣night, or if you see cause, you may make a po∣tion that purgeth flegm. The next is to drink often of the syrup of oximel, and take a tent and dip it in mustard, and put it into the nostril, is very good: and to drink of this decoction fol∣lowing is excellent. ℞. Decoctio. Glyzyrhyzae. ℥.ij. Rorismarini, Salviae, Hys∣sopi, Betonicae, Stoecados. an. M.j. Bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, & fiat decoctio. Also Methridate, Methrida∣tum. Sternuta∣mentum.

VERTIGO, is a disease, . wherein the pati∣ent doth imagine, that his head and all other things, doth turn round, and the brain is so affected, that the eyes grow dark and dim, that if the patient be not stayed up, he falleth to the ground. The cause, is, either of the brain, Causae. being distem∣pered, and evill-affected, or of the mouth of the stomack offending the brain. The brain it self is evill-affected, when as a grosse and tough humour is contained in it, from whence a vapo∣rous and windy spirit, being resolved by weak heat, is moved inordinately about the brain. The mouth of the stomack doth affect the brain, when through corrupt homours, being gathered abundantly in it, vaporous and win∣dy exhalations are carried up to the brain, and so turn about the animal spirits contained in it. For the cure, the first intention is, Curatio. to open a vein, drawing away a little blood at a time, Venae sectio if nothing forbid it: then to purge with a dosse of head-pills, as. Pilularum cochiarum, ʒ.j. f. pill. 7. Pilulae. when the body is well purged, take this ster∣nutament following, as much as will lye upon a half-peny piece at a time, in a morning fa∣sting; snuffe it up into your nostrils, many have been perfectly cured with this Receipt onely.

Also, foeniculi dulcis, beaten to fine powder, and taken in the pap of an apple in a morning fasting, and to drink oximel, is good. If there be inflammation, the opening decoction is very profitable, Vomitus. but if the cause come from the sto∣mack, then it must be cured by vomiting, and stomack pills; Lastly, this electuary following is very good to strengthen the head and sto∣mach. ℞. Electuari∣um. Hollerius. Specierum aromatici rosati, triasantali an. ʒ.ss. sacchari rosati q. s. cum syr. rosato. fiat elect. CHAP. IV. PHRENITIS, . is a disease wherein the mind is hurt onely, and differs from mad∣ness, which is called in Greek or Latin, Melan∣cholia aut Mania, for that a fever is joyned with the phrensie, and therefore the phrensie may be called a continual madnesse and fury, joyned with a sharp fever. The cause, Cause. Galenus. as Galen saith, is an inflamma∣tion of the braine, or filmes thereof; some Phy∣sicians are of opinion, that this disease pro∣ceedes from a hot impostume of the braine, and that it is in vain to undertake the cure; and the reason is, because it is confirmed in a principal member; wherefore the intention of the Physician must be, to hinder that it may
not happen, for having once taken a man, it is in vain to enterprise any cure: yet I will shew you a way, under God, to prevent it: but first I will let you to know, when the patient is incli∣ned to a phrensie. The signes of a phrensie to come, Signa. are the signes of a present Paraphrenisis, as continual head-ache, rednesse of the face, over-much heat, rednesse of the eyes, with too much ap∣pearance of their veines, staring, thirst, dri∣nesse of the tongue, unquietnesse, different from wonted actions, and some Alienation of mind, whether these things happen, by the force of some acute fever, or some other cause; by these you shall judge Paraphrenisis, and a fear of a phrensie to come. For the cure, Curatio. first consider whether there be fulnesse of the body or no; if there be, we may open the vein which is common, or the vena nigra, of the right arme, Venae. secti and draw out five ounces of bloud, let this be done in the morn∣ing, and in the afternoon, administer this cly∣ster following. ℞. Malvae, violarum, Mercurialis, an. M. j. Clyster. Bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, usque ad consumptionem medietatis. strain it, and adde olei violati ℥.iij. Cassiae Nov. ext. ℥.ss. Sacchar. Rub. ℥.ij. As much salt as will lye on a six-pence: and this is to be considered, that the oyle of Violets is most requisite in the phrensie, because the pa∣tient is subject to watchfulness, and Violets do procure sleepe, but in sleepy diseases it must be avoyded, as in Subeth, Lethurgies, Subeth. and
such like: the next day following, we may open the Cephalica veine in the right arm, and draw forth the quantity of four ounces of blood; which done, about four of the clock in the after∣noon, let him take the foresaid clyster, make him barly water, Victus ra∣tio. nip the juice of Lemonds into his beer: ale of chirmd-milk is good, but no strong beer: the next day, which is the third day, if the disease groweth worse, the hemero∣dial vein must be opened, out of which must be drawne three ounces of blood; and if the di∣sease do still remain, then we are to doubt of an Impostume ingendred, wherefore we must be bold to open the vena Recta of the fore-head, and to draw the quantity of three ounces of blood, for by this blood-letting, all evill affects of the head, for the most part are removed; then to procure sleep, take this Julep that fol∣loweth. ℞. Julepus. Syrupi de papavere, err. & aquae lactucae, ana. ℥.ij. If all this will not serve, commend the sick to God, and so much of the phrensie. . Peripneumonia si supervenerit phrenitis, malum. Hippocrat. lib. 7. Aphor. 12. CHAP. V. EPILEPSIA, . or the Falling-sicknesse, doth shew it self as a convulsion of all the parts of the body, but not perpetually: and it doth bring with it hurt of mind, and sense.
There are three differences in this disease, for ei∣ther it happeneth when the brain is affected by it self, which is, when the original spring∣eth from thence, or else it springeth through the consent of the stomack, being evil-affected, from whence vapours arise to the brain: or else through the consent of some other subject part, from whence venemous vapours do arise, and do creep into the brain by hidden passages: for some say that they do feel the cause of the evil, from that part of the body, from whence it springeth, as it was a vapour, or cold ayr, carried into the brain, by the continuity of the parts. The cause for the most part, Causa. happeneth from the abundance of a melancholy and fleg∣matick humour, from whence venemous, cor∣rupt, and virulent vapours do arise, from which happen obstructions in the Meatus, and pas∣sage of the brain. As soon as this evill taketh them, Signa. the sick falleth down, and they are plucked up toge∣ther, they snort, and sometime they cry out, many do tremble, and turn round about, but the peculiar sign is foming at the mouth. For an infant take green pionie roots, Curatio. slice them length-ways, and cut them so as they may be made fit to hang about the childs neck, like a bracelet, then make this Ecligma following: ℞. Cranii humani, pulveris paeoniae, mellis opt. misce. omnes, quant. suf. fiat Ecligma. Ecligma. Oximel is also very profitable, anointing the neck behind with oyle of dil, and exetor, Oleism. onely advise a diet for the nurse, of meats of good juice, Victus ra∣tio. (if the child be not weaned) her diet must be hot
and drie, that thereby her milk may be the hot∣ter, and thinner. For those that are elder in years, if you perceive they be of a plethorick body, Venae-sectio a vein may be opened: and withall, once a week the humours offending, may be avoy∣ded by purgations, and first this clyster. ℞. Clyster. Rad. paeoniae, ℥.j. Centaurii, absynthii. salviae, betonicae. ana. M. ss. Sem. anisi, pulp.

Bolus. Cranii humani, ʒ.i.ss. pulver is paeoniae, ʒ.ss. Methridati opt. ʒ.ij. fiat bolus. Afterwards if you see cause, you may purge with this potion. ℞. Potio pur∣gans.

Bayrus, cap. 17.
CHAP. VI. LETHARGƲS is a disease, . which doth provoke the patient to sleep without resi∣stance, and it bringeth with it, forgetfulness, and for the most part deprivation of all the senses, the reason is, because not only the hinder part of the head is affected, and therefore principally the memory is hurt, but also the forepart of the head, by which the patient doth not perfectly feel this disease, that hath a great affinity with Caros and Subeth, Caros. Subeth. but onely differs in that Caros is void of a fever; but indeed a more profound necessity of sleeping, possesse him; for being pricked, he is scarce stirred, Caros or dead sleep is scarce discerned from the Apoplexie, yet ne∣verthelesse in this it doth differ, that he that is affected with Caros, doth breathe freely and ea∣sily, but the contrary doth happen in the Apo∣plexie, yet the cure is all one, to the lethargie, and performed alike, they that have the lethar∣gy, will answer to a question, if much compelled. It is caused of abundance of flegme, Causa. which cooleth and moisteneth the brain, and thereby provoketh sleep, the flegme putrifieth the brain, and thereby causeth a fever, which is al∣wayes annexed with this disease. Their pulse is watery, great, Signa. and striketh seldom, they are continually sluggish, and slee∣py, they will sometime open their eyes, if you cry aloud to them, and shut them forthwith; they gape and gaspe often, sometime they keep
their mouth open still, as though they had for∣got to shut it. Curatio. For the cure, first administer this clyster following. ℞. Clyster. Radicis lilii alb. ℥.j. Rutae, salviae, maioranae, Malvae, ana, M. j. florum Roris-Cam. Meli∣loti. Centaurei. Minor. Betonicae, an. M. ss.

Afterwards if blood do abound, Venae-sectio you may open the Cephalica vein, then after that it will be very necessary to purge, with these pills fol∣lowing. ℞. Pilae.

If the patient cannot swallow them, then dis∣solve them in ℥.iij. of aq. betoniae, mellis Rosati, ℥.j. and give the patient to drink: for the faculty sensitive is so stupified, that the patient doth scarce taste the bitternesse: then it would be ve∣ry profitable, Cucurbit∣lae. to apply cupping glasses to the shoulders, and keep accustomed evacuations if they be retained, such as are the hemroydes, menstrues, &c. and a tent of strong mustard put up into the nostrils, Sternuta∣mentum. and to provoke sternu∣tation is good: and lastly, take mustard-seed bruised, Mixtura. and mixe it with honey, vinegar, and methridate, rubbe and anoynt the tongue, and pallate of the mouth; Gargaris∣mus.

CHAP. VII. SPASMOS in Greek, Convulsio in Latin, . is a disease, in which the sinews are drawn, and plucked up against our will. There be of it three kindes of differences. The first is called in Latin distensio; it is, Distensio. when the neck remaineth altogether immoveable, and cannot be turned away, but must be holden right forth. The se∣cond is called Tensio ad anteriora, Tensio ad anteriora. in this disease the head, and neck, be drawne down to the brest. The third is called Tensio ad posteriora, Tensio ad posteriora. in this disease the head is drawn down back∣ward to the shoulders, which is most dangerous. The cause of this disease, Hippocrates, Causa. Hippocrates appoin∣teth but onely two, that is, fulnesse and empti∣nesse of the sinewes in the body, sometimes it cometh with the biting, or stinging of some venemous beasts. If the cramp take one that is whole, or by and by, as soon as the disease com∣eth, or not long after, then this disease is caused of fulnes; but when the convulsion cometh after, in any sweats, vomits, watchings, or drinesse, or purging, then it cometh of emptinesse. The diet of them that have this disease, coming of ful∣nesse, must be hot and drie: but where it is cau∣sed of emptinesse, their diet must be moyst soopings, and fat broaths: If this disease be of fulnesse, first administer this clyster following. Curatio. ℞. Radicum Liliorum alborum. ℥.j. fol. salviae, Clyster. Betonicae, ana. ʒiij. florum cardui benedicti. Camomeli, Mercurialis, Centauri-minor.

Then if you perceive he hath a very foul body, and full of blood, Venae-sectio it were very fit to open a vein, and also if flegme bear a share, and windinesse in this disease, of fulnesse, then purge with this following potion, but first prepare the humour with oximel, over night. ℞. Potio pur∣gans. Diaphaenicon ʒ.ij. pul. Sanct. benedict. ana ʒ.ss. oximel. q. s. fiat potio. Then it were fitting the convulsed parts were rubbed, and chafed with warm linnen cloathes, and then anointed with oyle of Rew, and castoreum, O'cum ca∣storei. or oyle of dil, and exetor, and hypericon, which you will; and after they be well anointed, bind them up with Wolves or Foxes skins, if you can get them: let them be bound up warm, Sternuta∣mentum. and straight; also use the ster∣nutation, and with the oyls aforesaid, anoint the hole of the neck. There is one thing more that is excellent in this cause, Infusio me. thridatum. and that is the infusi∣on of castoreum, and a dram of methridate, ad∣ministred in oximel fasting in a morning: if you see cause, you may give it at twice. If this di∣sease happeneth by the biting or stinging of a venemous beast; Medica∣mentum. then bruise scabious, to which mixe a little treakle, with the yelk of an egge, and so apply it upon the affected part; if this di∣sease chanceth through emptinesse, it is such an evil, Victus ratio. as that it is almost incurable: their cure is moyst soopings, and fat broaths of mutton, gel∣lies
made of chickins, also soft frictions with oyles, and their whole cure must alwayes be like the cure of hecticks; now after he hath soopings, and after he hath had frictions as aforesaid, then take this Electuary fol∣lowing: ℞.

℥.ij. Weckerus lib. 2. pag. 407. De cu∣ratione convulsionis. CHAP. VIII. CEPHALALGIA. . Galenus. Galen saith, there are three paines in the head, and they are sundry. The first is Cephalalgia as aforesaid, that is, when the paine is new and tolerable. The second is Cephalaea, which is an old inveterate head-ache, stubborn, and confirmed. The third is, Hemicrania, and doth occupy the half part of the head. The cause of Cephalaea, Causa.  is abundance of blood and other humours, or by the sharpnesse of hu∣mours and vapours, contained within or with∣out the scull, and inflaming the head. The signe is, Signa. exceeding pain, continuing long, and hard to cease, upon which light oc∣casion, have very sharp and great fits followed, so that the patient can neither abide noyse, loud speech, nor clear light, drinking of wine, nor sa∣vors, that fill the brain, but desireth for the greatnesse of the pain, to sit or lie quiet in the dark, supposing that his head were strucken with a hammer. The cause of Hemicrania, Causa. . is by the ascending, or flowing of many vapours, either hot or cold, either by the veines, or arteries, or by both. It is a painful evill, Signa. remaining in the one halfe of the head, either in the right half, or in the left of the head; to be short, the cures of the paines in the head, are according to the diver∣sity
of causes. But first I will shew you from whence it proceedeth, whether from heat, cold, moysture, or drinesse, &c. The signe of head-ache, Signa. caused of heat of the, Sun, is when a body tarry long in it, ha∣ving vehement pain, you shall feel their head hot, as soon as you touch it, and their skin is drier than it was wont to be; their eyes do look red, and are delighted with the sprinkling, and anointing of cold things. The signe of head-ache caused of cold, Signa. out∣ward, as when the ayre is very cold, especially when one tarry in it a long time bare headed, or by applying suddenly any cold thing to the head: the pain is vehement, yet the head when it is felt on, is not hot, and the face and eyes do not look red, nor their face is not drie, and shrunk, as that which is caused of outward heat, but contrariwise, full, and pale, their eyes are swollen, and swarth, and they feel ease by hot things. The signes of head-ache caused of drinesse, Signa. are: there come few excrements, or none at all out of the nose; If the eyes be hollow, and the patient, that is pained, hath watched much be∣fore, and the skin of the head is drier, then it is a certain sign, that it comes of driness. The signe of head-ache caused of moysture, Signa. is meant either by moystening medicines, or by the moyst ayre, by bathes, or the like: There is much filth coming out of the nose, the eyes puf∣fed up, and swelled, and the patient sleepeth much, while you judge of it, be sure you mark, whether it be hot and moyst, or cold
and moyst, do cause the paine. The signe of head-ache caused of blood, Signa. is: when the veines swell, the face and eyes be red: the veines commonly, when blood do much abound, may be seen even to the smallest; the the pulse is great and vehement, the urine red∣dish, and thick: the veines of the temples do beat; and the pain is heavinesse. The signs of head-ache caused of choller, Signa. are: the pain is like the head-ache caused through heat of the Sun, but their pain is more sharp, and pricking, their head is moderately hot, their face is pale and wan, but the peculiar signe is bitterness of the mouth, and driness of the nose, eyes, and tongue. The signes of head-ache caused of flegme, Signa. are: there be fulness and heaviness of the head, and whiteness and moystness of the face; more∣over, the sick will easily fall asleep, he is slow, his sences are dull, and he aboundeth with moysture or excrements in his head, this head∣ache is apt to breed some ill infirmity, if not looked to in time. The signs of head-ache caused of windiness, Signa. are: there be felt distension, and streaching in the head, without heaviness and beating, and if there be sound and noyse in the eares, then it betokeneth windiness. The signe of head-ache caused through the default of the stomack: Signa. it may be knowne through the biting and gnawing pain they feel; moreover in this kind of head-ache, if the sick, fast and suffer hunger long, the pain is the more vehement, for through long abstenence,
the Mallice of the humour increaseth. The signe of head-ache caused by fevers, Signa. is evident enough, and the signe is all one to that of blood, and choller. Now I will go for∣ward to the cures of these head-aches, one by one. The cure of Cephalaea, Curatio. Venae sectio is first to open the Ce∣phalica vein, on the same side, if strength will suffer it, and anoint the head with oyle, or ointment, of a cooling quality; and this cool∣ing clyster following, is very proper in this head-ache. ℞. Malvae, violarum, Mercurialis, an. M.j. Clyster. Bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, usque ad consumptionem medietatis: colatura, adde butyri quantit. ovi, sactharum Rub. ℥. j. sa∣lis communis ʒ.ij. fiat Enema. Administer it about four of the clock in the af∣ternoon, and give cooling things. The cure of Hemicrania. Curatio. if it proceed of a hot cause, cure it as you do Cephalaea, and abundance of humours, onely purge twice in two dayes, with the aforesaid clyster. If it come of a cold cause, purge strongly with this Recipe fol∣lowing. ℞. Pilularum foetidarum pil. cochiarum. an. ʒ. ss. Pilulae. fiat pil. 5. Anointing the head with oyles, that have pow∣er to heat, and dissolve, for although here be many things which be excellent, for head∣aches, yet nevertheless, we have seen pain of the head and teeth proceeding of a cold cause, with one only purgation, hath been removed, and so a hot cause with one only blood-letting.
The cure of head-ache, Curatio. Oleum. caused through heat of the Sun. Take oyle of Roses, and a little vi∣negar being added to it, it will pierce the faster, and deeper, and also besprinkle Rose-water on the forepart of the head, where the seam goeth overwhart; for it is the thinnest part of the scull, stupefactive things are to be avoyded, such as juyce of Poppies, Night-shade, or of Mandrake. The cure of head-ache, Curatio. caused by outward cold, is to anoint the forepart of the head with with oyle of Rue, or the like, and if plethorick, and somewhat costive, Olumrutae Clyster. Curatio. Oleum. you may give a sharp clyster, that you think proper. The cure for the head-ache caused of drines: you may anoint the forepart of the head with oyle of sweet almonds, or with oyle of violets, and cammomel, mixed together; it is also good to drop some of these oyles into the nostrils. The cure for the head-ache caused of moy∣sture, Curatio. Oleum. is to anoint the head with oyle of Rue, Cammomel, or Euforbium, or oyle of Ireos; this must be done: if the cause be cold with moy∣sture, (as you may in part judge by the water) then use such things as are hot and drie, if the cause be cold and moyst: and use such things as are cold and drie, if the cause be hot and moyst. In this Chapter are remedies enough of all sorts. The cure for the head-ache caused of blood, is first to open the Cephalica veine, Curatio. Venae-sectio on that side the grief is on; eschew strong beer, wine, hot∣waters, and spices; but take all cooling things; if much blood doth still abound, you may open the vein in the forehead, and it were fitting a
cooling clyster were administred, Clyster. such a one as you shall think fit. The cure for head-ache caused of choller, Curatio. Purgatio. must be begun with purging of the chollerick humour straightway, because choller is thin, and moveable, and will easily be purged out: for digestion is nothing else, but an alteration of the humour causing the disease, therefore such me∣dicines must be used each morning fasting, be∣fore you do purge, untill good concoction ap∣pear in the urine; for by this means choller being concoct, & as it were tamed, & made mild, be∣comes so obedient unto nature, that it will soon, without any grief be drawn out by purging, therefore for a preparative, use this or the like medicine, syrup of violets, or syrup of popies, which of them you will ℥. j. Iulepus. Syrup of water-lillies, ℥.ss. distilled waters of Indive, Succory, and Roses, of either ℥.j: mixe them, and let them drink of it in the morning fasting, or you may give the decoction of saene,, and then you may purge with pil. aurae, make six or seven: Pilulae. also anoint the forepart of the head with oyle of lillies, and popies. If choller in the stomach do disturb the head, vomit with Stibium, Oleum, Vomitus. the infu∣sion thereof, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14. according as you shall see cause, sometimes nine dragmes is sufficient. The cure of head-ache caused of flegme, Curatio. is first to extenuate, and make it thin, fit for pur∣ging, with oximel, and Syr. de stoecade, when that is done, take this ℞. following. ℞. Pilularum. cochiarum, Pilulae. pilulae hiero cum a∣garico, ana ʒ. ss. Sem. paeonia. no. ʒ. Syr.
de stoecadae. q. s. fiat. pil. 7. But remember that you provoke vomit with Asaron, Asaron. if their body be loose: and if choller be the cause, as aforesaid, vomit not with Sti∣bium, untill the body be loose; either naturally or artificially. If the head-ache be inveterate, and abundance of flegme, purge twice in four dayes with the aforesaid pills, Sternuta∣mentum. sternutation is al∣so good. The cure for head-ache caused of windiness, Curatio. Oleum. is to anoint the head with oyle of Cammo∣mel, but the best, is oyle of Nutmegs, Mace, Rue, and such things as have power to discuss windinesse: neesing is also very good, and a cly∣ster made with Aniseeds, Clyster. Fennel-seeds, Carra∣way-seeds, and Commin-seeds, boyle these (of each alike, with one large handful of Bettonie) in a quart of water to a pinte, straine it, and ad. Benedict. lax. ℥. ss. diaphenicon. ʒ. ij. this is for a lusty body. The cure for head-ache caused through de∣fault of the stomach, Curatio. Vomitus. is to vomit, and if any hu∣mour fire the tunicles of the stomach, purge with Hierapicra, Hierapic. which is a soveraign thing. The cure for head-ache caused by fevers, Curatio. Venae-sectio is forthwith to bleed, if nothing prohibit it: eschew all hot things, and take all cooling things, a∣nointing the head with oyle of Roses, and juice of popies. Lastly, a cooling clyster will be wondrous proper, such a one as you shall think fit: and to procure rest, bathe the temples of the head with a little of this liniment, fol∣lowing. Linimen∣tum. ℞.

Signa. with moy∣sture, & sometimes by a cold & drie distempera∣ture; If coldnes with moisture be the cause, then the party is very drowsie and sleepy, and much moisture is avoided at the nose. If it be caused of a cold & dry distemperature, the patient is watch∣full, and yeeldeth forth little or no moysture. Curatio. Oleum. Gordonius. For the cure, if it be caused of a cold and moyst distemperature. Gordonius, adviseth to use oyle of Castoreum, and of Euphorbium; also to give for certain dayes together, Confectio ex ana cardis ʒ. ij. with the decoction of smallege, and fennel rootes, and it is sufficient to mixe one dragm: with a little quantity of Methridate, Methrida∣tum. or Treakle, and to take every morning a spoon∣full of syr. of stoecados, doth profit much; oyle of cinamon is good to anoynt the head, Ol.

CHAP. X. MELANCHOLIA, is a delirium, or doltishnesse, . which springeth from a me∣lancholick humour, without a fever, which doth so perturbe the seate of the minde, that the speech and actions are altogether void of Reason. The cause sometime is of the common vice of melancholy blood, Causae. being in all the veines of the whole body, which also hurteth the braine: but sometimes only the blood which is in the brain is altered, and the blood in all the rest of the body is unhurt, and that chanceth two wayes, for either it is derived from other pla∣ces, and ascendeth up thither, or else it is ingen∣dred in the brain it self: and sometime it is in∣gendred through inflammation, and evill affect about the stomack and sides, & therefore there be three diversities of Melancholy, according to the three kindes of causes. The signes are, Signa. fearfulnesse, sadnesse, hatred, and also they which be Melancholius, have strange imaginations: for some think them∣selves bruit beasts, and do counterfeit their voice, and noise. Some think themselves ves∣sels of earth, or earthen pots, and therefore they withdraw themselves from them, that they meet, lest they should knock together, moreover they desire death, and do very often determine to kill themselves, and some fear that they should be killed, many of them
do alwayes laugh, and weep; some think them∣selves inspired with the holy Ghost, and do pro∣phesie upon things to come: but these be the peculiar signes of them that have melancholi∣ousnes, caused through the consent of the whole body; for in them the state of the body is slen∣der, black, rough, and altogether Melancholius, caused naturally, or through certain thoughts, watchings, or eating of wicked meats, through hemroyds, or suppression of Menstruis: but they which have Melancholia, caused through evill affect of the stomach, and sides, they have raw∣nesse, and much windinesse, sharp belkings, burnings, and grieviousnesse of the sides: also the sides are plucked upwards, and many times are troubled with inflammation, especially about the beginning of the disease, also there is costivenesse of the womb, little sleep, troubled with naughty dreams, swimming of the head, and sound in the ears. For the cure, if it be caused of adusted blood, Curatio. first administer a clyster, afterwards open a vein, with this caution, Venae-sectio that if good blood shews forth, close up the vein, but if the blood shall appear grosse, black, and turbulent; then we draw away according as we shall see cause, a sufficient quantity, but first administer this cly∣ster following. ℞. Epithymi, thimi, florum. Stoecados, violariae, Clyster. Mercurialis, fol. Malvae, an. M.j. bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, ad lib. j. cola∣turae, adde cassiae novit. extract. ℥.i. ss. olei violati ℥.iij. saccar. Rub. ℥.i.ss. salis com. ʒ.i. vitelli ovi. N. j. fiat Enema:
Or else administer such a potion, as you shall think proper: then to digest the matter, we give this syrup following. ℞. Syr. de pomis. simpl. ℥.i. Syr. violati ℥.ss. aqua. Mixtura. bugloss. violarum, boraginis, ana ℥.j. misce. Let his meats, Vietus ra∣tio. be meats of good juice, which are hot and moyst, but more moystning than heating, and musick, with what delights you can, but let his diet be slender. If it be caused of adusted melancholy; Purgatio. first purge with pills, or potion, which purge melan∣choly, afterwards, if you see that blood abound, open a vein with the former caution, but howe∣ver open the hemroyd veines with leeches, and use a concoctive syrrup, and anoint the temples of the head, and pulse of the hands, and soles of the feet, with this oyntment, made as fol∣loweth. ℞. Linimen∣tum. Vnguen∣tum. Olei nenupharis, ung. popui. ℥.ss. misce. pro∣linimento. Or else you may take ung. populeneum ℥.iv. dis∣solve opium ℥.ss. if you see cause, drop in Ol. nu∣cis muscat. gr. iij. into a little of the oyntment aforesaid, also Landanum paracel. 3 or 4 grains, or more according as you shall see cause. And syrrup of poppies ℥.ij. mixt with ℥.iv. of the wa∣ter thereof, Iulepus. is good: let him ride or walk by pla∣ces pleasant, sayling on waters, and such things to delight in. If the disease proceedeth from the stomach and sides, Vomitus. either vomit or purge, which you shall judge to be most proper and fitting: remember to keep accustomed evacuation,
which you do with this decoction. ℞. Myrobal. Indarum, Stoecados Arabici, Decoct. Epithymi. Mesue.

MANIA AƲT INSANIA FƲ∣ROR, that is, madnesse, . they that have this disease be woode and unruly like beasts, it differeth from this frensie, that because this di∣sease comes without a fever. The cause is much blood, Causa. flowing up to the brain, & yet the blood is temperate, sometime it happeneth through a sharp chollerick humour, and sometime melancholy and choller do so prevail, that they are forced to be bound in their beds some are of opinion, that sometimes a spirit troubleth this kind of evil, which say they, is known by discoursing with him, after the fit. For the cure: if it be caused of blood, Curatio. Venae-sectio you must begin with blood-letting, and in women cut the inward vein in the anckle, anointing the head with unguents or oyles that be cold and moyst, to procure sleep. And purge if you see cause
with a cooling clyster. Vomitus. If it be caused of choller, purge or vomit with such things as purge chol∣ler, if the fits be violent and strong, take this powder following. Pulvit. ℞. Take Brimstone, Gun∣powder, Hypericon, Mugwort, Vervine, pow∣der of peony roots; of each a like quantity in powder; mixe them altogether, cast a little on coles, and hold his head over it. CHAP. XII. CATALEPSIS, . or conglation, is a certain sudden detension; both of the mind, and of the body, with the which whoso∣ever is taken, doth retain the same figure of the parts of the body, which he had when he was taken, whether he were sitting or lying; from whence it is called of some, Stupor vigilans,, be∣cause the sick is become sencelesse, and altoge∣ther without motion. This disease doth agree with the Apoplexy, in this, that, as in the Apo∣plexy; so in this disease, the patient doth lose both sence and motion; but herein it differeth, because here the spirits themselves are affected, and congealed, and do remain as it were still, and quiet, and in whatsoever part of the body they are taken, the parts do remain cold, stiffe, and hard, but contrary in the Apoplexy. The eyes of those that are Apoplectick, are closed up. The cause of this disease, Causa. is an exceeding cold, and drie distemper of the brain, by which it happeneth; as well the brain, as the animal spi∣rits,
to be both congealed and dried: this disease if it be not speedily cured, it killeth the pa∣tient. For the cure of this most grievous evil, Curatio. we must administer those things that do mode∣rately heat, and moysten, and first a clyster, which you shall find to be excellent; it is made as followeth. ℞. Floru. camomeli, meliloti, ana. M.ij. Clyster. Mercu∣rialis, M.i.ss. salviae, Thimi, pulegii, Epithy∣mi, ana. M.j. polypodii quer. senae alex. an. ʒ. 5.

Afterwards we use great clamors and noyse, with painful bindings and rubbings of the ex∣tream parts, the better to excite and stirre up the sick: Sternuta∣mentum. Venae sectio for that purpose we administer also sneesings. If this disease proceed from abun∣dance of blood, open a vein, then afterwards use such oyntments and oyles, as resolve; such as be. Ol. Anethi, ol. camomeli, & ol. liliorum; ana ℥.i.ss. coquantur in iis, cum hyssopi, thimi, Ʋnguen∣tum. postea ad∣datur, colatura, castorei. ℈i.ss. fiat ung. s.

Concerning which, if any one desire to be further satisfied, Zacutus. Lusitanus.

ANGINA: is an Inflamation of the la∣rinx, or weasand, and of the rest of the parts of the throat, which doth hinder both breathing, and swallowing: this disease is very dangerous, if not looked to in time, because he can hardly draw breath, nor receive nou∣rishment. The cause for the most part is of blood, Causa. flow∣ing from the jugular veines, in which there is great store, or else from a bilous, or cholerick blood; Angina notha. or else from some defluxion of a cold humour, and then it is called Angina notha, or bastard squinsie. For the signes, Signa. if it proceed of blood, there is a full pulse, and great difficulty of swallowing,
and breathing, rednesse in the tongue, and face, with a troublesome fever: if it proceed of a chol∣lerick blood, then there is a very sharp and acute fever, with intolerable burnings, and with bitternesse of the mouth, if it proceed from a cold humour, then there is much moysture, little or no fever, the pain is lesse, and the tumor more lax: We must at the first open a vein under the tongue, because there is need of present help, Curati. Venae-sectio but if it hath gone past three dayes, do not open a vein without the concurrance of some other learned man, give all cooling things, and make a Gargarisme with strawbury leaves, Gargaris∣mas. wood∣bind, and fivefinger, of each alike, boyle them in fair water, and in the latter end of the boy∣ling put in a little Allum, and honey, gargarise the throat often. To cure the squinsie caused of a cold hu∣mour, as flegme, take Sturcus canis album, bea∣ten to fine powder, and drink it in this garga∣risme, Calamenthae fiat decoctio, dissolve allom with oximel, or let the foresaid powder be blown into the throat through a quill. Also to gargarise with thin mustard, is good: and administer a clyster. But above all, if the body be bound, give such a quantity of jallap, Jalapium. in oxi∣mel, as you shall think proper, which I have found by experience to be excellent good, and some have been perfectly cured therewith. Also this Ecligma following is good. ℞. Piperis ʒ.ss. croci myrrhae ana scrup. j. mell. Ecligma. despumati lb. ss. misce ad modum lohoc. Rondeleti∣us. cui adde stercoris canic ossa rodentis. ʒ.ij.

PLƲRITIS, . the plurisie, is an inward inflammation, or apostumation of the up∣per skin, girding the ribs, or sides within. The cause is an abundance of hot blood, Causa. flowing unnaturally to that part, and this is pluritis vera, it taketh its name from the part af∣fected, called plura. The signe, Signa. is difficulty of breathing, a cough, a continual fever, vehement and pricking pain, with a high and hard pulse. For the cure, Curatio.

CHAP. XV. PERIP NEƲMONIA is a hot im∣postume, or Inflammation of the lungs, . Causa. with a sharp fever: for the most part it is caused of strong and hot Rheumes, and distillations, falling upon the lungs. The sign is great difficulty of breathing, Signa. ful∣nes, and streaching out of the brest, without pain, but if the skins, which be joyned all the length of the brest be inflamate, then they feel pain of the brest, all the face, and the agrieved place, look red, the nose is crooked in the top, the veines of the temples do beat, the tongue is drie, the appetite is lost, the breath is hot, they covet cold water, they have a drie cough, and is frothy, or chollerick, and bloudy, or red, which be the worst tokens: if the sick shall die, Prognostica he shall watch much, and shall have fearful short sleeps; If he recover, there will follow bleeding in aboundance. For the cure, Curatio. if this disease come after other diseases going before, you must eschue blood-letting: Venae-sectio but if it begin without any disease going before, then bleed, if strength will suffer it, on both armes a little at a time: Lohoch è scylla. Ecligma. é pulmone vulpis, and syrup of Hyssop is good, the cure is much like the cure of Pluritis.
CHAP. XVI. SPƲTƲM SANGƲINIS pro∣ceedeth of divers causes, Causa. as fulnesse, and abundance of naughty blood, which by its sharpnesse doth gnaw and erode asunder the veines, and so doth break open the heads of them, sometimes through sharp humours, which do distill from the head to the lungs, or else are ingendred in the lungs themselves, or through some fall, or through great cry∣ing, Hippocra∣tes. or immoderate cold, as Hippocrates wit∣nesseth, breaketh the veines. For the signe, Signa. if the spitting of blood, be of blood in abundance, then it cometh out gush∣ing all at once, and after it is out, the sick is bet∣ter; but if it be caused through bursting of a vein, then hot perturbations have gone be∣fore it, and cometh out on heapes, by little and little, with the cough, and they are alwayes worse, also if it be froathy & palish, and cometh forth now and then with the cough, then it is a certain sign, it proceedeth from the lungs, so it be without pain. If phlegmatick blood be spitted out with easie coughings & streachings, then the blood cometh from the Trachaea Ar∣teria. If blood be spitted forth, being black and clodded together, having also the cough and pain in the agrieved place, then it is a token it cometh from the brest, many times it cometh out of the nose from the head. For the cure; Curatio. Venae-sectio If it be caused of abundance of blood, then open a vein, and use the juyce of
nettles, to snuffe up into the nostrils, or to drink, and minister such things as be altogether of a cooling quality; if it proceed from the lungs, charge them that they do not breathe much, nor make a noyse, Aq. sperm. ranar. but speak as little as may be, use Aqua spermatis Ranarum, which seldome or never fayles, and indeed it is good for either of them. If there be a great faintnesse and danger of Syncope, Vinum. give a little Claret wine burnt often: also if you see cause, you may give the patient bolus-armeniae, Pulvis. with lofe-sugar in Claret wine: or ℞. Boli armen. sangu. dracon. balaust. ros. rubr. Aliud. mastic. lapid. haemat. sumach. myrtillor. Maquard. ana ʒ.ij. misce fiat pulvis, Marq. liq, 2. cap. 12. Let the patient take one dragm with Rob. deri∣berius, or with Syrrupo myrthino, or conserve of Roses. CHAP. XVII. TREMOR in Latin, . trembling or sha∣king in English. It is a disease which is ac∣companied with two sundry movings; one is, while the member is constreyned through hea∣vinesse and griefe to creep downward, the other is, while the member is carried upward from his natural course and faculty. The cause is altogether through weak∣ness of the sinews, Causa. and doth plainly declare old age, but privately it cometh of other causes, that is, of very cold temperature of nature, cold drink taken out of time, or season; especially
in fevers, moreover, the abundance of a cold, grosse, and clammy humour, and much using of wine that is unmixt and clear, old age, and fear, are causes thereof; as for signes you need none, because it is known by the sight, and words of the patient. For the cure it is in a manner all one to the cure of the palsie, Curatio. and cramp (letting of blood only excepted) the decoction of Egrimony, Decoctio. Casto∣reum, and the braines of a hare are said to be good, but if it comes by drinking of wine, let him drink the decoction of sage, Decoctio. and betony, with Hydromel, untill he be cured. CHAP. XVIII. PTHISIS AƲT TABES, . Signa. is an exul∣ceration of the lungs, which doth follow for the most part, spitting of bloody matter, or the cough proceeding off or from some sharp defluxion; sometimes also the lungs are ex∣ulcerated by reason of Apostumes of the brest, and when the matter of one being broken forth into the spaces of the brest, and cannot in time be purged and avoyded, but there doth lye and putrifie. The signe is, Signa. there doth follow this disease, weaknesse, and a pining away of the whole bo∣dy, the nayles grow curned and crooked, the eyes are sunk into the head, the face is deadly and wan, the haires fall away, and there fol∣loweth a fluxe of the womb, and finally death.
This disease hath alwayes been accoun∣ted incurable, Curatio. and especially by the ancient Physicians: for although we may cure the ulcers of the lungs, yet because there is left be∣hind it certain callos and fistulous reliques, they do very easily, and in short time, break out again: but as concerning the cure, the me∣dicines following are approved to be very good, for cleansing the ulcer. Hydromel alone, and Mulsa; remembring alwayes when we will deterge, and cleanse the Ulcer, we must give the honey cruide; but to glutinate and joyn up, the honey must be boyled, but if you will have a medicine, that shall both deterge, and conso∣lidate, take this ℞. following. ℞. Lohoch de pul. vulpis, lohoch sanum, ana ℥.j. Lohoch. Syr. ros. siccarum. & de glyzyrhyzoe, de hys∣sopo, capil. vene, tussila. & consarvae Rosa∣rum ana ℥.ss. misceantur. And let the patient take thereof often, with a stick of Liqueress, also a fume of colts foot is ve∣ry profitable, and for the same purpose, this Ecligma following, is good. ♃. Consar.

PALPITATIO CORDIS is an im∣moderate elevation and depression of the heart against nature: the new sorts of Phy∣sicians do wrongfully call it Cardiaca passio, Cardiaca passio. for that is an effect of the mouth of the stomack it self, and not of the heart. The cause is either a distemper, Causa. or the multi∣tude of an humour, contained in the outward skin that goeth about the heart; or else swelling contrary to nature, and such like. The signe is knowne by the pulse, Signa. for in a hot distemper there cometh a fever, and the pulse is swift and great, and their urine very high coloured; In a cold distemper, the contrary. If plenty of an humour contained in the upper skinne of the heart do cause beating thereof, then the pulse is soft and feeble. Indeed it is easily known by the words of the patient, who doth feel the beating and panting. The cure is performed according to the di∣versity Curatio.
of causes. If it be caused of a cold cause, or the multitude of a cold humour, Purgatio. then purge with such a purgation as you shall think pro∣per by the water, Decoctio. and to administer the drink set down in the Chapter of the palsie. And amongst simple medicines, these be profitable. Amber, musk, saffron, wood of aloes, styrax, cloves, and mace: among compounds these are good, Elect. diamber, dianthos. Species Aroma∣ticum Rosarum, diamargariton callidum; Electuari∣um. of these you may make Electuaries and lozinges, and of the simple medicines use the oyles there∣of, as, anoynt outwardly the region of the heart with oyle of saffron, cloves, mace, Oum. am∣ber, and the like. Those that be vexed with beating of the heart, caused off a hot distemper, they must have remedy by cold medicines, which can correct the hot distemper, and adde strength to the heart, as those be among sim∣ples, as Roses, Violets, Borage, flowers of wa∣ter-lillies, Saunders, Corall, Camphere, and such like amongst compounds be these, Dia∣margariton frigidum, diarrhod Abbat, Conserve of Roses, Violets, Buglosse; of all which may be made Potions, Juleps, or Electuaries Lastly, this Epithema following is good to strengthen and comfort the heart. ℞.

CHAP. XX. CONCRETIO LACTIS is caused through abundance of milk, Causa. which is not drawne forth: it is caused also of some hot di∣stemper, when through overmuch heat, the thinner part of the milk is digested, and dissol∣ved, and the rest groweth together, and turn∣eth into curds: it may also be caused of cold, which may cause the milk to congeale, and turn to curds. For the sign, Signa. there needs no tokens to know this evill, for it is known by and by, both by touch, and the patients words. For the cure, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. the diet is divers, according to the diversity of causes, for in a hot distemper of the paps, their diet must be of a cooling quali∣ty, in a cold distemper, contrary. If it chance through grossenesse of the milk, then there must be an extenuating diet. If there be abundance of milk, not being as yet curded, it must by little and little be sucked out. If heat cause the curding of the milk, then anoynt them with juice of Nightshade, also apply oyle of Roses and vinegar, also a Lilly root rosted and stamped with oyle of Roses, Cataplas. ma. Oleum. and applyed, is good. If it be a cold distemper, anoynt the paps with oyle of cammomel, dill, and lillies, beware you touch not the nipple; also this Emplaster following is held to be excellent good. Empla∣strum. Take honey half an ounce, styrax cal∣lamite three dragms, of oxes gall two dragms,
oyle of Cammomell, ℥.ij. Myrrh, and Frankin∣sence, of either two ounces, make an Empla∣ster according to Art. In a cold cause oyle of wormwood is good, also women use lin∣seed oyle, and searge cloath thereof, Oleum. with good successe. Also you may use this Li∣niment. ℞.

INFLAMMATIO MAMMA∣RƲM, Causa. is caused of abundance of hot blood, flowing to the paps, sometimes through milk curded, and turned to suppuration, and matter; the aforesaid causes are easie to discern asunder: for the first cause of Inflammation chanceth to them that be not with childe, nor brought to bed, the other chanceth on∣ly to such.
For the cure, Curatio. Venae-sectio it is good first to open a vein in the arme, , the inner or in∣ternal vein, unlesse the Menstruis be stopped, for then it is better to cut the vein on the ham or ankle, afterward if the body be costive, losen it with a cooling clyster, and if you see cause, you may give this gentle Apozem, that cools and quencheth the Inflammation, and openeth obstructions in the brest, as followeth. ℞. Apozema. Syrrup. Rosarum. pal. ℥. j. Syrrupus de Rhabarbaro, ℥. ss. Decoctio senae. quantum sufficit fiat Apozema. Let it be given the one half over night warm, and all the rest in the morning warm; eat no∣thing untill noon, but take three or four spoon∣fulls of broath between stooles: also apply out∣wardly this Emplaster following, Emplaster. Barley-meal, lin-seed, bolus armeniae, saunders, Oleum Nim∣pheae, oleum Rosarum, oleum Camomeli, misce. fiat Emplasterum: But first anoynt it with oyle of Roses, Ol.

If there be much pain, ℞. Epithema. Weckerus. Florum camomilae, mellioti, althoae, saeni∣graeci, seminis lini & anethi, ana M.j. co∣quantur in aqua, cui adde olei rosacei & ane∣thini, ana ℥. ij. aceti ℥. j. Spongia in eo ma∣defacta

IMBECILITAS STOMACHI is caused through distemper of the working qua∣lities, without any flowing of humours, Causa. some∣times it is caused of an humour contained in the bosome, and large space of the stomach, which hath power, either to heat, cool, mov∣sten, or drie, or two of these qualities, mixed together; and sometimes it is caused of an hu∣mour, stuffed and drowned in the filmes, or coats of the stomack. For the signe, Signa. in a cold cause there is dull and difficult concoction, the taste of the nourish∣ment is felt long after, there is sharp belchings, and little or no thirst, but contrary in a hot cause, there is exceeding thirstinesse, abhorring of meat, and bitter belchings, and this is certain, that if the cause be heat, the patient is cased by administring of cold things, if it be a cold cause, then he is eased by hot things, if that choller cause it, there is such bitter belchings, that there is cast forth bitter choller, with bitternesse of the mouth. For the cure, if it come of a cold caule, Curatio. Pilulae. as of phlegme, purge gently with stomachal pills,
if they have gone a day, and have not had a stool, then take one pill an hour before supper. Then take this cordiall Electuary following, which is said to be good. ℞. Electuari∣um. Conserv. Caryophilorum. ℥. i. ss. pul. Aro∣matici. Ros. ʒ. i. ss. pul. Cinnamomi. Nucis Muscatae, ana ʒ. ss. Syr. absynthii, & de Hy∣sopo, q. s. f. Elect.

Rosat. and drink after it a draught of Wormwood wine, for that will prepare the stomack to the next concoction, and also bathe outwardly with oyle of worm∣wood, Oleum. nutmegs, cinnamon, or mastick; or the best is to spread honey on bread tosted, and cast thereon the powder of nutmegs, cloves, and cinnamon, and for the richer sort, take this ♃ made as followeth. ℞. Pulvis. Rosarum Rubrum Absinthii, menthae, maio∣ran. siccae, an. ʒ. ij. ligni aloes, spicae, nardi, ca∣lami aromatici, ana ℈. ij. fiat. pul. qui accip ia∣tur cotone, involvatur duplici linteo. And this must also be remembred, that oynt∣ments, emplasters, and cataplasms, must not on∣ly be applied before, but behind also, about the thirteenth Vertebra. In a hot cause purge with Cassia, Apozema. and Rhu∣barb, or else an Apozem; and open a vein if you see cause, Venae sectio and then this Electuary is said to be very good. ℞. Electuari∣um. Cons. Rosarum ℥. j. Diarrhodon. alb. ʒ. i. ss. Syr. assato. lymonum. q. s. f. Elect.
Also direct Lozenges of Diarrhodon alb. Triasan∣dali, and make him broath with cooling herbs, currents, and damask pruins; also bread dipped in Posca is wondrous proper to be eaten; Posca. as for outward applications, use oyle of Roses, Oleum. Quin∣ses, or the like; but take heed of things that cool too much, yet give him no strong beer, no wine, hot waters, spices, nor milk, &c. If chol∣lar do abound with costivenesse of body, purge with an Apozem made with Cassia, Rhubarb, Apozema. Vomitus. or the like. If temperate, provoke vomits with Stybium, the infusion thereof. CHAP. XXIII. CANINA APPETENTIA, is an im∣moderate or dog-like appetite, or desire of meat, and when they cannot refrain their ap∣petite, they devoure in meat without measure, then being heavy with the multitude of meats, and the stomack being not able to bear the same, they turn to vomiting, then afterwards they fill themselves, and turn again to vomi∣ting like dogs, the part affected is the mouth of the stomack. The cause is a perpetual gnawing or biting of the mouth of the stomack, Causa. like unto a suck∣ing, sometimes it happeneth through a cold distemper of the mouth of the stomack: some∣times through cold, sharp, and vitious humours: sometimes it proceedeth through certain kinds of worms, which do devour the meat that is ta∣ken into the stomack, as fast as it is received:
sometimes through dissipation of whole body. For the sign, Signa. if it be a cold distemper, it is known by windinesse, and rumbling: sharp hu∣mours are known by four belchings, dissipation is known by the excrements, for they be scor∣ched, and lesse in quantity than before. For the cure, Curatio. Pilulae. in a cold cause it is good first to take stomacal pills; also Hierapicra Galeni ʒ. 6. with wine infused with water, or given in oxi∣mel fasting, is good, and to drink muscadell is good, he must abstain from all soure and re∣strictive meats; but let his meat be meats of good juyce: if a child laboureth in this disease, the body being bound, Syr. de Rhubarb. and a doubt of worms, give it one ounce of Syrrup of Rhubarb, or more, according to the age and strength of the childe, the one half over night, and the other half in the morning warm, either in muscadel, oximel, or the juyce of pruins; also let it have muscadel oftentimes instead of beer: Vinum. If the child be very young, give it no beer untill it be well. Also oximel is good, give it honey with any thing you give it if the disease be cau∣sed of dissipation, Mel. or extream heat, give it all cooling things, and if you fear worrnes, let Wormseed and Rue be boyled in vinegar with honey, Syrrupus. and give thereof often. You may boyl the Wormseed in muscadel, if nothing forbid it; Fernelius. Avicenna. if you want more, look in Fernelius, and there you may find plenty of remedies: Also Avicen bids that wine should be given before meat, and Galen commendeth a vomit. Vomitus.
CHAP. XXIV. CATARRƲS is a distillation of some Rhu∣matick matter into the lower parts: . as when it falleth to the mouth or jawes, it is cal∣led Gravedo, when it falleth into the nose, Gravedo. and causeth the pose, some call it Raucedo, Raucedo. others when it doth descend to the nostrils, and cause opilation, they do call it Coryza, Coriza. and when it doth desce to the parts in the throat, Branchus. it is cal∣led Branchus, and when it doth descend to the brest and lungs, then it is called a Catarrhum, from whence this verse doth arise; Si fluit ad pectus Rheuma, tunc dico Catarrhum, Ad fauces Branchon, ad nares, dico Coryzam. The cause is either of some outward cold, Causa. or heat, sometimes evaporation of meats, some∣times the smell of hot or cold things, the immo∣derate use of Venery, over much sleep, violent exercise, or too much rest, or repletion. For the sign, Signa. if the flux of humours come off heat, the head is hot, and a sharp and thin hu∣mour distilleth as well by the nose as by the mouth; also the face and nose is red, and for the most part there followeth a fever: contrariwise they that have the flux caused of a cold hu∣mour, their head & forehead is stretched forth every where, also a phlegmatick and thick hu∣mour, distilleth out of the nose. For the cure, Curatio. if a hot humour distill from the head, together with a fever, the first thing is to purge (if co∣stive) with this cooling Apozem.
℞. Apozema, Decoctio sennae ℥.6. Syr. Rosarum. ℥j. Syr. de Rhabarbaro. ℥.ss, Mix them, and make an Apozem, and give it half overnight and the rest in the morning warm: or if you think proper, you may wash the belly with a clyster, Venae-sectio and be sure you open the Cephalica veins if nothing forbid it; also powr rose vinegar upon hot tile-stones, or iron, and so receive the fume, but the best is this Gar∣garisme following. ℞.

In a cold cause the first intention is to purge with head-pills; Pilulae. (if it be salt rheume, and falleth to the eyes, Empla∣strum. apply an attractive plaster to the hole of the neck, and every night when they go to bed, Ʋuguen∣tum. gr. ij. of ung. Tutiae, will be good to put into the corners of the eyes, then shut them, and anoint the eye-lids all over) in a cold cause, af∣ter you have purged as aforesaid, either with pills or potion, use this hot Gargarisme fol∣lowing. ℞.

Afterwards it is proper to use fumes of Styrax∣cal, Fumigatio. cinnamon, frankincense, cloves, mastick;
these you may make into powder to strew upon coles: also of these may be made booles, adding thereto Syrrup of Myrtles, with a little cinnamon water. Lastly, draw the rhume back with a plaister of Cantharides, and take Pillulae de cynoglossa, made as followeth. ℞. Myrrhae ʒ.vj. Thuris ʒ. v. opii, Pilulae. Hyoscy∣ami ana ℥. ss. croci ʒ. i. ss.

ASTHMA is a certain difficult, thick, and hard respiration without a fever: Causa. and is, when as grosse and clammy humours, in abundance, be gotten into the grissles and lap∣pets of the lungs, or when there is some swel∣ling like unto a botch, sometimes a pestilent ayre, and the fume of quick-silver may be the cause; also intemperate diet, and idlenesse, and grossenesse of body, but chiefly it happen∣eth from a grosse clammy and viscus flegme, which doth stick in the passages of the sharp Artery. For the signe, Signa. it is easie to be known asunder (for distillation doth often chance in hayl folks, by and by through a manifest cause, in a man∣ner altogether without a fever, having the to∣kens of distillation following it, if there be swel∣ling of the lungs like a botch, then there must needs follow a fever, and so within few dayes after it, the inflamed botch being rotted, the
matter is cast out with the cough, if there be a cruid & raw Tubercle, and both ingendred, such do not feel any great grief, neither are they troubled with much difficulty of breathing, but they are much troubled when they eat or drink, because they cannot swallow but with great grief.) Now they which be properly Asthma∣tick, or orthopnicks, have no fever at all, & there chanceth to them heavinesse of sence, and they do not spit out matter with their spittle. There is also a difficulty of breathing, Morbus virgineus. Glissonius. not unlike this, which happeneth unto young women, com∣monly called the Green sicknesse, or white fever. For the signe of this sicknesse, Signa. you shall know it thus, their water is pale, and inclining to greenish, their Menstruis be retained, and great difficulty of breathing when they stirre, their complexion is like the wall, and they do desire those things generally, that put out na∣turall heat, as milk, apples, nuts, peares, fish, roots, turnips, wheat, oatmeal, and such like; now I shall first give you a way how to cure Asthma, and then the green sicknesse, which is a disease very common. For the cure of Asthma, Curatio. Victus ra. tio. is first to erect a fit and convenient diet: that I leave for brevi∣ties sake, to the discretion of the learned Physi∣tian. The next intention must be to purge with this or the like purgation. ℞. Potio pur. gans Diaphenicon. ʒ.ij. pul. Sanctus, Jallap. & be∣nedict. lax. an. ʒ. ss. vini albi. q s.f. potio. Or if there be abundance of blood, Venae sectio. a vein may be opened, alwayes providing that you keep ac∣customed
evacuations. And to use moderate exercise, after the taking of this loch, in morn∣ings, or before meales; is good, ℞. Conserv. Rosa. Rub. ℥.j. pul. Ireos. Lohoch. & sul∣phur. liquiritiae, ana ʒ. j. Anisi. ʒ. j. Tussi∣lag. q s. fi. lohoch. Which must be taken the quantity of a Wal∣nut curnel last at night, and first in the morn∣ing, and in the day time between meales. Wormwood here is also very profitable, and to eat three figs every morning, Matthiolus Ficuum. Emplastrū. madufied in Aqua vitae, Matthiolus doth much commend it; lastly, to apply to the brest a plaster of figs, barly meal, having rosin, honey, and wax commix∣ed with it, and to anoint the brest with oyles of Ireos, Dill, and Rew. Oleum. For the cure of that which is like a botch, hath need of medicines, to atenuate and drie; It must be cured with aromatick things: Theriaca, Methridatum, Theriaca, &c.

Victus ra∣tio. Febris vir∣ginea. the first intention is to prescribe a fit and convenient di∣et, such as is Rabbets, Chickens, Veale, rost, reare-egges, or the like; and if you will take a right course, some kind of women must be stented of their meat and drink, or else they cannot be cured; that beer they do drink should be of the best beer, and they must be∣ware of meats that are scorched, and must leave at meales with an appetite, they must eat no trash, as milk, roots, fish, green fruit, and no
salt things, and drinking after supper to bed∣ward, or fasting a mornings, is not good: the second intention is to take a vomit with Alsa∣ron, Vomitus. Venae-sectio the third to bleed of the foot, and to take of this drink following, a quarter of a pint at a time, Exercitiū. every morning fasting; and to use exer∣cise after it, either to work or play is very pro∣fitable; Take new beere three pintes, when it is in the fat wrought ready to tunne, boyle in it herb-grace, Decoctio. and unset hysop, of either a hand∣full, red Currants a quarter of a pound, untill half be wasted, then strain it, and adde a little saffron.

CHAP. XXVI. SYNCOPE, . is a sudden, and swift fayling of the strength, and it is a terrible symptom, because it is the image of death, for both na∣tural,
animal, and vital, chiefly do fail, from hence it happeneth, that there is no pulse, nor respiration, sence, and motion is abolished. The face is wan and pale, the extream parts are chill, and moyst, with a faint sweat. For the cause, Causa. it may come by immoderate watchings, anger, sorrow, great cares, suddain fears, intollerable pain, acute fevers, immode∣rate emptinesse, famine, sweats, labours, vomi∣tings, exceeding fluxes, losse of blood, a sod∣dain emptying of water, as in the dropsie; of∣tentimes it proceedeth from abundance of grosse, cruid, rotten sharp, and biting humours, which do daily check, and as it were fill the mouth of the stomack in such sort, that the pas∣sages of the spirits are obstructed, that their motion is intercepted, even as it is when respira∣tion is let and hindred, as it is when abundance of humours are concluded in the passages of the lungs, that the sick cannot draw in ayre, to serve for the cooling of the heart. For the cure, Curatio. Vinum. Galenus. it is according to the diversity of causes, Galen in every swounding doth com∣mend wine, which otherwise in burning fevers is dangerous, nevertheless it may be used sparing∣ly, in time of intermissions, so it be diluted with Buglosse, Borage, and such like. Odors, and sweet smells, do comfort very much, except choaking of the mother be the cause, then sweet odors must be received underneath, and to the nostrils apply things that be foetid and stinking, as Castoreum, Assafoetida, and burnt haire; besides, we cause sternutation, Sternuta∣mentum. which if the patient cannot do, it is a most manifest sign
of death: If it proceeds from poyson, if we know the venim, we administer the proper an∣tidote, if not, we give treakle, or methridate. If Cardialgia, Cardial. & stomachica. Medica∣mentum. and Stomachica, do follow the syncope, then we take a toste of bread, moyste∣ned in wine, and scatter on it the powder of Nutmegs, and Cloves, and so apply it to the stomach, but not upon the heart, and this is to be observed, that nothing repaires the spirits so soon as wine, because it is vaporous, and hath a great affinity with the the spirits: but some will say, why do they sprinkle cold water on the face. I answer, because that the heat and the spi∣rits flying outwards, may be driven and turned back, from their circumference unto their Cen∣ter, yet cold water must not be used in the syn∣cope of a flux; Theriaa. Galenus. for thereby the flux will be in∣creased, but rather use new Treakle; for Galen affirmeth it stayeth all super-purgations and fluxes: if it hapneth through immoderate sweats, then we sprinkle the face with Rose-wa∣ter campherated, Olrsum. and rub the body with cold linnen, and anoint it with oyle of Roses. If it cometh through inanition, or emptiness, as immoderate watching, much venery, famin, and two much exercise or violent motion: then sprinkle the face with wine, and let them smell to mint-water, and administer some cordial Electuary, Electuari∣um cord. as you shall think proper, re∣membring you put in new Treakle or Me∣thridate. If it be caused through vomiting, use fri∣ctions below, if through a flux use frictions above: and wine is most proper in the syncope,
coming of emptinesse; Ranzovius Ranzovius doth much commend this water following, affirming that by the continual use of it, one lived to the age of 129. yeares. ℞.

Causa. as it were a a cramp, raised through the expulsive facul∣ty of the stomach, which goeth about to ex∣pell hurtful and evil matter. For the most part it is caused of fulness or emptinesse, as Hippocrates doth affirm, Hippocra∣tes. also somtimes it is caused of (or through) the biring of sharp humours in the stomach, or coldnesse; and sometimes hot fevers may be the cause, when either the stomack, or some other bowel is inflamed. Fulnesse is knowne by heavinesse, Signa. and empti∣nesse of those things that went before: you may know if the meat be corrupt, by the burnt sa∣vour of it, but you shall know sharpnesse
by gnawing, pricking, and pulling. 1. Prognosticks are, if neesing follow upon the Hicket, the patient is delivered, so that it proceedeth of fulnesse. 2. The Hicket coming in an Iliac passion is evill, or coming with swouning, or with di∣stention of nerves, or with dilerium, is a deadly signe. 3. Also coming upon the inflammation of the liver, of the wombe, of the brain, or upon some notable wound, is very dangerous, and oftentimes deadly. 4. In acute diseases, and burning fevers, and the pestilence, it is for the most part deadly. 5. Also if it happeneth through two much emptinesse, it is alwayes evill. 6. It is also evil if it cometh with vomiting, for it threatneth danger of inflammation of stomach, Cuatio. and braine: As concerning the cure, we must consider the cause. If it proceed of em∣ptinesse it is the more dangerous, and therefore must be helped, by giving fit and conveni∣ent nourishment, that thereby that which is de∣fective, may be supplied. If a flux of blood, or an exceeding flux of the wombe do cause this in∣firmity, we may give oyle of sweet Almonds, either by it self, or in warm water, he is to be nourished with cordial broath, there are some that cure this Hicket with drinking of milk that do refresh, Amilum. Victus ra∣tio. but the best is Amilum given with milk: and the broth of an hen, and the flesh thereof, capons, chickens, and Rear-egges, with the powder of Eringium, is wondrous
proper; his drink must be white-wine diluted with water, Oleum. the back and stomach must be anointed with oyle of violets, and sweet al∣monds. If sharp humours have stirred up the hicket, we must give such things as are sweet and fat, as the fat of broath, of henne, or cock, or two spoonfulls, of clarified honey, or penidice, Mel. or pinecarnels, with sugar; or it may be purged, Purgatio. so that it be prepared before with drinking of Aqua mulfa: if it proceed through heat, Vomitus. and biting sharpnesse, then to provoke vomit is wondrous proper, and to give all cooling things, as julleps, Apozems, or juices, Julepus. Theriac. or waters of succo∣ry, and such like, you may compose your juleps, with syrrups of violets, Nymphea, of poppie, or the like; when the hicket is most strong, we give new treakle. If it proceed from a cold cause, and the mat∣ter grosse, and viscus, prepare the humour with oximel, and then a vomit, or purge, as you shall see cause, and compose this Electuary following, for them that are able. ℞. Confect. Caryophyllorum. ℥.j. Cinamomi, Electuari∣um. & Aromat. Rosat. ana ʒ.ss. Syr. Hyssopi. q.s.f. Elect, molle. Also Lozenges are very proper, Lozeng. made of Aromaticum Ros. Candid Ginger is very good, Castoreum. also ℈, ij. of Castoreum, in white wine: but many times one purge or vomit is sufficient; Dioscorides. Di∣oscorides commends Aristoloch. radix cum aqua, & Asplenum herba cum posca, & castorum cum aceto. Also he commendeth Ineezing, if Singultus cometh of fulnesse. Dioseor. lib. 2. cap. 4.
CHAP. XXVIII. DOLOR STOMACHI, or pain of the stomach is caused divers and sundry ways, Causa. as when naughty, venemous, and gnawing hu∣mours be kept in the stomach, whereby it chan∣ceth, that through intollerable gnawing, they cause swouning, Stomachae cardialgiae. which they call Stoma∣chia, or cardialgia; sometime pain of the sto∣mach is caused through some stroak or fall; and an inflammation may be the cause thereof. In a hot cause, Signa. there is felt a sharp pricking pain, gnawing in the mouth of the stomach, bitternesse in the mouth, vomiting of chollar, and there followeth a great weaknesse and fee∣blenesse of the whole body: in a cold cause the pain is lesse, Curatio. and more dull, and slow; in a hot cause, give this Apozem following, the one half over night, and the other half in the morn∣ing warm. ℞.

Causa. de Symto∣matum causis, doth affirm that a cold di∣stemper of the instrument of breathing, to be the cause of the cough, also a humour distil∣ling from the head, to the Trachaea arterea, go∣ing about within, doth provoke the cough,
sometimes it is caused through cold, or flegme, descending upon the lungs, sometimes it hap∣peneth through heat, dissolving the superflu∣ous matter of the brain, and so through a cat∣tarrhal distillation the cough is excited. The outward signes, are smoak and dust. If it be caused through a cold distemper, Signa. they spit out nothing while they cough, neither is it so violent, but may be eased by holding the breath, because through holding the breath, the instruments of breathing, that were vexed with cold, do waxe hot, and contrary they are provoked with breathing, oftentimes to cough, their face is pale, and they are not thirsty. If a hot distemper be the cause, there is felt thirst, and often breathing, do relieve and suc∣cour them; it is also sharp, and more tedious, and they spit but little, this is a thin hot Rhoume distilling from the head to the Tra∣chaea arteria, and sometimes happeneth in the plurisie. For the cure in a cold cause, Curatio. which for the most part happeneth in winter, may be helped with hot things, his neck and feet are to be kept warm, Oleum. and oyles of mace, dill, and lillies, be good to anoint the brest; and if he have a ple∣thorick body, give a purgation made by the judgement of the water: If a thin cold Rheume, give penedice, in every sooping they take, and syrrup of oximel is wondrous proper. Oximel. If from thin and sharp humours, then ingross it with syrrups of violets, foals-foot, and maidens-hair, and stay the distilling humour with such things,
as you shall find proper in Catarrhus. In a hot cause first an Apozem as you shall see proper, after take mallowes, M.6. currents, Apozema. M.3. stamp them together, Decoctio. then take Liquo∣ress ℥-j. boyle them in four pints of water till halfe be wasted, strain it, and adde stone-sugar ℥.ij. Syrrup of violets ℥. j. give the patient five or sixe spoonefulls at a time last at night, first in the morning, about ten in the forenoon, Syr. de pa∣pavere er∣ratico. and four in the afternon; also syrrup of poppies in poppy water, or given alone is good. CHAP. XXX. PICa, is a languishing of the stomach, . with a provoking and desire of vomit, or casting of meat received, and sometimes vomiting of chollar and flegme, or it is a certain desire of vitious and unwholesome meats, for they desire strange things, as raw-flesh, shells, coals, chaulk, lime, salt, vinegar, old rags, rotten leather, tar, candles, & one I knew would eat tobacco-pipes. The cause according to Piso is a hurtful acti∣on of the animal faculty, which doth erre, Pisco. and not desire good nourishment, the part affected is the mouth of the stomach, as may be percei∣ved by the appetite, this disease hapneth for the most part to young women, being repleat and full of naughty humours, but chiefly when they are with child, sometimes to maides, and girles, and such as are troubled with Cachexia, which is an evill state of the whole body with a wate∣rish disposition, whereby it waxeth loose and
soft, the cause, signe, and cure you shall have in its proper Chapter. For the signe of pica or malacia, Signa. Malacia. is, that if there be shed, burnt, and black chollar in the stomach, they desire such things as are acrid and sharp, as coales, ashes, tobacco-pipes, and all such things as are drie. If salt humours, they desire those things that are salt, some have refer∣red the cause of this disease to be crudity & cor∣ruption of the whole body, which being commu∣nicated to the mouth of the stomach, they will have it to be affected by consent; in like manner there do appear daily spittings, gnawing of the mouth of the stomach. If there be flegmatick humours, (heavinesse) and according to the variety of vitious humours, and patient doth de∣sire the foresaid divers, and strange meats: This disease for the most part as I said before, happeneth to young women with child, about the fourtieth day from conception, and do continue often untill the fourth month, and then it ceaseth, partly because vitious humours are avoyded by vomit, and partly because they are concocted, by reason that about those times, the woman receiveth but little nourish∣ment, through a loathsomenesse, partly be∣cause the multitude is diminished by evacuati∣on, that in the first two months, the child draw∣eth but little to it self, because it is but small of growth, but in the increase it doth require more nourishment, (so much) as it draweth something that is vitious, as well as good, and so it happeneth that the whole body be∣cometh more empty from that vitious quality,
and is lesse offended with naughty humours. As for women with child, Curatio. Victus Ratio. they seldom make use of a physician, but if any do prescribe a spa∣ring diet, as chickens, rabbets, or the like, with parseley; but nothing that is fat: a mornings to eat almonds, and reysons of the Sun, and ox∣imel, and to drink muscadel in the day time is good, but suffer not much drink to be drunk, because the meat will swimme, and if a pletho∣rick body, give clysters, Vomitus. or provoke gentle vo∣mits, but not in the first month, for danger of Abortive, or if a child laboureth of this disease, use the means prescribed in the Chapter of Ca∣nina appetentia: if it take hold on men, which is but seldom known, Vomitus. first prepare the humour with oximel, and then administer such a vomit as you shall know to be proper. If chollar be adust and scorcheth, prepare the humour with this Apozem following. ℞. Syr. de Rhabar. ℥. j. syr. Rosarum sol. ℥. ss. Apozema. Decoction Sennae. q.s.f. Apozema.

Causa. or losse of appetite, is for the most part caused through aboundance of cruid and raw humours, lurking in the sto∣mach, or oppressed through nourishment cor∣rupted: sometimes it is caused by consent, as from a defluxion of the brain, from whence a thin wheyish matter is sent unto the stomach, or else from the liver being strongly affected; for it happeneth oftentimes upon the recovery of some sharp and acute disease, that there is left behind a weaknesse of the stomach: Also a chollerick humour, pressing the mouth of the
stomach, may cause this evil; and also it hap∣peneth in fevers, and especially in Synochus, not putrified, because through the aboundance of blood, there is no attraction. For the sign, Signa. in a hot cause there is felt gnawing in the stomach, a desire to vomit, and thirst, sometimes a fever with rotten humours; but contrary in a cold cause, the part affected is the mouth of the stomach. In a hot cause or chollerick humor, Curatio. Victus Ratio. a cold di∣et must be prescribed, moderate sleep, & quiet∣nes, must be used or provoked, his body must be kept soluble; if you see cause give a vomit, Vomitus. if otherwise, purge with this Apozem following. ℞.

SITIS, . hath a twofold cause: natural, and animal. The natural is by natural in∣clination, to require a cold and moist sub∣stance, for to supply the place of the sub∣stance, that was dissipated, wasted, and spent: but the animal appetite is, when the stomach, feeling it self to be empty of moysture, doth de∣sire drink, as happeneth in burning fevers. Sometimes falt humours are the cause, Causa. and drinking of old wine, the part affected is the mouth of the stomach, either by it self, or by consent with the heart, or liver, and chiefly by the inferiour parts thereof, or with the lungs, or by the veines of the Mesenterium, or the Je∣junum inflamed; for those parts are accompa∣nied with a hot and drie distemperature, and indeed hapueth for the most part in hot and pu∣trified fevers, in hydropsies, and such like. As for the sign it is needlesse, Signa. for it may be known by the patients words: if the stomach be heavie and dull, it signifies repletion: if falt humours, that's known by the patients eating of salt things: if the cause be windinesse, there is felt extension: if chollar, bitter belchings, and extream thirst: if sharp humours, biting, gnaw∣ing, and such like.
If the cause be an hot inflammation, Curatio. he must abstain from hot things, salt things, and immo∣derate exercise, and if a plethorick body, Venae sectio open a vein, and administer an Apozem, made as you shall see fit, and a Julep made as followeth: Julepus. Take (French barley ℥. i. ss.) French pruins ℥.iv. boyl them in a sufficient quantity of water, untill half be wasted, strain it, and adde plan∣tin wator ℥.ij. conserve of barberries ℥. j. mixe them, and drink thereof often; and hold the conserve of aforesaid in your mouth, letting it dissolve by degrees, adde to the julep, loafe-su∣gar, and if it proceed of drunkenness, drink Aqua hordei; if it cometh of salt humours, Julepus. as in the scurvie, then drink Aqua fumariae, & syr∣rupus fumariae, make a julep, and drink thereof: Also purging is good, and refrain salt things. But when it chance to those that have burning fevers, then give them Posca, that is, Posca. vinegar and water sodden together; if you will, Aqua sper∣matis ra∣narum. you may adde conserve of barberries: and Aqua sper∣matis Ranarum is very effectual, mixed either with some cooling syrrup or conserve, or given by it self, a spoonfull at a time, Sperma ant semen ranarum colligitur mense Martio. Destillatur au∣tem per alembicum vitreum. Quercetanus. CHAP. XXXIII. NAƲSEA, . is a naughty and wicked motion of the expulsive faculty of the stomach. It is caused of a vitious humour contained in Causa.
the stomach, being either hot or cold, which humour either swimmeth in the concavity or hollownesse of the stomach, or it is stuffed in the filmes thereof, cleaving like bird-lime, sometimes great exercise after meales, sayling on the seas, and over fat meats, or stopping of the Menstruis, may be the cause. In a hot cause, Signa. you shall find the sign in the Chapter of weakness of the stomach: if vitious humours do swim in the stomach, then for the most part vomiting, followeth; If a tough hu∣mour like bird-lime be drowned in the cotes of the stomach, it causeth a disposition to vomit, but bringeth forth nothing; also a dulnesse throughout the whole body. As touching the cure of vomiting, Curatio. you must note in the beginning, it ought not to be stop∣ped, if the sick be the better for it, especially if such things be purged, as ought to be; it is also good, and may be suffered, if not, it is evill: for the cure, Clyster. the readiest way is sleep, if it may be procured, as in a hot cause: if the body be co∣stive, administer a cooling clyster, adding there∣to oyle of violets ℥.iij. or give gr. iij. of lauda∣num Paracel. which is good: providing the body be first made soluble: also infuse a piece of bread in white-wine vinegar, or rose-vinegar, and bruise it in a morter, Ceratum. and adde thereunto powder of cinnamon, cloves, red-roses, or the like; this may be applyed to their stomachs warm; if children be troubled with vomiting, give syrrup of Rhubarb, Cataplas∣ma. such a quantity as fit∣teth the age and strength of the child; and you may take cammomel, wormwood, mint, and
porret, of either half a handfull, boyle them in halfe a pinte of wine-vinegar, and thicken it with crums of white bread, like a poultis, spread it on a double cloth, and apply it warm. If the body be temperate, and a doubt of worms, in∣stead of the syrrup aforesaid, use worm-seed, ac∣cording to the directions, in the Chapter of Canina appetentia; if blood cause vomiting, you shall have directions in the Chapter of sputum sanguinis: Vomitus. In a cold cause procure vomiting with Asaron, if nothing prohibit; Pilulae. and after use stomachal pills, mint-water, and the syrrups of wormwood, if you want more, look in Sitis, and Imbecillitas stomachi; I have often∣times stopped vomiting with Aquamenthae & syrrup. cidoniorum, Mixtura. of either one ounce mixed together. CHAP. XXXIV. CHOLERICA PASSIO, is an immo∣derate perturbation of the stomach, cau∣sed by vomits upwards and downwards, the Latins call it Cholerici. It is caused through much crudity and raw∣nesse of the stomach, choller, Causa. and sharp hu∣mours, with an ill and corrupt digestion. For the signe, Signa. there is pricking and biting about the stomach, and withall vomiting, and a flux of the belly; it is called the chollerick passion in English: there do oftentimes accom∣company this disease, cold sweats, a swift pulse, frequent, little, and short, with Syncope.
If children be taken with this disease, Curatio. sleep profiteth much, in old men for the most part deadly; the juyce and syrrup of Quinces, with syrrup of Roses and Myrtills, is excellent in a hot cause, as this Recipe following. ℞. Mixtura. Miva Citoniorum ℥. 4. syr. Citoniorum, & Mirtilorum, ana ℥.j.cons. Oxiacanthae ℥. ss.

IMBECILLITAS JECINORIS is caused of a distemper, either hot, cold, moyst, Causa. or dry. 1. Signa. A hot distemper doth burn up as well the humours which were before in the liver, as also those humours which are carried to the liver, by the veines Mesenterii, and there is stink∣ing grosse choller, avoyded by the belly, and is abundantly coloured; also a fever vexeth him, he abhorreth meat, and many times cast∣eth up choller, with a sore thirstinesse, the vrine high, and a swift pulse. 2. In a cold distemper, it doth make the flegmatick and raw humour, which is already contained in the liver, tough and hard to be moved, and the humours that be carried to the liver, it leaves them half digested; this indureth long, and the belly floweth certain dayes abun∣dantly, but lesse stinking, and not so much in quantity; and is like putrefact blood curded, but indeed for the most part you shall find it, as it were a certain slime, and dregs of grossblood,
coming nigh to melancholy: many times there appeareth a faint fever, the face doth not fall, and there is a greater appetite of meats. 3. A dry distemper, doth make the hu∣mours drier and thicker, and less in quantity than the former, but thirsty. 4. A moyst distemper make the humours more thin and watery, and they are less trou∣bled with thirst, therefore they which have a weak faculty of the liver, are called Hepatici. 1. Curatio. Venae-sectio In a hot cause, if there be not great aridity, and driness, with exceeding heat, open the li∣ver vein of the right arm, otherwise not; for blood is a bridle, Ceratum.

In a moyst distemper, use a drying diet, Diacurcue ma. and provoke sweat; Diacurcuma is good, so is syr∣rup of wormwood. 4.

EPHIALTES, is a disease whereas one thinketh himself (in the night) to be op∣pressed with a great weight, believing that something cometh upon him, and thinketh that he is strangled. It is often times caused of excesse of drink∣ing, Causa. and sometimes continual rawness of the stomack, from whence doth ascend vapours, gross and cold, filling the ventricles of the brain, and letting the faculties of the brain to be dispersed by the sinewes. They that have this disease can scarce move, Signa. being astonied, and as it were held by some∣thing that doth violently invade them; the voyce is suppressed, some do believe (though vainly) that they hear the thing that doth op∣press them; now at the last with much trouble, the vapours being attenuate, and driven away, and the passage of the spirits being opened, the sick is by and by raysed to his perfect sences. If this disease continue, Signa. Prognosti∣ca.

Causa. which signifieth a matte∣ry spitting, it is caused when an impo∣stume, or botch being in the upper skin, gird∣ing the ribs, or else in some other skin of the brest is broken all at once, and shed into the empty place of the brest, which is between the lungs and the upper skin, it is fometimes cau∣sed through bursting out of blood, sometimes through a fluxe of the head, and other upper parts falling thither, which is wont often to change into the squinsie. There is felt heavinesse in the bottom of the brest, a strong and dry cough, Signa. without pain in the beginning, there chance to them fevers, faint, inordinate, and hard to be judged, when the impostume draweth now to a rupture, then the fever is more vehement with quaking, and they are troubled in their speech; the matter that cometh out is sometime clear, sometimes thick, and dreggy, and sometimes flows upward into the voyd place of the brest; and these be most perilous, sometimes they flow down∣wards to the paunch, bowels, and bladder, such alwayes labour of the fever Hectick. Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. Let them use meats of good juyce, broth of cocks, and flesh of hens, chickens, and birds of
mountains, let his drink be Aqua mulsa, and thin white wine, it must be speedily looked to, or else the matter gathered together will cause the Ptisick, or an ulceration of the lungs, there∣fore a drink made with liquoress, figs, and ani∣seeds, is good to rot and voyd the matter; if it creep into the belly, minister mollifications, if to the bladder, such things as provoke urine; if it cometh out by a cough, then give ptisan mixed with good honey; you shall have plen∣tiful remedies in the Chapter of the Ptisick, and in Astma, and Pluritis, yet this Electuary fol∣lowing is very good. ℞.

CHAP. XXXIX. DIARRHAEA; . is a great and copious flux of the wombe, without exulceration and inflammation. It is caused through weakness of the instru∣ments that do serve to digestion; Causa. also through aboundance of corrupted meat, and nourish∣ment that is moyst and viscous, moreover gnawing and biting of those things that are contained in the belly: also flowing of some humours from above the belly, and weakness of the retentive vertue may be the cause. 1. Signa. Diarrhaea be caused through weakness of the Instruments that serve for digestion, as the stomach, bowels, liver, and spleen, seek the signes out of their own proper Chapters, as in Imbecillitas stomachi, & Iecivoris. 2. If through weaknesse of the vertue re∣tentive, seek the signes in the Chapters a∣bove. 3. If through much devouring of evil meats, and drinks, it's known by the Patients words. 4. If it be caused through Cholerick humors, the excrements are yellow colour, there is felt gnawing and heat whil'st they are casting out; there is also felt bitternesse of the mouth, thirst, a thin state of the body, and other to∣kens signifying choller. 5. If flegmatick humours be the cause, all those forementioned signes are contrary. 6. If humours flow from the head to the
belly, the egestious will appear frothy, and the temperature of the brain will be very moyst. 7. If through fullness of the body, it is easily known. 1. Curatio. If it be caused through weakness of the instruments, you shall find remedy in the Chapter of Imbecill stomach. 2. If through the fulness, or other causes, and nature labour to help it self, you must suf∣fer it a while; for being stopped, the vitious hu∣mours are carried upwards, and do cause pain in the head, a frensie, lethargy, or impostuma∣tion behind the eares: but if it shall continue long, casting forth, not only superfluities, but melting as it were the state of the body, and consuming the strength, then labour to stop it. 3. If through chollerick humours, Apozema. an Apo∣zem of the infusion of Rhubarb is much pray∣sed, at the first taking of this disease, Cassia and Manna is good, then this julep following. ℞. Aqua plantag. Portulacae, ana ℥. iv. Syr. Julepus. Mirti. & cons. oxiacanthae ana ℥.j. Make a julep, and take steel gadds red hot, Chalybs. quench them in milk, scum it, and drink, it is much commended, if there be no fever; if there be, powre a fourth part of water to the milk, and boyle it untill halfe be consumed. 4. If chollar be in the bowels, Clyster. Electuari∣um. give a clyster of the decoction of French barley, with oyle of Roses or the like, then make an Electuary with conserve of Roses, Diatrion Santalon. & Syrrup. Mirt. For the poorer sort take bolearmenia,
(instead of the Diatrion sant.) Aliud. with the conserve of Roses, and Syr. Lujulae, or Myrtills. 5. If it be caused of flegmatick humours, that be gross and tough, minister the infusion of Agarick, with Mirabol. Emblici, or use clysters made with the decoction of Centory, and oyle of Rue; Cataplas∣ma. after that, apply the poultis (outward∣ly upon the stomach) which you shall find in the Chapter of Nausea, page the 67. onely in∣stead of vinegar use clarret, or red-wine, and a little cinamon; and if he be over-greedy of meat, let him use a spare diet. 6. If it be caused through weaknesse of the vertue retentive, bathe the body with oyle of of Myrtills, soure mulberries dried in the Sun, and beaten to powder, Pulvis. and drunk in some bind∣ing syrrup, do marvellously stop: This Lohoch following is good. ℞.

If Diarrhaea cometh through Rheuma∣tick matter, see the Chapter of Catarrhus.
CHAP. XL. LIENTERIA, is a certain lightnesse, . or smoothnesse of the bowels, even like as there chanceth a scarre on the outside of the body: in this disease the bowels do not hold the meat, but let it slide away before it be chan∣ged, or perfectly digested, in the same likeness that it was eaten. It is caused oftentimes through a grievous flux, Dysenteria (by name) going before, Causa. which causeth deep exulceration of the bowels, and consequently scarres; now the mouthes of the veines which draw nourishment from the bow∣els being obstructed, and the bowels being be∣come smooth, will not suffer meats to be distri∣buted, but let them slide out before they be al∣tered, this disease is many times caused through debility of the vertue retentive in the stomach: also sometimes when dropsie water is avoyded by the belly, this flux Lienteria followeth. Whatsoever causeth this flux, Signa. the sick do taste or feel no meat, there is an evill plight of the body, their excrements are pale, cruid, raw, whitish, unequal, and very watery, not mixt with blood, or choller, he feeles a burning all over the sides, loathing of meat; if soure bel∣chings do happen, it is a good sign the meats abide some while in the stomach. For the cure let him be sparing of drink, Curatio. for much is forbidden in all fluxes. 1. If it be ingendred through weaknesse of
the virtue of the stomach, search the cure in its proper Chapter, as in Imbecill. Stomachi Di∣arrhaea, and the following Chapter; But to be short, minister those things that re∣strain and strengthen the stomach and bow∣els; as syrrup of wormwood, mints, and worm∣wood wine, Oleum. is good; use outwardly oyle of ma∣stick, wormwood, mints, and myrtills, make the poultis that is set down in the former Chapter, and strew on the powder of Cinamon, Cloves, Galingale, Baulaustia, or red Roses. 2. Those that have a scarre, the eating of sharp things are profitable, for that it causeth a Refrication, and rubbing upon the scarre, it re∣nueth natural heat, therefore use scouring things with restrictive medicines, with the meat use vergis, the juyce of soure pomegra∣nates, lemonds, or the syrrup of the same, or of unripe grapes; also a clyster of the decoction of Balaustia, Clyster. sloes, French pruines, unripe grapes, and such like: some Authours do much commend vinegar, to receive the fume upon hot tile stones, others the fume of Fran∣kincense, Laud pa∣racel. and Amber, to be an excellent thing, but in all fluxes, Laudanum paracel. judicially administred two or three graines, is said to be a most sure help: Actuarius. Diacodion Weckerus. Also for the same purpose, Actuarius his Diacodion is wondrous proper, the making of which you shall find in Weckerus his antidotary, lib. 2. p. 786. After purging with Aloes or Rhubarb, or Clysters, you must streng∣then the ventricle with this Opiat following. ℞. Opiat. Riverius.

XLI. DYSENTERIA, . is an exulceration of the bowels, being tormented, and fretted very much with pain, some reckon four kindes of Dysenteria. 1. The first is when blood is sent forth by circuit, through some part of the body being cut off: or through some exercise of the former life, let passe for a time. 2. The second is when watery blood, like the water wherein new killed flesh have been washed, or soaked, (which chanceth through weakness of the liver) is sent forth. 3. The third is, when there is sent forth an humour, more shining and blacker, than that which is natural, being commixt of blood, and Melancholy. 4. The fourth kind in which by little and little, and between whiles is cast out pure blood, yet sometimes clodded, and shavings of the
bowels cometh out with pure blood, and many times thick dung, sprinkled with drops of blood; of this fourth kind I shall treat at this time, and let passe the other three. The cause of this last kind is through exulcera∣tion of the bowels, Causa. caused many times through outward cold, heat, and moystnesse, sometimes through pernicious medicines, as scammomy, eating of fruit, or sharp, and soure meates, cru∣dity, and rawness, or through sharp and gnaw∣ing humours, flowing from the whole body to the belly, or ingendred in the belly it selfe; and this doth sometimes begin after Tenasmus; the excrements are cholerick, diverse, and fatty, because the fat, that cleaveth within the bowels, is melted, so that when the Superficies of the bowels are bare, and the exulceration abiding about it, then the excrements be dreg∣gy, and bloody, but when the ulcer is pierced deeper, then there is sent forth filthinesse, ha∣ving as it were little pieces of parchment com∣mixed with it, so that if it be not stopped, it eateth the places nigh unto it, and sendeth forth such excrements, as are wont to runne from dead bodies. 1. Signa. When the small guts are exulcerate, there is pain about the Navill, the excrements are chollerick, the patient feeleth grief, and fret∣tings, and gnawings, so that the patient is not farre from fainting; they are not thirsty, and fe∣verous, the excrements are cruid and raw, and the bowel Jejunium is exulcerate sometimes, though seldom; and sometimes they vomit, and abhorre meats.
2. But if the exulceration be ingendred in the great bowels, there the ordour is pure, and much heaped together, coming out with win∣dinesse, and frothinesse; mixed with fatnesse, blood swimming aloft, the knowledge of this greatly helpeth to the cure. 1. Curatio. If the exulceration be in the upper or small bowels, you must cure it by medicines gi∣ven at the mouth. If in the great or lower bowels, it must be done by clysters, be the cause what it will, endeavour to procure rest, and give them little meat; milk is good, and Rice with milk, if there be no fever, marmalad of Quinces, Plantin boyled in the juyce of French pruins, with balaustia, no flesh, except Birds, or Rabbits, &c. Chalybs. steel quenched in run∣ning-water is good. If the stomach be weak give restringent wine not very old, amongst syrrups take plantin, knotgrasse, purslain, sharp mulberries, Balaustia, Frankincense, Terra lem∣nia, and grape curnels, all these restrain: the tallow of goats, swine, geese, and hens, these asswage the acrimony, which should be first looked to, that thereby the patient may be eased: Hares creem, Harts-horn burnt, the shells of Crabs, running water, and sage, these drie up. This clyster following is good for Dysenteria, though the cause resteth in the great bowels, as well as in the small, and better. ℞, Fol. Ros. Rub. Plantag. Centinodium, Clyster. Consol.

If the exulceration be in the small bow∣els, then give unto them such things as you shall find proper in Diarrhaea, use syrrup of dried Roses, Myrtils, and Quinces, apply this Ce∣rate outwardly. ℞.

Clyster. If there be deep excoriation, make a clyster with the decoction of brann, and ℥. ij. of deer suet, clysters of milk is good, for either of them. 2. Purgatio. If it happens through contagion of Ayre, at the first give a strong potion of Rhubarb, infused in plant in water, with a little cinamon, and then a little treakle or methridate, in cina∣mon or treakle water, is excellent. But after purging, endeavour next to procure rest, either
with Laudanum, or something else, and then give a scruple of treakle, or methridate, in &c. Theriaca mithridat. as aforesaid, forbare bleeding, or purging, ex∣cept with Rhubarb, many have been cured with Harts-horn burnt, others take hard bones of Beef, or Pork, calcined, or burned untill they be white, made into powder, and so drunk in ordinary drinks continually, with some few drops of cinamon water, and cinamon and nutmegs in powder, are good.

1. Causa. The cause is sometimes through outward cold. 2. Sometimes through sharp chollerick humours. 3. Sometimes through salt flegme. 4. Sometime through impostumation. 5. Sometimes through inflammation in∣gendred in the streight gut. 6. Sometimes the blind gut is stopped with hard dung. 1. Signa. The sign is as various: if it be caused of cold, it is known by the tale of the sick, whe∣ther he hath set on any cold stone, &c. 2. If chollerick, it is known by the colour of the humours, or excrements that com∣eth out. 3. If an impostumation, botch, or bile, there is mattery corruption flowing forth, and he feel∣eth a pricking in the fundament. 4. Inflammation causeth swelling in the right bowell, with grievous pain, together with a fever. 5. If a flegmatick humour, it is also known by the colour of the humours, or excrements. 6. If abundance of dung, it causeth distension, and streching out about the bottom of the belly. 1. Curatio. The cure is diverse, according to the di∣versity of causes: if it be caused of cold, use hot oyles, Clyster. as of Lillies, and Rew, administer clysters made with mints, origan, calamints, cammo∣mel, sothernwood, aniseed, and sennel-seed, ad∣ding oyles of dill, cammomel, or lillies. 2.

If through an ulcer, impostume or botch, look into Dysaenteria, for many times Tenasmus follows that grievous flux; Fumigatio. use a fume of fran∣kincense, and pitch, which is said to help sud∣denly, also use cooling oyles, or clysters afore∣said. If the pain be intollerable, procure rest with ungentum populi cum opio. Ʋnguentū. Adding two or three drops of oyle of nutmegs, or else minister Laudanum. 6.

It is caused many wayes, Causa. as through chole∣rick humours, sometimes through humours in the stomach, gathering wind from the liver, and milt, or from the reines of such as have the stone, or from an impostume in the wombe, sometimes from all the parts in mans body, as in fevers, where the humours are expelled from the veines to the guts, so that either it may pro∣ceed from hot and drie, or cold, and drie di∣stemperatures, but never of moyst: there are many causes, but I shall treat but of these four especially that follow. 1. Sometimes it is ingendred through gross and flegmatick humours, fallen down within the skin of the gut Colon. 2. Sometimes through windinesse, which have no room to get out. 3. Also it is caused through inflammation of the grosse and thick gut, nexing, and stretch∣ing out.
4. Lastly, through sharp and gnawing hu∣mours, which afflict the aforesaid bowell, vehe∣mently. 1. They that have it ingendred of a grosse, Signa. and flegmatick humour, they be nexed aloft, all over their Abdomen, that is, the place which is under the mouth of the stomach, especially they are grieved, where the gut Colon lyeth, for the pain is as though it is brayed, or bored with a bodkin, having a disposition to vomit, with belchings and costivenesse. 2. If it be caused of windinesse, they feel ex∣tension, and stretching forth. 3. If through inflammation, there is felt in∣ward burning, and heat, with no small fever, and costivenesse, with retention of urine, trou∣bled with thirst, vomiting of choller, without ceasing; and this is most grievous, and threat∣neth Iliaca passio. 4. If of sharp humours there is thirst, and watching, small fevers, the urine sharp, and cho∣lerick humours are sometimes thrown out; go∣ing to stool, easeth the torment, hot drinks do the same, but beware of cold drink. 1. Curatio. When gross and clammy humors do cause the chollick, there diet must be extenuate, flesh of birds, hens, Partridg, Turtles, black-birds, and doves, the flesh of calves, beware of pulse, Victus ra∣tio. for pot-herbs use fennel, Apium, Asperage, let his food be easie of digestion, ingendring good juyce, and eschew fulnesse, Vinum. he may drink wine, (a little) thin, shining, of mean age, tem∣perately allayed, yet beware of medicines, heating vehemently, Clyster. Clysters made with
Rew, Cammomel, Dill, Althaea, mellilot, with the oyles thereof, also cummin, and fenegreek, Mercury, Mallowes, and if need be hierapicra, benedicta lax, Mell Rosarum; If the patient can vomit before supper it helpeth much, some do commend a vomit after a clyster to be exceed∣ing good, Vomitus. and to sit in the decoction of Althaea, peniroyal, Decoctio. laurel leaves, fenegreek, cammomel, Motherwort, dill, &c: wine wherein worm∣wood is infused, is much commended, also Ca∣storeum one dram at a time, Castoreum. continually drunk in Aqua mulsa, destroyeth the disease utterly. 2. Clyster. If it be caused through windinesse, then this clyster, take Sothernwood, origan, peni∣royal, calamint, cammomel, ana M. j. Rew, wild mints, ana M. ss. seeds of Annise, fennel, carawayes, commin, dill, ana ʒ. ij. boyl them in a sufficient quantity of water, strain it, and adde Hierapicra, benedict, lax, ana ℥. ss. castore∣um ʒ. j. powder of Diacuminum ʒ. ij. oyles of rew, and dill, ana ℥. i. ss. common salt ʒ. i. ss. make a clyster, there may be added thereto the confection of bay-berries, which is effectual to drive away windinesse, Cataplaf. also a poultis out∣wardly of wormwood, mint, bay-berries, cina∣mon, pepper, and such like; beware of any thing that ingenders windinesse. 3. Venae sectio If it be caused through inflammation of the bowels, open a vein in the arme, if there be suppression of urine, cut the vein in the Ankle, you may use some of the aforesaid, and follow∣ing remedies, except hot and sharp things, and vehement purges, rather use clysters easing pain. 4. If it be caused of sharp and gnawing hu∣mours,
give such things as wash, without cau∣sing mordacity, and gnawing, as broath of ptisan, or the decoction of fenegreek, linseed, cammomel, Althaa, fresh Goose-grease, Clyster. Hens∣grease, and oyle of Roses, compound a clyster, or take violet leaves, Endive, Althaea, cammo∣mel, ana M.i.ss. seeds of fenegreek, and flax, of either ʒ.ss. make a decoction, adde Cassia ℥.j. hierapicra ʒ. 6.

ILIACA PASSIO, is a most painfull di∣sease, proceeding from obstructions of the small guts, which suffereth nothing to passe downwards, but their excrements many times issue out at their mouths; it differeth from the chollick in the scituation, in that it hath its place and being in the small guts, and the chollick in the great guts; this disease taketh its name from a gut called Ilion. It is caused sometimes of crudity of meates, Causae. especially fat, which commonly ingenders ob∣structions in the small guts or Ilion; sometimes of stripes in places where the small guts lye, or through vehement cold, restraining the excre∣ments, or through abundant eating, but espe∣cially drinking of cold things in a sweat, some∣times the bowels with the dung fall into the
cods, and being violently thrust back, is infla∣med, or through drinking of deadly medi∣cines, or through hard dung, impact about the thin bowell, yet for the most part Ilia∣ca passio is ingendred, either of inflammation, or obstruction, this disease is common to chil∣dren, but through the help of natural humi∣dity, they easily escape, but in ancient people it is dangerous. They that have Iliaca passio, Signa. have vehement pain, the thin and small guts are swelled, and stretched out with over-much moystness of the stomach, empty belchings, rumbling, and noyse of the bowels; and both wind and dung ants evacuation. If the disease waxe greater,  avoydeth all upward, voyding sometimes gme, and choller, and a coldness of the whole body, to some difficulty and hardnesse of breathing. To them that shall die, there chan∣ceth cold sweats, difficulty of making urin, and the fundament is so close, that it will suffer no small instrument to enter, and sometime dung is cast up by vomit, also there happeneth the hicket, Delirum, and convulsions: their wind and excrements are much stinking; these be dead∣ly signes. For the cure it must be performed in chil∣dren, Curatio. with foments, and clysters, as in the chol∣lick, but in the aged otherwise. 1. Vomitus. If it be caused of crudity and fulnesse, provoke vomit; If the stomach be free from crudity, Clyster. administer clysters as this that follow∣eth. Take Mercury, Rew, leaves of Althaeae, Centory, ana M.j. Hysope, calamint, worm∣wood,
ana M.i.ss. Root of Althaeae, ℥.j. Root of wild cowcumber, ʒ.i.ss. seeds of flax, and fenegreek, ana ʒ.iij. seeds of cummin ʒ.ij. make a decoction, strain it, and adde Benedict. lax, ℥.j. fresh butter, and honey, of Roses ana ℥.ss. oyles of Rew and Difl, ana ℥. i. ss. common salt ʒ. j. make a clyster, you may foment with oyles of Rew, and Dill: after a clyster, if need be purge, Oleum. a vomit is much commended. 2. If it happen through some venemous or poysonous medicine, give them warm water to drink, after that hot oyle to drink, or fat broath, that they may vomit; after that, Theriaca. give him The∣riaca, dissolved in wine; if it be a corroding me∣dicine, milk is commended. 3. If through inflammation, begin with phlebotomy, cast in cooling clysters, made with mallows, linseed, fenegreek, with oyle, and butter. 4. If through falling of the bowels into the cods, labour presently, (the patient lying up∣right) to thrust back the bowels, and keep them up without violence, and make a trusse. Note that Stircus Lupinum, is a remedy in Iliaca passio, Stircus Lupinum; as Album Graecum is in Augna. Lastly, if the pain be violent, use fomentations; and labour to procure rest. CHAP. XLV. VERMES, There be three kindes of them; The first round and long, named Teretes. The second be broad, Teretes. called therefore
Lati: Lati. Ascarides. the third is called Ascarides: The first kind be round, and a hand breadth in length, and sometimes longer, they be comoner than the other, and they are often in the slender and small guts, and they go into the stomach, and therefore often voyded by the mouth, and often some out at their nostrils, and this kind is peculiar to infants, children, boyes, and girles. 2. Plinius. The second be broad long, and of incre∣dible bignesse, as Pliny witnesseth, lib. 2. cap. 33. sometimes they are seen three hundred foot long, Paulus. Aetius. Paulus, and Aetius, witnesseth they are nothing else but a permutation of the thin films going about the small guts within; into a cer∣tain living body that will move and stirre. 3. The third kind be thin, short and small, and found most commonly in the right gut, and in the end of the fundament. All these be ingendred of cruid, Causae. raw, gross, and flegmatick matter, and through a kind of rottennesse in children, especially in great eaters. 1. Signa. They that have Teretes, do feel incredible gnawing of the bowels and stomach: with thin and small coughs, provoking to vomit (often times) with driness, in some yelking, with mo∣vings of the stomach, and do arise up unreaso∣nably: many do walk and leap up with noyse, and crying out, and fall asleep again, some put forth their tongue, and shut their mouth, and be quiet, & keep a silence, but do fret & fume with them that raise them; because they cannot watch, they are so weak: some have their eyes sprinkled with blood, and their pulse unequall,
obscure; fayling, and running back; to many there chanceth losse of appetite, children, while they sleep chew their tongue, and also do fast joyn their mouth, as though they sucked meat: to some gnashing of teeth, others refuse meat, for if compelled to eat, they can scarce swallow it, or else vomit it up again. In many the belly throweth out corrupt meats, being puffed up as it were a tympany: The rest of the body con∣sume without fasting, or purging, going be∣fore: sometimes the face is red about the Halles of the cheeks: but it turneth again into a swarthy colour: some speak foolish things in their sleep, like frantick persons; some change the place they lye down on, tumbling from one place to another. And a fever is increased with∣out order, with vehement coldnesse of the ex∣tream parts, having fits the third or fourth day without order: but all these signes must not be looked for in every body, but the chiefest of them. 2. Broad wormes bring continual gnawing of the stomach, and an impotent and incorrigi∣ble appetite to meat; for being in the guts, they devoure the meat, so that they have need of more straightway, or else the bowels are gnawne: there followes slendernesse and weak∣nesse of body, with inequality. The infallible signe is, if certain things like coucumber-seeds, be avoyded out with the excrements. 3. Ascarides do raise vehement itch in the fundament, and provoke the patient to go to school continually, and they that be troubled with this disease, for the most part are better
after egestion, and easing themselves. For the cure, Curatio. eschew all things that ingender flegmatick humours, but they must be fed, and not hunger: Victus ra∣tio. no hot things if there be a fever, but be diligent to get the worms out of the bo∣dy, or else they will gnaw untill they die; there∣fore first kill them, and then drive them out; these symples following are good (if there be no fever, if there be, use them outwardly or in∣wardly with some thing that is of a cooling quality) wormwood, Seryphium, a kind of wormwood growing in the Sea, Sothern∣wood, Callamint, Horehound, Dittanie, Hy∣sope, Rew, leaves of Persica, Coriander seeds, Hartshorn, Lupines, Mints, Peniroyal, Ori∣gan, Centory, Fern, Gentian, Aristolochia ro∣tunda, Garlick, seed of Coleworts, and roots of Ennula campana; but Aloes is most commended, so is wormseed; of all these you may make ei∣ther powders, decoctions, or poultices, also Pul∣vis contra lumbricos is good, Palvis. but remember to give your powders with milk, honey, or Syrrup of liquoris, because it allureth the wormes: out∣wardly you may use Bulls gall, or the oyles of some of the fore-mentioned symples; Emplastrū, and a plaister of honey and Aloes is good, also Rew and wormseed boyled in white-wine vi∣negar, Decoctio. and after it be strained, adde honey; if no fever, Pulvis. boyle it in Muscadel, or take worm∣seed ʒ. ij. centory, wormwood, harts-horne burnt, ana ʒ.j. calamint, peniroyal, origan, ana ℥.ss.

If it be an infant, and that the body be bound, apply a poultis made of cammomel, Cataplas∣ma. wormwood, mint, and porret, &c. and rost an onyon soft, stamp it with neats gall, and apply it a little above the Navill: sometimes syrrup of Rhubarb is sufficient. Hierapicra, Pilulae. and pilulae pestilentiales, or Rufie, have a marveylous effi∣cacie in killing and bringing out wormes: If there be a flux joyned, search the Chapters of fluxes, but remember to adde, with restrictive things, those things that do kill wormes, but labour to strengthen the stomach. The worm called Ascarides, in children that be infants; they must be brought out with Suppos: made with honey and salt, or such like: Supposito∣ria. Clyster. in them that be elder give clysters with some of the symples abovesaid, adding oyls of the same; but first take a piece of old powdred flesh, fa∣shion it like a suppository, fit for the fundament, Suppositor. and thrust it into the Tuel, applying a ligament or band; let it alone awhile, and then draw it out with the worms that stick on it: after this the clyster, and then anoynt the streight gut or fundament with Acatia, Hypocischidos, Acatia. juyce of Sumach, for the flesh being constrained by restri∣ctive things, looseth its ability that ingendreth wormes, and excludeth and shutteth out the Ascarides.

CHAP. XLVI. HEMORRHOIDES, is an unfolding or spreading abroad of the veines in the Tu∣el; some be blind which do swell, some be open at certain times sending forth blood. Through melancholy blood in abundance sent by the liver to those veines, Causa. is the cause of the Hemorroids. For the signe the patient cannot be ignorant of the disease, Signa. for it is easily known. If they be blind raising tormenting pain, Curatio. Venae sectio and a full body; cut the vein in the ankle, and keep the body soluble, and sit in a bath made of the decoction of mallows, Balneum. violet-leaves, melilot, fe∣negreek, cammomel, leaves of Althaea, and Lin∣seed, some get out blood by putting wooll, anoynting it with juyce of onyons, or with oxe gall; Decoctio. the best is Eldern leaves M.j. boyle them in water untill they be very tender, dip a piece of scarlet in it, apply it as warm as may be suffe∣red five or six times one after another; then lay the herbs upon the scarlet hot; Sanguisu∣gae. apply it: some use horse-leeches (with good successe) in a reed: If they bleed moderately, do not stop them, but if immoderately, weakening the patient, then stop them, Victus ra∣tio. lest a dropsie follow: therefore Rice is good with Bolearmenie: for pot-herbs, En∣dive, succory, purslaine, and marmalad of quin∣ces, and restrictive wine: open a vein in the right arme, Mixtura. Galenus. also look into dysenteria, and other fluxes: Galens medicine was frankinsence one
part, Aloes one part and a half, commix them with the white of an egge, untill it cometh to the thicknesse of honey, lay it on the soft haires of an Hare, and apply it to the bleeding place, bound outwardly with bands; If they bleed not, Pulvis. the best thing is rosemary, mother-time, sweet Marjoram, of either a like quantity in powder, and a little frankinsence, mixe them for a fume, Ʋnguentū. or take May butter, or Pork suet, of the best, halfe a pound, Ivie leaves four handfuls, stamp them, and then boyle them together, straine them for an oyntment; also the fume of the parings of a stone-horse hoof, I have used with good successe, Lastly, ℞.

It is caused of vapours grosse, and windiness, hard to digest; sometimes of viscous humours in the ends of the veines, springing from the flat part of the liver. 1. Signa. If grosse and vaporous windinesse want∣ing free passage, doth ingender obstruction,
there ariseth heavinesse and griefe about the right side, and a feeling of distention, and stretching out. 2. If through viscous humours, there is hea∣vinesse, pain, easie, and sometimes vehement with a fever, and sometime without, especially when the patient useth vehement moving after meat, when the body is stopped, there is prick∣ing and extension. Give hot meates, Curatio. Victus Ratio. having virtue to take away obstruction, as be leeks with oximel, sperage, fennel, parsley, capers, these in pottage, wine thin and old, Catalogus symplicium. is good; also these symples, wolves liver, fumitory, Agrimony, cammomel, galin∣gall, Dragons root, Asaron, Anise, Apium, wormwood, Cassia, Ireos, liqueris, Raphonti∣cum, Rhub. arb.

If the disease be inveterate, use purging with Rhubarb: pills and bleeding, Venae sectio is good; when the hollow part of the liver is vexed, purge by the belly: If the em∣bossed part of the liver be vexed, purge by urine; but this Electuary following is good. ℞.

HEPATIS INFLAMMATIO there is, Causa. as well as in other members, and through the same causes that they be ingengred of. If the liver be vexed with inflammation, Sgna. there is felt pain and heavinesse all over the right side, with swelling in the place; he hath a sharp fever, a small and drie cough, insatiable thirst, abhorring of meats, difficulty of breath∣ing, the tongue is first red, and after that black, vomiting pure choller; the body is costive, the colour of the body is changed like Icterus: they have the hicket. In their fit they rave, voyding forth sharp urine: The inflammation that chan∣ceth through causes in the crooked and hollow parts of the liver, have the foregoing symptoms, but if ingendred in the outward and round part of the liver, it causeth greater pain in draw∣ing breath, and a greater cough than the other: And sometime the Muscles leaning upon the liver be inflamed, causing the skin round about
to be stretched with swelling, sometimes a swel∣ling fashioned like the liver, which is a true signe In the beginning open the liver vein, Curatio. Venae sectio which hath society with vena causa, draw out a large quantity, Clyster. if nothing forbid: the next intention must be to administer a cooling clyster: foment with oyle of Quinces, and Roses, putting to it odoriferous wine: Ceratum. Ceratum Santalinum, is good: remember that restrictive things do exceed those that mollifle and loosen when the heat is vehement: on the contrary, when it decreases, let those that mollify exceed the other: beware you do not apply things cold, but warm them a little: Fomenta∣tio. foment with the decoction of worm∣wood, mellilot, red roses, cammomel, dill, plantin, endive, and in vehement pain, juyce of liqueris in hot water, or juyce of endive with honey: Vietus ra∣tio for their diet Ptisan, and chicken broath; in the first boyle Apium, in the second parsley, also barley broath is good. If the inflammation change to suppuration, the aforesaid signes will increase, as paines, fe∣ver, Decoctio.

LIENIS INFLAMMATIO, Causa. the spleen is nexed with inflammation, as oft as hot blood flowes thither unnaturally. It is known by heavinesse, Signa. and swelling of the left side, which will not give place to the feel∣ing; also it's known by pain, stretching out of the place, by burning heat, and fevers: and if abundance of humours rush in thither, it is known by the greatnesse, and swiftnesse of the ingendring the inflammation. For the diet look, Curatio. into the foregoing Chap∣ter.
First open the Salvatella vein, Venae-sectio between the little and ring-singer, wash the belly often with Clysters; if he may not bleed, this fomenta∣tion is good.

LIENIS SCIRRHƲS, Inflammation of the spleen not rightly cured, draweth to∣gether a hard swelling of the spleen: Causa. The cause is a certain humour cleaving stubbornly to the spleen; but it is when hardnesse ingendreth without inflammation, in over-much swel∣ling. It is easily known by touching, Signa. of what cause soever it be. His diet must be easie of digestion, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. Exercitium he may drink pure wine, being without all restriction: exercise before meat is excellent, strong potions are good, root of capers are good: Harts-tongue, the root and herb of Tamariscus sodden
in vinegar or oximel; juyce of centory drunk the decoction of bitter lupines, rew and pep¦per. Iron often quenched in wine is a conveni∣ent remedy, if a fever quench it in Posca: steele is commended; also wormwood, Cassia, Chalybs. Ani∣seeds, &c. you may make a fomentation with the symples above mentioned: oyle of capers, lillies, and ireos, are good: Ʋng. Dialthaeae, fe∣negreek, linseed, Goose-grease, Hens, and Badgers grease: Gum Ammoviacum, Bdellium, and Galbanum, being first dissolved in vinegar are good; Opoponax, myrrhe, and frankincense, of these may be made Cerates: Cucurbia culae. Some commend cupping-glasses. Si non adest febris, dentur spe∣cies diacurcumae, trochisci de capparibus, de absyn∣thio, rhabarbara, &c. CHAP. LI. OBSTRƲCTIO LIENIS: Causa. It chanceth not only through weaknesse of the attractive vertue in the spleen, but also through stopping of the passage from the liver unto the spleen; after that naughty blood is distributed over the whole body, it being corrupt, and inclineth to blackness, and sometimes hath uncurable ul∣cers: the causes are the same with that of Ob∣structio hepatis. It is known by heaviness on the left side, Signa. by the colour of the face, difficulty of breath∣ing, and troublesome dreams. The diet, with plenty of remedies, Curatio. you shall find in the Chapter of obstruction of the liver;
but remember the spleen requires strong medi∣cines, and hath need of preparatives before purging: the purging medicines you shall find in the former Chapter. Lastly, ℞. Electuari∣um. Sennertus.

It is caused sometimes through corrupti∣on of blood without a fever, or through biting of venemous beasts, and so the blood is made chollerick: sometimes through diseases of the spleen, and also weakness of the bladder may be the cause, or through obstruction and debil∣lity of the vessels, whose mouthes are derived from the gall, to the liver. When choller burst out to the skin, Signa. by rea∣son of a good Crisis in fevers, the excrements and urine be of natural colour. 1. If there be heaviness under the right side, it signifies inflammation of the liver, by whose violence the blood is changed, and sent over all
the body: If no fever, and yet heaviness under the right side, white excrements are avoyded in them, judge obstruction in the passages of the bladder; If such egestions come forth without heaviness, the attractive vertue from the liver, or the expulsive vertue which driveth out to the bomels is weak, and sometimes chollerick hu∣mours be sent out abundantly with the urine, making the froath as yellow as saffron. 2. If melancholy be sent to the skin, toge∣ther with the blood, they be vexed with sad∣ness, gnawing in the belly, difficulty of breath∣ing, abhorring of meat, voyding black urine, and dung being costive; but contrary, if yellow choller causeth the Jaundies, indeed the whites of the eyes and face do betoken the cause: how∣ever there is a sluggishness in either, and their veines under the tongue are swelled. 1. If caused of a good Crisis, Curatio. Oleum. when the fever is ended, use a moyst and extenuating diet; use frictions with oyles of Cammomel, Dill, &c. 2. If through biting of a venemous beast, you must search the cure in some other Chap∣ter following; the cure is much like that of the biting of a mad dog. 3. If through distemper or inflammation of the liver, look into the proper Chapters. 4. If through obstruction of the bladder, Venae-sectio use blood-letting, and purging; If the liver be af∣fected, open the Basiltea: If the spleen, cut the vein in the left arm; Clyster. make clysters with En∣dive, Hore-hound, Agrimony, Maiden-haire, Wormwood, seeds of Anise, fennel, parsley, sperage the roots of liqueris, Apium, and fennel,

The juyce of horse-radish with white-wine is good: you may pick many re∣medies out of the foregoing words in this Chapter: rosemary boyled in the former oyls to bathe with, is good. Also Chalybs prepared ℥.j. Infusio. dissolved in white-wine, pinte. j. and drunk a little at a time, is excellent.
CHAP. LIII. CACHEXIA, . is an evill disposition of body, being spread abroad with weariness, and all over, the flesh is loose, and wax∣eth soft. For the most part it is caused of a long sick∣ness, Causa. also it followeth when some intraile is hardened; especially, the hardness of the liver, and spleen; also in a continual Dysenteria, and the disease called Caliacus morbus; or through letting of some accustomed excretion. The whole body is made whitish and weak, Signa. his legs being scarce able to bear him; in the be∣ginning appetite remaineth, but afterward fol∣lowes abhorring of meat: their breathing sel∣dom and weak, the belly sending out unequal excrements; old men and children are chiefly taken with this disease, which soon perish through weakness of the vital faculty: If it continue long, it turneth into the dropsie. A thin and dry diet is best, wine that is white, Curatio. Victus ra. tio. thin and odoriferous is best: If nothing forbid, draw away a little blood at several times, if it happen through retention of Hemroyds or Menstruis: But in them that abound with vi∣tious humours, bleeding is hurtfull, and purg∣ing is better; after purging use exercise, deam∣bulations, frictions with linnen, and oyles: Exercitiū. some commend waters springing from Allum, Salt-peter, and sulpher, a potion of wormwood is commended; also this powder following:
Take nutmegs, mace, saffron, of either two pe∣niworth, Pulvis. powder them fine, and adde a quar∣ter of a pound of sugar, and three peniworth of prepared steel: if it turn into the dropsie, turn to the next Chapter.

This kind of dropsie is caused through great coldness of the liver, Causa. or other parts that be
cooled, which bringeth the liver into the same affect; as the coldness of the spleen, stomach, Bowels, Lungs, Reines, and Midriffe: some∣times through unmeasurable voyding of Hem∣royds, or Menstruis, or through their retenti∣on: for in all these the liver hath no unnatu∣ral swelling, and yet the dropsie followes onely through refrigeration of the liver: sometimes it waxeth hard, as is seen in those that drink cold water, and so cool the liver on heaps, and so the dropsie follows before it be lifted up into a knotty swelling: sometimes it followeth the Gout; loathing of meat; evil state of body; Jaun∣dies, Caeliacus morbus, and dysenteria. The whole body swelleth, Signa. and is like a dead body: and there is difficulty of breathing, hea∣vinesse, naughty colour, and thirst: women are lesse troubled with the dropsie then men; but children for the most part are taken with Ana∣sarca; this is least dangerous. First, if age and strength will suffer, Curatio. and that there be retention of Hemroyds, or Menstruis, draw blood; Secondly, purge with Jalap, Jalapum. Cambogiae. Vinum absinth. or Rhubarb, or Gambogiae, gr. 12. with syrrup of wormwood; also wormwood-wine and beer is good: purge often, and not too much at once. Elder roots sodden in wine are good; you shall find remedies enough in obstruction of the liver, you must provoke urine with broom-flowers, Vinum genistae. M. ij. in white-wine quar. 1. also eringa roots boyled in broath, are good. Take wormwood, flowers of broom, hysop, tops of red nettles, ana M.j. chop them small, seeds of annise, fennel, carraway, ana ℥.j. bruise them, mixe them,
and knead them into a loaf of wheat bread, lb. iv. bake it drie, then break it into small pie∣ces, and put it into a ferkin of strong drink, when it is well wrought, let it stand a week, and then let the patient drink of it often: or take a dry broom faggot, half a peck of bean hulls, three handfulls of dry wormwood, Lixivium diuret. and with dry ash burn them to ashes, make lye of it: you may make a small quantity, for it will not keep: for the liver, Pulvis. take powder of Diacurcuma ℈.j. powder of Diatrion santalon, Diarrhodon Abbatis ana ʒ.ss. nutmegs, spicknard, an. ℈.j.ss.

Take leven lb. ss. Turpintine ℥.iv. make them like a poultis or pulpe with white-wine vinegar, spread it on a thick cloth, strew one ounce of Cantherides in powder, apply it one night to the swelled legges; smalledge broath is good, Victus ra∣tio. Exercitium with parsely, rosemary, &c. A drie diet must be, and exercise is excellent: this drink is much commended. Take a pint of the ashes of bean hulls, put it into a quart of water, and a
quart of white-wine, set it on the fire, Potius di∣uretica. and stirre it all the while untill it begin to boyle, then set it by one hour or two, then powre it from the ashes through a cloth, and adde twelve ounces of syrrup of Dialthaea, brue it together, and drink a quarter of a pint at a time, last at night, and first in the morning, mid forenoon, and mid afternoon. If bound, administer a cly∣ster twice or thrice a week: candid Eringa roots are very good to eat at meals. Hercul. Saxon. Elaterium.

CHAP. LV. ASCITES: . this kind of dropsie swells the whole body, except the upper parts there∣of, which are not puffed; and if you strike it, there is heard a sound like as a bottle, that is not full of water, being shugged: The upper parts drie away. It is caused through much waterish humours, Causa. heaped up between the skin or filme, called Se∣ritoneum, and the bowels: also weaknesse of the liver, &c. For the sign, Signa. the body doth not pit when pres∣sed: the pulse is feeble, swift and small; short∣nesse of breath, heavinesse, thirst, &c. as in the former Chapter their legs swell. Let his diet be easie of digestion, Curatio. Victus Ratio.

TYMPANITES, . Causa. is also properly called Hydrops, as well as Anasarca: It is caused of wind and water, swelling the belly, so that it is stretched out. The signe is, Signa. the belly is puffed up higher than that of Ascites, the navil is thrust forth, if one clap upon it, it gives a noyse or sound, and all the other parts of the body wax leane: this kind is most dangerous. There diet is like the other, Curatio. Exercitiū. but more espe∣cially windy things are to be avoyded: exer∣cise is good, and thirst doth succour the pati∣ent. First purge as aforesaid: also clysters, Clyster. as in Ascites, onely you may adde in the boyling,
roots of Apium, fennel, parsely, rew, melilote, in the streining Hierapicra, Electuarium è baccis lauri, and oyle of Dill: you must provoke urine, and dissolve windines, of this look into the Chap∣ter of the chollick, it will help much: for poul∣tises look into Anasarca, Emplastrū.

CHAP. LVII. MIGTƲS SANGƲINIS, is a disease of the reines, through the which thin whey∣ish blood is pissed. It is caused through weaknesse of the reines, Causa. being not able to divide the urine, or through amplitude of the reines, breaking of a vein in the reines, caused through lifting or leaping: sometimes sharp humours gnaw the reines, flowing from above; also stones in the reines may be the cause. If this disease be caused through weaknesse, Signa. the blood is wheyish; If through amplitude and largenesse of the veines, they feel no pain: If through breaking of a vein, then the blood cometh forth abundantly: If through gnawing humours, the blood is sent forth by little and little, with pain vexing the reines: If through a stone, look into its proper Chapter. If through weaknesse of the reines, Curatio. rest pro∣fiteth, black wine, and restrictive meats, Se spu∣tum sanguinis; abstain from carnal copulation, Venus. and diuritick things, harts-horn with wine, or juice of Marygolds is good: Decoctio. and Lapis Hemati∣tis: also the decoction of knot-grasse, Syr. de ro∣sis succis, myrtils, sheeps milk, ℥.iv. mixed with a dram of Bolearmoniack, is onely praised; Bolusarus. and loafe-sugar with it is not amisse: look into the Chapter of Dysenteria: also myrtill berries, pomegranet rinds, and Balaustia, give meats of good juyce; sometimes blood is curded in the bladder, then cleanse, but first dissolve, and
then use astringent things, Venae sectio as aforesaid: If through breaking of a vein, or gnawing of sharp humours, open a vein in the same side: draw blood by little & little: If there be inflam∣mation, give cooling things inwardly and out∣wardly, and avoyd sharp and salt things; If an exulceration be left, look into the same Chap∣ter. If it be caused by certain circuits, the cure is the same. Aq. sperm. ranarum. Aq. sperm. ranarum is most excel∣lent, especially if there be inflammation, or ex∣ulceration. CHAP. LVIII. INFLAMMATIO RENƲM, is an in∣flammation of the reines, Causa. caused through corrupt humours and medicines, which ingen∣dreth inflammation of the reines, and espe∣cially continual and vehement ridings; also stripes may be the cause. There is a beating pain behind about the joynt of the back, Signa. a little above the bastard ribs: the pain stretching inwards towards the liver; the right side reine most commonly is vexed, and also the bladder; privie members, loynes, hips, share, and thighs: weaknesse of limbs: their extream parts are cold, as the calves of the legs, and feet: there is difficulty of making urine: in the beginning it's thin and watery, but after∣wards more rubicund, gross, and filthy; a ve∣hement fever, a disposition to vomit, gnawing of the stomack, and vomiting of choller; this is when it comes to a Nephritick passion: some
are vexed with sweats and faintings, costive∣nesse of body, puffings up with wind, and ab∣horring of meat. First, his diet must be of a cooling quality, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. Phleboto∣mia. and thin; Secondly, bleed the Basilica vein on the same side, and after the Saphena: beware of hot diureticks, and acrid medicines; as scam∣mony: use outwardly oyle of roses, and quinces: cooling clysters with Cassia is very good, Olcum. or Cassia inwardly with syrrup of violets: also to drink Aq. sperm. ranarum, is excellent; Aq. sperm. ranarum. fasting is hurtful; use diureticks (when the Absessus is bro∣ken) as parsley, and fennel: in clysters, put in oyls of roses, violets, and cammomel: If you want more, look into the Chapters of other inflammations; and the Chapter of ulcers in the reines; for the which honey and milk is good. This clyster following is proper in the inflam∣mation of the kidneys. ℞. Rad. althaeae ℥.j. fol. malvae, violar.

The cause is continual crudity and rawnesse of the stomach, whereby much grosse and earthly humours are heaped up together,
which being parched with a burning fiery heat about the reines, hardneth into a stone: The stones do sometimes differ in greatnes, and figure; colour and sharpness; they are black, whitish, and pale. They feel grievous pain in the reines, Signa. even as it were a bodkin thrust through, and yet no swelling without; he have much adoe to turn his back bone: the leg against the diseased rein is astonied, with abhorring of meat and vo∣miting: the urine is sometime pissed forth little in quantity and watery: afterward followeth perfect suppression of urine: the womb avoyd∣deth nothing, yet maketh many proffers to go to the stool; sometimes blood is avoyded through the violence of the stones, especially if they be sharp: the urine hath gravelly residence, when the stone is removed: If the stones be light and round, they are easily sent forth, but very hard if they be long and sharp. For the cure, Curatio. if thou wouldst first prevent it in any person, prohibit fulnesse of diet, and all such things as ingender gross and obstructive juyce, unleasened and light bread, gross and new ale, and beer, with new and unsetled wines, and their exercises must be mean; also let them avoyd cheese and milk, and plenty of flesh: all things that do heat and inflame the liver and kidneys are to be avoyded; let him not stand with his back against the fire, sallets are good, Victus ra∣tio. and let his meat be such as yeeld nourish∣ment; as veal, pullets, chickens, partridges, doves, larks, and hedge-sparrowes, which is said to be best: Cassia. Cassia is much commended to
be given in a good quantity with syrrup of vio∣lets. Althaeae, maiden-haire, or lymonds; the broath of Althaeae is very good, with the roots of parsely, fennel, cicers, and the root and seed of saxifrage, with a little new butter: ℞. Bolus. Tere∣binth. venet ℥.j. aut ℥.i.ss. let it be washed in saxifrage water, take it in wafers, also some of the aforesaid syrrups taken in Aq. sperm. rana∣rum, cannot but be excellent, wine of Alkekengie, Vinum. and also the milk of an asse is much commen∣ded by Aetius: also syrrup of marrich mallows, Aetius. Potius diuret. taken in parietary, saxifrage, or onion water is good. Secondly, if the stone be ingendred, if there be a plethorick body, and strong, some will ad∣vise the vein in the ham of that leg that is asto∣nied to be cut, and also purging, Phleboto∣mia. if nothing for∣bid it, otherwise take this clyster following. ℞.

A cataplasme made with wheat meale, linseed, fenegreek, lupines, cam∣momel, fennel roots, beaten well, and leaves of Althea: If the stone stick fast, or rest quietly in the kidneys, beware of diureticks: you must first loosen the reines with foments, and cata∣plasmes, as aforesaid, and if the stone shall hap∣pen to fall into the bladder, or yard, and so stop
the urine; then make use of a silver Cathetur, and diureticks; the blood of the goat in saxi∣frage water is good: Elect. Dulcis. the ancients use Justinum, or Elect. Dulcis: In the fit you may use clysters, bathes, unction, Cassia, turpentine, to disturb the stone, use the clyster abovesaid, to which may be added in the boyling cammomel; roots of parietary, and aniseed, in the streining hony of of violets ℥.j. venus turpentine ℥. ss. oyles of scorpions, ʒ. ij. aut ℥. ss. give syrrup Dial∣thaea, Syr. alth. to make the passages slippery in some diuretick water: but this is to be noted, that if the stone be old or hard, it is in vain to use diu∣reticks, but if it be sand, and small stones, then use those things aforesaid: If you want more, look into the Chapter of obstructions, and the three kinds of dropsies; and also into the Chap∣ter of inflammation of the reines. Hercul. saxonia lib. 3. cap. 41. p. 346.

DIABETES, is a disease about the reines, causing much thirst, and what is drunk, is pissed out again, even as it is taken. It is ingendred of weaknesse of the retentive vertue of the reins, Causa. but the attractive vertue is so strong, that it sucketh the whole body through immoderate heat, causing a stubborn thirst. For the sign, they drink continually, Signa. because the drink they take passeth swiftly out again: their bowels seem to burn, the loynes swell up, and the stones and haunches; also gnawing in the bowels, a wrinkled stomach, the body is lean with consuming. If there be fulness of blood, bleed in the arm, Curatio. Venae-sectio Victus ra∣tio. if nothing forbid it.

VLCERIS RENƲM, To an inflamma∣tion suppurated, there doth succeed a great and hollow ulcer, which is seldom or ne∣ver cured; for the continual passage of urine hinders the consolidation of the ulcer, the cure consists in exsiccation and drying. It is caused through breaking of the veine in the reines, Causa. through sharp and gnawing humours carried into the reines. There is pain in the loynes, Signa. with heavinesse;

CHAP. LXII. CALCƲLƲS VESICAE, stones in the blad∣der, ingender oftner in children, than in elder folk. It is caused through grosse and thick urine, Causa. that is carried into the bladder, and setleth there, and through the heat that is in children, breedeth into a stone. The sign is, Signa. often itching with handling their members, which are swollen; and making wa∣ter continually, being vexed with a strangury, their urine is cruid and waterish, with white sand: to be certain, the chirurgian may use the Catheter, yet many have been deceived, be∣cause the stone is sometimes wrapped in a coat of clammy flegme, so that it yeilds no sound. The cure is much alike to the stone in the reines, Curatio. only if possible use stronger diureticks: excellent authours affirm, Sectio. the safest way is to cure it by section, and not to strive so long with saxifrage, because it wasteth the spirits; so in the end they are not able to indure to cure: To inject oyle of scorpions is much commended, Ol. Scorpi∣enum. and to anoynt the perinaeum with it: also the powder of the stone that is found in the gall of an oxe, the stones of spunges in powder, and goats blood being warm, Pulv. sem. gemistae. and injected with a syringe; also broom-seed in powder, and drunk in white-wine: also this ℞. following is much commended, Infusio. Take parietary of the wall, and parsley, of either a handfull; a good great
red onion; bruise them grosly, then put them into a quart or three pintes of white-wine, let them stand all night, in the morning straine them, and adde ℥. 4. of syrrup of marsh mal∣lowes: you may infuse Juniper berries with it: Bacc. Ju∣niperi. in this drink will be fit to take any diuretick powder: Raphanus Rusticanus. also horse-radish roots are much com∣mended.

IN FLAMMA VESICAE, Hippocrates according to Hippocrates, it is for the most part deadly: he saith, Si vesica sit dura, & dolore vexetur, Fu∣nestum eoque magis si accedat Febris continua. They are vexed with a sharp fever, Signa. they watch, rave, and speak they wot not what; they vomit pure choller, and they cannot make wa∣ter, the share is hard with vehement pain, and have a desire to the stoole: as in Tenasmus the order is thin, and sometimes the wombe is costive. For the cure, bleeding first in the arm, Curatio. Phlebotomiae Clyster. and afterward in the foot is much commended; but first a cooling clyster to ease pain: nourish the bladder with oyle, wherein is sodden dill, linseed, rew, or fenegreek, or Althaea; and re∣member the bladder is full of sinewes, and therefore cold things are hurtfull: I conceive
that Aq. Mixtura. sperm. ran. with syrrup dialtheae given warm, must needs be proper: If there be neces∣sity, use a syringe to draw out the urine, but be∣ware of strong diureticks, wine, sharp things, and spices: Victus ra∣tio. and let their diet be thin, and of a cooling quality. In inflammatione vesicae valent cadem, quae in inflammatione renum. Hartmannus. CHAP. LXIV. VLCERIS VESICAE, Causa. It is caused either through some byle or botch, or swelling, which hath been before, or through some rup∣ture, or gnawing of a flux. There followeth sharp pain of the bladder, Signa. casting out matter: when the ulcer is foul and filthy, the matter is more slimy and dreggy: sometimes thin skins like leaves and wooll are sent out. If the ulcer spread abroad and feed deep, the urine is bloody, mattery, and stink∣ing; also there is difficulty of making water, and rising up of the yard: if there be pain about the pubes, it sheweth the ulcer to be in the blad∣der. If pain be in the perinaeum, then the ulcer is in the neck of the bladder; If in the yard, in the uriter: note that ulcers of the bladder be incurable, or at least very hard to cure, as well because the bladder is sine wey; as also because the urine which is of nature sharp, doth con∣tinually touch the ulcers, and so gnaweth them, that it will not suffer them to con∣glutinate. For the cure, Curatio. if he have a fever, which for the
most part is annexed with it; labour to quench it: milk is much commended, Lac. Clyster. either drunk or injected: make a clyster with mallowes, fene∣greek, linseed, cucumber-seed, &c. when you administer it, let the Patient lye groveling upon his knees: Pilulae. give milk and honey to scoure and cleanse the ulcers: pills of Alkakengie with opium, are commended to ease pain: If you would stop the ulcer from spreading, use loti∣ons made with bolearmenie, and barley water: Mel. rosa. Mel rosarum injected with milk is a good clean∣ser: also Syrrup. rosarum ciccarum in barley wa∣ter, to inject is good: what is wanting else, you shall find remedies enow in the Chapter of Ulceris renum. Yet you may (according to Fontanus directions) use this injection follow∣ing, every fourth day. ℞. Mucilaginis, seminis altheae, Injectio.

Suppressio urinae in Latin; it is a disease in which the urine of the Patient is stopped. It is caused sometimes through weaknesse of the bladder, Causa. not being able to thrust out
that which is contained in it; it is also caused of grosse humours, or of a stone congealed: some∣times of inflammation, or of hardness: some∣times by a piece of flesh, or hard knob ingen∣dred in the passage of urine: also of clodded blood: also it is caused of matter sent down to the reines or liver, or from some other part: also through over-long holding of the urine: also through the obtuse sence of the bladder. If stopping of the urine be caused through weaknesse of the bladder, Signa. it may be known by their diet, and course of life: If of the stone, you may know that by the signes in the Chap∣ter of the stone. If through inflammation or swelling, it is known by pain, fever, and sight; if through a piece of flesh or knob, is may be known by putting in an instrument; and also if the knob or boyle be broken, there com∣eth out blood, or fragments of flesh: if clotted blood be the cause, there went before pissing of blood. 1. Curatio. For the cure, if it be caused through im∣becillity of the bladder, use heating things; as pasneps, Apium. fennel, Apium, sperage, smalledge, &c. after diureticks, the palsie drink were good. 2. If through gross humours, then use those things that cut and divide, Decoctio. as oximel, decoction of hysope, peniroyal, origan, thime, and inject oyle of lillies, &c. 3. If through clodded blood, horse-radish roots infused in white-wine is good: Raphanus Rustica. in drink motherwort, stichas, wormwood, sothern∣wood, &c.
4. If through inflammation, look into its proper Chapter. 5. If through a piece of flesh, give such things as spread abroad the pipe and conduit of urine, Syphon. as in the Chapter of the stone in the reines: also the using of a syringe is good. 6. If through a dull sence of the bladder, it must be cured, even as the weaknesse thereof is cured, onely beware of strong diureticks. 7. If through holding their urine too long, stand so as the neck of the bladder may leane downward, and lay both your hands about the share, & press it, thrusting out the urine by little & little; and thus he may do, in the dull sence of the bladder, which some I think do but suppose may be the cause of Ischuria; some commend clysters of parietary, cammomel, Nasturtium, Clyster. majoram, peniroyal, Origanum: plenty of reme∣dies you may find in the Chapter of the dropsie and stone.

ʒ. ss. Fontanus lib. 3. cap. 36. pag. 437. CHAP. LXVI. DYSƲRIA: . Causa. urinae difficultas, is a disease wherein the urine is hardly pissed: It is caused through weaknesse, and coldness of the bladder, sometimes through gross humours. Weakness and coldness is known by the pa∣tients words; Signa. and the thinnesse and whitenesse of the urine. For the cure, Curatio. Diacur. cuma. Oleum. Hercul. Saxon. Diacurcuma is commended: and to noursh the share with oyles of Rew, Dill, Lillies, and Castoreum: there is plenty of remedies in the other foregoing Chapter, and thither I referre you. Hercules Saxonia saith, that Curatio dy suriae, quando provenit ex humoribus permistis cum urina, habet omnes has intentiones, ut evacuentur, revellantur, deriventur, contemperen∣tur, & partes à quibus gener antur, corrigantur.

CHAP. LXVII. STRANGƲRIA: Stillicidium urinae; . is a di∣sease, whereas the urine distilleth down by drops, or by little and little, and causeth a con∣tinual provoking to piss. It is caused through the sharpnesse of urine, Causa. or by exulceration of the bladder, inflamma∣tion, or an impostume of the liver or reines; which being broken, and sending the filth to the bladder, through the shar pness it causeth continual desire to pisse: In old men some∣times sharp humours is the cause. Sharpness is known when the urine is chol∣lerick, and gnawing about the bladder: Signa. An exulceration of the bladder, an impostumation of the liver, and reines, are known by the signes mentioned in their proper Chapters. For the cure, Curatio. in aged persons some com∣mend exceeding much, (as Galen. lib. 5.) Galenus. Terebinthi∣na. Cassin. Phleboto∣mia. Clyster. Turpintine washed in plantine water: If there be sharp humours, with inflammation, and a young body, bleed and purge with Cas∣sia in whey: but beware of hot things; and ma∣ny diureticks: Clisters are good of Mallowes, purslain, violets, cucumber seed, beware of salt things, and sharp things: Lac. also hot milk in∣deed is the best thing to asswage pain: to the former clyster adde Althea, water-lillies, in the boyling: and Cassia fistula, sugar, oyle of violets and roses in the streining. Lastly, Aq. sperm. ranarum. Aqua spermat. ranarum, is most excellent. Yet these
emulsions following are much commended by Gorraeus in his Treatise de formul. Gorraeus. remed. pag. 158. ℞. Emulsio.

CHAP. LXVIII. VRINAE INCONTINENTIA, is an in∣voluntary pissing, by reason of the palsie of the bladder. 1. Causae. The muscle Sphincter being resolved through coldness and moysture, or the nerves that spring from os sacrum, being ill affected; the urine goeth away against the will of the pati∣ent. Galenus. Galen defineth  to be , The way of the humours in the veines. 2. Besides imagination, which doth chiefly
work in us when we are asleep; there happen∣eth also a laxness of the round muscle, caused by the abundance of urine; and the sharpness thereof do provoke urine, as that some persons pisse their bed. For the first, Curatio. a purgation of the infusion of seane and Agarick. 1. A bag of primula veris, Ina arthretica, Sacculus. Sal∣via, majorana ex floribus Anthos, Stacados, and cammomel; which may be applyed to the pubes, perinaeum, and also to the loines: also anoynt those places with oyles de castoreo, costi, Oleum. cinnamomi, vulpis; remember to make that strengthening decoction set down in paralysis, Decoctio. but make it with wine: you may inject the oyls and waters of sage, primroses, rew, Injectio. and Steca∣dos; promise no short cure, for it ever proves long and difficult. 2. For the latter, some use Pil. de quinque gener. Pilulae. myrobolanorum: or you may infuse two dragmes of rhubarb in the decoction aforesaid: or a cly∣ster, wherein dissolve Oleum nervale; Pulvis. some commend Vesica capre, suis, Tauri, being dried in an oven, and powdered; and ʒ. j. or two given in wine, or the decoction aforesaid: Aetius. Aetius commends the lungs of a goat to be rosted, and eaten fasting a mornings: the testicle of a hare boyled in wine, the wine to be drunk, and the stones eaten: It is a common thing, and confir∣med by Galen, to give Farcimen ex muribus. Galenus. FINIS. .
CHAP. I. LIB. II. EPHEMERA in Greek, . Di∣aria febris in Latin, in English one day fever; The Patient having but one fit, and so for the most part finished in one day of his own nature: It is the spirit or breath that is inflamed. Galenus. Galen cal∣leth it, A simple fever. A fever properly is an unnaturall heat, Definitio febris. which taking his beginning at the heart, is spread by the arteries and veines into the whole body, and doth let and hurt the operation of it. Now of simple fevers some reckon three kinds; an unnatural heat ingendred in the spi∣rits of breath causeth Ephemera, or Diaria (as aforesaid) whereof be two kinds, that is, Ephe∣mera, Simpliciter or Diaria: Secondly, Diaria plu∣rium dierum, otherwise called Synochus non pu∣trida, enduring three or four dayes: unnatural heat ingendred in the humours, causeth Putri∣da febris, a rotten fever; they do not in two pla∣ces, within the vessels, and that two wayes; for either all the humours do putrifie and rot equally, and cause a fever called Synochus putri∣da: or one only humour putrifieth, and so cau∣seth a continual fever. If there be putrifaction of choller, it causeth a
continual Tertian, or a burning fever: If of flegme, it causeth a continual Quotidian. If of melancholy, it causeth a continual Quartan. If they rot without the vessels, then they cause an intermitting fever: for if there be putre∣faction of choller, it causeth an intermitting Tertian; If of flegme that is sweet, an intermit∣ting quotidian, exquisite and pure. If of flegm that is glasen, it causeth Epialos: Epialos. If of melan∣choly, an intermitting fever Quartan. The cause of Ephemera is, Causa. when as the breath is inflamed, and heat above nature without any putrefaction or rottennesse: also through watchings, crudities, lack of digestion, sad∣nesse, fear, vehement care of mind, kernels in the throat, and such like; which heat and in∣flame the spirits, and the whole body. 1. The signes are six: first, Signa. the pulse are greater, swifter, and oftner. 2. Secondly, their urine is like a haile bo∣dies urine. 3. Thirdly, their heat is gentle and easie. 4. Fourthly, the fever endeth on a sudden. 5. Fifthly, there wants evill symptomes, as pain of the head, stomach, &c. 6. Sixthly, they are alwayes ingendred of an outward cause. 1. If watching be the cause, there is heavi∣ness of the eyes, swartness of the face. 2. If of anger, there is rednesse of the face and eyes, with a swift pulse. 3. If care and sorrow be the cause, there is a noughty colour, heaviness of the body, hol∣lowness of the eyes, swartness of the face.
4. If of Sun-burning, the head is hot, and their veines sometimes puffed up. 5. If through cold, there followes distilla∣tions and Rhumes. 6. If of wearinesse, the skin is dryer. 7. If through drunkennesse and hunger, it is known by the telling of the sick. 8. If through swelling about the throat, their pulse is great, swift, and often with a red and swelled face. If there be inflammation, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. Vinum. and want of rest, let his diet be cold and moyst: white-wine that is thin is much commended in all diary fevers, except there be headache: Galenus. It helps digestion, provokes urine, and procureth sweat; Galen commendeth baths and gentle sweatings: oyles of Ireos, Oleum. and Nardinum to anoynt outwardly is good: juyce of ptisan and lettice in broath: If there be crudity in the stomach, wash the belly with clysters, bathing it with oyle of wormwood, Oleum ab∣synthii. and procure rest, which digest∣eth crudity marvellously. And if nothing for∣bid, administer this clyster. ℞. Clyster. Carolus Amatus. Decoctirutae, sem. lini, radicum althaeae, fl. Chamo. lb. ij. ss. olei rutacei ℥.ij. olei viol. ℥.j. Agarici ʒ.ij. misce pro enemate. This is good for a strong body, and one that abounds with flegm and wind; If the inflammation be great, make your clyster of a more cooling quality, with Ol. Violar.
CHAP. II. DIARIA PLƲRIƲM dierum (called Syno∣chus non putrida) because it continueth un∣till the third day. It is caused of thicking of the pores of the skin through cold or restrictive medicines, &c. Causa. The skin is harder. Signa. The longer you touch them, the hotter they are, or seem: their body falls not. The pulse is equall, great, swift, fre∣quent, and vehement. Phlebotomy is much commended, Curatio. Venae sectio ptisan is good, but especially oximel; also pure mulsa scoureth much, which is when a little water is mixed with honey: this clyster following is good. ℞.

Causa. aut continens fe∣bris, a constant fever: It proceedeth chief∣ly from blood; yet all the humours do putrefie and rot equally together within all the vessels, by reason of a feverons heat kept within the body. The signes are an unseparable redness in the face: Signa. an inflation of the veines, arteries, and temples: with lassitude and wearisomeness of the body with a sleepy disposition: The urine is red and gross; difficulty of breathing: a full, high, and swift pulse. First administer a cooling clyster. Curatio: Venae-sectio Secondly, draw blood out of the Basilica, Galen counselleth even to the fainting of the patient: Sanguisu∣gae. If it cannot be done, apply Sanguisugae, to the thighes, legges,
and shoulders: or provoke the Hemorrhoyds, Menstruis, or bleeding at the nose: sometimes purge the body with strong Apozems, Apozema. of the infusion of Rhubarb, with the syrrups of fumi∣tory, and cichory: To resist putrefaction, give Syrrupus de limonibus; Aqua graminis ℥.iv. Julepus. of the syrrup two ounces make a julip. Also the syr∣rups of Bugloss, fumitory, and cichory, given in the waters of Roses, and sorrel, with a few drops of oyle of vitriol do well: Clyster. let clysters be often repeated, made with lettice, endive, pur∣slaine, in the streining put Diapru. sol. and oyle of violets: Also let him drink Aqua hordei; Aq. Hord. If there be Asthma put in liqueris, he must abstain from hot things, flesh, or anything that nourish eth: If you would comfort the heart, use Bugloss and Borrage. If you would coole the liver, use cichory and lettice. If you would cool the reins, use the cold seeds. For constivenesse, use violets, roses, pruines, Mallowes, Tamarinds, &c. Lastly, to give him of Aqua spermat. ranarum, Aq sperm. ranarum. a spoonfull or two at a time is most excellent. Yet this Apozem fol∣lowing is very good to cool and open. ℞.

CHAP. IV. FEBRIS CONTINƲA, . Causa. Signa. a continual fever: It is caused when one only humour doth rot within the vessels: There is not a more certain sign of a continual fever (either Tertian, Quo∣tidian, or Quartan) than that none of them do come to intermission, or slaking altogether be∣tween the fits, until the fever be quite quenched: Also it begins not with vehement cold, & stiffe∣nesse: nor ends in quiet and rest, as an exquisite intermitting Tertian doth: likewise a conti∣nual Quotidian hath not any absolute inter∣mission; an exquisite Quotidian hath: In like manner a continual Quartan cometh not to quiet and rest between fits: the exquisite quar∣tan doth: and this is all that puts a difference in the signes between them: Curatio. Observe this com∣pendium in curing rotten fevers, First quench; Secondly, let, or stop the portion of the fever (which is not yet kindled) from being infla∣med: Thirdly, heal the rottenness, and let, and stop that which is already to ingender putrifa∣ction: Venae-sectio But first open a vein, secondly open ob∣structions by the wombe, or guts; by the urine, and by sweats, as you shall see cause: and Lastly, ℞.

CHAP. V. CAƲSOS: Ardens febris: continua Tertiana, . a continual Tertian or burning fever. It is caused when choller rotteth and putrifi∣eth within the veines; Causa. it agreeth with an exqui∣site intermitting Tertian, because it is ingendred of the same humour that the other is: But yet differs, in that in an intermitting Tertian the choller is carried all over the body (but in this causos, it is contained in the vessels with the blood) so that when the choller is stirred vehe∣mently, and driven about by nature, there is wont to follow vehement cold, and rigour: Hippocrat. Hippocrates saith 4. Aphoris. 58. That if it hap∣peneth in a burning fever, the Patient is delive∣red from the disease. It is known by these signes: Signa. their tongue is drie, grosse, rough, and black: also gnawing of the stomach, thirst, watchings, and many times ravings: their egestions of the wombe be liquid, and pale. For his cure, use lettice, and sorrel, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. in his broath; strew his room with the leaves of the vine, flowers of roses, violets, and water-lillies: also sprinkle cold water in the roome. But the first intention is to open a vein, Venae-sectio from whence a large quantity of blood must be drawn. This Epithema is good. ℞. Aqua rosarum rub. lactucae, ana ℥.iij.ss. Epithema. aqua endiviae, cichorii, an. ℥.i.ss. aceti ℥.j. triasan∣tali, ana ℥.ss. Sem. portulacae gr. iv. fiat Epith.
moysten rotten wool in it, and apply it to the liver: If you will make one for the heart, take the waters of Bugloss, Burrage, Pul. elect. dia∣marg. frigid. corall, saffron, &c. Lastly, cause the chollerick humour to be voyded, either by sweats, vomits, or egestions downwards; and labour to quench the heat with Aq. sperm. ranarum, or the like; or if you please, you may make a julep of barley water, Julepus. wherein is boyled the strings of the vine a handful bruised; with a few pruines; to the streining adde sugar, syrrup of violets, poppies, or any other syrrup that is of a cooling quality. The manner of preparing barley water, Guibertus. Aq. hord. according to Guibertus is thus. Accipe hordei communis manipulum unum. Bulliat in libris duabus aquae ad quadrantis consumptio∣nem. Extracta ab igne, refrigerata, coletur per lin∣teum mundum ad usum. CHAP. VI. EXQƲISITA TERTIANA: . Cassa.  febris intermit∣tens: It is caused of choller, carried by the sencible parts of the body, yet it remaineth pure, sincere, and unmixed: and therefore it is called exquisite. In every fit they feel a vehement cold, Signa. ri∣gour, and stiffenesse, and as it were pricked: In the increasing of the fits, the pulse are vehe∣ment, great, and frequent, with thirst; he breathes out as it were a flame of fire, coveting cold water: sometimes they vomit choller, the belly being loose: Their urine is chollerick, the

If it in∣vade the Patient daily with the signes aforesaid, it is called Duplex tertiana, a double tertian. Galen in the most hottest fevers giveth coun∣sell to draw blood, even ad lypothimiam: Galenus. Curatio. Vena sectio after the third fit it is most proper to be done. At the first opening of the vein, we may draw blood more in quantity then at the second; because the first is for evacuation; the second but for re∣frigeration: let this be done the day before the fit. The next day at the houre of the coming of the fit, give a vomit of the infusion of Stibium, Vomitus. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15. drams, according to the strength of the Patient. The next fit pro∣cure a sweat with Diascordium mithridate, Mithrida∣tum. Victus ra∣tio. gun∣powder, or the like. Let him use that which cools and moystens, as the flowers of violets, bur∣rage, roses, water-lillies, endive, succory, let∣tice, damascene pruins, purslaine, sorrel, roots of grasse, of these may be made decoctions. Amongst compounds, there is Elect de prunis damascenis, without diagridium: Diarrhodon Ab∣batis, Diatria santalon in powder, Emplastrū. and the con∣serves of the former simples: Also tosted bread infused in rose-vinegar, beaten in a morter, and adding coral ʒ.i. red roses, and cinnamon, of either half a dram, and applied like a plaister is good: also Ceratum santalinum, Ceratum. and clysters doe well: and if the Patient be not able to take a vomit, give him strong Apozems.

In this fever, Signa. the time of the fits exceed twelve hours; and there is not such great heat in the state and rigour of this fever, as in the exquisite Tertian; besides, it doth not end in abundance of sweat, as the exquisite Tertian doth.

QƲARTANA FEBRIS, Causa. intermittens: It is a fever proceeding from melancholy, pu∣trifying and rotting without the vessels; and moveth every fourth day, as choller in a tertian every third, and flegme in a quotidian daily: Valescus reporteth, Valescus. that he saw a man that had a fever every thirtieth day, for the space of thirty years: that quartan is safest which pro∣ceedeth not from other diseases, for there be some fevers that degenerate into a quartan. The signe is knowne by things antecedent, Signa. as if the sick were melancholy, &c. It beginnes with trembling and shaking, but not vehement at first; but afterward with rigour, and extreme cold: His bones seem to be bruised, and feeleth pain in his lower parts, because the humour is cold, drie, and grosse. A small and low pulse, little hear, except there be burnt choller: they
have little sweat, the urinc thin, and waterish, and the stooles drie. If blood seem to abound, Curatio. Venae sectio open the vena lic∣naris, or spleen vein, being the innermost of the left arm; with this caution; that if the blood be black, gross, and corrupted, draw boldly; if thin, yellow, or the like, close up the vein: In wo∣men move the Menstruis, in men the Hemor∣rhoyds; Vena sal∣vatella. also it is not amisse to open the Salva∣tella: his diet must be easie of digestion: wine is good that is thin and pure: also exercises mo∣derate do well; keep accustomed evacuations with this clyster. ℞.

It is ingendred of putrified and rottenflegm, it is called of the Greeks Amphimerina; because it causeth a fit every day: yet the learned may be (sometimes) deceived; for Duplex tertiana, Triplex quartana. and Triplex quartana, doth return daily: But the Tertian with rigour and exceeding cold. The Quartan with shaking and shivering. The Quotidian with cold of the extream parts: more properly an exteam chilling: The two lat∣ter doe not end in sweat as the Tertian doth. It is known by the slownesse of the pulse, Signa. be∣ing little and weak, they feel no thirst, the urine is white and thin; or thick and troubled; no sweat in the first dayes: They oftentimes vo∣mit flegme: flegmatick persons are alwayes vexed with it, but never cholerick: If the flegm be sharp, it causeth hunger. If salt, thirst. If it be sweet, then it causeth drowsinesse. But if some flegme that is glasen (which is the coldest) do putrifie by it selfe, . then it ingen∣dreth a fever called Epialos febris, in which the Patient is feaverous, and vehemently cold both together: feeling both immoderate heat and
cold in all the parts of his body at the same time: Forpart of the humour which is not as yet pu∣trefied, being spread by the veines, engendreth the rigour or cold. But the other rotten part of the humour en∣gendreth the fever: so that they are hot out∣ward, and cold inward. Lipyria is a fever much like Epialos, . you may have both their cures (out of the Chapter of Quo∣tidiana febris) which is as followeth. First administer this clyster. Curatio. Clyster. ℞.

Secondly, Vomitus. a vomit made with the juyce of Asaon, and oximel, and given before the fit, is a sure help. To drink oximel simplex with oxi∣mel scilliticum, or if rest be wanting, with syrrup of poppies, Haustus. is good: If you see cause, procure a sweat, with possetale, wherein is boyled Car∣duus benedict, centory, and liqueris: when the hu∣mours are extenuated, provoke urine with broath, wherein is boyled smalledge, parsley, and fennel roots: The juyce of Horse-radich in whey is excellent for the same purpose: sto∣mach pills are good: also anoynt his back with oyle of flower-delice or dill: Ceratum. and use ceratum
stomachale, with oyle of nutmegs: and give him syrrup of wormwood sometimes: And it is held for certain, that a dragme of old Treakle, Diaphore∣ticus. or mithridate, (the body being purged) given in pure white-wine, before the fit, doth cure the same: Lastly, if you see cause, give him this potion. ℞.

HECTICA FEBRIS: . is anunnatural heat kindled, not onely in the spirits and hu∣mours, but also in the sound and fleshly parts: The Patient is not sensible of the fever, nor of any pain. It is caused for the most part of burning fe∣vers continuing long: Causa. also great evacuations may be the cause: A feverous heat invades the dewy or alimentary humour, called Cambium; and at length consumes the humidity that is contained in the body of the heart: melting fevers the Greeks call Marasmos. There may be felt heat if you lay your hand on them: Their urine is thin, cruide, white, Signas and pale, at last oylie: a drie cough, a slack and hard pulse: It is called Hectick by reason of the drie Artery, their hands and feet are hotter af∣ter meales then before; their stomach sticketh almost to the ribs: the face is leady: at last he is like a ghost: his eyes hollow, his nose sharp, his haires fall, his legges swell; and lastly, a flux of the belly; then judge that death is nigh.
It is called a fever Hectic, so long as natural humidity is reserved; when that is consumed, then is called Marasmos. The whole cure consists in cooling and moystning: Curatio. tisanae. Victus Ratio. let him eat ptisan, also flesh of kids, feasants, birds of mountains, cocks stones, ca∣pons flesh, reer-egges, lettice, endive, cichory, gourds, spinach, mallowes, cherries, strawber∣ries, pruines, pomegranets, melons; milk is ex∣treamely commended, if it be not compounded with another fever; Aq. sperm. ranar. is excel∣lent: Clyster. beware of purging: if need be, give cool∣ing and moystning clysters, adding the mar∣row of cassia fistula. The syrrups of violets, pur∣slain, water-lillies, and poppies, are good: so are gellies; also lambs heads, and calves feet boyled in the decoction for clysters. Let four young men take a sheet and dip it in cold water (in aqua sperm. ranarum, so I con∣ceive to be farre better) and lay the Patient in it, and immediately tumble him into another; into a third; and so into a fourth: also to dippe or plunge him into cold water is commended; and then to wipe him softly, with soft linnen cloathes: and to anoynt his body with oyle of roses, Galen much extolleth it. ℞.

Apply it to the liver. Historia. Pollio Romulus being above a hundred yeares old, Divus Augustus asked him, by what means he kept his strength of body and mind, he answered, Intus mulso, foris oleo, that is, I keep me moyst with mulso with∣in, and oyle I anoynt upon my skin: Asses milk is good: some commend bleeding, but not above two or three ounces at a time. Lastly, Marasmos is not to be cured: . for even as to poure oyle into a lamp where is no week nor match, is nothing else but oleum & operam perdere; so in vain we strive to restore to nature that solid substance, being by heat consumed and taken away. If you want more, look into the Chapter of Ptisis. Lastly, ℞. Cons. ros. antiquae ℥.j. trochisc. de carabe, Mixtura. Forrestus. de terra sigil. ana ʒ. i. ss. cum syr de portulaca q.s. fiat mixtura.

It is caused through putrified flegme, that is mixed with rotten choller. They altogether tremble, and shake daily; Signa. being often troubled with unquietnesse, bitter∣nes, (watchings, thirst,) of the mouth; with lassi∣tude. From flegm proceeds the cold, from chol∣ler, a light succession; But from both, trembling:
He is farre more grievous than a terrian; Hippocra∣tes. Hippo∣crates saith, its deadly, because it leaveth no time to nature to nourish the body, concoct hurtful humours, and repaire strength: so that they have often syncops: when the tertian ex∣ceeds the quotidian, there is vehement cold in the augmenting of the fit; Also more burn∣ing: yellow choller is sent forth by vomit, or stoole: If the quotidian exceeds the tertian, there is cold in the extreame parts: but little shaking; and lesse heat: If of like force, it comes with horror and shaking, then it is an exquisite Hemitrice fever. The remedies must be mixed against chol∣ler, Curatio. and flegme: The stomach strengthened, and the liver cooled: search the Chapters of Tertiana, Quotid. and Tertiana notha febris. CHAP. XII. FEBRIS PESTILENTIA; . Causa. is a disease which hapneth unto many: Having his beginning from an un-usuall putrefaction; also having its beginning likewise sometimes in our selves; the humours do degenerate so much from their na∣tural temperament, that they take unto them∣selves a pernicious and venemous quality: some∣times it is caused by outward means, as putre∣fied exhalations communicated to the ayr from dead carcases not buried: Fennes, Pools, stand∣ing waters, stinking channels, venemous dens, and mettalin spirits arising out of the earth: Al∣so from the variable commistion of the pla∣nets:
and then it is the scourge of the most high God for our sinnes: Also a corrupt ayre may be the cause: I mean diet: It rageth com∣monly at the latter end of Summer, and the beginning of Harvest or Autumne. The outward members are cold, Signa. the inward hot: There is heavinesse, wearisomenesse, sloth, difficulty of breathing, pain in the head, careful∣nesse of minde, sadnesse, marvellous sleepy, and sometimes raging vexeth him; with losse of appetite, thirst, often vomiting, bitternesse, and drynesse of the mouth: a frequent, small, and deep pulse: the urine thick and stinking: yet sometimes it is like a hail bodies urine. Last∣ly, the sure token is botches behind the eares, or under the arme-holes, or about the share: also small spots all over the body, with great faintnesse. First, burn juniper, oken wood, laurel, Curatio. Fumigatio. or Ta∣mariscus in the house: or strew juniper berries, mirrhe, frankincense, rew, Angelica (in pow∣der) upon coales: Also sprinkle vinegar upon the pavement. Secondly, If a plethorick body, open a vein, Venae-sectio Vomitus. on that side the botch is on: and on that vein that comes from thence: some commend a sti∣bium vomit, especially if choller abound: also Electuarium de ovo, Elect. de ovo. which maximilianus the Emperour once used with marvellous successe, ʒ. j. at a time in scabious water: Also ℞. Theriaca Andromachi ℈. ij. Haustus. Mithridatum ℈.j. Bolus arm. prae. ℈.ss. Aqua rosarum, Buglossae ana ℥.j. misce, fiat potio: Let him sweat upon it: Diascordium, treakle, or

In this fever, Clyster. a clyster is to be administred, if the body be much costive: also make this electuary. ℞. Electuari∣um. Cons. rosarum rubr. Buglos. Borrag. an. ℥.ss. confect. caryophil. ℥. j.

LƲES VENEREA, is a contagious evill, gotten for the most part by the use of vene∣ry, and of unclean bodies: The part affected is the liver. The cause is an impure touch in copulation, Causa. the man or woman having their privities troub∣led with virulent ulcers, or molested with a viru∣lent strangury; the contagion whereof is eom∣municated from one infected body to another. The woman takes it by receiving the virulent seed of an unclean person; The signes thereof remaining in the wrinkles of the womb, may be drawn in by the pores of the open and stan∣ding yard, and so infect the man; whence suc∣ceed ulcers, and a virulent strangury in the pri∣vities of both persons.
It may be taken by breathing onely, or by eating, drinking, and lying with the infected, or after them in their sheets: I read of a nurse that infected a Gentlewomans child, the childe, the mother, the mother, her husband, and the husband infected two of his other children. There appear Bubos in the groine, Signa. pustuls in the yard, the urinary passages are ulcerated: The prepuce is sometimes so scorched with heat, that it will not slip over the Glans: the urine burnes with pain, and a virulent Gonor∣rhea: Sometimes red, sometimes yellow, and filthy spots like warts, are over the body, which in time prove ulcers and pustuls: There is pain of the nerves, shoulders, head, and neck: In many there is pustuls in the pallat of their mouth, jawes, nose, and tongue, which in time ulcerate: oftentimes the haire of the head, and Beard fall away: They cannot sleep, for they have exceeding pain in the night, more then in the day. Because the venereous virulency lying asleep, is enraged by the warme bed: also the Patients thoughts are fixed upon the object of pain most in the night. On their joynts and shin-bones, they have certain tophies and tumours very hard to be dissolved: and especially in their foreheads, and shoulders; Prognostica The effects of Lu. ve. are sad. For some lose one, or both their eyes, or eye-lids; looking very gastly; some lose their hearing, and their noses do sometimes fall flat, with the losse of the bone called Ethmoides; so that they faulter and fumble in their speech: some have
their yards cut off, by reason of a Gangreen, and women a great part of their privities are tainted with corruption: men sometimes have their urethra obstructed by budding caruncles, or inflamed pustules, and often stand at need of the Cathaetur: some their mouthes are drawne awry, others grow lame of armes, or legges: some are troubled with Asthma, others have the leprosie: some with Hectica febris, others their throats eaten with putrefied and cancrous ulcers: some are troubled with a filthy flux of blood, and the falling sicknesse. Sometimes there followeth a disease called Plica: being most loathsome, and horrible: Plica. Glissonins. and bred by modern luxury and excesse, sei∣zing specially on women. It is a viscous venemous humour, that glues together (as it were) the haire of the head, with a prodigious entanglement: sometimes taking the form of a great snake, or else of little ser∣pents, full of nastinesse, vermine, and noysome smell: so that being pricked with a needle, they yeeld bloody drops. It began in Germany, I mean, at the first, in Poland: Those that cut off their hair, either lost their eyes, or the humour falling down, tortured them very much in their lower parts: The cure of this most grievous disease, you may pick out of this Chapter; yet if you would see farther concerning it, Hercul∣saxonia look in∣to Hercul. Saxonia his tenth book De Plica: and in it you shall find 67 Chapters of this disease; which with the rest aforementioned, are often∣times the offspring of the Lues venerea: whose proper Antidote is Argentum vivum. Also
many become impotent to Venery: venereous ulcers on the yard are hard to cure. But if being healed they remain hard, and callous: they are signes of the disease lying hid in the body. Mentagra. . A disease called Mentagra, that vexed the Romans in the time of Claudius, was very like this, which oftentimes is transferred from the parents to the children: Lastly, ma∣ny perish with a fever (that have Lues venerea) having continual sorrow and grief. This disease being newly taken, Curatio. Venae sectio admits of an easie cure: 1. The first intention must be to open a vein. 2. The second is, the grosse humours must be attenuated: for which purpose, The de∣coction of Radicum foeniculi, eringii, enulae campanae, Oximel. lentium, uvarum passarum, ficum, &c. also oximel scillitici, is good for the same purpose. 3.

Let the Patient sweat often with this draught, an hour at a time: his sweat must be wiped off with fine dry cloaths, taking heed of cold: you may adde centory, and liqueris to the aforesaid decoction, and it will be the stron∣ger to procure sweat. If the Patient be much feverous, leave out the Guaiacum, and its bark: And put in Borrage, Bugloss, Cichory, Violets, Polypody, Cur∣rants, &c. 6. Also let Sarsaeparilla, China, and Eringo roots, be boyled in his broath: made with the knuckles of veale. 7.

Let your frictions be gentle, and you must so long use them with unctions, untill the virulent humours be evacuated, by spitting and saliva∣tion, by stoole, urine, sweat, or insensible tran∣spiration; which you shall know by the falling away; and drying up of the pustules; And the ceasing of the paines and other symptomes pro∣per to this disease: unction must be used twice aday on strong bodies; upon rare and delicate bodies but once; upon weak bodies, every two or three dayes; and then binde up their limbes with gray paper. Observe if nature be stirred up, and bent to any kind of evacuation, either by the mouth, pores, stool, or the like, then use frictions every 2, 3, 4, or 5, dayes. Dysenteries caused by unction, may be helped by clysters; wherein much hogs-grease is dissolved. If you should anoynt some to death, you can∣not bring them to fluxe at the mouth; yet through some other evacuation they recover:
this Emplaster following is much commended for hard tophies. ℞.

For the ulcers of the mouth, make a decoction of barley, marsh mallowes, and lettice: Also to wash the mouth with cowes milk warme, is good. 11. If the mouth and jawes become so swel∣led, as a gangreen is to be feared; then use re∣strictive and repelling gargarismes, Gargaris∣mus. made of barley water, plantin, night-shade, knot-grass, sheppards purse, quinces, lettice, water-lillies, and wood-binde: also Balaustia, red roses, and myrtills: syrrups of dried roses, quinces, and barberies; honey of roses, and diamoron. His diet in this condition must be reer-egges, Victus rae∣tio. barley creames, cullesses, made of the decocti∣on of knuckles of veale, and gellies. 12. For the ulcers on the prepuce, and glans, every night anoynt them with ung. Argenti vivi: so far as they are scorched with inflamma∣tion, or ulcerated; and in the morning wash it with the coction of guaicaum, or china, or sarsae∣parilla: so do untill the ulcer be dryed, and hea∣led, and the inflammation quenched; this is a sure help; its called Paraphimosis. 13. For the virulent Gonorrhaea annexed
with it: Gonorrhaea virulenta. First direct a dry diet; as biscakes, rai∣sons, blanched almonds, to make meales of them often. 14. Then purge him with this potion fol∣lowing. ℞. Potio pur∣gans. Decoct. com. ℥. vj. cassiae re. extractae ℥. ss. Syrrupus rosarum. sol. ℥. ss. misce. Let him take the one half overnight warm, and the rest in the morning: If he be a strong body, put in ℥.ss. or ʒ.vj. of Diaprunum sol. in∣stead of Cassia: let him drink of the decoction of Sarsae and China constantly. 15. And let him take halfe an ounce of washt turpentine in wafers, 2, or 3 times; and sweat once or twice, if need be. For this Gonorrhaea, is the beginning of the Lues venerea; and will certainly follow, if not prevented with the aforesaid meanes: And so much shall suffice for this most detestable and grievous evill, which by Gods command, hath assailed mankind; as a scourge or punishment to restrain the too wanton and lascivious lusts of unpure persons. CHAP. XIV. SCORBƲTƲS: . called by Pliny, Sceletyrbe, and Stomacace. It is a disease obstructing the spleen, whereby the course of melancholy is hindered; which being mingled with the rest of the blood, infecteth all the body: The grosser part falling down stains the legs with spots; the thinner part being carried up, defiles the gums.
The cause is a grosse and corrupt diet; Causa. and also a full and delicate diet (using no exercise) may be the cause: sometimes it followes a quartan fever. The gummes are foul, Signa. and swelled with black blood: the teeth loose, black, and leady spots in the legs: and sometimes in the face. There is weaknesse in the joynts, difficulty of breathing, being ready to die when they move: but being layd, they are refreshed: they are greedy of meat, costive of body, yet some have a flux: some have swelled, and ulcerated legs, so that their shin bone lye bare: In some bo∣dies it turnes into a kind of leprosie: those that die of this disease, their bodies are found to be spotted all over. First open the vein on the left arme, Curatio Venae sectio called Li∣enaria, and draw away blood according to the strength, and age of the Patient: If it be possi∣ble draw blood from the Haemorrhodial vein; Also if they abound with blood, take the Basi∣lica; but if they be farre spent, abstain from phlebotomy, except it be by the haemorrhodi∣all veines: Next give this Apozem following. ℞. Decoctio. com. ℥.vj. cassiae re. extractae ℥. ss. Apozema. Syrrupus de epithymo cretens. Syr. fumariae ana ℥.j. misce. & f. Apozem. Give him half over night, and the other half in the morning warm: For this disease admits not any vehement purgations. Also morning and evening let him take a spoonfull or two of the juyce of scurvigrass, and brooklime, Becabunga called Becabunga: you may put two or three ounces of it into posset ale, drink it and sweat, if possible.
Also this julep following is good to drink often of it. ℞. Aqua fumaria p. 1. Syr. ejusd. ℥. ij. ol. vitr. gr. Julepus. vj. misce. For children make this syrrup. ℞. Syrrupus. Succi chochleariae, succi becabungae, an li. iij. sacchar. albis. li.ij. charificetur succus cum abumine ovi, fiat syrrup. secundum artem: Give the childe, or weak body, a little at a time often: If the gummes be swelled with black blood, let it out with an instrument: Lastly, this drink following I never knew fail. ℞.

Stamp the scurvigrass, and radish; bruise the berries, ginger, and pepper: and put them all into the wine and water; let them stand a whole night; strain it, and let the Patient drink a quarter of a pinte at a time, last at night, and first in the morning. Forestus. If any man desire more knowledge of this disease, let him read Fore∣stus his observations in diseases of the spleen. CHAP. XV. PRIAPISMƲS, . Causa. is a disease in which the yard is extended in length and bignesse, without any lusting. It is caused either through immoderate opening the mouthes of the arteries; or else of a
vaporous spirit ingendred in the hollow and fistulous sinew, or through long absti∣nence from carnall copulation: Satyriasis. If there be panting, and beating of the yard, with a desire to the act of generation, then it is called Sa∣tyriasis. They suffer as it were a cramp, Signa. the yard being puffed up, and stretched out: they quickly pe∣rish, without sudden help: And when they die, their bellies be puffed up, and their sweat is cold. First open Mediana of the armes; Curatio. Clyster. Venae-sectio then clysters made of beets, mallowes and mercury; adding Manna, and Cassia: but beware of purges, and things that be diuretical: to procure gentle vo∣mits are good: Aq sperm. ranarum. give him to drink a little Aqua sperm. ranar. with sugar. And keep him from sights, and stories appertaining to lechery: Let him drink barley water: If a virulent Gonorrhaea be annexed with it, then frictions (on the fistu∣lous sinew) of ung. argenti vivi, helps him: In this disease, Forestus in his first Tome, and 26. Forestus. Book, and ninth observation, commendeth a vomit made with Asaron. CHAP. XVI. GONORRHAEA: seu seminis profluvium: . It is excretion and shedding of seed against the Patients will; without sicknesse of the yard. It is caused through imbecillity of the reten∣tive vertue, in the vessels containing the sperm: Causa. or violent moving, may be the cause.
The sperm is watery, Signa. and thin, without ap∣tetite to carnal copulation: some feel not the fluxe, others feel a certain pleasure; but not like the pleasure that is in that Gonorrhaea which is found in plethorick bodies, abounding with blood; that lying on their backs in the night, shed forth abundance of spermatick matter. Also their bodies waxe leane, especially about their loines, with much weaknesse: There is also a virulent gonorrhaea, whose cure you shall find in the Chapter of Lues venerea. 1. Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. For the cure, let him use a dry diet. 2. Secondly, let him give himself all the rest and quiet he can possible. 3. Thirdly, this powder is excellent. ℞. Pulvis. Sacchari restrin. ℥.ij. resinae ℥.j. bolus arm. ℥.ss. nuc. moschatae ʒ.ij. mastich. ʒ. j. misce & fiat pulvis: Let the Patient take as much as will lye on a twelve-penny piece, or a half crown at a time, in a quarter of a pinte of warm milk from the cowes dugge, evening and morning, and sometimes in Rice broath will do well. 4. If you please you make some of the pow∣der into pills, Palulae. with washt Venus-turpentine: and let him take three over night, and four in the morning; for a week together. 5. Emplastrū. Also Emplastrum sticticum is very good to lay to his back, spread on leather: give him with his meats, the seeds of Agnus castus, and the leaves of rew: Aq. sperm. ranarum. to eat purslaine, and drink spawne-water, will be good to extinguish seed: Let him lye on his side And lastly, he
must eschew and exclude all thoughts, belong∣ing to carnal copulation; and ℞. Succi myrtillorum vel succi foliorum myrti, Linimen∣tum.

Con∣silium 301. pag. 738. CHAP. XVII. CELE in Greek, . Ramex and Hernia in La∣tin: of the barbarous writers Ruptura: there be seven kinds or nine. 1. Enterocele, or Ramex intestinorum, . is when the Peritonaeum do break, and the bowels fall down into the Cods. 2. Bubonocele, or Ramex inguinis, . is when the bowels do cleave, or stay above the privie members. 3. Hydrocele, or Ramex aquosus, is when a watery humour is gathered into any part of the filmes or skin of the Cods. 4. Sarcocele, . or Ramex carnosus is when there groweth hard flesh within the coats, and tuni∣cles of the stones. 5. Epiplocele, or Ramex omenti, . is when the kall or filme, that laps in the bowels, do fall down into the Cods. 6. Enteroepiplocele, or Ramex omenti & inte∣stini, is when the bowels do slip down with the filme. 7. Cirsocele, or Ramex varicosus, is when the
veines, which nourish the stones, are spread abroad, and swollen out of measure on heaps. 8. Ramex ventosus. Physocele or Hernia ventositatis, is when wind is gathered into the skin of the Cods. 9. Hyrophysocele or Ramex ventosus & aquo∣sus, when wind and water is gathered into the filmes of the Cods. They are caused by some violent accident, Causa. as a stroak, leaping, crying, fall, or lifting, which do break the peritonaeum; and so cause Ramex intestinorum; or stretch it out more then it ought to be, and so cause Ramex inguinis. Or the vessels joyned together, and increa∣sing in the Cods; or the vessels being broak, and slidden down, sendeth blood thither; which being changed into a watery, or wheyish sub∣stance, causeth Ramex aquosus. Ramex carnosus is caused through a stripe or blow, upon the stone or stones: The cause of the other ruptures are evident by their descriptions. The signes of the two first is a manifest swel∣ling in the Cods; Signa. or above the privie members: It goeth back slowly, but rolleth down quickly, also the swelling is very great. The signes of a watery humour, is a swelling without pain: firm and shining, like the colour of the humour, as dregs of blood, or the like: If it be on both sides of the Cods, its then a dou∣ble rupture. The signes of Ramex carnosus is hardnesse, somtimes like a kernel, and thenthere is neither colour, sense, nor feeling: But if the humour be of a wicked nature, then pricking pain doth vexe him.
You must lay the Patient upright, Curatio. yet so as his head may be lower then his buttocks; and separate his legges; then put up the bowels by little and little; then keep them up by conveni∣ent trusses, and ligaments: But if the place ad∣joyning to the Cods, or privie members, be in∣flamed, and very painful, so that thereby the bowels are made disobedient to go up; then you must use foments, and liniments, made with mallowes, cammomel, dill, linseed, fennegreek, Fomentati. and nourish the place with wooll dipt in oyle. Also take Emplastrum ad Herniam; spread some on a piece of lether, and apply it: Emplastrū. let it lye on seven dayes, being bound fast with his truss: and let him give himself rest for thirty dayes; this is an excellent help. Also make a decoction with comfry roots, plantin, myrtill seed, pomegranat flowers, Decoctio. and leaves of laurel, boyle them in red wine, and water of plantin, and then sweeten it with sugar. For a watery rupture look into the Chapters of the dropsies, as Ascites, &c. A perfect rup∣ture coming by the breaking of the Peritonaeum, in men of full growth, seldom admits of cure. A certain chyrurgion did use to beat a load∣stone into fine powder, Historia. and give of it to chil∣dren in a little pap: and then he anoynted the groine with honey, and then strewed on it the fine filings of Iron: this he did for 10, or 12, dayes together; keeping up the bowels straight with a truss. Thus have you had directions for the curing of the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth: As for
the fourth rupture, its more properly a chirur∣gious work, Paraeus. and if you please you may take Pa∣rey for your guide; so likewise for the seventh: As for the eighth and ninth, look into the Chap∣ters of the dropsies. There is also Hernia Humoralis, generated by the confused mixture of many humours in the Cod; Hernia humoralis, or between the tunicles which involve the testicle: And there is Pneumatocele, which is a flatulent tumour in the Cod, Pneumato∣cele. being round and shining; both of them are cured by medi∣cines which dissolve, and trusses to keep up the Cods from falling: Ʋnguentū. Also clysters: And take Helder, cammomel, fetherfew, betony, great valerian, chickweed, sention, mercury, hem∣lock, smallage, gomepheny, and cellindine, ana M, j. chop them small, boyle them in p. iij. of May butter, and two penny worth of neats-foot oyle; bathe the Cod with it, or ℞.

MENSIƲM SƲPPRESSIO, Causa. is either naturally, or against nature: If natural∣ly, the woman is vexed with no grief of the bo∣dy, nor yet of the wombe. If against nature, it happeneth either through grossnesse, or slendernesse of body: the former have but little blood, the lat∣ter
no superfluous blood in them. Also grosse blood, bleeding at the nose, &c. sweating, conti∣nual vomiting, fluxes of the belly, hardnes, scars, or a peece of flesh ingendred in the mouth of the matrice, may be the cause: also carelesness, fear, and sorrow. There is heaviness, a desire to vomit, Signa. abhor∣ring of meat, paines about the loynes, thighes, neck, eyes, and head; sometimes fevers, and blackish urine made with difficulty. 1. A cold distemper is known by dulness, a white and leady colour in the face, and a wa∣tery, thin and greenish urine. 2. A hot distemper of fulness, is known by vehement paine about the loynes, and privie members; with swollen veines. 1. For a cold distemper turn back to lib. 1. Curatio. Sabina. chap. 25. pag. 52. for a poor body let the leaves of savine be boyled in wine and drunk, or re∣ceive the fume of savine; it will force them: It doth also expell the dead child. 2. In a hot cause bleed on the feet, Venae sectio coole and moysten; and give syrrup of steel: And when the distemper is over, then observe the former directions: for fulness make a purgation with Diaphaenicon, Hierapicra, and benedicta laxativa: Purgatio. Amongst simples that provoke the terms, are roots of parslay, sperage, seeds of smallege and fennel: Anniseed, nettles: Also calamint, Catalogus simplicium. wormwood, origan, sothernwood, mugwort, peniroyal, hyssop, hore-hound, rew, mother∣wort, Ireos, laurel berries, madder, sage, cum∣min-seed, Enula, campana, root of Aristolo∣chia, and Savine: of these may be made deco∣ctions;
into which may be put a little sugar to drink. 4. Also Castoreum, Storax, Galbanum, fran∣kincense, Fumigatio. Bdelium, and Benzoine: of these may be made suffumigations: Also if you turn back to the eighth Chapter of this book, Vin. Cha lyb. and the ninth page, you shall find an excellent thing for this purpose; even the steel wine, to give the Pa∣tient of it evening and morning, with the syrrup of the same; and exercise.

The humour is red like putrefied blood; Signa. yet sometimes pure, which noteth erosion or gnaw∣ing: mattery, white, and sometimes watery: the secret part is continually moyst with the humours, being of divers colours: She is ill co∣loured, abhorreth meat, her eyes are swollen, and she breatheth difficulty. 1. Curatio. Venae sectio For the red fluxe open a vein in the arm often; drawing a little blood at a time, and let her diet be restrictive. 2.

VTERI STRANGƲLATIO seu suffocatio, . otherwise called Hysterica passio: It is a drawing of the womb to the upper parts, as it were by a convulsive motion. It is caused through the defluction either of seed being sometimes corrupted: Causae. or the flow∣ers which causeth the womb to be swelled, and the vessels and ligaments to be distended with fulnesse, and pressing the Diaphragma, causeth shortnesse of breathing: Also the whites, or some other humour, or a tumour, or a rotten impostume, or some ill juyce putrefying, and resolving into gross vapours, may be the cause. The womb removeth out of his seat, and doth one while fall towards the liver; another while towards the milt, another while towards the midriffe; stomach, and downwards to∣wards the bladder: sometimes the child is very great, that it press the midriff, and so cause the fits. When the fit is nigh, Signa. there is heavinesse of mind, slowness, paleness, and sorrowfulness. Being present, there is a drowsiness, also do∣ting, and a withholding of the instruments of breathing, they wax dumb, and draw up their legges, and a moyst humour floweth out of the womb.
1. If it assaile the guts, the bowels make a noyse. 2. If it trouble the stomach, there is vo∣miting. 3. If it assaile the brest and throat, there is choaking. 4. If the brain, there is madnesse. 5. If the heart, there is swouning; some sleep sound, others talk foolishly, others they breath so little, that they seem dead. 1. If you would know whether she be dead or not, take a smooth looking-glasse, lay it, or hold it before her mouth and nostrils; if she breath though never so obscurely, yet the glass will be duskey. 2. Or take a fine downish feather, and hold it likewise as aforesaid, and it will by the trem∣bling, or shaking motion thereof; shew that there is some breath, and therefore life remain∣ing in the body. 3. But the surest way is to blow up sneesing powder, but if no breath appear, do not pre∣sently judge the woman for dead; for the small vitall heat may be drawn into the heart, and so not quite destitute of life; but for the present na∣ture is contented with transpiration only. So flies, gnats, and pishmares, or pismires, live all winter without breathing. 1. If it proceedeth from the corruption of the seed, the accidents are more grievous and vio∣lent: difficulty of breathing goeth before, and shortly after comes the deprivation thereof: And the whole habit of the body seems more cold then a stone: She is a widow, or a woman that
her husband hath a long time been absent from her, so that she hath great store of seed, which causeth heavinesse of the head; losse of appetite, sadnesse, and fear: Also young maids that are prone to lechery, abounding with blood and seed; are often troubled with this di∣sease, so that if the abundance of seed be the cause, they speak things that are to be concea∣led; some laugh, others weep, and some sing: But the peculiar signes, if the midwife tickle her womb with her finger, there comes away thick and grosse seed, with much pleasure and de∣light; as may be perceived by the Patient: so that all symptomes do quickly vanish. 2. It is very like it is caused by the suppres∣sion of the flowers, if they had them very well formerly, and on a sudden they stop, and the fits likewise quickly follow after. Look the cause of Mensium suppressio, I mean the signe: many do perish in the fit, or within few houres after, which happeneth when the pulse are swift and inordinate, and then vanish clean away. In the Fit, place her on her back, Curatio. with her brest and stomach loose, and her garments slack about her, that she may breathe the more freely. Some pull the haires of the secret parts, using frictions below: and fumes of cinnamon, Lignum aloes. Callam. aromat. lignum Aloes, Ladanum, Ben∣zoin, and storax: An instrument may be made for this purpose, with a tunnell on the top, through which, the fume may passe into the matrice. Contrariwiwise, to the nostrils Gum. galba∣num,
Sagapenum. Assafoetida ammoniacum, Assa foetida, the snuff of candle, also haire, old leather, horse-hoofees, and partridges feathers burnt, are good. If she be a married woman, let her be strong∣ly encountered by her husband, who possibly may be the cause, by not affording her due be∣nevolence: for one I knew once to be guilty of this crime, and for no other end, but because he was unwilling to have any more children by her: so that the woman had undoubtedly peri∣shed in her most grievous fits, if I had not per∣swaded him to relieve her; which according∣ly he did, and she very suddenly recovered. If she be a maid, or widow, let the midwife anoynt her finger with Oleum moschaetalinum, Oleum. or cloves, or the best is a little amber greece, or civet, Sacculi. and tickle the top of the neck of the wombe (which Plato calleth , a craving creature,) Also to apply sitle bagges (of motherwort, origan, cammomel, peniroy∣al, lavender, and mugwort) hot to her secret parts, is a present remedy, in the time of the fit. And procure sneesing with Helleborus albus, or pilletary, with a little powder of Castoreum. After the fit I have procured gentle vomiting, with good successe; and Castoreum drunk in wine, is excellent. Also open a vein on the foot, Venae-sectio especially if the menstruis be stopped: using other meanes also to procure them. And administer this clyster following. ℞. Clyster.

The cause is of falling from an high place, Causae. sore
travel of child-birth, or through the unskilful∣nesse of the mid-wife, who draweth away the womb with the childe, or with the secundine cleaving fast thereunto. Also a tenasmus may be the cause, or what∣soever weightily presseth down the Diaphrag∣ma; or the muscles of the Epigastrium; or set∣ting on a cold stone: Therefore what thing so∣ever resolve, relax, or burst the ligaments or bands, whereby the wombe is tyed, are suppo∣sed to be causes of the accident. There is felt pain in the entrails, loynes, or os sacrum: Signa. And a tractable tumour at the neck of the womb: It is sometimes seen hanging out, of the bignesse and form of goose egge, like a peece of red flesh. If that hangeth out be putrified, Curatio. it must be cut away; being first tied, and the rest seared with a cautery. Paulus, and others testifie that some women have lost the greater part, others all their womb, and yet have lived very well, after it: If it hangeth down between the thighs; it is hard to cure, yet place her on her back; her buttocks and thighes being lifted up, and her legges drawne back, then anoint with oyle of sillies: Fomentatio If it be swelled, use a fomentation of mallowes, Althaea, and fennegreek, then thrust it up gently with your finger into its place, whilest the woman draw her breath as as if she supt something: then wipe away the oyle, and foment with an astringent decocti∣on made with pomegranate pills, Decoctio. roche-allam, cypress nuts, Clyster. barberries, &c. boyled in smiths∣water: Also a clyster is good. Or prepare wooll
in figure and thicknesse, according to the pro∣portion of the member: wind it about with a fine cloath, dip it in the juyce of Acatia, and Hypocischis, put it into the wombe, and you shall by little and little, Vomitus. wrest upward all that is fallen down: vomiting is much commended, let them smell to odoriferous things, and stink∣ing things used below: of which you have plenty in the former Chapter: Lastly, if it cometh through cold, ℞.

CHAP. XXIII. MOLA, of the Greek word Myle, . Galenus. which signifieth a millstone: Galen in lib. 14. Ther. meth. defineth a Mola to be a peece of flesh without shape, or . an idle and imperfect flesh. It is a false concep∣tion of deformed flesh, round and hard: some∣times distinguished into members, coming by corupt and weak diseased seed, Causae. and the immo∣derate fluxe of termes, overwhelming the mans seed, changeth it into a Mola: which disease cannot happen to any without the help of
man, whose seed doth onely minister mat∣ter for the generation thereof. There is a pricking pain (at the beginning) that troubleth the belly, Signa. which will swell sooner then it would, if it were a true issue: and will be distended with greater hardnesse, being more troublesome because contrary to nature: pre∣sently after the dugs swell, but shortly they fall lank: for nature sendeth milk thither in vain, because there is no issue in the womb that may spend the same. 1. It will move before the third month, but the true conception will not. 2. Also this motion is of the faculty of the wombe, and of the spirit of the seed dispersed through the Mola, and not of the intellectual soule, or spirit, sent from above, But is nourished and increased after the manner of plants. 3. The Mola by reason of its greatnesse and heavinesse rowleth like a stone: unto that side the woman declineth her self. 4. She waxeth lean in all her members, espe∣cially her legs; although towards night they swell. 5. she is slow in going. If it cleaveth not very fast, it falleth away in 3, or 4, months; some have it cleaving so fast to the sides of the wombe, and Cotylidons: that they bear them 5, or 6, yeares, some as long as they live. 6. She hath an evill colour, loss of appetite, and suppression of menstruis, as in the lawfull conception. 7. There is sometimes difficult making of
urine, and the excrements stop for a week to∣gether, by reason the Mola presseth the guts. 8. There happeneth sometimes excellent fluxes that lesseneth the body; in one wombe sometimes are found 2, or 3, Moles: And some∣times the Mola is annexed with a child. 9. Lastly, about the ninth or tenth month, some expell sounding blasts of wind, whereby the wombe falleth lank and slender, which be∣fore was so puffed up, as every one thought them to be with child. For the cure, Curatio. all things that provoke the flowers, and exclude the dead child are to be prescribed: inwardly put up, and outwardly applyed: look into the Chapter of Mensium suppressio: make fomentations with mallowes, Fomenta∣tio. Althaea, cammomel, melilot, fennegreek, lin∣seed, and fat figs.

CHAP. XXIV. VTERI INFLAMMATIO: Causa. It is caused through a stripe: the stopping of the men∣struis, abortion, exulceration, unmeasurable le∣chery, or immoderate deambulation may be the cause. There is an acute fever, Signa. pain of the head, share, loynes, and roots of the eyes; convulsion and cramp of the armes, fingers, and neck: pain of the stomach, and womb. If the hinder part be inflamed, there is pain about the loyns: if the fore part, there is pain about the privities; so that a strangury, or difficult making of urine do follow: when it affecteth the mouth of the matrice, the mouth is hard, shut up, and burning hot: If the sides be inflamed, the parts above the privities are distended, and the legges grieved. First open a vein on the foot (if it came not by abortion or a flux of blood) Secondly pti∣san, Curatio. Venae. sectio and cooling clysters are exceeding good: Apply to the share cataplasmes of fenegreek, Cataplas. Althaea, mallowes, motherwort, melilot, with the meal of linseed, put in wool moystned in the juyce of Plantin, knotgrass, and purslain, or in oyle of roses: Lastly, ℞. Julepus. Aq. sperm. ranar. p. 1. Syr. de althaea ℥. iv. misce.
CHAP. XXV. VTERI INFLATIO: Causa. It is puffed up through cold, or corrupt humours in it: Abortion, sore travel in child-birth, the neck being shut, or a clod of blood stopping it. The bottome of the body is swelled with hardnesse, Signa. and a pain that pricketh even to the Diaphragma, and stomach, to the loynes, share, and navel,: If wind be gotten into the hollow∣nesse of the womb, there is heard a rumbling noise: If into the thin, and slender passages, the pain is vehement and hard to cure. Fasting is good: if a plethorick body, Cura tio. Venae sectia open a vein: an excellent clyster for this purpose you may have in uteri strangulatio: Bathe her body with oyle of Rew, Dill, and Origan: you may powre them into her womb, for they resolve windinesse: In her broath boyle the seeds of Apium, fennel, caraway, cummin, and anise: Also with cammomel, calamint, motherwort, penniroyal, and sothernwood, may be made poultises. If there be clods of blood, let the midwife put her finger (being first anoynted) into her privities, and bring it forth by little and little, that the windinesse may passe. Lastly, with her meat give her this powder. ℞. Cinnamomi, nucis moscata, cardamomi an. Pulvis. Ruffus. ʒ.ij. zingiberis ʒ.iij. piperis longi ʒ.ss. croci gr. v. ex his pulvis fiat.
CHAP. XXVI. VTERI EXƲLCERATIO: Causa. It is caused through hard child-birth: sharp medi∣cines, fluxes, impostumes, or botches broken: or Lues venerea, may be the cause. They have pricking pain in the agrieved part: Signa. stinking matter, bloody and dreggy, is sent out from the ulcer: They have headache, pain of the great sinews in the neck, The roots of their eyes, and even to their fingers ends. For the cure, Curatio: Venae-sectio first bleed, if nothing forbid it: If there be much heat, look back into the Chapter of Ʋteri inflammatio: If the ulcer be very foul, cleanse it with ptisan and honey: Also Mulsa with the decoction of Ireos, Aristolochia, wormwood, or Agrimony: eating ulcers must be washed with Mares, or Asses milk, with honey. The ulcer being cleansed, Decoctio. make a decoction of pomegranate rinds, roses, quinces, myr∣tills, Acatia, with restrictive wine: oyle of ro∣ses and quinces are good. If you want more, look into the Chapter of the ulcers of the rains, bladder, and yard in Lues venerea. Yet this oyntment following is very good. Ʋnguentū. ℞. Tutiae ablutae partes ij. lithargyrii, cerusae, sarcocollae, sing. partem j. cum oleo rosaceo, & cera, f. unguentum. Altomarus de exul. uteri cap. 117. pag. 673.
CHAP. XXVII. VTERI PHYMOSIS: . It is such a streight∣nesse of the matrice, that it will not admit of any seed, yet sometimes it doth re∣ceive the seed, but through the streightnesse of the matrice, it bringeth occasion of death to the woman. Also sometimes the yard of man is troubled with a Phymosis; upon the praeputium for the most part. It is caused of exulceration, Causa. and an inflam∣mation going before: or Lues venerea, which lieth hid in the body: Signa. Curatio. Fomentatio There needeth not any signes: Fomentations must be used that can dissolve and mollifie; made of fenegreek, Al∣thaea, &c. And put up a drie spunge, having cord hanging to it: If it fall out put in a thicker: sometimes anoynt the spunge with oyle of Ire∣os, and goose-grease: If there be much inflam∣mation use oyle of roses, instead of oyle of Ireos: Oleum. Thus must you alwayes use spunges untill the end of the cure: If this Phymosis (which is a cal∣lous hardnesse) happeneth upon a mans yard, use dissolving things, as ℞. Muscilag. fic. & faenug. ana ℥. ij. Stirac. Ʋnguentū. myrrhae, ammo. diss. in ol. irino ana ℥. ji cerae novae q.s. fiat unguentum. If it will not yeeld to this meanes, use ung. ar∣gent. viv. extinct.
CHAP. XXVIII. STERILITAS: Causa. or barrennesse: It is caused either of the womans, or of the mans part; when his seed is either too hot, cold, thin, wa∣tery, or too feeble: Their yards too short, or their bellies too big. 2. Also women of their part cannot con∣ceive, because their matrice is either too hot, cold, and moyst, or too foule, filthy, or drie, or too streight, or too open: Also unwilling car∣nal copulation, or their age too great, or too lit∣tle, doth let and hinder conception. 3. A fertil woman is commonly of a mode∣rate stature, and height of body, breadth of loynes, and share: her buttocks sticking out, a handsome and convenient greatnesse of belly, a streight brest, and large paps. 1. Signa. The hot distemper of a man is known by his lascivious and readinesse to carnal lust, yet he is satiated and filled. 2. Coldnness is known by their want of hair, for their stones are bald, and they have little desire to lust. 1. If through too much heat of the ma∣trice, the rest of their body is hot and they are lecherous. 2. Coldnesse is known by their despising carnal lust, and the stopping of the menstruis. 3. If through too much moystnesse, then in the act they are bedewed with moystnesse, and the menstruis floweth much in quantity.
5. Drinesse of the wombe is known by the contrary signes to moystnesse. Moderate exercise and a good diet doth well. Curatio. Exercitiū. 1. If she be full of corrupt humors, purge her, 2. If the menstruis be stopped, look back in∣to the Chapter of Mensium suppressio. 3. If coldnes be the cause, Fomentatio make a fomentati∣on of penniroyal, aniseed, and cumminseed, let her drink Castoreum, and the juyce of sage in wine. 4. If heat be the cause, coole and moysten, with lettice, plantin, purslain, and gourds; Aq. sperm. ranarum. to make a decoction, or boyle them in broath; But Aqua sperm. ranarum, is excellent. 5. If moystnesse be the cause, let her exer∣cise, purge, and use a drie diet, and sometimes give her a cup of restrictive wine, wherein sage is boyled and steeped. 6. If drinesse be the cause of barrenesse, use those things that moysten. 7. Hierapicra. If grosse humours be the cause purge her with Hierapicra in whey or the like, labour and sweating is good. 8. If witdninesse, look into the Chapter of uteri Inflatio. 9. If through too much streightnesse of the matrice, look into the Chapter Ʋteriphimosis. 10. Fomentatio If through gaping of the mouth of the matrice, let her use a drie diet, and fomentati∣ons of the decoction of pomegranate rinds, quinces, myrtils brambles. Acatia, &c. 11. If the matrice be writhed, use mollifying pessaries Paulus saith that carnall lust used backward, is good to conceive. Faul.
CHAP. XXIX. DIFFICILIS PARTƲS: Causa. hard travel in child-birth, chanceth either through de∣fault of the parent, of the childe, of the secun∣dine, or through some outward cause. 1. Of the parent, as if she be grosse, fat, faint∣hearted, and unskilful of pain, or if the matrice be small, inflamed, or vexed with some other disease. Or if she be naturally weak, or labour before time: or if the neck of the matrice be crooked, or some peece of flesh ingendred there, of a bile or ulcer going before. 2. Default of the childe is, when it is of an unaccustomed bignesse or if it have two heads, or three feet. Or if it be dead, or if they be two or more: or weaknesse of the childe, may be the cause. 3. The travel is made difficile through the se∣cundine: If it be not pulled away, because of the grossenes of it: or if it break before it should, be∣cause of the thinnesse of it, and so the privities are left without moysture, which should make a slippery passage for the child. 4. Also it is caused of outward causes, as of cold, that thickens the matrice, and streight∣neth the passages: or through a great heat that dissolveth and weakneth the strength. 1. Outward causes are easily known by the telling of the Patient, Signa. or them that sit by them. 2. Weakness of the child is known by its flow motion.
3. Greatness of the child may be known by the greatness of the womans body, and the bigness of the Parents themselves. 4. Grosseness and thickness of the secundine, is known thus; none of the aforesaid signes are present, and the woman is strong, and the child stirreth lively. 1. The signes of a birth at hand, is pain un∣der the navel at the groine, and loynes, the Genitals swell with pain, and a certain fever like shaking, invades the body: the face wax∣eth red by reason of the indeavour of nature, armed unto the expulsion of the infant. Also when the infant by kicking, breaketh the mem∣branes, so that the humours runne out, is a certain sign the child is at hand: If the infant come forth with those waters, the birth proves easie. 2. The child in the wombe untill it be fully formed, sends forth his urine by the pas∣sage of the navel or Ʋrachus: but a little before the time of child-birth, the Ʋrachus is closed up, and then the man-child voydeth it by the conduit of the yard, and the woman child by the neck of the womb. 3. This urine is gathered together in the coat Chorion or Allantoides or Farciminalis (be∣ing all one membrane) together with other excrements as sweat; and wheyish superfluities of the menstruall matter. 4. He voyds two sorts of excrements, name∣ly urine, and sweat; in both which he swimmes. 5. If the woman have a man-childe she is merry, strong, and better coloured: The
males stirre in three months and a half, her right parts are strongest to every work or mo∣tion of the body. The right dug sooner waxeth hard; and that child stirreth most on the right side, if she have a female, contrary signes ap∣pear. 1. There be three concoctions, the first is performed in the stomach, which being dri∣ven down into the intestines, is voyded by the fundament. 2. The second cometh from the liver, and is threefold, first cholerick, a great portion where∣of is sent to the bladder of the gall, and part is expelled by sweat. The other is like whey which goeth with the blood into the veines, to nourish the whole body, and part thereof is expelled by sweat and urines. The third is the melancholy excrements, which being drawne by the milt, the purer part nourisheth the milt, and the remnant is purged by the Hemorroi∣dal veines, and partly sent to the orifice of the stomack, to instimulate appetite. 3. Thelast concoction is absolved in the ha∣bit of the body; and breathed out by insensible transpiration; is partly consumed by sweat, and other passages, as the brain unloadeth it self by the nose, mouth, eares, eyes, palat bone, and sutures of the scull. Lastly, Signa. if the child be dead in the womb, it moveth not: the womans belly is cold, having great pain about the navel, a naughty co∣lur of the face, and a stinking breath. 2. Also the waters are flowed out, and the secundine come forth: which are certain signes
of a dead child: Because the child breathing by the arteries of the navel, and the breath be∣ing received by the cotylidon of the arteries of the womb; It must of necessity come to pass (when the secundine is separated from the infant) that no ayr or breath can come unto it. 3. Moreover the child will be more heavie to the mother, falling like a stone to that side the mother inclines her body: she is vexed with sharp pains from the privities even to the navel: with a perpetual desire of making water, and going to stool, because nature is wholly busied in expulsion: The Genitals are cold, as well as the womb. 3. The child corrupteth in three dayes, and sendeth vapours up to the brain, and heart, &c. which causeth often swounding: Her dugs do fall, and her body is more puffed up then before. 5. If she be weak, having a feeble pulse, a cold breath, a livid and gastly colour: cold sweats, and cold in the extream parts, then judge death is nigh. 1. For the cure of hard travel in child-birth, Curatio. First place her in such a posture as is fit; namely on a stool or chaire, that is hollow and lyned with cloath (and covered with linning) made on purpose, or else place her on a bed, in po∣sture like one that is ready to be cut of the stone. 2. Then let the midwife anoynt the mouth of the matrice with unsalted butter, oyle or hens-grease, and open it wide by little and little, having her nailes pared close, and her rings
taken off, if shee have them on. 3. A fearful woman must be comforted, and incouraged, commanding her to hold, and stop her breath strongly. 4. If adstriction be the cause, as through cold, foment with decoction of mallowes, fe∣negreek, &c. 5, If she be very weak give her fome cordial, and let her smell to vinegar. 6. If the infant be over-great, make the mouth of the matrice as wide as you can. 7. If an unnatural form of the child be the cause, bring him to a natural form, partly by putting back, drawing to you, partly by turn∣ing, and partly by making it streight; the mid∣wifes armes being bare all the time, and well well anoynted with some fat thing. 8. If there be 2, or 3, bring out that which seemeth most ready, driving back the rest. 9. But if it be dead, and the Physicians can∣not prevail (with potions, baths, fumigations, sternutatories, vomits and pessaries) to expell the dead child: It must then be done by chi∣rurgical extraction (if the woman be able to in∣dure the same) with instruments made on pur∣pose to tear in pieces, if necessity require the same. 10. If the tunicle or secundine be very thick and strong, cut it. 11. If the humour contained in the tunicle or secundine, cometh away, so that the places are dried up, and a hard labour like to follow: wash it all about with the whites of egges: and with the decoction of mallows & fenegreek, or

If the secundine stick to some part of the matrice, draw it out by little and little, but not violently; your arme being warme, and well anoynted. 14. But if the neck of the womb be shut, Fomentatio use somentations that can mollify and release. 15. If she be strong let her sneese, Sternuta∣mentum. with casto∣rem and pepper; use fumigations, and the same things you would use to procure the termes. 16. Seeth in a pot motherwort, Ireos, savin, penniroyal, calamint, dictamnus, and such like, put the pot under a close chaire, upon the which let the woman sit; If the womb will not open with this means, whereby you may draw away the secundine, yet it will rot and turn in∣to matter, and so fall away. 1. When the woman is delivered, give her 2, or 3, spoonfulls of oyle of sweet almonds, Ol amigdal. dulcium. ex∣tracted without fire, or cullises, or gellies. 2. Let the secundine be presently drawne away (before the neck of the womb be clo∣sed,
according to the former directions. 3. Then must the navel-string be tyed with a double thred, an inch from the belly; let not the knot be two hard, lest that part of the na∣vel-string without the knot should fall away sooner then it ought: neither too slack, or loose, lest that an exceeding and mortal flux of blood should follow after it is cut off: when the knot is made, the navel-string must be cut in sunder the breadth of two fingers beneath it with a sharp knife: upon the section you must apply a double linnen cloth, dipped in oyle of roses or sweet almonds, to mitigate the pain, for so within a few dayes after, that which is beneath the knot, will fall away being destitute of life, and nourishment; By reason the umbilical vein and artery are tyed so close, that no life nor nourishment can come into it: commonly mid∣wifes do let it lye unto the bare belly of the in∣fant, whereof cometh grievous pain and gri∣ping by reason of its coldnesse: being destitute of heat: but it were better to roule it in soft cot∣ton, or lint, untill it be mortified, and so fall away. 4. Then the child must be wiped and clean∣sed from all filth with oyle of roses or myrtills; being first washed with warm water and wine, wherein is boyled the leaves of roses red, and myrtils; adding thereto a little salt is excellent: some use this lotion 5, or 6, dayes together, with very good success; for it washeth away all the filthy matter. 5. If there be any passages stopped, or cove∣red with a membrane, as often happeneth to
the eares, nostrils, mouth, yard, womb, and fundament: It must be cut, and tents put in to keep it open. 6. And if the ligamental membrane under the tongue be short and stiffer then it ought; it must be amended by an expert Chyrurgion. 7. If there be a chalky substance, both in colour and consistence, that sticketh on the in∣ner side of the mouth (which the French-men call the white Cancer) cleanse it with a linnen cloath bound to a little stick, and dipped in a medicine made with oyle of sweet Almonds, Medica∣mentum. honey, and sugar: This cancer will not permit the child to suck. 8. Also give the child a spoonful of oyle of sweet Almonds, extracted without fire, and rub the inner side of the mouth therewith. 9. If the child be troubled with fretting in the guts, apply moyst or sweaty wool, macera∣ted in oyle of cammomel. 10. Children ought not to be weaned be∣fore their teeth appear. 11. Those that are scabby all over the heads, face, or body, voyding many excrements, are like to be strong and sound of body. 12. Those that are faire of body, gather the matter of many diseases in their bodies, which in time will appear. Certainly by the sudden falling of such matter into the back bone, many become crook-backt. 1. The belly of the woman must be bound about with a ligature, made of indifferent breadth and length, to keep out cold (which bringeth hysterical suffocations, painful fret∣tings
in the guts, and a fever with other mortal diseases) and to presse out the blood. 2. Then give her some capon broath, or caudle, with saffron, and to keep the belly from wrinkling,. 3. Ʋnguentū. ℞.

CHAP. XXX. IS CHIAS in Greek: The barbarous sort call it Sciatica: It is a grievous pain which chanceth about the joynt, which the Greeks call Ischion, the Latins Coxa; in English the Hucklebone. 1. A plentiful phlegmatick humour, Causa. that is cold, gross, and viscid, flowes down into this joynt. 2. The pain not only troubles the leg, but entring very deep, is extended to the muscles of the buttocks, the groines, knees, and very ends of the toes: yea oftentimes it vexeth the Patient with a sense of pain, in the very Verte∣bra of the loynes. 3. The cause of such wandring pain, is to be referred to the manifold distribution of the nerves, which come to the joynt from the loyns and holy-bone. 4. Continual rawness and unmeasurable using of venereous acts do not a little help: Al∣so neglect of exercises, and a slux suddenly stop∣ped may be the cause: sometimes there is a fla∣tulency, mixed with the humour that runneth into the cavity of this joynt. There is a bitter and violent pain in the Huc∣klebone, Signa. some have pain about the privie mem∣bers; and the bladder being vexed, they have difficulty of pissing: The whole leg from the haunch to the heel, suffereth pain, yet often∣times no swelling, rednesse, nor distemper, ma∣nifest
to the eye. Lastly, the ligamentous bo∣dies moystned, with this excrementious humor, become loose, whence succeeds lamenesse, and at last a hectick fever. First, Curatio. Venae sectio if there be an inflammation, and the Patient full of blood, open the Basilica on the grieved side for revulsion; and then for evacu∣ation of conjunct matter, the Vena Ischiadica; on the one side of the Ankle.

ARTHRITIS in Greek, in Latin Articu∣laris morbus; the joynt sicknesse: It is a di∣sease harming the substance of the joynt, by the falling downe of a virulent matter; indued with a maligne and venenate quality; ac∣companied by four humours; There are ten in number. 1. Siagonagra, of Siagon. a jaw, . is when the virulent matter falleth upon the joynt of the Jaw. 2. Trachelagra, of Trachelos, . is that which af∣fecteth the neck. 3. Rhachisagra, of Rhachis: the spine, is, . when it troubles the back-bone. 4. Omagra, of Omos, the joynt of the shoul∣der; is when it molests the shoulders. 5. Cleisagra, of Cleis; . is when it affects the joynts of the collar bones.
6. . Pechyagra, so called for Pechys, which sig∣nifieth the elbow. 7. Chiragra, of Cheir a hand. 8. Gonagra, of Gony, the knee. 9. Podagra, so called, for that the Greeks term the foot Pous: this gout is most hard to help. 10. . Ischias, so called, for that the Grecks term the Hip Ischion: of this gout I have trea∣ted of in the former Chapter. Abundance of raw humours is the cause of this disease, Causa. occasioned by immoderate diet; and many other causes, which is to be found in the other Chapter. Those humours that do abound and fasten in the joynts, either be sanguine, cholerick, flegmatick, or melancholious: and sometimes ingendred of the commixtion of humours: The humour causing the gout is different from that which causeth a Phlegmone, edema, Erysipilas, or Scirrhus; Aetíus. for as Aetius saith, it never cometh to suppuration, like other tumors. The reason I think is, because it happeneth in parts destitute of blood. As soon as it falleth into the spaces of the joynts, Signa. it causeth cruel pain; one while with heat, as if they were burnt, another while with extream cold. Such as have this disease here∣ditarily, can no more be freed therefrom, then those in whom the matter of the disease is be∣come knotty: as Ovid saith well. Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram. The matter of the gout is a thin and virulent humour, yet not contagious; offending rather
in quality, then in quantity; instigating the humours, together with flatulent spirits, prepa∣red ready for defluction upon the affected parts, do there cause extream paines, that are intolerable. 1. I read of a Gentlewoman that had many ter∣rible fits, by reason of a tumour scarce equalling the bignesse of a pease, on the out-side of the joynt of the left hip: In her fit she did cry and roar, and rashly and violently threw her body this way and that way above her nature, Thru∣sting her head between her legs, and laid her feet on her shoulders, as if she had been possessed with a devill, being most violent when the tu∣mor was touched: yet all the quarter of an hour the fit held, she had her senses, and no inflam∣mation, no other swelling did appear. At last a potential cautery was applyed to the grieved part or tumour; and after the fall of the eschar, very black and virulent sains flowed out; which freed the woman ever after: whence you may gather the malignity and venenate quality of the humour. 2. The matter of the gout commeth for the most part from the liver or brain. If from the brain, it is flegmatick, thin, and clear; it passeth out of the muscles, skin and Pericranium, as also through the large hole by which the spinal marrow (the braines substitute) is propagated into the spine, by the coats and tendons of the nerves, into the spaces of the joynts: and it is commonly cold. 3. That which proceeds from the liver, is diffused by the great vein and arteries; and
participates of the nature of four humours. 1. If it floweth from the head, there is hea∣viness, and dullnesse of the head; with pain: the functions of the minde are hurt by the maligni∣ty of the humour: The musculous skin of the head swells, with a certain oedematous tumor. 2. If from the liver blood and choler bear the sway, the veines are large and swollen, the defluction is on a sudden; and through crudities it degenerates into flegme and a wheyish hu∣mour: if it degenerates into melancholy, the gout resembles the nature of a Scirrhus; but it is rare to be found. 1. Melancholy causeth numnesse, and a dull pain; the gout being of a livid or blackish colour. 2. A phlegmatick humour is also known by the colour; being white like the neighbouring parts; giving place to the finger, it is cold, and the urine thin and watery, and the pain is not very sharp. 3. The sanguine gout looks red, and the veines are puffed up by it. 4. The cholerick, fiery or pale; the pain is sharp like lancing: he is eased by cooling things, in the fit a fever taketh him, he is thir∣sty, and his urine yellow, many many times if the choller be acrid, a gangreen ceazeth on the affected part. 5. If salt flegme, there is itching, gnawing, and biting, 1. A gout healed, often leaves a palsie be∣hind it. 2. They oft desire venery, which is hurtfull,
because it dissipates the spirits, and weakeneth the nervous parts, and exasperates the pain. 3. The great heat dissolves the seminal matter, which flowing to the genitals, distends them. 1. Curatio. Theriaca. Avicenna. Treakle is commended in all Arthritical affects, because it dries and wastes the maligni∣ty thereof; so saith Avicen. in lib. de ther. ad pi∣sonem. c. 15. 2. If blood be the cause, cut a vein on the opposite part; as if the right arm be troubled with a gouty inflammation, Venae-sectio open the Sapheia on the right leg; this is for revulsion and evacu∣ation: If this easeth him not, open the vein next the pain, let him abstain from wine and flesh. ℞. Lac caprae ℥. v. vitell. ovor. no 2. ol. rosar. ℥.j. Caaplas. croci ʒ.ss. With the crums of bread make a cataplasme: stamping them well together. Bathe with vi∣negar, and then with oyle of roses. 4. After the body is once fed, they must not return to meats, before that the concoction be perfected in the stomach (which is called Culina communis totius corporis) lest the liver draw by the mesaraick veins, crude and ill digested mat∣ter, and so deprive the body of its nourishment; for vitium prioris concoctionis non potest corrigi per sequentes. Keep his body soluble with clysters, Purgatio. if a full body give a strong purge. 5. Vomitus. For a cholerick flux a vomit of Stibium is good; for vomiting in the gout is commen∣ded, Potio pur∣gans. and purging is good with Electuarium è suc∣co rosarum, in the common decoction: and ap∣ply medicines that can cool and restrain, the
medicine made with goats milk described be∣fore is good: adding popy seeds ʒ. iij. or opium ℥ ss. leaves of roses, night-shade, plantin, Hem∣lock, and henbane are good: In all hot gouts apply cloaths wet in Aqua sperm. Aq. sperm. ranarum. ranarum: for it is a singular remedy. 6. When you are forced to use stupefactive medicines in vehement paines, nourish and re∣create the part afterwards, with things that do heat, as origan, savorie, &c. 7. In all gouts, things that are diureticall are commended. 8. Vomitus. Purgatio. For a flegmatick flux, a vomit of Asaron is good: or a purgation downward is the safest way, the making of which you shall find in the former Chapter: But first extenuate the hu∣mour with oximel scillitic. Oximel. or the like: Let him abstain from meat often: Cataplas desolving fomenta∣tions are good, take mallowes boyled in milk, and stamped, adding thereto saffon, goose∣grease, and wheat bran, to make a poultis: or Arkangel stamped with white-wine vinegar, is good: or ℞.

First appoint a convenient diet. 2. Secondly evacuate by purging and bleeding. 3. Use topick medicines, according to the condition of the humour. 4. Lastly, correct the symptomes and pain,
which many times is sufficient to kill the Patient. CHAP. XXXII. MORBƲS SPINALIS, . vel spinae dorsi: The disease of the spine of the back: In English, the Rachites, or the Rickets. 1. The primary essence of this disease, con∣sisteth not in the animal constitution, or in that which dependeth upon the influx of the brain into the parts. Nor in the vital constitution, or in that which dependeth upon the influx of the heart into the parts: But this disease consisteth in the natu∣ral constitution, being rooted in the similary constitution of the natural parts. 1. Those parts that are primarily affected, do labour under a notable cold distemper, with penury and stupefaction, or benumednesse of spirits: many famous physicians have attribu∣ted the first essence of this disease to the liver; but it will be proved otherwise, for it is one thing to produce a common cause of a disease, and another thing to be the first essence of a disease. The affect of the liver doth follow this disease, and its substance is augmented in this affect: But in dissected bodies it hath been seen incul∣pable, in respect of the other conditions; nei∣ther is the liver grievously and evidently (throughout the progresse of the disease) affli∣cted: neither doth it labour under a cold and moyst distemper; for if it did, the face could not
be so well coloured, and the cheeks so ruddy: moreover the debility of the muscles, and the dislike of exercise, seemeth not to have any correspondence with the liver. The lungs cannot be admitted for the first seat of this disease. 1. For the narrownesse of the brest doth not presently arise from the very beginning of the disease. 2. Neither doth the Asthma perpetually ac∣companie this affect. 3. The cough is sometimes present, and sometimes absent. 4. An inflammation of the lungs doth not presently afflict the Patient. 5. Hard swellings, impostumes, and bun∣ches may follow; for they are common to men as well as children. 6. The ptisick cometh after a long continu∣ance of this affect, being far from the essence of this disease. 7. The impotency of the external parts to motion, and the inequality of nutrition, can∣not be deduced from the affected lungs. 1. The spinal marrow issuing out of the skul, doth seem to discern the first place. 2. The second all the nerves produced by it. 3. The third all the membranous and fi∣brous parts, unto which those nerves are car∣ried along; In these alone, the first essence of this disease is rooted. The softnesse, loosenesse, and Atony of the whole spine, without the skull, of all the nerves
arising from thence, of all the fibres of the uni∣versal body, do cause inability to motion, sloth∣fulnesse, and affectation of rest, which bewray themselves from the very beginning of this af∣fect; do abundantly evince the parts to be affe∣cted with coldnesse, defect, and benumednesse of spirits. 2. The secondary essence of this difease is ra∣dicated in the natural constitution; and also in the vital, which are both vitiated in this affect: The secondary essence, hath a dependency upon the primary. The secondary essence of this disease, is likewise in the animal constitu∣tion; which is that affection of the body, con∣sisting in the generation and due motion of the animal spirits, by which is understood the excursion of them from the brain through the nerves like lightening, and again their re∣course back to the brain, whereby they declare unto it, what is perceived by the organs of the outward senses. Now by reason the animal spirits have their passage through the first affected parts, name∣ly through the spinal marrow without the skull, through the nerves from thence proceeding, and through the parts into which those nerves are distributed, and seeing that all these parts in this affect do labour with a cold distemper, with a paucity and dulnesse of inherent spirits, the animal constitution must needs be vitiated, and the activity of the spirits in some degrees retarded, and yet the sence is not vitiated; for almost the gentlest motion of the nerves, is sufficient for sence, but not for motion; because
the latter requireth a greater strength and vi∣gour of the nerves. The parents may be troubled with Cachexia, Causae. Febris alba. the dropsie, the green-sicknesse, which some call the white fever: The scurvy, French pox, and the jaundies, which corrupt the blood, that cannot be changed into laudable and fruitful seed: so that infants may borrow a disposedness (from their parents) to this affect: But it can∣not be comprehended under the species of an hereditary disease, properly so called; for that consisteth in the formation. This disease accor∣ding to its primary essence is a similary disease, as before demonstrated. 1. Yet in many children, this disease doth fall under a second species of an hereditary di∣sease, improperly so called, as when the parents are troubled with the diseases aforesaid. There is also many times in the parents pe∣nury of natural spirits, as happeneth after large evacuation in fluxes, which wasteth the strength, and is not repaired before coition; especially a consumption, or hectick fever; a Gonorrhaea, or a cold, or a moist distemper of the genitall parts, and womb; or excessive sleepi∣ness of the woman with child, or slothfulness and ease, may be the cause of this disease. 2. A cold and moyst ayr doth powerfully contribute to this disease, which easily happen to such children as are born near great Rivers, Ponds, or Meers: So doth an extream hot and subtil ayr, for that allureth forth, and con∣sumes the inherent spirits: Also a plentiful di∣et may be the cause.
3. Likewise a stupidity and sluggishnesse of the first affected parts, a defect of motion, and want of exercise, immoderate sleep; and on the contrary, inordinate watching may be the cause. Also things preternaturally retained, as if choler abound and luxuriate in the body, for it dissipates the natural spirits. Likewise ter∣rene dregs of the belly, a sour humour, and also flegm may be the cause: immoderate sweat∣ing doth much dissipate the spirits. Precedent diseases may be the cause, as a phlegmatick Ca∣chocymi. Hepaticus fluxus. A Cachexia, a dropsie, immoderate vomiting, Lyentery, Dysentery, the Hepatical flux, Diabetes, excessive sweating, a feeble appe∣tite of the ventricle, an obstruction or scirrhus of the mesentery, sweet-bread, spleen, or liver; also an opoplex, palsie, or lethargy. It is possible for this disease to happen to those of full growth, being conjoyned with another, which is the primary cause; although it seldom cometh to passe, because of their con∣tinual exercise. The magnitude of the head, the leannesse of the joints, the crookednesse of the shank bone, or the elbow, the inflexions of the joints, and the sharpnesse of the brest, do not accompany this disease presently, but in process of time they bewray themselves, there is a consumption of the parts which is onely a symptome, and not a disease. Some are so gently affected with this disease, as you would scarce suppose them to be sick; they ear, they drink, and sleep like those that
are healthful, only they play with more un∣chearfulnesse, and shew forth some slight signs of sickness, and yet by the only benefit of na∣ture, without any assistance of art, they recover. The Rachites degenerate often into a con∣sumption, a Hectick, or into a slow putrid fever. The usual companions of this malady are Hydrocephalus, the fault of breeding teeth, an Asthma, Pthisis, Hectica febris, a slow and erra∣tical fever, and Ascites, &c. yet these may hap∣pen, although the Rachites have not preceded. Lastly, such as have little or no dependance upon this affect, are a malignant fever, the French pox, the scurvie, and the strumatical affect, which do sometimes associate this evil, and yet they are all distinct from this. The dogmatical signs relating to the animal actions, are these, Signa. the looseness and softness of the parts, the debility and languidness, and fi∣nally, the slothfulness and stupefaction. 1. First a certain laxity, and softness, if not a flacciditie of all the first affected parts, is usually observed in this affect: the skin is soft, and smooth to the touch: the joynts are easily fle∣xible, and many times unable to sustein the bo∣dy; for the most part they speak before they walk, if they be infested with it the first year, which among us is held to be a bad Omen. 2. But if they be afflicted with this disease after they have begun to walk, by degrees they stand more feeble upon their legs, they stagger and stumble at every small occasion, and cover sitting.
3. Upon a vehement increase of this disease, they totally lose the use of their feet, being not able to sit with an erected posture, and the weak and feeble neck doth scarce, or not at all sustain the burthen of the head. 4. A kind of slothfulness and numbness doth invade the joynts, and presently after the be∣ginning of the disease, and by little and little is increased: The younger that are carried in the nurses arms, do not laugh heartily, when they are delighted and pleased with any thing: nei∣ther do they kick or cry so fiercely, when they are angred: when they are committed to their feet, and the disease prevaileth, they are averse from all motion of their limbs. 5. They are moderate in sleeping, and wa∣king, ingenious, not stupid; but for the most part of forward wits, unless some other impe∣diments arise. Their countenance is more com∣posed, and severe, then their age requireth; as if they were ruminating upon some serious matters; these signs being taken do constitute a sufficient Pathogonomonical Syndrom, or con∣course of symptomes; of the first kind, which relate to the animal actions. 1. Of how great moment the Alogotrophy, or unequall nourishment of the parts, in this af∣fect; we have already demonstrated. 2. Secondly there appeareth the unusual big∣nes of the head, and the fulnesse and lively com∣plection of the face, compared with the other parts of the body: yet there is a Cacotrophy, or vitious nourishment, proper to this affect. 3. Thirdly, the fleshie parts are daily more
and more worne away, made thin and lean, which excellently demonstrateth the motion and degree of this disease, by its increase; This sign being joyned with the former, doth at least constitute a Pathognomonical sign of the second kind, that is such a one as is proper to this di∣sease alone. 4. Certain swellings, and knotty excrescen∣ces, also carruncles, knobby swellings, and hard bunches of flesh about some of the joynts, are observed in this affect; chiefly conspicuous in the wrists; and somewhat less in the Ankles: the like are in the tops of the Ribs, where they are conjoyned with grissles in the brest and sterne. These tumours are scituated in the ve∣ry bones, which witnesseth the species of the disease. 5. Some bones are crooked, as the spine bone, the shank bone, the Fibula, or small bone in the leg; then afterwards the greater shank bone, and the lesser bones of the elbow: the bones of the head stick out. Hippocrates But in health ac∣cording to Hippocrates, , The bones do give unto the body, stability, uprightnesse, and form or fashion. 6. The stern is elevated, that it may yeeld room to the augmented bulk of the liver. 7. The former parts of the Ribs are more soft then the hinder, and do more easily receive their aliment, and augmentation then the har∣der: so that the formost parts of the Ribs, which are soft, are more lengthened then the under∣most. The teeth come forth slowly, with
trouble; and then oftentimes waxe loose and black, falling out by peices, and new ones come again: though late, with pain. 8. The brest becometh narrow (in the high∣er progression of the disease) on both sides, and sticketh out like the brest of an Hen, or Capon, which indeed may somewhat happen in an Atrophy, or a defective nourishment of the parts: but it can scarce so fall out according to the change of the figure, without an Alogotrophy; this must also be reputed a Pathognomonical sign of the second kind. 9. Again, a swelling of the Abdomen, and an extension of the Hypochond parts, which hin∣der the free motion of the Diaphragma down∣wards, and consequently interrupt the breath∣ing, proceeding partly from the windiness of the stomach and guts, and partly from the big∣ness of the liver, and other bowels. 10. A cough is frequent, and stoppings, hard tu∣mors, impostumes, and inflammations of the lungs, is usual; and there is a lateral growing of the lungs in the Plura, which partly is the cause of the vitiated figure of the brest: They are averse from lying on their sides, either because of the coalescence of the lungs with the Plura, or by reason of some tumor; but these are not conspi∣cuous, whilest the child is living: The pulse in the wrists are small and weak. 11. Their excrements of the belly and blad∣der, do resemble theirs that are in health; they loathe sweet things, they weigh heavier then others that are in health, of the same age and stature.
12. The Hydrocephalus is known by dulness of the sences, the magnitude of the head, the sutures do gape more wide, the bone in the fore-head sticks out, there is a water outwardly contained undet the Pericranium: for the signes of other diseases, which are usually complica∣ted with this affect, look into their proper Chapters. The observations collected from the dissecti∣on, and inspection of bodies subdued by this di∣sease, are these. 1. The Abdomen being opened, the liver hath exceeded in bigness, yet well coloured, and not much hardened. 2. The spleen for the most part is not to be contemned, whether you consider the magni∣tude, the colour, or the consistence of it. 3. The stomach and guts are somewhat more infected with flatulent humours, because of the extension of the Hypocondriacal parts. 4. The mesentery is somewhat faultlesse, and sometimes affected with glandulous ex∣crescencies, and sometimes with swelling bunches. 5. The sweet-bread is suspected to be obstru∣cted, and to have a Scirrhus. 6. The kidnies, uriters, and bladder, are lau∣dably sound, unlesse there be a concomitancy of other diseases. 1. The stern being withdrawn, there is per∣ceived stoppings or stuffings of the lungs, which alwayes more or lesse groweth with the Plura; some have glandulous knobs or bunches, though but seldom.
2. In the cavity of the brest, is sometimes seen, a collection of wheyish waters, and more frequently then in the cavity of the Abdomen. 3. Sometimes all the lungs on the left or right side (though seldom) is infected with an impostume, so that being crushed, they yeeld a copious, thick, and stinking matter; of a yel∣lowish colour, and in the impostume is con∣tained much water. 4. The kernel in the cavell bone is always observed to be great. 1. The skull being sawed thorow in a cir∣cular figure, and the little cover being open∣ed, you may observe the Dura mater to be firm, and adhered to the skull in many places. 2. Between the Dura mater, and the Pia ma∣ter, and in the very ventricles of the brain, is sometimes found wheyish and waterish hu∣mors, which is the cause of the Hydrocephalus. 3. The Carotides and the jugular veines, ex∣ceed in many, their just proportion: but the arteries and veines, are usually slender in this affect. 1. The prognostical signs are these; the di∣sease properly natural; or if it invadeth before the birth, is the most dangerous, and seldom end in health. 2. The more early the invasion is after the birth, the more dangerous the disease is. 3. Elder children that go up and down, are more easilier cured then young infants that can∣not use their legs. 4. This disease proceeding from some other foregoing affects, is more dangerous then that
which is introduced by an erroneous regiment of health. 5. This disease chiefly invadeth the cradles of the Gentry, who live at great ease. 6. The greater the head is, the longer and harder is the cure. 7. The weaker the back bone is, the grea∣ter and the more dangerous is the affect. 8. The great swellings in the bones of the wrists, and the ends of the ribs, the crookedness of the shank bone, the shoulder bone, or the bone of the arm; and the great inflexion of the joynts, do presage the continuance of the disease. 9. If the Hydrocephalus be complicated with the Rachites, it ever importeth great danger; If the sutures of the brain-pan, do gape and water, get into the middle spaces, and swell the the Dura mater into a waterish and soft tumor, it is mortal. 10. A painful breeding of teeth is sometimes accompanied with most vehement symptoms, and even threatneth death: but the dog tooth portends more danger in this disease. 11. An Asthma, especially the Orthopny, Othopnaea. in which the Patient cannot draw breath, but with an erected neck, is very dangerous; for that prompteth to a suspition of some tumor, impostume, plurisy, or inflammation of the lungs, or some growing of the lungs with the Plura. 12. If the ptisick be complicated with this affect, it is for the most part mortal. 13. This disease in time changeth into the
ptisick, at least brings a consumption to the de∣struction of the sick, unlesse some grievous af∣fect and symptome do intervene, and prevent by hastening death: as a convulsion, the loud cough, the swelling of the lights, (vulgarly cal∣led the rising of the lights) a fever, a plurisy, &c. 14. If a dropsie of the lungs, or an Ascites, be complicated with the Rachites, it portends a desperate, and deplorable condition. 15. A hectick, slow, putrid, and continu∣all fever, maketh this disease desperate. 16. If the venereous pox, be consociated with the Rachites; be it hereditary, or contra∣cted by infection, it is uncapable of remedy. 17. The scurvie doth very much retard the cure. 18. Strumatical tumours, internall or exter∣nal, do not very much suspend the hopes of cure. 19. Whosoever are not perfectly cured be∣fore the first five years of their age be spun out, they afterwards live but miserably and sickly; and being either Asthmatical, cachectical, or ptisical, they die before they arrive at the con∣sistance of their age, or else they grow deform∣ed, crooked, or dwarfish. 20. If scabs, wheales, pimples, or the itch, come after this affect, it doth hopefully expe∣dite the cure. For the cure, Curatio. the method to practice is divi∣ded into , and , the Therapeutical and the Prophylactical part, or the curative, and the preservative: The curative part presupposeth the Physiology, Pathology, and Semeiotical part, which require a manifold exer∣cise
of every operation of the understanding. 1. Indication that noble instrument of the method of cure: Galen delivereth to be, Galenus. an in∣sinuation or declaration of the consequence, that is something to be done: In this sence it may be defined to be an objective action of the indicant, relatively considered, which repre∣senteth to the understanding the thing indica∣ted: that is, what may be helpful, what hurt∣ful, what elected and applyed, what forsaken, and avoyded. 2. The indicant is a state of the body, as it is moveable, relatively considered; namely, as it intimateth what is to be done in that particular. 3. The thing indicated is a medical action (directing to health) required on the part of the indicant. 4. There are nine things to be considered (according to Argenterius) in indicated actions; Argente∣rius. An? Quid? Quâ materiâ? Quantum? quale? qu∣modo? quando? ubi? quo ordine agendum? That is, whether? what? with what matter? How much? of what kind? after what manner? when? where? In what order a thing must be done? These indicated actions, are found out by the force of indication: which indication is refer∣red to some generation of the understanding: They vainly attempt the cure, who are igno∣rant that one thing is indicated from one indi∣cant; which indicant the understanding doth comprehend, together with the indicate in the indication according to Galens definition, Galenus. . Item in alla definitione, .
1. For the indications curative, first this di∣sease indicateth that those things are to be avoi∣ded which cherish and augment the distem∣per: and such things are to be implored, that may subdue the same, namely, hot and dry. 2. Secondly, Those things must be avoyded, that can scatter and consume the spirits: and such things must be elected, that have virtue to restore, cherish, and multiply them. 3. Thirdly, those things that make thick, fix, or stupify the spirits, are to be avoyded; and all those things that can excite the spirits, and ex∣pell their stupefaction are good; as exercises, motion, and frictions, &c. 4. Fourthly, those things are to be avoyded that are wont to mollify, loosen, and weaken the tone of the parts, and those things are to be given that can render them more solid and firme. 5. Fifthly, a caution is to be had of those things which promove the flux of blood to∣wards the head: or retard the passage thereof to the first affected parts: also choyce must be made of such things as stirre the pulses of the arteries in the parts first affected, and that do excite the spirits to a greater activity. 6. Sixthly, the unequall nutrition indicateth those things which promove the even and im∣partial distribution of the alimentary heat to the extenuated parts: The crookednesse of the bones require such things as attract the ali∣ment to the hollow side, as frictions, &c. 7. Seventhly, Cephalicals, and such things as facilitate the distribution, as exercise, and those
things that corroborate and strengthen the parts, are good. 1. For the indications preservative, or the prophylactical part: they are deduced either from the antecedent, or the present causes, the latter is propounded. 2. The causes are either impurities, or excre∣mentitious humours, (which are) collected or impated in the first passages, which unlesse they be taken away, do not only infect the nou∣rishment inward, but they dull and hinder the appropriate medicines: They indicate therefore an evacuation, either by a gentle vomit, or by a lenetive purgation. 3. The head requireth a particular evacua∣tion; which usually is performed by scarrifica∣tion of the veines in the hollow of the ear: also blisters raised between the first and second turning joynt of the neck. 4. If the Cacochymical humours be unapt for motion, then medicines must be used that do prepare such humours; more especially if tough and grosse humours be impacted, and setled in certain parts of the body; Hippocrat. according to Hippo∣crates, Corpora quum quis purgare volet, ea fluxi∣lia faciat oportet, when you would purge a body, you must first make it fluxible, with such a pre∣paration, as hath a peculiar reference to that part in which they are inherent: for the hu∣mours in the liver require one kind of prepara∣tion, those in the lungs another, &c. 1. Life it self consisteth in a triple constitution of the body, the natural comprehendeth under it, first the temperament, secondly, the inherent
spirits, with their plenty and vigour: thirdly, the tone of the parts; fourthly, the structure of the organs, fifthly, the continuity. 2. The vital containeth first the generation, secondly, the distribution of the vital spirits, thirdly, their participation with those parts un∣to which they are distributed; namely, the uni∣on of them with the said parts, and the com∣municated heat. 3. The animal comprehendeth first the ge∣neration, secondly the distribution of the ani∣mal spirits: thirdly, the due stretching of the parts, depending upon the influx of the brain: all these because life consisteth in them, are cal∣led vital indications; which directeth to the conservation of the animal, vital, and natural constitution. 1. First, in this affect you shall make choice of the best nourishments, such as are easie of concoction. 2. Secondly, cherish and strengthen the parts most affected. 3. Thirdly, gentle evacuations are good, the violent must be avoyded. 4. Fourthly, prepare the tough humours before purging, Hippocrat. according to Hippocrates, Quae movenda sunt fluida prius facere oportet. 5. Fiftly, let your remedy arrive at the seat, and penetrate to the very cause of the disease. 6. Sixthly, if the humours be naturally apt to move upwards, expell them by vomit: If downwards by siege: in like manner root out the causes by spitting, by urine, and by sweating.
7. Medicines mingled with the nourish∣ment, ought to be grateful to the pallate, lest they subvert the stomach, and hinder con∣coction. 8. The universal causes yet flowing to and fro in the body, being impediments, must be first expelled. 9. We must relieve the more urgent and weighty indicant; first, unlesse there be an in∣terruption of some impediment. The chyrurgions work is to scarrify the ears, make issues, raise blisters, apply cupping-glas∣ses, leeches; also ligatures and swathing bands are to be used, to sustein and erect the bending of the joynts and bones. Many children are cured only by the means of issues: it is a powerful remedy against the Hydrocephalus, both curative and preservative; and very much conduceth to lessen the magni∣tude of the head, and to evacuate the superflu∣ous water thereof: represseth the inordinate in∣crease of the bones, and drieth up the too much humidity of the spinal marrow, exciteth heat, strengthens the nerves, and expelleth the asto∣nishment: the issue must be made between the second and third turning joynt of the neck. To streighten the trunk of the body, or to keep it streight, they use to make brest-plates of whale-bone, put into two woollen cloathes, and sewed together, but the best way is to fa∣sten them to the spine of the back, with a handsome string fitted to that use. 1. Those remedies that can cleanse, and
wash the first passages, are clysters, vomits, and lenitive purgations. When the belly is costive, the excrements hardened, and windy humours torment the guts, or some vehement pain in the bowels af∣flict the Patient; then clysters are commen∣ded, as ℞. Clyster. Lactis vacc. rec. calfact. ℥.iij. iv. vel. v. sem. anis. pul. gr. X. sacchari commun. ℥. j. ℥.i.ss. vel. ℥. ij. butyr. recent. ℥. ss. vitellum unius ovi M.ff. Enema. Vel ℞. Clyster.

Emedical remedies, or vomits, do chiefly perform three things; First, they evacuate crude and corrupt humours, or impurities con∣tained in the stomach. 2. Secondly, by an agitation, and commo∣tion, they loosen the gross and viscous humours, adhering unto the bowels and other parts; and unlock obstructions. 3. Thirdly, they most effectually irritate the expulsive faculty of all the parts of the body; as the guts, liver, sweet-bread, spleen, kidnies, lungs, brain, &c. Finally, the whole body (by straining to vomit) is prone to a Diaphoresis; ei∣ther by a manifest sweating, or by an occult and insensible transpiration: If the humours tend upwards of their own accord; and the child
be naturally, or customarily apt to vomit, then administer one, according to the strength and age of the child, as ℞. Infusionis croci metallor. in vino Hispan. Vomitus. loco frigido factae & per subsid. optimè depurat. ʒ.j.ʒ.i.ss. vel ʒ.ij.

And let the child drink it in the morning warm. This is good to evacuate chollerick hu∣mours out of the stomach: This that followeth is an excellent vomit to purge flegm. ℞. Succ. fol.

Remedies preparatory, partly relate to the preparation of the humours (which are either flegmatick, thick, viscous, chollerick, melan∣choly, &c.) partly to the wayes thorow which they are to be expelled; and partly to the passa∣ges themselves, which sometimes require Ce∣phalicals, Hepaticals, and pectoral preparations. The simples are these, Catalagus simplicium. Herbae omnes capillares, Imprimis, Trichomanes, Ruta muraria; Spicae ra∣dicis osmundae regalis; Polypodium murale, Phylli∣tis, Ceterach, Hepatica, Agrimonia, Scabiosa, Be∣tonica, Cuscuta, Folia & cortex Tamarisci, cortex radicum capparum, rad. cichor.

If there be a suspition that the scurvy, or venereous pox be complicated with the Rachites; look into the thirteenth and four∣teenth Chapters of this book, and there you shall have plenty of remedies. 5. Remedies electively evacuant, are to be used after the matter of the disease be prepared, and the passages opened to expell peccant hu∣mours, Rhabarba∣rum. for which purpose Rhubarb is most ex∣cellent; for it is directly opposite to the essence of the disease. The simples are these, Rhabarbarum, Catalogus simplicium. Aga∣ricus. sem. Carthami, Jallappa, Turpethum, Epithy∣mum, &c. The compounds are these, Syr. Rosar. solut. Compos. de cichor. cum rhab.

Also the root of osmond the royal, of the male fernbrake, Asparagus, madder, maiden-hairs, Ce∣terach, hearts-tongue, liverwort, betony, sage, rosemary, and the leaves of dead nettles, may well be numbred amongst specifical simples, for their singular vertue in this disease. ℞.

This is most proper for those who have the Rachites, complicated with a cough, and an obstruction of the lungs. If the liver be afflicted, put in the flowers of Tamarisk, the roots of
male-fernbrake, raisons, white and red sanders, Sassafras wood, and sage leaves. ℞. Sarsaparill. ℥.viij. rad. chinae ℥.ij. lig. sassafr.

Let the child take half a dram, two scruples, or a dram every morning by it self, or else in possit Ale. 7. Remedies that correct the symptomes (such as the flux of the belly, the lientery pro∣fuse sweats, Rhabarb. and painful breeding of teeth) are these, Rhubarb, Senna, Tamarinds, Myroba∣laus,
for they leave behind an evident binding after evacuation. So that the cure is perfected partly by purgations, by astringent remedies, by such as open, and partly by such as streng∣then the parts. ℞. Mixtura. Fol. Sennae elect. ʒ.ss. rhab. ℈.j. pulpae tama∣rind. ʒ.i.ss. semin. anis. contus. gr. x.

If you want more, look back into the 39, 40, and 41. Chapters in the first book. For profuse and excessive sweating; mark what Hippocrates saith, Hippocra∣tes. sudorem illum, qui praeter causam fluit, purgationem postulare. That that sweat which floweth away without cause, re∣quireth purgation. For which purpose Rhu∣barb is most excellent, Rhabarb. also French, and Ren∣nish-wine is commended. But because accor∣ding to Galen, Galenus. Vinum pueris inimicum, by reason it heateth above nature, and hurteth the head; Mix with it rose-water, or put in Borrage, or rosted Apples, adde a little sugar, and nutmeg: Also Electuaries with steel, Electuariū. (If there be no ca∣thar, cough, inflammation, plurisie, or flux) Di∣arrhod.
abb. Diatri. sant. and conserve of Barbe∣ries, are good. For the painful breeding and aching of the teeth, vomiting is commended; or to rub the teeth with a tobacco leafe moystened. Nurses use coral, but to rub the gums with a marsh mallow root is better. If the pain be violent, use Laud. gr. ss. as before. Laudan. 8. External remedies may be divided into two kinds, namely the manner of exercise, and things externally applicable: Gentle exercises are referred to the manner of lying down. To the agitation of the body in the cradle. To the carrying them about in the nurses arms, and to sedendary pastimes. 1. First, lying upon the back, among all po∣stures of the body, doth chiefly recede from ex∣ercise: and is almost only allowable in the ex∣treme weaknesse of the spirits, as in acute fe∣vers, inflammation of the liver, spleen, lungs, in a plurisie, in the growing of the lungs with the Plura, and an impostum, &c. The simple lateral position conteineth somewhat more of exercise, to correct the crookednesse of the back-bone, a little bag may be made to lay un∣der the gibbous part. 2. Secondly, rocking of the cradle in time of sleep, must be intermitted: This kind of ex∣ercise is most profitable for weak infants, that can scarce stand upon their feet. 3. The bearing them about in the nurses arms, is most agreeable to the same children. Let the nurse sing, and wave the child to and fro; if it be strong, to hold it up gently by the
hands; if weak, under the arms; also rowling the child upon a bed is good, or upon a table, laying a hard cushion underneath, whereon the gibbous part may rest. 4. Sedendary games and pastimes are the least profitable. Masculine exercises of greater note are re∣ferred to these three titles: Exercitiū. To going, to an artificial hanging of the body, to friction, rub∣bing, and contrectation of the Hypocondries, and the Abdomen. Let the nurse use frictions with her warm hand upon the back bone, thighes, hips, legs, ankles, and soals of the feet, but not on the gibbous part that sticketh out, but on the hollow part: Let the nurse some∣times lift up the bowels, and sometimes depress them: sometimes remove them towars the right, and sometimes towards the left hand: and sometimes thrust the tops of the fingers under the bastard ribs, thereby to deliver the liver from any preternatural growing with the Peritonaeum; If any such should chance to be: It easily happens by reason of the greatnesse of the liver, and the stretching of the Hypocondri∣acal parts, whereupon the Peritonaeum and the membrane of the liver are most neerly and strictly conjoyned, and so by the help of time may easily grow together. Things to be externally applyed are liquors, oyles, liniments, oyntments, and plaisters. First, 1. Fomentatio ℞.

Emplast. de beton. and Diacalcitheos is much com∣mended, to be applyed to the back, adding ma∣stick, Linimentū. and Olibanum in powder, of each half a dram. Lastly, a liniment made with the gelly of Harts-horn, being made with such things as strengthen the sinews, as the flowers of sage &c. and in the time of anoynting, to mingle there∣with oyle of Castoreum, and oyl of nutmegs by expression, is excellent. . FINIS.
LIB. III. CHAP. I. ACHOR, vel Tinea, . or scald head: is a disease possessing the musculous skin of the head, or the hairy scalp, and eating thereinto like a moth. 1. Furfur is also a kind of ulceration of the head, Furfur. like a scurf or dandruff, and is like unto bran or oat∣meal; some term it a drie scall. 2. There is another called Ficosa, Ficosa. a fig-like scall, because when it is despoyled of the crust or scab, which is yellow; there appears grains of quick and red flesh, like to the inner seeds or grains of figs, and casting out a bloody matter. 3. But Achor is properly an ulcerous scall, for it abounds with ulcers, which are open with many holes, flowing with liquid saines, like the washing of flesh; stinking, sometimes livid, and sometimes of a yellowish colour. 4. If the holes be somewhat larger, Cerion. Favosa. its called Cerion, or Favosa, (that is like a hony comb) The matter which floweth resembleth hony in colour and consistence. They all proceed of a humour which is lesse or more vitious. Causa. It need not any more signes. Signa. Curatio. Purgatio. You must first begin with purging, and if
nothing prohibit, open a vein. Next, with char∣ril, Venae sectio sothernwood, Venus haire, Enula campana, roots and fumitory, make lie with a little vine∣gar, Lotio. and wash the head therewith, and with this oyntment following anoynt the head. ℞.

Lastly, an ulcerous and contumacious scall must be cured, as we cure the Lues venerea: to the oyntments prescribed, may be added a lit∣tle Ʋnguentum enulatum; Emplastrū. or take Emplastrum vi∣gonis cum mercurio, and fit it into the fashion of a cap; and apply it: but let the head be often washed with the decoction of Guaiacum, &c. For childrens scald heads, ℞. Lixivium. Pisorum m. 4. Decoquantur in s.q. aquae. Horum iuri admisceatur tantundem lixivii fortis: & facta ebullitione reservetur usui. Rulandus.
CHAP. II. ALOPECIA, is baldnesse, . or falling off of the haire; expert Physicians do reckon nine kinds of defaults of the haire. First, 1. Contorsio, which is a curling or intang∣ling of the haire. Secondly, 2. Decoloratio, a deformity of the colour. Thirdly, 3. Quassatio, a splitting or cleaving asunder of the haire. Fourthly, 4. Fractio, which is a short breaking away of the haire, for it snappeth asunder. Fifthly, 5. Atrophia, a drying away, or consuming of the haire, for lack of food. Sixthly, 6. Canities, is when the haire before its due time becomes gray or white. Seventhly, 7. Defluxio, which is a falling away of the haire, like as in them who lost their naturall heat, or recovered after a long continued sick∣nesse. Eighthly, 8. Phiasis, is when the haire is coloured like a snake. The ninth and last is this, 9. Alopecia I now treat of. The causes of Alopecia, Causa. are inflamed moy∣stures, whereby the haire before was fed; which through inflammation thereof is taken away. If blood abound, open a vein, Curatio. Venae sectio Fomentatio and take myr∣till seeds, and leaves, boyle them in plantin wa∣ter and red wine, and wash the head there∣with. Or ℞. Mellis purioris, vini cretici, Fallopius. urinae puero∣rum,

TORTƲRA ORIS, called of Almansor, Con∣tractio: it is untruly named the palsie, for it is more nearer a cramp; yet if it proceed from moysture, it is a kind of palsie; if through drowth, then it is a kind of cramp, and is com∣monly a sign of death. The chief cause springeth, Causa. as of that of the palsie, or cramp, called Spasmos, or else of cold, or some angry passion. The mouth and lips are contracted to the right or left side, Signa. so that one eye is sometimes clear shut up; and the breath issueth out at one corner of the mouth. For the cure, Curatie. if you look into the Chapters of Spasmus, and Paralysis, you shall find plenty of remedies; yet this bag following is much com∣mended. ℞. Sacculus.

CHAP. IV. PEDICƲLARIS MORBƲS: Causa. the lowsie evill, is a miserable sickness: It happeneth that these vermin do breed of moysture of a mans flesh, and begin commonly in the eye∣browes, and in some scabs or scruf, by little and little they creep out of the whole body with such danger, that very skilful Physicians have enough to do therewith. First purge, Curatio. and then anoynt with this lini∣ment following. ℞. Ol. amigd. amar. ℥. ij. ol. antiquiss. Linimentū.

CHAP. V. OPHTHALMIA, . is an inflammation of the coat Adnata, and consequently of the whole eye, with beating, and great pain. It may be caused either by a fall, Causa. a stroak, dust, or small sand flying into the eyes: or by a defluxion of a thin hot humour upon the eyes, or an inflammation of the Dura mater, or peri∣cranium, may be the cause. The signes are great heat, Signa. rednesse, and pain, which sometimes is so vehement, that it forceth the eyes out of their orbe, and breaketh them asunder: they are sometimes taken with vomi∣ting, which is a sign that the matter of the di∣sease proceeds from the stomack. Their diet must be moderate, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio Venae-sectio Galenus. and of a cool∣ing quality, and if nothing forbid, give him a gentle purgation, and open a vein in the arm. But Galen commends the opening of a vein in the forehead, to be a most speedy help. Then use repercussives, as ℞. Collyrium. Paraeus. Aq. ros. rub. & plantag. an. ℥.ss. mucagin. gum. tragacanth. ʒ.ij. album ovi quod suf∣ficit. f. collyrium.

CHAP. VI. SƲFFƲSIO, vel cataracta, . is a disease in which the Patient imagines that he seeth black things: It is the concretion of an hu∣mour into a thin skin under the horny coat, just against the apple or pupil: or it is a corrupt water congealed like a curd betwixt the Tunicles, and set before the sight of the eye, and the cristalline humour; so that the sight is quite lost, weak, or somehat depraved. Leucoma, or the web of the eye, Leucoma. Glaucoma. is not much unlike the cataract: and also Glaucoma, which is, when the cristalline humour is dry and thick, and the colour of it is green, so that the eyes seem green. The causes of a cataract may be a fall, Causa. stroak, heat, cold, or pain; by whose meanes the humour is drawne and gathered together: or else vapours and humours ascending to the brain, and from thence descending to the eyes, which in processe of time, and by reason of cold, are changed into water; and in the end be∣comes thick and congealed. When the cataract is formed and ripe, Signa. it resembleth a thin membrane spread over the Apple or pupil; and appeareth in colour some∣times black, green, livid, citrine, and a quick∣silver-like colour, which are all held uncurable, because it is very like that the optick nerve is ob∣structed: But a chesnut, or a sky, or sea-water colour, with some little whitenesse, yeeld great
hope of a happy and successeful cure. At the first when it beginneth to breed, they seem to see many things, as flies, hares, nets, and black things: sometimes every thing ap∣peareth two, and sometimes lesse than they are, and their sight is best in the morning: now if this filme cover half the pupil, then all things shew but by halfes: But if the middest thereof be covered, and as it were the centre of the cri∣stalline humour, then they seem as if they had holes or windowes: but if it cover all, then can they see nothing at all, but shadowes of vi∣sible bodies, and that but confusedly, and by conjecture. He must abstaine from wine, Curatio. pease, beanes, turneps, and especially from venery: Let his bread be seasoned with some sweet fennel-seeds: Venae sectio phlebotomy, and purging, if they be requisite, shall be appointed: Also masticatories to be used in the morning; and frictions upon the eye-lids are commended. Bright shining things, as the Starres, the Moon when it is at the full, Looking-glasses, Diamonds, &c. for the Pa∣tient to look earnestly upon them, are said to dissipate a beginning cataract; also for this pur∣pose, Collyrium. take two ounces of Damask rose-water, warme it on the fire, and half a dram of Aloes succotrine pulveris'd, mix them with the juice of Cellendine, as much as sufficeth; drop three drops into the eye every night eight nights to∣gether. I was taught this by a very good friend of mine, that held it for a great secret; or take Vigo's collyrium made ℞. Collyrium. Hepatis hircini sani & recentis lb. ij. ca∣lami

CHAP. VII. LIPPITƲDO, blear eyes: . or blood-shot eyes, is nothing else but a certain white filth, flowing from the eyes; which oftentimes agglutinates or joynes together the eye-lids. Sometimes it is hereditary, Causa. Rhasis. and then not to be cured: Rhasis saith, that when the white of the eye is turned to rednesse, it is caused of some salt humour, or super-abundance of Rhume, with corruption of blood: Also excre∣mentious flegme may be the cause. Some commend Emplast. contra rupturam, Curatio. Cucurbi∣tulae. to be applyed to the shaven crown: frictions and cupping-glasses applyed to the hinder part of
the head are good, and a collyrium made with rose-water, Collyrium. and a little vitrial dissolved there∣in. Lastly, ℞. Decoctio. Salviae, betonicae, hyssopi, serpilli, an. m. j. flor. stoechados m. v. rad. faeniculi peoniae, ana ℥.j. sem. anisi, faeniculi, ammi an. ʒ. j. nucis mus∣chatae, cinnam. an. ʒ. j. misceantur & co∣quantur usque ad consumptionem tertiae par∣tis, deinde coletur, saccharoque dulcis red∣datur potio, cui denique addantur syrupi de betnica. ℥.iv. Let him drink thereof often; Venae-sectio but first purge him and bleed him, and an issue made in his neck, cannot but be very effectual to turn the course of the humour: unguentum tutiae cannot but be very good. CHAP. VIII. AEGILOPS, . fistula lacrymosa; or weeping fistula of the eye, it is in the corner there∣of, near unto the nose, where there is a glandule made for the receiving, and retaining moy∣sture; for the humecting the eye, lest it should drie by continual motion: This glandule some∣times swells, impostumates, and ulcerates: by reason of a sanguine, Causa. or pituitous defluxion, falling violently from the brain, and in time it rotteth the bone that lyeth under it. There is for the most part a tumour of the bignesse of a pease, Signa. the which being pressed, floweth with a sanious, serous, red, or white, and viscid matter: In time they cause an Atro∣phia
of the eye, in some blindnesse, Prognostic. and a stink∣ing breath. Some chirurgions cut up the uppermost skin, Curatio. and wring or presse out the impostume, which lieth lockt in a little bladder; and cut it off as near as may be, the rest they take away with an actual cautery: The same swelling doth set∣tle it self otherwhiles in the length of the eye-lids, yet both are to be holpen with oat-meal, wine, and Tutiae, tempered together in manner of a salve: Anchylops. Anchylops somewhat differs from Aegilops, for that is a superfluous flesh in the cor∣ners of the eye, whereto humours gather. ℞. Thuris, sarcocollae, aloes, sang. dracon. Collyrium. ba∣laust. antimonii, aluminis, an. ℈.j. floris gr. v. fiat pulvis, & cum aqua rutae f. colly∣rium. Forestus. CHAP. IX. LAGOPHTHALMƲS; or the hare-eye: . In this affect the Patient sleepeth with his eyes open, because his eye-lids are so short, that it will not cover them. The cause is either internal or external; Causa. in∣ternal, as by a carbuncle, impostume, or ulcer: external as by a wound made by a sword, fall, burning, or the like. That which happens by burning and a car∣buncle, &c. is held uncurable; Curatio. because much of the substance is lost, you must use relaxing and mollient fomentations. Ectropion, is the turning up, Ectropion. or out of the eye∣lid,
both their cures are properly performed by chyrurgery. In this last, purge twice or thrice with these pills following. ℞. Pilulae. Forestus. Pilul. sine quibus, lucis major. ana ʒ. ss. dia∣gridii. gr. ij. fiant pilulae vij. deinde ut ocu∣lum lavaret praecepi vino albo, cui alumen de rocha, in exigua quantitate semel bullitum erat.

CHALAZION, or Hailstone of the eye-lid, is a round and clear pimple which growes upon the upper eye-lid, and is movea∣ble: The Latines call it grando. There is another pimple called Hordeolum, Hordeolū. growing upon the verges of the eye-lids above the place of the hairs, it resembles a barley corn. At the first beginning it may be dissolved and discussed, Curatio. but if once it comes to be hard, it's scarce curable, and is hardly brought to suppu∣ration: The best way is to open them, and then to press forth the matter: If the pimple be small, thrust it through with a needle and thred, and leave the thred therein, of such length, that you may fasten the ends thereof with a little Emplastrum gratia Dei, to the forehead; if it be on the upper eye-lid; or to the cheeks, if on the
lower, you must draw forth a fresh one every se∣cond day, as is usually done in chyrurgical Se∣tons: Thus at length the swelling will be de∣stroyed, and made plain. Forestus, Tom. 1. lib. 11: obs. 45. Forestus doth much commend the fat of a cock to bathe the pimple called Hordeolum with, and also the decoction of Cammomel. CHAP. XI. MYDRIASIS, . is the dilatation of the pupil of the eye. It happeneth either by nature, Causa. as from the default of the first conformation, (which is un∣curable) or by chance as a blow, fall, or contu∣sion upon the eye, which causeth the offspring of a humour, to flow down from the brain. First open a vein, Curatio. Venae-sectio then use cupping-glasses with scarrification, and frictions, whereby the defluxion may be hindered: Take the blood of a turtle-dove, pigeon, or chickin, reaking hot out of the veines, and poure it upon the eye; then apply thereto this Cataplasme. ℞. Parinae fabar. & hordei ana. ℥. iij. ol. rosar. Cataplas. & myrtillorum an. ℥.i.ss. pul. ireos flor. ʒ.ij. cum sapa fiat cataplasma.

To. 1. lib. 11. obser. 28.
CHAP. XII. HYPOPYON, . is the suppurate or putrefied eye. Sometimes it is caused by a defluxion, Causa. and sometimes it cometh after an inflammati∣on, sometimes by a stroak; through which occasion a vein being opened, hath poured forth blood thither, which may presently be turned into pus or quitture. Evacuate the matter (the Corea being ope∣ned) at the Iris, Curatio. in which place all the coats meet, you may cleanse the ulcer with Hydromel or the like. There are divers other affects of the eyes; as the Hydatis, Hydatis. Proptôsis. or fatnesse of the eye-lids. Proptôsis, or the falling or starting forth of the eye. Chemôsis. Chemôsis, or the turning up of the eye-lids. Pterygion, Pterygion. Staphyloma or web of the eye. Staphyloma, or grape-like swelling. These affects of the eyes, and their cures, are also so well known to ex∣pert chyrurgions, that for brevities sake I will omit them without giving you either the cau∣ses, signes, or cures of them; because I have been large in the former affects of the eyes; So that the cure of the former, may serve for the cure of these. Forestus. If you desire to be further satis∣fied, see Forestus. Tom. 1. lib. 11. de morb. occul. & palpeb.
CHAP. XIII. DOLOR AƲRIƲM: pain of the eares, Causa. is caused in some through cold taken in a journey, by cold winds  also it chanceth to many through a hot distemper, or inflamma∣tion: sometimes sharp and biting humours do cause pain in the eares. If cold be the cause, Curatio. Clyster. administer a sharp cly∣ster, made with rew, balme, bettony, worm∣wood, bay-leaves, and rosemary; also a poultis of the same herbs, Cataplas. with oyle of cammomel would do well; and drop into the cares a little oyle of bitter almonds: make a cake of Rye-meal and water, when it is well baked split it, and lay on English hony, apply it to the pained ears hot, and upon the cake a hot brick or tyle, so do three or four times, I once used it with good successe. ℞. Ol. amygd. dul. & Chamaem. an. ℥.i. ss. ol. Oleum. lillio∣rum, viol. an. ℥.ij. misce, injiciantur in aurem. This is good in a hot cause. If there be an impostume, ℞.

CHAP. XIV. SONITƲS AƲRIƲM; sound and noise of the eares, is for the most part ingendred of windy vapours, Causa. or of gross and clammy hu∣mours: It may be caused through weaknesse of the members, and of outward things, as of cold, heat, or a blow on the head. First purge with a dragm of head pills, Curatio. Pilulae. Sternuta∣mentum. if no∣thing prohibit: And let sweet fennel-seed be baked in his bread: Every third morning let him take sneesing-powder, and drop into the eares every night certain drops of oyle of rew, Oleum, and aniseed, and keep the eares stopt with cotten wool; This Electuary following is good. ℞.

If the cause proceed from the stomach, Vomitus. Theriaca. Venet. admi∣minister a vomit. Lastly, a dragm of Venus-treakle given in posset-ale (wherein rosemary is boyled) is ex∣cellent. Forestus. Vinum. Forestus doth direct wine to be drunk in this affect; and the decoction of Coriander seed prepared.
CHAP. XV. SƲRDITAS, & gravis auditus; deafnesse, . and slow hearing; It doth beginne some∣times at ones birth, and sometimes after∣wards. It chanceth either through cholerick hu∣mours, flying upwards, Causa. or through crude and grosse humours, stopping the hearing. First administer a dragm of head pills, Curatio. Pilulae cochiae. Oleum. or give him the infusion of senne, and sweet fennel-seed. Take an onyon, rost it soft, stamp it, and strain out the juyce, & mixe it with a little fresh goos∣grease, and drop three or four drops at a time often into the ears, and then stuffe them with black cotten wool, and let him keep his head very warm. The juice of coal-worts, mixed with white-wine, is good for the same pur∣pose: Fumigatio. Stern ta∣mentum. Let him receive the fumes of frankin∣cense, and amber into his ears. Also provoke sneesing: Let him lean his ear upon a quill, or reed, having one end made fit for the ear, and the other for the pot (let there be in the pot wormwood, mints, marjoram, stoechas, rew, seeds of dill, and cummin sodden in water) that the vapour may passe into the course of hear∣ing: Oyle of Rew, and Castoreum, Ol. caster. are good to drop into the eares, so is the vapour of vinegar taken with a reed. ℞. Scoriae ferri ℥. j. decoq. Rondeletius in vino, Injectio. quod postea injiciatur in aurem.
CHAP. XVI. PAROTIDES: . be inflammations, which are wont to issue in the kernels, which be by the eares. It is caused of abundance of hot blood, Causa. which is either mixed with choller, flegm, or melan∣choly: sometimes of humours compact in the head, and sometimes Parotides breaketh out in feavers. If fulnesse of blood be the cause, Signa. then there is vehement pain; if cholerick blood, they seem much like Erysipelas; if of melancholy blood, they do not vex with vehement pain, they are hard, but do not look red: If of flegmatick blood, in the swelling they be raised sharp upward. First cut the Cephalica vein on the same side, Curatio. Venae sectio Fomentatio and make a fomentation with Fenugreek, Al∣thaea, cammomel, and meal of Linseed, to ease pain: Emplastrū. Emplast. Oxycroceum, and melilot plaister is good, some have performed a perfect cure with Argent. Ʋng. enul. vivum. The oyntment there∣of being rubbed upon a plaister of melilot, and applyed two or three times: Lastly, this cata∣plasme following is very good. ℞. Cataplas. Paraeus. Rad. liliorum, & ceparum sub. cineribus coct. an. ℥. iij. vitell. ovor. num. ij. axung. suillae, & unguent. basilicon. an. ℥.i. fari. sem. lini ℥.i.ss. fiat Cataplasma. But if the matter so require, let the tumor be opened. If you see cause, you may put Ʋng. Enu∣lat. in the Cataplasme.
CHAP XVII. OZAENA: . is an ulcer in the inside of the nose, deep, stinking, and rotten, out of which are sent forth a loathsome and stink∣ing savour, with many crusty and stinking ex∣crements. The cause is sharp and rotten humours, Causa. which flow to the nostrils. Let the head be dried and strengthened; Curatio. Pilulae co∣chiae. but first purge him with one dragm of head pills: and ℞. Omphacii ℥.ss. cortic. mali granati, Ʋnguentū. vel confi∣ciantur sic. an. ʒ.iij. myrrhae aluminis, ladani ana ʒ. ij. calchit. aloes, cort. thur. an. ʒ.j. ol. rosat. & myrrh. an. ʒ. ij. cerae rub. q.s. fiat unguentum. Also the nostrils may be anoynted with the juyce of pomegranate, boyled in a brazen ves∣sel unto the halfe. Monardus. Monardus commends the urine of an asse. The juyce of Cresses with Al∣lam are good, and ℞. Mel. rosarum ℥.j. cerus. ℈. ij. misce. Mixtura. And anoynt the scabs therewith. Lastly, let him drink of this julep often. ℞. Aqua fumariae p.j. Syr. fumar. ℥. iv. misce. Julepus. Weckerus. And to mitigate pain Weckerus (in lib. 2. par. 2. pag. 423.) doth commend axungia gallinae cum ol. viol. & pauca cera.
CHAP. XVIII. PROFLƲVIO SANGƲINIS ex naribus: flux of blood at the nose, Causa. is caused by a two∣fold meanes, as internal, and external; external, as some fall, a stripe, vehement exercise, and tarrying in the sun; of inward causes, as plen∣ty of blood, and thinnesse of the same, and sometimes great drinking of wine. You may know if it come through plenty of blood, Signa. by a heavie pain in the head, much blood in the face, and by the rednesse of the eyes. First open a vein on the arm, Curatio. Venae-sectio if nothing for∣bid, Then take a little bolearmeny, and Aqua sperm. ranarum; mix them together, and spread them on a double cloath, and apply it to the temples: and let the Patient snuffe up a little of the water aforesaid, often cold: If the Patient be ancient, and have lost much blood, comfort him with claret wie burnt, Historia. and sweetned with loaf-sugar. This course I did once take with an ancient woman of fourscore years of age (that had lost so much blood that I feared greatly she would die under my hands) and God cured her: There are many excellent re∣medies to be found in the Chapters of other fluxes. Yet this medicament following is of great use. ℞. Medica∣mentum. Aquae plantag. ℥.viij. aceti ros. ℥.j. aqua ros. ℥. ss. duo ovi album. boli arm. veri ʒ. i. ss. concussa cum panno lineo fronti apponantur. Forest. Forestus. To. 1. lib. 13. ob. 13.
CHAP. XIX. POLYPƲS; is a fleshly matter growing in the nostrils, like unto a kind of carbuncle: Hippocrat. Hippocrates doth affirm that it is uncurable. Sometimes it is caused through grosse hu∣mours descending to the nostrils, Causa. and some∣times it ariseth through a melancholy humour. Signa. It is one while white, another while reddish, and adheres to the bone of the nose, and some∣times fils the nostril, hanging towards the lips, and resembling the foot of a sea Polypus. There is also found sometimes a softmembrane, long and thin, and is filled with a flegmatick and viscid humour, which in expiration hangs out of the nose, but is drawn in and hid by inspiration: It makes one snuffle in their speech, and snort in their sleep. Some kinds of Polypi are painful, hard, Curatio. and resisting: having a livid or leading colour, such must not be touched with the hand: But apply this Anodine. ℞. Olei vitell. ovorum ℥.ij. lytharg. auri, Anodyna. & tu∣tiae praep. an. ℥.j. succi plat. solani an. ℥. j. la∣pid. haematit. & camphorae an. ℥. ss. Let them be wrought in a leaden morter, and so make a medicine to put into the nostril: Those that are soft, loose, and without pain, are curable; some pluck them away with an instru∣ment: but the best way is to waste them away with Aqua fortis, or oyle of vitriol, and then to ease pain, take ung. de bolo, & nutritum: for a
fleshly Polypus, some commend a Polypody root to be put through it, to waste it. CHAP. XX. FOETOR ORIS: stinking of the mouth: it is caused for the most part through putre∣faction of the gummes, Causa. or teeth: or through meat sticking still in the teeth: many times it cometh through a hot distemper of the skin of the mouth, sometimes through corrupt and rotten humours sticking in the mouth of the stomach, sometimes ulceration of the mouth, or lungs, is the occasion of the stinking breath. If it chance through putrefaction of the gums, Signa. or teeth, or meat sticking in the teeth, it is easily known. If through heat in the mouth, there is felt thirst: If through vice in the stomach, the breath is more stinking before meat, than after. Exulcerations of the lungs, are known by exte∣nuation of the body, and by coughing, &c. Let his meat be easie of digestion, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. if stinch of the mouth come through corruption of the gums, look into the Chapter of the scurvie: If through ulceration of the lungs, look into the Chapter of Ptisis. Vomitus. If it proceeds from the stomach, administer a vomit, and then streng∣then the stomach with Aromat. Aromat. rosat. &c. rosat. Diam∣bre, &c. If through ulceration of the mouth, look into the following Chapter.
CHAP. XXI. APHTHAE, . are certain ulcers bred in the uppermost part of the mouth, and are by the Barbarians called Acola: they have a cer∣tain burning heat; some be whitish, some be reddish, and some be blackish, and those be most perilous of all other. They ingender for the most part in children, Causa. Causa. when either the nur∣ses milk is naught, or the child cannot well di∣gest it. These ulcers sometimes chance to them that be of perfect age, caused by a flux of vitious and sharp humours. The tokens are easie, they which be red, Signa. do shew blood to have the mastery, yellowish, sig∣nify bitter choller, whitenesse, flegm, blackness, melancholy. This gargarisme following will serve for the cure, if the ulcers be not malign. Curatio. ℞. Hordei integri p.j. plantag. ceterach. Gargaris∣mus. pilo∣sellae, agrimoniae an. m.j. fiat decoctio; in qua dissolve mellis rosati ℥.j. Diamoron. ℥. ss. fiat Gargarisma. Some make it with Balaustium, Barberies, red roses, allam honey of roses, &c. If they yeeld not to this means, Medicae∣mentum. anoynt them with Ʋnguentum Aegyptiacum, mixt with mel. rosarum. If any de∣sire to know more, let him read Forestue de Aph∣this & oris ulceribus. lib. 15. obser. 21.
CHAP. XXII. DOLOR DENTIƲM; the tooth-ache: It is caused sometimes through a hot or cold sometimes through flowing of humours out of the head, unto the roots of the teeth; which through their sharpnesse do gnaw about them. In a hot distemper the whole body is hot, Signae. and the face red, cold is known by the con∣trary judgements. If through the flowing of some humour, then there is pain, not only in the teeth, but also into other parts which it pas∣seth by. An hot humour ingendreth vehement pain, a cold humour causeth lesse pain. If it come of cold, Curatio. wash the teeth with warm wine, or this Gargarisme following. ℞. Gargaris∣mus. Origan calaminthae, pulegii, rad. verbenae, fol. salviae, betonicae, florum rorism. an. m. ss. nuc. muschatae ʒ. ij. vini albi. q.s. fiat Garg. And then bathe the cheecks with oyle of cam∣momel, Oleum. and rew: but if it come through ex∣tream cold, then ℞. Pulvis. Piperis longi, rad. pyrethri, melilot. an. ʒ. j. staphisag. ʒ.ss. Bruise them, and put the powder into a linnen cloath, and lay it on the aching tooth or teeth, and keep it there a quarter of an hour. If the teeth ake through heat, Decoctio. seethe in vine∣gar, plantin, roses, purslain, & pillory. If the heat be vehement, seethe in vinegar the seeds of let∣tice
and poppy. Oleum. And bathe the cheeks with oyl of roses, and water-lillies. If through flowing of humours, cut the Cephalica or media, Venae-sectio on the same side the grief is, or the vein under the tongue, then purge him. And make this Gar∣garisme. ℞.

It preserveth the teeth, and keeps them from pain. Sometimes a hollow tooth, that is much eaten, causeth extream pain; so that the Pati∣ent is forced to have it drawn, to prevent a fe∣ver. These pills following are much commen∣ded for staying a defluxion of rhume upon the teeth, which many times causeth much pain. ℞. Myrrhae drach. vj. Thuris masculi ʒ. v. Opii.

DENTES DENIGRATI, & molles. Causa. Teeth that be black and loose, happen through the flowing of vitious humours; and sometimes through a stripe or fall, sometimes through flowing of moysture, which doth loose the sinews and ligaments, and so doth make the teeth loose; or else gnawing, and weaknesse of the gummes, in which the teeth are set,
may be the cause. Also the scurvie. You must begin with purging; Curatio. then use Dentifrices. ℞. Fulvis pro dentifricio Nigellae, myrrhae, thur. ana ℥. j. mastic. pi∣peris alb. ana ℈. ij. pistolochiae ℈.j. aluminis ʒ. j. fiat pulvis. To score the teeth and dry them, you may adde nitrum, hats-horn burnt, dry mints, com∣mon salt burnt, pillitory, and dry penniroyal. Then make a collution to fasten the teeth with red roses, Lotio. mints, plantin, the barks of cypress nuts, seeds of myrtyls, Sumach, Acacia, pome∣granate-rinds, and restrictive wine. If the scur∣vie causeth the loosenesse of the teeth, look into the Chapter of the Scurvie, for there is plenty of remedies. Lastly, ℞. Pulvis. Coral. rubr. & alb. pyrethri, maceris, masti∣chis, Rauzovius pumicis, boli armeni ana ℥.ss. misce, & fiat pulvis subtilissimus. Rauzo. CHAP. XXIV. EPULIS; . is a fleshly excrescence of the gums, which by little and little oft times is increased to the bignesse of an egge, so that it doth hinder the speech, and eating. It casts forth Salvious and stinking filth, and not seldom degenerates into a Cancer, which you may un∣derstand by the propriety of the colour, pain, and other accidents; and then you must not touch it with your hand. If there be no pain, Curatio. begin your cure as spee∣dily as may be. Let it be tyed with a double
thred, which must be twiched so straight, untill such time as it fall off, then let the place be burnt with a cautery, put through a pipe, or with Aqua fortis, or oyle of vitrial; Aq. fortis. Oleum. but have a great care you hurt not the sound parts: for if so be it be not burnt, it usually returns. Epulis doth oftentimes turn into a grisly and bony substance (for want of a timely cure) as well as into a Cancer. If you would be further satisfied concerning Epulis, read Felix Platerus. Platerus. Tracta∣tus tertius & ultimus cap. 3. de extuberantia. pag. 383. & Fernelius. lib. 5. cap. 8. pag. 163. & 421. Fernelius. Dioscorides & Dioscorides. lib. 1. cap. 80. pag. 164. CHAP. XXV. COLƲMELLAE INFLAMMATIO, The inflammation of the Collumella, or uvula; which is a little peece of flesh, spungy, and somewhat sharpened to the form of a pine Ap∣ple, hanging in the upper, and inner part of the pallate, so that if one gape wide, and hold down his tongue, it may be seen: It serves to break the force of the ayre drawn in: And to form and tune the voyce: It is often vexed with inflammation. It is caused through blood, Causa. and other hu∣mours descending from the head. There chanceth difficulty in swallowing, Signa. pain, swelling, rednesse of the Collumella, and a feaver. Their diet must be of a cooling quality, Curatio. Phleboto∣naa. cut the Cephalica vein in the arm, and afterward
the vein under the tongue: purge the belly with cooling clysters, Clyster. and restrain the flux of hu∣mours, with such things as are of a restrictive quality, as Balaustium, red roses, plantin, myr∣tyls, &c. of which may be made collutions. As, ℞. Gargaris∣mus. Aqua rosa. rub. Plantag. portulacae an. ℥.iv. syr. de ros. siccis, vel de granatis, vel myr∣thi, vel cytoniorum, vel diamoronis, vel mel rosa. ℥. iv. aceti parum fiat Garga∣risma. Of what sort soever the medicines be, minister them warm. If the pain be violent, make a de∣coction of Hyssop, Decoctio. Figs, Liqueris, Faenugreek, Althaea, &c. If it draw toward rotting, as may be perceived by his colour, and will not break with Mulsa, and Oximel scilliticum, or such like; Then open it with some instrument; after the matter is burst out, use cleansing, abstersive, and glutinative medicines: especially the juyce of Eupatory, &c. This Gargarisme following doth very much restrain the flux of humours in the in∣flammation of the Collumella. ℞. Gargaris∣mus. Plantaginis, solani, portulacae, flor. ros. rub. an. m. j. folior. myrti, corticum malorum granat. an. ʒ. ij. coquantur in aqua Cister∣na, pro lib. i. ss. adde succi malorum grana∣torum post colaturam ℥.j. aceti ros.

CHAP. XXVI. COLƲMELLAE LAXATIO: often∣times it chanceth that a loose Columella, or Ʋvula doth hang upon the roots of the tongue, and jaws. It is caused for the most part through abun∣dance of Rhume, also great labour, Causa. and great weaknesse or sicknesse, may be the cause. You must use in the beginning such a kind of cure, as the inflammation thereof requireth; Curatio. you must make gargarismes that restrain and drie, as ℞. Nuc. cupressi m. j. ros. rub. balaustior. Gallar. Gargaris∣mus. myrthill. an. ℥.ss. aluminis ʒ. iij. decoquan∣tur in lb. ij. aquae ad remanentiam l. j. in co∣latura, dissolve syr. de granatis, diamor. ana ℥.i.ss. misce pro Gargarismate. If the inflammation be great, Venae sectio open a vein un∣der the tongue, and administer a cooling cly∣ster, then ℞. Succor. plantag. virgae pastor. portulacae, Gargaris∣mus. de∣purator. an. ℥. iv. mellis rosati ℥. ij. diamor. ℥.j. bolus arm. ʒ.j. misce fiat Gargarisma. If the Columella happen to ulcerate, look into the Chapter of Aphthae. Some are forced to have a great part, others all their uvula cut away. Take the ashes of centory, the powder of dogs dung, and hony, Mixtura. mix them for the ulcers of the uvula, &c.
CHAP. XXVII. BRONCHOCELE: . The Latines call it, Gutturis Hernia; The rupture of the throat, is a great round tumour in the throat: It set∣leth it self between the skin and the sharp arte∣rie, in which sometimes gross flegm is included; I mean flesh, as it were a kind of humour like unto hony, fatnesse, or like unto cheese and egges sodden together. It proceeds in women, Causa. from the same cause as an Anurisma. In some there is found a fleshy substance, Signa. having some small pain, some are small, others great: some have a cist or bag, others have no such thing; those that shall be curable, may be opened with an incision-knife, Curatio. and if possible, let out the matter: when the matter is evacua∣ted, let the ulcer be consolidated, & cicatrized: but before you attempt this kind of cure, make Gargarismes, Cataplas. Marquar∣dus. and poultises, of figs, fenugreek, linseed, Althaea, &c. Lastly, if need be, purge with Diacatholicon or Diaphaenicon in oxi∣mel; open a vein under the tongue, and ℞. Haustus. Cineris muris ʒ. j. detur cum vino, aut alio modo in aurora. CHAP. XXVIII. TONSILLARƲM INFLAMMATIO, in∣flammation of the tonsils, or almonds;
whose places be hot and moyst; and therefore the more subject to inflammation. They are most vexed with this evill that abound with blood. Nature hath placed these two Glandules opposite to one another, at the Jawes neer the roots of the tongue, in figure and magnitude like Almonds: their office is to receive the spittle falling down from the braine, which serves to moysten the tongue; which otherwise with continuall speaking, would grow dry, and fail, which often happens in feavers. The inflammation of the almonds, Causa. called Amigdalae, is caused sometimes by the drinking of strong wines; and through greedy devou∣ring of meat; sometimes there flowes a great quantity of crude, phlegmatick, and vis∣cid humors, together with the blood, whence a∣riseth a tumor. Signa. Swallowing is painefull to the patient, he hath a feaver: and many times the muscles of the throttle and neck, is so swollen to∣gether with the glandules, that the patient is strangled. First administer a cooling clyster, Curatio. clyster. Venae-sectio then open a vein under the tongue; if he abound with blood, first open the Cephalica on the arme. To ease pain, applie a poultis, made of barly meal, seeds of flax, fenugreek, althaea &c. or this ca∣taplasm following. ℞. Nidi hyrund. ℥ iij. pul. nuc. cupress. ℥ j. ros. Cataplas. ℥.ss. excipiantur oxymel. fiat ad formam Ca∣taplasmatis, applicetur in lateribus colli. Then use astringent Gargarismes, Gargaris∣mus. if still the inflammation increaseth, and there be sharp gnawings in the evening; then look for rotting
of it; Decoctio. for which purpose Aqua mulsa is good, and the decoction of figs, hyssop, seeds of Al∣thaea. &c. when it is perfectly rotten, break it with sharp collusions, or cut it with some fine instrument; and after it is broken, let the pati∣ent bow his head downward, that the matter may the better run out: and then let him gar∣garise with Aqua mulsa, Aq mulsa. untill it be healed. Sometimes there are ulcerations of the Tonsils, which happeneth unto those that do abound with vitious humours; I shall referre you to the Chapter of Aphthae. CHAP. XXIX. RANƲLA: . is a tumour under the tongue, which takes away the liberty of pronunci∣ation of speech: wherefore the Greeks call it Batrachium; because such as have this disease of the tongue, seem to expresse their minds by crooking, rather then by speaking. It is caused by the falling down of a cold, Causae. moyst, grosse, tough, viscid, and flegmatick matter from the brain, upon the tongue; which matter in colour and consistence, resembles the white of an egge: yet sometimes it looks of a citrine or yellowish colour. You shall open the tumour with a cautery of hot iron; Curatio. that so it may not return again: when it is opened, thrust out the matter contained therein, Gargaris∣mus. and then wash the Patients mouth with some barly water, hony, and sugar of roses: for so the ulcer will be safely and quickly healed. Or
℞. Aquae plantaginis lib. ss. balaust. ʒ. i. s. Gargaris∣mus. aluminis ʒ.ss. mellis ros. ℥.ss. bulliant: pro lotione usui reservetur. Forest. Tom. 1. lib. Forestus. 14. obser. 29. CHAP. XXX. HYDROCEPHALƲS: . is as it were a drop∣sie of the head, by a waterish humour; and is a disease almost peculiar to infants new∣ly born. The violent compression of the head by the hand of the midwife, or a fall, Causa. or contusion may be the cause; from hence comes a break∣ing of a vein, or artery; and an effusion of blood under the skin; which by corruption becom∣ing wheyish, at last degenerateth into a certain waterish humour, or abundance of serous and acrid blood, sweating through the pores of the vessels, as between the musculous skin of the forehead; and the Pericranium, or between the skull and the Duramater; or in the ventricles of the brain may be the cause. It is a tumour without pain, soft, Signa. and much yeelding to the pressure of the finger. 1. If it bee a tumour contained be∣tween the musculous skinne and the Peri∣cranium. 2. When it remaineth between the Pericra∣nium and the skull, the tumour is a little harder, and there is a little sense of pain. 3. When it remaineth between the skull and the Duramater, or in the ventricles of the
brain, there is dulnesse of sight, and hearing: the tumour doth not yeeld so much to the touch, the pain is more vehement, the head more swollen, the forehead stands further out, the eye is fixt and immoveable, and also weeps by reason of a serous humour sweating out of the brain. Vesalius. Vesalius writes that he saw a girle of two years old, out of whose head rann nine pound of water: Some their heads grow so big, that their necks cannot bear them. An external tumour is easily taken away; Curatio. It must first be assailed with resolving me∣dicines. ℞. Lin mentū. Pulveris absynthii, cammomillae, meliloti an. ℥ij. Butyri recentis, olei cammomillae an. ℥.iv. cerae parum, fiat linimentum. Vel ℞. Linimentū. Olei cammomillae, vel anethini ℥. iv. sulphu∣ris ℥.j. fiat linimentum. If it be complicated with the Lues venerea, mix with the liniment a little Ʋnguentum enulatum. If it cannot be so overcome, you must make an incision, taking heed of the temporal muscle, and then presse out all the humour; then the wound must be filled with dry lint, and cove∣red with double bolsters, and then bound with a fitting Ligature. CHAP. XXXI. PHLEGMONE; It is a general name for all impostumes, which the abundance of inflamed blood produces; as a Phygethlum,
which is a little swelling hard and red in the crown of the head, and Phyma, . or a little swel∣ling like a boyle; A fellon, Carbuncle, inflam∣mation of the eyes, squinsy, Bubo, &c. That is called a true phlegmon, which is made of lau∣dable blood, offending only in quantity. But a bastard phlegmon, or a phlegmonous impo∣stum hath some other proper name, as a car∣buncle, fellon, gangreen, &c. If a small portion of phlegme be mixed with a greater quantity of blood, then it is called an Oedematous phleg∣mon. But if the quantity of phlegme be greater, then it is a Phlegmonus oedema. A phlegmon though most commonly it be in the flesh, yet sometimes it happens in the bones, Hippocrat. Galenus. as Hippo∣crates (lib. de vuln. Galen lib. de tumor. praeter naturam) witnesse. The causes of a phlegmon, are of three kinds, Causa. 1. First primitive, as falls, contusions, strains, immoderate labour, frictions, application of acrid oyntments, burnings, long staying, or la∣bouring in the Sun; and an inconsiderate diet which breeds much blood. 2. Secondly, Antecedent, as the great abun∣dance of blood, too plentifully flowing in the veines. 3. Thirdly, conjunct, as the collection or gathering together of blood impact in any part. The signes are swelling, tension, resistance, Signa. feaverish heat, pain, pulsation, (especially while it suppurates) and rednesse; by which the abun∣dance of blood is signified. The cause of pain and pulsation, is heat, and abundance of blood,
contained in the vessels and arteries (which more frequently then they are wont incite the atteries to motion, that is, to their Systole and Diastole) and the compression and straitning of the said arteries, by reason of the repletion and distention of the adjacent parts, by whose oc∣casion the parts afflicted and beaten, by the trembling and frequent pulsation of the arte∣ries are in pain. First, Curotio. Victus ra∣ratio. his diet must be of a cooling quality, and he must shun all such things as generate blood too plentifully, or that heat the blood; rest must be commanded. Let him have his body soluble, if not by nature, then by art; as by the frequent use of clysters. Clyster. Let him avoyd all vehement perturbations of mind, as Hate, Anger, &c. and let him wholly abstain from venery. Venus. If strength and the age of the Patient permit, give him a cooling purgation; and open a vein. Venae-sectio If much pain trouble the part, it must be mitigated with medicines, asswaging pain. 1. In the beginning of a phlegmon, you must use repercussives, as ℞. Cataplas. Far. hordei ℥. ij. succi semper vivi, plantag. an. ℥. iij. pul. malicorii, balaustiorum, & ro∣sar. an. ʒ. ij. ol. myrtill. & rosar. an. ℥. j. fiat Cataplasma. Vel ℞. Linimentū. Ol. nymph. & rosar. ana ℥. iij. aq. ros. solani, & plantag. an. ℥. ij. aceti ℥. iij. albumin. ovorum n. iij. fiat linimentum. Let linnen cloathes be dipped in it, Aq sem. ranatum. and ap∣plied to the part. Also Aqua sperm. rana∣rum,
is excellent for the same purpose. 2. In the increase you must use this local medicine. ℞. Farinae hord. ℥. iij. farinae sem. lini, Cataplas. & faenu∣graeci ana ℥. j. coquantur in aqua communi, addendo sub finem pul. myrtillorum, rosarum, & chamaemeli an. ℥. ss. axungiae, anseris, & olei rosarum an. ℥. j. misce. fiat Cataplasma. 3. In the state, Anodines ought to be mixed with repercussives and discussives, as ℞. Rad. altheae ℥. iv. malvae, parietar. an. m. ij. Cataplas. coquantur sub cineribus, addendo farin. fa∣barum, & lentium, ana ℥. ij. pul. chamaem. & meliloti, an. ℥. ss. olei chamaem. & rosar. ana ℥. j. axungiae gal. ℥. ij. fiat Cataplasma. This cataplasme following is exceeding good to ease pain. ℞. Mucagin. rad. altheae. Cataplas. & foenugraeci ana ℥. iij. ol. ros. & aneth. an. ℥. j. farin. sem. lini quantum satis, ut inde formetur cataplasma satis molle. Or you may use populeon with Opium, Ʋnguentū. or nar∣cotick medicines, if the pain shall still remain. 4. In the declination, that is, when the vio∣lence of pain, and other symptomes are asswa∣ged, you must use more powerful and strong discussives; as ℞. Empl. mucag. & oxycr. ana ℥. i. ss. Diachyl. Emplastrū. mag. ℥. j. emplas. de melilot. ℥. ss. olei lilio∣rum, chamaemeli, & aneth. quantum satis est: fiat emplastrum molle. But if the humour be so impact, that it cannot be repressed; and so grosse that it cannot be dis∣cussed, which may be known by the greatness
of the heat, and swelling, by the bitternes of the pricking pain, the feaver and pulsation, and by the heavinesse: you must then use suppura∣tives, as ℞. Emplast. molle. Emplast. diachyl. mag. ℥. iij. ung. basilicon. ℥. j. ol. liliorum ℥. ss. misce. When the heat, pain, feaver, and other acci∣dents shall remit; and when the tumour hath a sharp head; and when by the pressing of the finger, the humour flow to and fro; then you may know that it is ripe. Then without any further delay, the tumour must be opened, ei∣ther with an incision-knife, or a potential cautery, in which action consider, 1. First, that you put your knife to the softest part of that Abscess. 2. Secondly, to the lowest part. 3. Thirdly, you must make your incision according to the wrinkles of the skin, and the right fibers of the muscles, lying next under the skin. 4. Fourthly, turn your knife from the large vessels and nerves. 5. Fifthly, the matter must not be evacuated too abundantly at once in great Abscesses. 6. Sixthly, handle the affected part gently. 7. Seventhly and lastly, after the matter is evacuated, the Abscess must be cleansed, filled with flesh, consolidated, and cicatrized. The ulcer must be dressed 2 or 3 dayes with this medicine. ℞. Medica∣mentum. Vitellum unius ovi, terebinth. venetae, & ol. rosar. an. ℥. ss. fiat medicamentum. Then use this detersive medicine.
℞. Mellis rosarum ℥. j. syrupi rosar. Medica∣mentum. & tere∣binth. venetae an. ℥. i. ss. farinae hordei ℥. ij. fiat medicamentum ad usum. But if you would cleanse it more powerfully, use Ʋnguentum Apostolorum, Ʋnguentū. or Aureum and Aegyptiacum mixed, according to the scope you conceive in your mind. Amongst the symptomes which most usually accompany phlegmons, feavers are the chief, as Ephemera, Synochus, &c. Their causes, signes and cures, you shall find in the second book of this volume. CHAP. XXXII. ERYSIPELAS, or inflammation. . Herpes mi∣liaris. It is a ge∣neral name for all impostumes brought forth by choller; as the Herpes miliaris, The eat∣ing Herpes, Ring-worms, and Tetters, &c. They are made by most thin and subtle blood, Causa. (which upon any occasion of inflam∣mation easilie becomes chollerick) or by blood and choler hotter then is requisite or by choler mixed with an acrid serous humour, but often∣times by sincere and pure choler, which by Galen is called a true and perfect Erysipelas. Galenus. 1. If choler being predominant be mixed with blood, it is termed Erysipelas phlegmonodes. 2. If with phlegme, Erysipelas oedematodes. 3. If with melancholy, Erysipelas scirrho∣des. But if they concurre in equall quantity, there will be made Erysipelas phlegmone; Erysi∣pelas oedema, Erysipelas scirrhus. There is great heat, Signa. pulsation and pain
(which is pricking and sharper then the pain in the phlegmon) without heavinesse, a yellow∣ish red colour. They quickly slide back into the body, at the least compression of the skin. Ery∣sipelas principally assayles the face, by reason of the rarity of the skin of that place. Galenus. Galen ac∣knowledges two kindes of Erysipelas, one sim∣ple without an ulcer, Prognostic. the other ulcerated. If an Erysipelas possesse the womb, it is deadly; And in like manner, if it spread too farre over the face, by reason of the sympathy of the mem∣branes, with the brain. So impostumes of a monstrous bignesse are often deadly, by reason of the great resolution of the spirits caused by their opening. Hippocrat. Curatio. Venae sectio Victus ra∣tio. Hippo. Aphor. 8. Sect. 6. The cure is performed by evacuation, and refrigeration. Open a vein if nothing prohibit; the Cephalick vein, if it assayles the face. Let his diet be of a cooling quality, then give a cly∣ster of refrigerating and humecting things. Galenus Avicenna. Galen and Avicen commends this oxycrate following. ℞. Oxycratum Aqua font. ℥. vj. aceti acer. ℥. j. fiat oxy∣cratum. In which you may wet linnen cloathes, and ap∣ply them to the affected part, and renew them often. If it be upon the face, ℞. Linimentū. Ʋnguentum ros. ℥. iv. succi plantagin. & semper vivi an. ℥. j. trochis. de camphora ʒ. ss. aceti parum, misce fiat linimen∣tum. Also Aqua sperm. ranarum is excellent; Aq. sperm. ranarum. you may wet cloaths in it, and apply them. If the pain be intolerable, this narcotick is good.
℞. Succi hyoscyami, solani, cicutae an. ℥. j. Linimentū. al∣bum ovorum, n. ij. aceti ℥. ss. opii & cam∣phor. an. gr. iv. croci ℈. ss. mucaginis sem. psyll. & foenugr. extractae in aq. ros. & plan∣tag. an. ℥. j. ol. de papav. ℥. ij. fiat linimen∣tum, addendo ung. refrigerantis Gal. cam∣phor. q. satis sit. But if the fiery colour begin to wax livid and black, abstain from narcotick medicines, and use resolving and strengthening things, as ℞. Rad. altheae ℥. ij. fol. malvae, bismal. pariet.

Erysipelous tumours do bring with them (oftentimes) Tertian feavers, as Exquisita Ter∣tiana, Tertiana notha & Semitertiana febris. CHAP. XXXIII. HERPES, . Causa. is a tumor caused by pure cho∣ler, separated from the rest of the hu∣mours, and carried to the scarf skin; and is diffused over the surface thereof. If choler be compounded with some small mixture of flegm, it will raise little blisters over the skin like to the seeds of millet; Herpes miliaris. Herpes exedens. This tumour of the ancients is called Herpes miliaris. And if it have any ad∣mixture of melancholy, it will be an Herpes exedens.
Let his diet be of a cooling quality; Curatio. Clysters oft times sufficeth for the purging of the pec∣cant humour. The chirurgion shall have re∣gard to the resolving of the tumour, and the drying of the ulcer; for which purpose ℞. Ʋnguentū.

Ʋnguentum enulatum is of great force in the re∣moving this tumour, Ʋng, enul. for it kills the pustules, and wastes the humour. Also fretting ulcers, which seem uncurable, may be healed, by touching the edges with Aq. fortis, or oyle of vitriole. CHAP. XXXIV. OEDEMA, is a soft, laxe, and painlesse tumour; caused by collection of a phleg∣matick humour. And may be said to be a ge∣neral name, for all tumours, which phlegme produceth; Anthero∣mata. Steatomata Melicerides as the Atheromata, Steatomata, and Melicerides; The matter of every one of these tumours, is shut up in its bladder or bag, as it were in a peculiar cell. The matter of the first is like childrens pap. Of the second like tallow. And the third contains matter like honey, in colour and consistence. Also the Testudo or
Talpa, is a tumour soft diffused, vaulted, Testudo seu Talpa. or ar∣ched like a Tortois, sometimes arising in the head, in the form of a mole. Nata. And the Nata is a great fleshly tumor growing for the most part on the buttocks, not much unlike a me∣lon. Glandula. The Glandula is a tumor which com∣monly breeds in the glandules, or Emnunctories of mans body. The Nodus or knot, Nodus. is a round tumor hard and immoveable, which usually arises on the bones of such as have Lues venerea. Also Ganglion, strumae, Wens, waterie rup∣tures, the Ascites, and Leucophlegmatia, may be reduced to an Oedema, and all flatulent tu∣mors which the abundance of corrupt flegm produces. But flegme is sometimes natural, and offends only in quantity, whence the true Oedema proceeds. The causes of all Oedema's are the deflu∣xion of a phlegmatick or flatulent humour in∣to any part. Causa. There is a whitish colour like unto the skin, Signa. a soft tumor rare and laxe, and without pain: when you press it with your finger, the Print thereof remains. Oedema's breed rather in win∣ter then in summer, and chiefly possess the bloodless parts, and is terminated sometimes by resolution, as in dropsies, &c. but oftner by con∣cretion, as in kernels, &c. and seldom by suppu∣ration. A symptomatical Oedema, as that which follows upon a dropsie, or consumption, admits no cure, unlesse the disease be first taken away. Curatio. Aer. Cibus. Potus. Motus. Quies. First prescribe moderation in the use of the six things not natural; as namely, the ayre, meat and drink, sleep, and watchfulnesse, exer∣cise
and rest, Somnus. Repletio. Inanitio. Animi pa∣themata. Venus. Hippocrat. Cataplas. emptiness and repletion, and the affects of the mind. If his belly be not natural∣ly loose, let it be made so by art. The moderate use of venery is good, if he be a strong body; for according to Hippocrates, it is a cure for phlegmatick diseases. You may use this fol∣lowing cataplasme. ℞.

As for the cure of flatulent and waterish tumors, I referre you to the Chapters of the dropsies, especially Tympanites. And also in the Chapter of the chollick, you may find plenty of remedies. Oedemateous Tumours do bring oftentimes with them intermitting Quotidian feavers. Oedema, Oedematis tempora. ut ceteri tumores, quatuor habet tem∣pora, nempe principium: augmentum: statum: & declinationem.

GANGLIƲM, A wen or ganglion, . is a tumor sometimes hard, sometimes soft, yet alwayes round, and useth to breed in dry, hard, and nervous parts; having commonly their bladder wherein to contain them. Wens or Ganglions are called of some Lupiae. For the most part they happen through dull blowes, falls from high places, straines, Causa. and other such like occasions. From small beginnings they grow by little and little to a great bignesse, Signa. in the space of six or seven yeares. Some of them yeeld much to the touch; and almost all of them are without pain. At the beginning, Curatio. Argentum vivum. strong and frequent fri∣ctions must be used. A plate of lead rubbed with Quick-silver, and strongly bound to the affected part, hath a wonderful force to resolve and waste the subject humour. But if the Wen be on the face, chest, belly, or throat, so that you can make no strong impression, then ℞. Gummi ammon. bdelii, galban. an. ℥. iij. Emplastrū. lique∣fiant in aceto, & traj ciantur per setaceum, addendo olei liliorum, & lauri an. ℥. j. aq. vitae pulveris ireos, salis ammon. sulphur. vi∣vi, vitrioli romani, an. ʒ. ss. fiat emplastrum. If the tumor cannot be thus resolved, it must be opened with a knife or cautery, and after
the eschar is removed, and the bag wasted by Egyptiacum, Egyptia∣cum. or Mercury, The ulcer must be cleansed, replenished with flesh, and cicatri∣zed. But sometimes Wens grow to so great a masse, that they cannot be taken away, but by the chyrurgions hand and instrument, this may be done if the wen be not too nigh the greater veines and arteries, or seated in the neck near unto the jugular veines, or under the arm-holes, or in the groine, or under the ham; It will be better in such a cause to let them alone, least deadly symptomes arise. Yet if they have a slender root and broad top, they must be streightly tyed, and so cut off. There are also certain small tumours of the kind of Lu∣piae, which grow chiefly on the wrists of the hands, and Ankles of the feet, caused by the imbecility of a Nerve or Tendon; got by wre∣sting, extension, a blow, or labour; which cau∣seth the Alimentary juyce (that flowes to those parts) to be converted into a cold and grosse humour, which in time concretes into a tu∣mour. It is not fit to use any iron instru∣ment to these Ganglia, which possesse the ten∣dons and joynts; Galbanum Ammoniac. but only apply Galbanum, and Ammoniacum, dissolved in vinegar, and Aq. vitae, or Vigo's plaister with double mercury: also a plate of lead rubbed with quick-silver, and ap∣plied, is excellent: If you want more, look in∣to the following Chapter, and there you may find plenty of remedies.
CHAP. XXXVI. STRƲMAE, or Scrophulae, That is, . the Kings evill. They arise in the glandulous parts: as the brests, arm-holes, groines, but chiefly in the glandules of the neck, commonly contained in their proper cist or bag. They are made of grosse, cold, viscid, Causa. and phlegmatick matter, with some admixture of Melancholy. Some of them are moveable, Signa. other-somme woven with the neighbouring nerves, remain∣ing unremoveable. They are oftentimes painful, especially when they wax hot by putrefaction: sometimes they degenerate into cancerous ulcers. A slender diet helpeth much to waste these tumors. Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. Let the superfluous humours be pur∣ged. Then take this emollient and resolving medicine. ℞. Mucaginis alth. foeenugr. & ficuum ping. an. Cerolum. ℥. ij. olei liliorum, & chamaem. an. ℥. j. pin∣guedinis anseris, & axungiae porci, an. ℥. ss. terebinth. ven. ℥. i. ss. ammoniaci, & galba∣ni, in aceto dissolutorum ana ℥. j. cerae novae quantum satis, fiat cerotum secundum ar∣tem ad modum diachyli magni. With some of this Cerote, may be mixed the powder of Quick-silver; and applied: for many have been holpen therewith; they must be dressed every second or third day. The un∣guent for the French disease, and Vigo's plaster,
are excellent for this purpose, especially if they be continued so long, untill the Patient come to salivation. The best way if possible, is to bring it to suppuration, and then let the expert Chirurgion open the tumor, or tumors; but not before all the contained humours that appear, be converted into pus or matter: for we must not as soon as any portion of the humour, be turned into pus, hasten the apertion; because one por∣tion of the suppurated humour, causeth the rest to suppurate. As fruits which begin to rot. If the putrefying part be not cut away, the resi∣due quickly becomes rotten. Also natural heat is the efficient cause of suppuration. Such as are in the neck, and have no deep roots, may be cut away; but speciall care must be taken, that the jugular veines, the sleepie arteries, and the recurrent nerves, be not violated or hurt. Lastly, some commend this emplaster following. ℞. Emplastrū. Manardus. Rhabarbari electi, ℥. ss. Aloes hepaticae ℥. j. Lixivti fortis lib. j. Saponis veneti lib. ss. ce∣rae ℥. ij.

A cancer, leprosie, corus, a Thymus, Gemursae. . which is a kernel under the canell bone; The Dracunculus, which is a genera∣tion of haires like worms, and are bred in the musculous part of mans bodie; whose cure ac∣cording to Gorraeus, Gorraeus. is performed after the same manner, and by the same method of se∣ction,
and incision, as the varices are; Varices. A varix is a crooked swelling vein, or if you will, it is the dilatation of a vein; Morpheae. Also the morphew black and white, and all other impostumes arising from a melancholie humour, Scirrhus legitimus. may be reduced to a Scirrhus, a true and legitimate Scirrhus is ge∣nerated, of a natural melancholy humour, be∣ing indued with a little sense, hard and without pain. The illegitimate Scirrhus is generated of a melancholick humour, Scirrhus illegitimus. concrete by too much refrigerating, it is insensible, and without pain. There is also a Cancerons Scirrhus, bred by the corruption and adustion of a melancholy hu∣mour; And lastly, an Oedematous Scirrhus. Causa. The cause is a grosse, tough, and tenacious humor, concrete in any part; which happeneth by an ill and irregular diet, or the unnatural af∣fects of the liver, or spleen, as obstruction, or by suppression of the Haemmorrhoids, Signa. or cour∣ses. The signes are hardnesse, renitency, a blackish colour, and a dilation of the veines of the affected part, with blackishnesse. The ille∣gitimate or bastard Scirrhus, and also the cance∣rous, admit no cure; and the true legitimate scarce yeeld to any. First prescribe a convenient diet, Curatio. Victus ra∣tio. and let the Patient be free from all perturbation of anger, grief, and sadnesse; and let him flie from ve∣nerie, as from an enemie. Secondly, Venus. procure the Haemorrhoids in men, and the courses in women, and purge with this potion fol∣lowing. Potio pur∣gans. ℞. Diacatholiconis, tripherae persicae, an. ʒ. iij.
diasennae solut. ʒ. ij. rhabarbari in aqua endiv. infusi & expressi ʒ. j. cinnamomi gr. iv. aqua∣rum lupuli, & endviae an. ℥. ij. misce, & fiat potio. At the beginning emollients must be used; and then presently resolving, or such as are mixed both of resolving, Emplastrū. and emollient faculties; for which purpose the emplaster of vigo with a double quantity of Mercury is effectual; for that mollifies, resolves, and wasts all tumors of this kind. Lastly Goats dung is very good to discusse Scirrhus tumours. If you want more, look into the Chapters of the diseases of the spleen. Quartan feavers happeneth often upon Scirrhus tumours. CHAP. XXXVIII. CANCER, It is a hard tumor, rough, and unequall; . round and immoveable; of an ash or livid colour, horrin by reason of the veines on every side, swollen with black blood, and spread abroad to the similitude of the stretched out legs, and clawes of a crab. The suppression of accustomed evacuations, Causa. an irregular diet, and obstruction of the spleen, may be the cause. It torments the Patient with pricking pain, Signa. like the pricking of needles with acrid heat, be∣ing of a livid and ash colour, and representing the toothed clawes of a crab. There is an ulcera∣ted or manifest Cancer, and the not ulcerated or occult, some are inveterate; one small, ano∣ther
great, one raging and malign, another more mild. Every Cancer is held uncura∣ble, or very difficult; for it is a particular le∣prosie. Some possesse the internal parts, as the womb, guts, and fundament. Others the ex∣ternall, as the brests. The tumor seems soft to the eye, but hard to the touch. The ulcer is filthie, with lips, thick, swollen, hard, knottie, turned out, and standing up, casting forth fllthie and carrion like filth, having a horrid aspect; The pain, feaver, and all the symptomes are increased by acrid medicines. In weak bodies we must not attempt the cure; Curatio. but only keep them from growing more violent, and from spreading further. Hippocrat. Hippocra∣tes saith, that such as are cured of an occult can∣cer do quickly die, but such as are not cured, live longer. Galenus. Galen affirms he cured a cancer not ulcerated. The cure is performed by medi∣cines purging melancholie, by phlebotomie, and shunning all things that may breed ill and feculent blood. A cooling and humecting diet must be prescribed, Victus. and the part affe∣cted with the cancer must be gently handled. Asses milk is exceeding fit to asswage the acri∣monie of the cancerous humour; taken in∣wardlie, and applied outwardlie to the cance∣rous ulcer. If the cancer be small, and in a part which may suffer amputation; cut a way (accor∣ding to art) whatsoever is corrupt even to the quick; Historia. A neer kinsman of mine was (eight years agone) troubled with a cancerous tumor in his brest; for a certain time I bathed the part affe∣cted with Oleum rosarum omphacinum, Ol. ros. omp. & applied
many plasters of Diacalcitheos, Diacalcith. and it pleased the Lord to cure him. Yea (and contrary to the Aphorisme of Hippocrates) he lived many yeares after. Hippocrat. This following medicine is very commendable. ℞. Plumbiusti loti, pomph. thuris an. ʒ. ij. ss. absynth. pontic. Ʋnguent. ℥. ss. letros. ℥. iv. cerae ʒ. vj. succi solani quantum sufficit ad ung uenti crassitudinē. Also ℞. Ʋngueutū.

Some applie leeches, Sangui∣sugae. others whelps, and chick∣ins, cut long wayes, and applied warm. If the cancer affect the womb, the Patient feels pricking pain in the groines, and kidnies, and is often troubled with difficulty of making water, and when it is ulcerated, it powres forth filth, or matter exceeding stinking, and carion like, and that in great plenty; The filthy vapour of which is carried up to the heart and brain, and causes often swounding. In this cause fo∣mentations must be used to ease pain, and cor∣dial Epithemes must be applyed to the heart, Epithema. and let the Patient drink Aq. Aqua opt. sperm. ranarum often, five or six spoonfuls at a time; also let it be injected with a syring. A plate of lead besmeared with quick-silver, Argentum vivum. and applyed to a not ulcerated cancer is much commended by divers; yea it is a good medicine for malign and inveterate ulcers, which contemn the force of other medicines, and is as it were an antidote to waste and over∣come their malignity and evill nature.
CHAP. XXXIX. ANEƲRISMA, is a soft tumour yeelding to the touch: made by the blood and spirit, poured forth under the flesh and muscles, by the dilatation or relaxation of an artery. They are made by the Anastomasis, Causa. spring∣ing, breaking, erosion, and wounding of the arteries. They happen frequently in the throat, especially in women after a painful travel, by holding their breath too strongly for the ex∣pulsion of the birth, the artery is dilated and broken; whence followes an effusion of blood and spirit under the skin. Also an artery woun∣ded, and closing too slowly may be the cause. Aneurisma, is a swelling, one while great, Signa. another small; soft, with a pulsation, and a colour not varying from the other fleshy parts: If you presse it with your finger, the arterious blood and spirits flieth back into the body of the artery, so that the tumor seems vanished; but the fingers being taken away, they return again with like celerity, making a noyse like hissing. Aneurismaes under the arm-pits, Curatio. in the groines, or any other part where there are large vessels, admit no cure. They ought not to be opened, unlesse they be small in an ignoble part. But the manner of cure shall be this, cut the skin which lies over it, untill the arterie appear; then thrust a blunt and crooked needle with a thred in it, under it, and bind it;
then cut it off, and so expect the falling off of the thred of it self, whilst nature covers the ori∣fices of the cut artery with new flesh. The Aneurismaes which happen in the internal parts are incurable. This matter many times by lit∣tle and little, is so dried and hardened, that it degenerates into a grisly, or else a bony sub∣stance. Victus. Their diet must be of a cooling quali∣ty. Cataplas. Clysler. Some commend cataplasmes of curds and new cheese, to be applyed. And clysters wherein Cassia is dissolved, and administred, is good. Lastly, take this caution along with you in the knowing Aneurismaes, sometimes you can perceive no pulsation, neither can you presse the blood into the artery, because many times it is condensate, and concrete into clods; this happens mostly in those that are large. The blood putrifies, Prognostic. they have great paines, a Gangreen usually followes, and mortification of the part, and lastly, death. If you would be further satisfied concerning Aneurisma: Paulus read Paulus lib. 6. cap. 37. & Aetius lib. Aetius Forestus. Sennertus. Fernelius. Platerus. 15. cap. 10. & Forestus lib. 1.

CHAP. XL. PROCIDENTIA ANI, the falling down of the fundament, is very frequent to chil∣dren. It is caused through the relaxation of the muscle Sphincter, which ingirts the fundament; Causa. which happeneth by reason of the too much humiditie of the belly. A bloody flux, or a strong endeavour to expell the excrements, or sitting upon a cold stone, a stroak or fall upon the holy bone, or a palsie of the nerves, &c. may be the cause. The Patient must forbear much drink, Curatio. or broath, and ℞. Pulegii, marrubii, myrthi, betonicae, Fomenta∣tio. ver∣basci, an. m. j. flor.

If you want more, look into the Chapter of Pro∣cidentia uteri.
CHAP. XLI. CONDYLOMATA, . are certain wrinkled and hard bunches, and as it were excrescen∣ces of the flesh rising especially in the wrinkled edges of the fundament, and the neck of the womb. Cooling and relaxing medicines ought to be used against this disease, Curatio. for which purpose ℞. Ʋnguentū. Ol. ovor. sem. lini, an. ℥. ij. Beat them together a long time in a leaden morter, and therewith anoynt the grieved part. If there be an inflammation, put thereto a little camphir. Chaps, Fissurae aui. or Fissures, are cleft, and very long little ulcers; with pain, very sharp and burning; by reason of the biting of an acrid, salt, and drying humour; making so great a contraction, and oftentimes narrownesse in the fundament, and the neck of the womb, that scarcely the top of ones finger may be put into the orifice there∣of; like unto pieces of leather or parchment, which are wrinkled and parched by holding of them to the fire. They arise sometimes in the mouth, that the Patient can neither eat, speak, nor open his mouth; so that the chyrurgion is constrained to cut it. In the cure thereof, all sharp things are to be avoided, and those which mollifie, are to be used; look Ʋteri Phymosis.
CHAP. XLII. CACOETHE, is a species of the canker, and so venemous, that it continueth with a bo∣dy all his life-time, being held by many incu∣rable. It sendeth forth a virulent sanies, which is properly called virus; this virus or virulency gnaws and feeds upon the parts which lie un∣der, and are adjoyning to the ulcer, Galenus: and maketh an eating ulcer; Galen calleth it Dysepu∣lotica, that is, difficulty to be cicatrized. This following medicine is much commen∣ded by Galen, Guratio. Galenus. being of certain and approved use for desperate ulcers, which many have ta∣ken in hand and left as uncurable. ℞.

CHA. XLIII. PARONYCHIA, . is a tumor in the ends of the fingers, under the nailes, with great in∣flammation. It is caused through a malign, Causa, and vene∣mous humour; which from the bones by the Periosteum, is communicated to the tendons and nerves, of that part which it affecteth. There follow pulsifique pain, Signa. a seaver, and restlesnesse. You must begin with purging, Curatio. Venae-sectio and blood-letting. Then make incision in the inner part of the finger even to the bone, along the first joynt thereof; This must be done before it come to maturation, suffer it to bleed well; then let him dip his finger in strong and warm vine∣gar, in which some treakle hath been dissol∣ved; and then appease the pain with Ʋnguen∣tum populneum, or the like. And take this oynt∣ment following. ℞. Ʋnguentū. Sacchari rosati ℥.ss. axungiae gallinae, ʒ.iij. vitellorum ovorum, n.j. butyri recentis pa∣rum. fiat unguentum, in mortario absque igne. If a Gangrene and Sphacel happen, the Chy∣rurgeon must make use of his cutting mullets, to save the rest of the body. If you please you may read Forestus lib. Forestus. 5. de tumoribus praeternatu∣ram. Observatio 16. pag. 162.
CHAP. XLIV. EXOMPHALƲS, or swelling of the navel. . It is caused by the Peritonaeum, either re∣laxed or broken; by which occasion oft-times the Guts or Kall fall into the seat of the navel, and sometimes superfluous flesh is there genera∣ted; sometimes this tumour is an Aneurisma. Sometimes it is caused by a flatulent, and some∣times by a waterish humour. If the fall be the cause, Signa. the colour is like the skin; soft, and almost without pain. But if the tu∣mor proceed from superfluous flesh, it is hard and immoveable. If from wind, it sounds when you press it. If by a waterish humour, it is easily known. If from the effusion of blood, it is of a livid colour; but if the effused blood be arterial, then there are signes of a Aneurisma. If it be cau∣sed by the falling down of the guts, there is heard a noyse when you press it. If the tumor ptoceed from the Kall and Guts, you must force them into their due place. Curatio. Then may the skin be taken up, and thrust through with a needle, and double twined strong thred; next let the sides be scarified, then thrust it through with a needle three or four times, and twich it strongly with a thred, that the skin with the ligature may fall off. But you may cut off the skin so distended even to the ligatures, and then cicatrize it. In a watery tumor, a small incision must be made, and the wound kept open untill the water be emptied.
CHAP. XLV. GANGRAENA: . a Gangrene is a certain disposition and way to the mortification of the part which it seizeth upon, dying by lit∣tle and little. When there is a perfect mortifi∣cation, . it is called by the Greeks Sphacelos, and by the Latines Syderatio, which according to Fallopius, Fallopius. Fabricius. and Fabricius, is an affect of a part al∣ready utterly mortified, and therefore not to be cured, but by amputation; that the whole bo∣dy come not to corruption thereby. Or it is a perfect and total privation of sense, being a mortification not only of the fleshy parts, but also of the nervous parts, even unto the bone, and sometimes of the bone it self. The cause of a Gangrene may be an exceed∣ing effusion of blood and spirits, Causa. or a distemper of the four humours. Also extream erosion, or corrosion of caustick medicines, or corrosive humours. A venemous and poysoned blood, great burnings and scaldings; or overmuch hunger and thirst, may be the cause. Also a Gangrene may happen by the pricking of a nerve, by a feaver, precedent; by a frost, and al∣so by extream cold, by the biting of venemous beasts, or mad dogs, or through great incised wounds, but especially confuted wounds, and by unreasonable stripes. Finally, from all intercep∣ons, intersections, or interruptions of spirits, what, or wheresoever mayproduce a Gangrene. The signes of a Gangrene are these, Signa. an ex∣tinction
of the lively colour, which was in the precedent phlegmon. Grievous pain, and con∣tinual pulsation in the diseased part; apparent by the arteries, being at first very sensible, but afterwards declining their due force: The part agrieved seeming for the most part in colour to be blackish, blewish, or of a duskie, or livid colour; yea sometimes putrid, and being open∣ed, a filthy Ichor of an unsavory smell proceeds from it. If there be sence, there is life, and hope. Curatio. 1. First, empty out abundantly the corrupt blood, which is stuffed in the affected member; Venae-sectio For this purpose some apply horse-leeches, others cut the fullest vein about the affected member, also deep scarifications are good. 2. When you have drawn out blood abun∣dantly, by deep slashes or cuts; the place must be splashed with salt-water; then lay on a medi∣cine appointed for corrupted sores, or wash it with hot vinegar, or Mulsum, twice a day. 3.

Galen bids to put upon it the juyce of a Leek with beaten salt, to hinder pu∣trefaction. 5. But if all these things shall nothing help, and now Gangraena is turned into a sphacell, or mortification, and that the part is throughly dead, which you may know by the colour, for it is black, and colder then a stone to your touch; It riseth not again after the pressure of the finger, and the skin comes from the flesh ly∣ing under it. The smell is so strong (especially in an ulcerated sphacel) that the standers by
cannot endure it. There is also a sanious moy∣sture, viscid, green, or blackish flowing from thence, and the part is quite destitute of sense and motion; though you pull it, beat it, crush it, prick it, burn it, or cut it off. I read of one, Historia. who many months after the cutting away of his leg, grievously complained that he felt ex∣ceeding grear pain of that leg so cut off. A thing wondrous strange, and prodigeous. Now if Gangraena be turned into Sphacelus, cut of that member very speedily, even to the whole; so that no filthinesse remaine behinde, for ; the infected parts of the body, Hip. lib. 2. Aphor. 9. the more they are cherished, the more they are in∣dammaged; and therefore the amputation not to be deferred. 6. Then let the veines and arteries be bound up, as speedily and as straitly as you can. But the ends of the vessels lying hid in the flesh, must first be taken hold of with a Crows beak, and drawn forth of the muscles; whereinto they presently after the amputation, withdrew themselves; when you have so drawn them forth, bind them with a strong double thred; and strew upon the wound an emplastick pow∣der, made with bolearmenick, &c. Pulvis em∣plast. laying there∣upon dry lint, (also the juyce of leeks is good) and apply a defensitive. The member being placed upon a plillow stuffed with wheat bran, it must not be stirred for four dayes, unless great necessity urge. Then to agglutinate ℞.

Herewith let the whole ulcer be strewed over, for 3 or 4 dayes; which being ended, let only the seats of the vessels be powdered therewith, for eight or ten dayes; the rest of the cure is ea∣sily performed. But great diligence must be used to procure the falling away of the ends, or scales of the bones, which may be done by applying to their ends actual cauteries, but take heed you touch not the sensible parts with fire. Some presently after amputation, make use of actual cauteries, but that brings great horror to the Patient. 1. Victus ra∣tio. Remember that those which are trou∣bled with Gangraena and Sphacelus, their diet must be of a cooling quality. 2. If nothing do let, turn away the flux by letting blood. 3. Purifie the blood with Catholicon, cassia, the decoction of Tamarinds, or fumitory. 4. Let the sick take Theriaca, which is able to defend the heart, from those corrupted and filthy smelling fluxes, which are mounted upwards. CHAP. XLVI. EXANTHEMATA, . the small pox are pu∣stules, and the measles, spots, which arise in the top of the skin, by reason of the impurity of the corrupt blood sent thither by force of nature.
Most of the Ancients have delivered that this impurity is the reliques of the menstruous blood, remaining in the body of the infant; Causa. be∣ing of that matter from whence it drew nou∣rishment in the womb, which lying still for some space of time, but stirred up at the first opportunity of a hotter summer, or a hidden ma∣lignity in the ayr, & boyling up or working with the whole mass of blood, spread or shew them∣selves upon the whole surface of the body. The small pox are caused of a more grosse and vis∣cous matter, to wit, of a flegmatick humour. But the meazles of a more subtle and hot, that is, a cholerick matter. At first, Signa. when the matter of the pox seek passage out, the Patients often sneeze, and are held with a continual feaver, with pain in their backs, itching of their nose, head-ache, and a vertiginous heavinesse, and with a kind of swounding or fainting, a nauseous disposition, and vomiting, a horsenesse, difficult and fre∣quent breathing, and inclination to sleep, a heavines of all the members, their eys are fiery, and swollen, their urin red and troubled. The small pox are extuberating pustules, white in the midst, but red in the circumference. On the third or fourth day they bunch out, and rise up into a tumor; becoming white, before they turn into a scab. They prick like needles, (by reason of a certain acrimonie) and cause an itching. The meazles yeeld no marks, but certain small spots without any tumor; and they be either red, purple, or black, without pricking or itching. The pox doth not only
mangle and spoyle the fleshy parts, but often∣times eat, and corrupt the bones, like the Lues venerea; and brings the dropsie, ptisick, hoars∣nesse, Asthma, bloody flux, ulcerating the guts; and at length death. Some have lost their sight, others their hearing, and other-some their smelling. Some that have died of this disease, and their bodies being dissected; Their entrails have been found to be covered with scabby or crusted pustules, like those that break forth upon the skin. If a sucking child be assailed with the pox, Curatio. it must be kept warm, and there must be provi∣ded for the nurse medicated brothes, with pur∣slain, Victus ra∣tio. lettice, sorrel, succory, Burrage, and French barly, bound up in a cloth: she must shun all salt, and baked, or spiced meats; and in stead of wine, Decoctio. let her drink a decoction of li∣quorice, raisins, and sorrel roots: also she must take purging medicines, and keep the child from pap. If the child be weaned, let him abstaim from flesh, untill the feaver have left him, and the pox be come forth. Victus. Let him feed on barly and Almond creames, chickin broths (wherein have been boyled the forementioned herbs, and the shavings of Ivory & harts-horn) Panadoes, gellies, cullases, and raisins. Let his sleep be moderate, for too sound sleep drawes back the matter to the center, and increaseth the feaver. You must neither purge, nor draw blood, the disease increasing; or being at the height; un∣lesse there be a plurisie, squinancie, &c. A gen∣tle clyster is good in the state, and increase of
the disease; Decoctio. you must make a sudorifick de∣coction of figs, liquorice, husked lentils, citron seeds, the seeds of fenell, and smalledge; the roots of grasse, raisins, dates, gold, millet, ma∣rygold flowers, and harts-horne, at the latter end of the boyling, put in some saffron, or ℞.

You must defend the eyes, Medica∣mentum. when you first begin to suspect the disease, with rosewater, or vinegar, and a little camphire. If the pain and inflammation be great, then use Aloes, Aliud. and Tuttie, washed in the water of fennel, eye∣bright, and roses. 2. You must defend the nose with a Nodulus; Nodulus. made with a little vinegar, water of roses, the powder of sanders, and camphire. 3. You must defend the jawes, throat, and throttle, and preserve the integrity of the voice, Oxycratum by a Gargle of oxycrate. 4. The Lungs, and respiration must be pro∣vided for, by syrups of jujubes, violets, Syrupi. white poppies, and water-lilies. 5. To prevent Pockarrs, after they are ripe, open them with a golden or silver needle; lest the matter contained in them, should corrode the flesh that lies under and after the cure, leave pock-holes behind it. 6. The pus or matter being evacuated, Lini they shall be dried up with ung. rosat. adding thereto
ceruse, Aloes, and a little saffron in powder. 7. Olcum. Being dried up like a scurf or scab, anoynt them with oyle of Almonds, or Roses, or with some creame, that they may the sooner fall away. 8. Ʋnguentū. If there be any excoriation through scratching, then shall you heal it with Ʋnguen∣tum album camphor. adding thereto a little pow∣der of Aloes or Desicativum rubrum. 9. To help the unsightly scars of the face, Lac virginale, Ol. lil. Goose, Ducks, and Capons grease are good; and also oyle of lillies, and Hares blood newly killed & hot. Many cry out against bleeding, though it be done a little before the pox come out; Phleboto∣mia. for my part, I have opened a vein (ofttentimes) with good successe on strong bodies, so that the pox have come forth within 24 houres after bleeding, without any danger. Also Bezoar is excellent to send forth the pox. Byzabar. But the most familiar thing for children, Diascor∣dium. is Diascordium. Lastly, the meazles are cured by resolution only, Cons. samb. and not by suppuration. For which pur∣pose conserve of Eldern flowers is especially commended; not only to be eaten, but also to be rubbed upon the heated parts. If there be great faintnesse, Cordial. take Aqua Mariae, syr. lujulae, of either one ounce, give him a little often.
CHAP. XLVII. ELEPHANTIASIS, . Paulus. Avicennas Galenus. or leprosie (accord∣ing to Paulus) is a cancer of the whole body, The which, as Avicen addes) corrupts the com∣plection, form, and figure of the members, or according to Galen. This disease is an effusion of troubled or grosse blood into the veines, and habit of the whole body. 1. The primitive cause is, Causa. either from the first conformation, or comes to them after they are born, by the too frequent use of salt, spiced, acrid, and grosse meats. Also familiarity, co∣pulation, and cohabitation with leprous per∣sons. Sweat and spittle left on the edges of the pots or cups (for there is a certain hidden viru∣lencie in the leprosie) strong wines, drunken∣nesse, gluttony, and a laborious life, full of sor∣rows and cares. The suppression of the He∣morrhoids, and courses. The small pox, and meazles. Also a Quartan feaver, the drying up of old ulcers; for that they defile the masse of blood; and thus in conclusion, the leprosie is caused. 2. The antecedent causes are, the humours disposed to adustion, and corruption, into me∣lancholy by the torrid heat. 3. The conjunct causes are, the melancholy humours, which are now pertakers of a vene∣nate and malign quality, and spread over the whole habit of the body; corrupting and de∣stroying it, first by a hot and dry distemper, and
then by a cold and dry, contrary to the begin∣nings of life, which consists in the moderation of heat and moysture. 1. The first sign is, a falling away of the haires, and you may perceive scauls in the head. 2. The second is a numerous and manifest circumseription, of round and hard pushes or pustules under the eye-browes, behind the eares, and in several places of the face, like hard kernels. 3. The third is, the more contract, and ex∣act roundnesse of the eares. 4. The fourth is, A Lyon-like wrinkling of the forehead, which is the reason that some term this disease Morbus Leoninus. 5. The fifth is, the exact roundnesse of the eyes, and their fixt and immovable steddinesse. 6. The sixth is, the nostrils are flat out∣wardly, but inwardly strait and contracted. 7. The seventh is the lifting up, thicknesse and swelling of the lips; Also the stinch, fil∣thinesse, and corrosion of the gummes; by acrid vapours rising to the mouth. 8. The eighth is, the swelling and black∣nesse of the tongue, and as it were varicous veins lying under it. Their face riseth in red bunches, or pushes, and is overspread with a duskie and obscure rednesse. Their eyes are fiery, fierce, and fixed. Some leprous persons have their faces tinctured with a yellowish, others with a whitish colour, according to the condition of the humour; for Physicians affirm, that there are three sorts of Leprosies, one of a
reddish black colour, consisting in a melan∣choly humour: another of a yellowish green, in a cholerick humour: another of a whitish yellow, grounded upon adust flegm. 9. The ninth sign is, a stinking of the breath; and also of all the excrements proceeding from leprous bodies. 10. The tenth is a hoarsness, a shaking, harsh, and obscure voyce, coming as it were out of the nose. 11. The eleventh is, a morphew, or defe∣dation of all the skin, with a drie roughnesse, and grainie inequality; such as appears in the skins of plucked Geese, with many tetters on every side, a filthy scab, and ulcers, not casting off only a branlike scurf, but also scales and crusts. 12. The twelfth is, the sense of a certain pricking, as it were of needles over all the skinne. 13. The thirteenth is, a cunsumption and emacination of the muscles, which are between the thumb and forefinger. Also their shoulders stand out like wings 14. The fourteenth is, the diminution of sense, or a numbnesse over all the body; by reason that the nerves are obstructed, and so the free passage of the animal spirit is hin∣dred. 15. The fifteenth is, the corruption of the extream parts, possessed by putrefaction and a Gangrene. 16. The sixteenth is, they are troubled with terrible dreams, for they seem in their sleep to
see Devils, Serpents, Dungeons, Graves, Dead bodies, and the like. 17. The seventeenth is, they are subtill, craf∣ty, and furious; and suspicious in all their dea∣lings. 18. The eighteenth is, they desire venery above their nature. 19. The nineteenth is, if you wash their thick, gross, and livid blood; you find a sandy matter therein. 20. The twentienth is, the Languidnesse and weaknesse of the pulse; Also the urine is sometimes thick and troubled, and oftentimes of a pale and ash-colour. Lastly, the face and all the skin is unctuous or greasie. Cure cannot be promised to such as have a confirmed leprosie; Curatio. for it is scarce curable at the beginning. Therefore care must be taken to free such as are ready to fall into so fearful a disease. Such therefore must shun all things in diet and course of life, whereby the blood and humours may be too vehemently heated. Let them make choice of meats of good juyce. Victus ra∣tio. Purging, bleeding, and bathing shall be prescribed, by some learned Physician. Gelding is much commended in this cause, because it deprives them of the faculty of gene∣ration; and makes them become cold & moist, which temper is directly contrary to the hot and drie distemper of leperous persons. I have oftentimes (after purging and bleeding) used Ʋnguentum enulatum with good successe in the beginning of the leprosie, nguentū. whilst the body was covered only with a scurf. Let them drink the
water and syrup of sumitory mixed together, Julepus. for the space of a whole year. ℞. Rad. buglossae, glycyrrhizae, an. ℥. j.

The Apostume of the liver, should have been placed amongst the distempers of the liver, in the first book; yet I think it better to place this Chapter here, then to leave it out. The cause is two-fold, Causa. external, as a fall, bruise, or by going too narrow git, &c. Inter∣nal, as gluttony, indigestion of the stomack, weaknesse of the vertue digestive of the liver: Also humours gathered together in the liver; and sometimes it happeneth through imperfect cleansing of the Gall, Spleen, Raines, and In∣testines. Also through cold. There is pain in the right side, Signa. tending up∣wards towards the ribs and shoulder blade; as it were the plurisie. He can hardly lye upon his sides, and especially on the right side; his face is very black, he hath no appetite, his urine is blood-red, especially if the impostume be hot; he hath a cough, and also the hick-cough, par∣breaking, short oreath, retention of urine, and great thirst. If cold be the cause, there is hea∣vinesse and oppression. uratio. uae-sectio In a hot cause, first the liver vein must be

CHAP. XLI. PESTIS. . The plague is an horrid disease, ve∣nemous, and contagious; lothsome, noysom, fearful, and hateful to mankind; yea and deadly for the most part; being accompanied with va∣riety of grievous sores: as carbuncles, botches, blaines; and also producing spots and discolou∣rings of the skin; and may fitly be called (Flagel∣lum Dei pro peccatis mundi) the rod of God for the sins of the world; for it produceth divers fearful and deadly accidents with great celerity, seaz∣ing upon the animal, vital, and natural facul∣ties; and seldome or never goes without a feaver. The material cause thereof is sin; Causa. Of the su∣pernatural cause. For it is a confirmed, constant, and received opinion in all ages amongst christians, that the plague and other diseases, which violently assaile the life of man, are often sent by the just anger of God, as punishments for our offences. Yea when the Almighty will shew himself in his fury against dust and ashes, he can put the host of heaven in his order, to fight against us) (Nam astra regunt homines, sed regit astra Dens;) for the starres govern mans body, and God governs the stars. And we have no way to escape his judgements, but by prayer, and unfeigned repentance. This furious disease, as it were disdaines any general method of cure, when it is in his rage; so that we must needs conclude (Quicquid faci∣mus mortale genus, quicquid patimur, venit ab
alto) that whatsoever man doth, or whatsoever man suffereth, all proceedeth from above. And as for all other natural or efficient causes, they are constellated, put on, and put off by divine providence, viz. ex praescientia Dei, by the fore∣know ledge of God. The terrestrial causes thereof, are venemous, Of the na∣tural cau∣ses. and stinking vapours arising (by the warmth of the Sun, and so communicated to the Ayre) from dunghils, sincks, channels, vaults, or the like; as also from unclean slaughter-houses of beasts, unclean dwelling-houses, Lanes, Allies, and Streets, in great Cities, as in London, &c. Also want of food, & unwholsom food, and the eating of abundance of raw fruits, may be a great cause of the increase of the plague. See lib. 2. chap. 12. It beginneth cold, Signa. Of the precedent and acci∣dental signes of the plague. and with pain in the head and stomach, and sometimes in the back, being commonly taken for an Ague. In some also it beginneth hot, with pain and giddinesse of the head: others find a general discouragement and weaknesse over all their whole body; many are taken with great desire to sleep; but it is not safe to permit such to sleep before a Diaphoretick be administred, to send forth the venemous vapours by sweat. In some it beginneth with a raging and fierce feaver, so that their speech fail them, and their eyes turn strangely to and fro in a fearful manner; being in their slumbers oppressed with grievous and fearful dreames, and fan∣tasies. In others it beginneth with sweatings, with pain of the back, and a stinking breath; and
such are ever very doubtful of cure, and ten to one but they have inward carbuncles. The one cheek is red, and the other pale, others have sweat drops on their noses, a fierce coun∣tenance, with grinding of the teeth. And to be brief, no symptome of any disease, but is incident to the infected of the plague. The signes that presage death are these that follow, Prognostic. namely, when the Patient is possessed with swounding, and faintings, with cold and clammy sweats, often changing of the counte∣nance, vomiting of sharp, slimy, and ill coloured flegm; with greenish, yellowish, blackish, or blood-coloured sanies, or avoiding excrements, either fatty, blackish, unctuous, or unnaturally stinking, convulsions, contractions of the nerves, graveling and pidling with the fingers, pluck∣ing up of the bed-clothes; a sudden flux of the belly of stinking matter, rusty, or of a greenish colour. A sudden going back of an impostume, carbuncle, or Bubo. Also it is a deadly signe in the pestilence, to have a continual burning fea∣ver, the tongue drie, rough, and black, with unquenchable thirst, and great watching; to have phrensie and madnesse together, the hick∣et, heart-beating, and the face pale, black, of an horrid and cruel aspect; bedewed with a cold sweat. Also when the Patient is insensi∣ble of the departure of his urine, and ex∣crements. There are some have ulcerous and painful wearinesse, pricking under the skin, with great torment and pain. The eyes look cruelly, and staringly, the voyce waxeth hoarse, and the
understanding decaying; so that the Patient talketh of frivolous things; these shew the plague to be deadly. Also if the urine be pale, or black, and the contents blew, greenish, fatty, or oyly. Or if the flesh of the Carbuncle be drie, and black, or the flesh about it be black and blew. If the eyes waxe dim, if the nostrils be con∣tracted or drawn together, if the mouth be drawn aside, or if the nails be black, then you may prognosticate that death is at hand; yet you may use cordial medicines, but it is too late to purge, or let blood. The symptoms of recovery are these, namely, when the fever ceaseth, the sick person takes mo∣derate rest, a botch come to good suppuration, a carbuncle to separation, or a blain to yeeld his usual indigested quitture, with mitigation of the dolour; or that the blaines withering by Gods mercy, through cordial diaphoreticks (for no sores heale faster then pestilential sores do) or that a cheerfulnesse in the sick appear, these are all good signes. Now the three certain outward signes of the plague are these. 1. First, the Bubo pestilentialis, Bubo pesti∣lentialis. which is a tu∣mour at the beginning long and moveable, but in the state immoveable; with a sharp head, and fixed deeply in the glandules or kernels, by which the brain exonerates it self of the vene∣mous and pestiferous matter, into the kernels that are behind the ears, and the neck the heart into those that are in the arm-holes; and the liver into those that are in the groin. It
is a deadly sign if the tumor be livid or black, and come very slowly unto his just bignesse, or if it increase suddenly, and come to his just big∣nesse, as it were with a swift violence, and as in a moment, have all the symptomes in the high∣est excesse; as pain, swelling, and burning. But if it be red, and increase by little and little, it is a good sign. 2. . The second outward signe, is that most fierce burning carbuncle called Anthrax, or the burning cole, which happeneth in any part of mans body without order or rule, within the body as well as without. It appears commonly inflamed and hard, and in the middest thereof, they feel burning pain like to burning fire, so that it will some∣times blister, which pain is so fierce and great, that the Patient groweth to be mad with ex∣tremity thereof. It is round in shape or figure, and the colour un∣certain, for somtimes it is pale, somtimes reddish, somtimes black, or purple, or greenish; & the two last are most fearful, and deadly signs. You shall see some carbuncles smooth as glass, of a black∣ish shining colour, not unlike pitch; with intol∣lerable pain, and the member whereon they are fixed, will be ponderous and unwildy to move to and fro. This disease is seldome healed without so much loss of the musculous flesh and skin, as it taketh first hold of, in what part soever it hap∣pen; except the fury thereof in the beginning be changed, by sweating medicines. The car∣buncle seldom or never cometh to suppuration,
but it will admit separation, and in time will come to fall out (if nature be strong) as a gan∣grenated part doth in one entire peece, from the sound. But if it grow black, and separate not, and the fever doth not abate, then it may be feared, death is at hand. 3. The third sign is the pestilential blain: Pustula pestilentia∣lis. it is a painful and angry push, somewhat like the small pock, yet in colour more red, and cloudy; and farre more painful, with a small head, of an angry blew, or reddish colour. Sometimes of a lead colour, and somewhat hard or fleshy; some have many, others not one. This blain seldom killeth, for by vertue of good medi∣cines, and by the strength of nature, it dryeth away, and requireth no other cure: Maculae pestilentae. There may be added a fourth signe of the plague, namely marks or spots, commonly called by the name of purples, and tokens; but they are not alwayes certain signes of the pestilence. These spots are upon some like flea-bitings, in others larger, in some as big as a peny, being of divers colours, as red, yellow, brown, violet, or pur∣ple (and therefore called the purples) blew and black; and also of a lead colour, and are ever without pain; yet they produce faintings, swoundings, trembling of the heart, and often∣times death. If they are of a purple or black colour, with often swounding, and sink in suddenly without any manifest cause, they foreshew death. But first for prevention, Curatio. two things are of chief account; the first is, that we strengthen our bodies, and the principal parts thereof,
against the daily imminent invasions of the poyson, or the pestiferous and venenate ayr. The other, that we abate the force of it, that it may not imprint its virulencie in the body; which may be done, 1. Phleboto∣mia. First, by purging and bleeding, and shun∣ning much variety of meates, which are ea∣sily corrupted in the stomach, and cause ob∣structions. 2. Secondly, let the belly have due evacua∣tion, either by Nature, or Art. 3. Thirdly, let the heart, the seat of life, and the rest of the Bowels, be strengthened with Cordials, and Antidotes, applyed, and taken. 4. Fourthly, if thou canst make choice of a pure ayr, and farre remote from stinking places. 5. Fifthly, kindle a clear fire in all the lodging rooms, and perfume the whole house with aro∣matick things. Fumigatio. As frankincense, myrrh, ben∣zoin, Ladanum, styrax, lavender, rosemary, sage, savory, wild tyme, marjarum, broom, peeces of firre, juniper berries, or cloves; also vinegar sprinkled upon hot bricks, and let your cloathes be aired in the same. 6. Sixthly, whilest the plague is hot, stirre not out of doore before the rising of the Sun; and perswade the Magistrates, that the Canons (laded only with powder) may be discharged morning and evening, turning their mouths upon the City. 7. Seventhly, all publick and great meetings and assemblies must be shunned; you must do
nothing in a pestilent season, whereby you may grow hot, Venus. and therefore venery is chiefly to be eschewed. Let the poorer sort which are not able to purchase rich cordials, Allium. take garlick in a morn∣ing, with a draught of good wine, for it being abundantly diffused over all the body, fills up the passages thereof, and strengtheneth it in a moment. Amongst cordial remedies Aqua Theriaca∣lis, is much commended, being drunk, Aquae opt. and rubbed on the nostrils, mouth, and eares; for it strengthens the heart, expells poyson, and is not only good for a preservative, but also to cure the disease it selfe. The confection of Al∣kermes, and Clove-gilliflowers are good. Also the pills of Ruffus are accounted most effectual preservatives against this disease, Pilulae. so that Ruffus himself saith, Ruffus. that he never knew any to be infected, that used them. Some rowle in their mouth, and chaw be∣tween their teeth the root of Angelica; Angelica. others drink wormwood wine. To be short, Treakle and Mithridate, faith∣fully compounded, excell all cordiall medi∣cines; adding for every halfe ounce of them, Electuari∣um. one ounce and an halfe of conserve of Roses, or of Bugloss; and three dragmes of Bole∣armenick prepared: Mithrida∣tes. Mithridates highly com∣mendeth Walnuts, take two in number, those that be very dry, two figges, Mixturae. twenty leaves of Rue, and three graines of salt, beat and incorporate them together, and take the quantity of a Hasel nut at a time
fasting, and drink a little wormwood-wine after it. Also pomanders are good, and it will be very convenient to apply to the region of the heart, a bagge filled with yellow sanders, Saculus. mace, cloves, cinnamon, saffron, and treakle; shaken together and incorporated, and sprink∣led over with strong vinegar and rosewater in summer, and with strong wine in winter. Thus much for prevention. 1. Now so soon as one is blasted with the pestiferous ayre, after he hath taken some pre∣servative against the malignity thereof; he must withdraw himself into some wholesome Ayre. And it were good to hang the cham∣ber, and also the bed, with thick or course brown linnen cloaths, moystened in vinegar and water of roses. And sweet fires may be made of Juniper, Ash, Benzoin, &c. 2. Victus ra∣tio. Their diet must be cooling and drying. And first of all begin the cure with an Anti∣dote; because by its specifick property, it de∣fends the heart from poyson; and drives and ex∣pels it out of all the body, by sweat, vomiting, scouring, and other kinds of evacuation. The Antidote I would have you make choyce of, Theriaca Mithrida∣tum. is Treakle, or Mithridate, that is three or four years old, which excell all other Antidotes; for by strengthening the noblest part, and the mansion of life, they repaire and recreate the wasted spirits, and overcome the poyson; not only being taken inwardly, but also applyed outwardly to the Region of the heart, botches, and carbuncles: for by an hidden property
they draw the poysons unto them. If there be great heat, Mixtura. mix with Treakle or Mithridate the juyce of limmons in sorrel wa∣ter. The Patient ought to walk presently after he hath taken his Antidote, but yet as mode∣rate as he can: After that he must be put warm to bed, and covered with many cloaths, and apply swines bladders filled full of Car∣duus water, to the groines and arm-holes, to procure sweat; for sweating in this disease is a most excellent remedy. When he hath sweat sufficiently, according to the strength of his body, let the sweat be wiped with warm cloathes, and dried. Let him be kept from sleep (if possible) untill the third or fourth day; yet if necessity require, he may sleep, but not above three or four houres on a day and a night; but not at all on the first day. After sweating, let him take the rind of a preserved citron, conserve of roses, bread to∣sted and steeped in wine, the meat of preser∣ved myrabolane, or the like; then let him eat of some cordial confection. And you may make Epithemes after the following formes. ℞. Aquar. rosar. & melissae, ana ℥. iv. Epithemae. aceti ros. ℥. iij. sant. rub. ʒ. j. caryo∣phil. ʒ. ss. croci ℈. ij. caphurae ℈. j. boli arm. terra sigill. & zedoar. an. ʒ.j. fiat Epithema. Vel. ℞. Aceti ros. & aquae ros. ana lb. ss. Epithema. ca∣phurae ʒ. ss. theriac. & mithrid. ana ʒ. j. fiat epithema.
When you intend to use them, take some portion of them in a vessel by its selfe, wherewith let the affected bowel be fomented warm, many will not allow either of purging or bleeding in this disease. I confesse in weak bodies it ought to be neglected; but in strong bodies that abound with corrupt humours, both are necessary to be done: Hippocrat. Sec. 2. Aphor. 22. for Hippocrates saith, Morbos ex repletione ut curat evacuatio, sic eos qui ex evacuatione fiunt repletio, &c. The best way if purging be fit, is to take six or ten graines of scammonie, Purgatio. Pilulae. beaten into powder, with one dragme of Mithridate or Treakle. Ruffus his pills may be profitably given, half a dragm at a time every morning, two or three houres before meat; they ate to be had at the Apothecaries. Agaricus. The ancient Phy∣sicians have greatly commended Agarick for this disease, because it doth draw the noysome humours out of all the members; let it be ele∣cted and prepared truly into Trochisces. Also Antimonium is highly praised by the experi∣ence of many: Antimoniū. So is mugwort, and the pickle of Anchovis; Vide Rond elet lib. 7. de pis. c 3. for some have taken eight ounces at a draught, and have been freed from this disease, so that it hath been counted a most cer∣tain and approved remedy against the pe∣stilence. 1. Cucurbi∣tulae. So soon as the Bubo appears if nothing forbid, apply a cupping-glasse with a great flame unto it; and let it stick to the part for the space of a quarter of an hour, and be re∣newed again every three quarters of an hour.
Then apply this liniment, Linimet. take Ʋnguentum di∣althaea, one ounce and an halfe; oyle of scor∣pions half an ounce, of mithridate dissolved in aqua vitae halfe a dragm. After it is fomented, Cataplas. fill a great onion (be∣ing hollowed) with Treakle, and the leaves of Rew, then rost it under the hot embers, beat it with a little leven, and a little swines grease; and so apply it warm unto the Abscess or sore; let it be changed every six houres until it be growne unto its full ripenesse and bignesse. If the inflammation be great, Cataplas. make a Cata∣plasme with the roots of marsh mallowes, and lillies of each half a pound. Of line, sorrel, and fenugreek, of each half an ounce; of Treakle one dragme, ten Figs, and as much hogs-grease as shall suffice, make a Cataplasme according to art. When the Bubo is come to perfect suppura∣tion, it must be opened with an incision-knife, or with a potential cauterie; the rest of the cure is easily performed. 2. So soon as the carbuncle appears, Fomentatio Let it be fomented with water, and oyle mixed toge∣ther, wherein a little treakle hath been dissol∣ved. The day following, Cataplas. take the leaves of sorrel and henbane, rost them under the hot ashes, afterwards beat them with four yelks of egs, two dragmes of treakle, oyle of lillies three ounces, barly meale as much as may suffice; make thereof a Cataplasme, and apply it. And round about the carbuncle, Medicae∣mentune. lay the salve of fine Bolus, made with vinegar and rose-wa∣ter, for to defend the parts adjacent from heat.
Also Scabions brayed between two stones, Aliud. and mixed with hogs-grease, the yelks of egs, and a little salt, is much commended by the Anci∣cients. Rapbanus rustican. And a radish root cut in slices, and so the slices laid one after one unto a carbuncle or pestilent tumor, doth mightilie draw out the poyson. In the beginning the point or head of the carbuncle must be burned if it be black, Aq fortis. by dropping on scalding hot oyle, or Aqua for∣tis: After this burning, hasten the falling away of the eschar, which will seem to sepa∣rate it selfe from the flesh round about it, and is a token of the Patients recovery, &c. A Car∣buncle and Bubo are tumors of a near affinity, consisting of one kind of matter, unlesse that which maketh the Bubo is more grosse and clammie; and that which causeth the carbun∣cle more sharp, burning, and raging, by reason of its greater subtility; so that it maketh an eschar on the place where it is. Their cures are somewhat alike, only the carbuncle requi∣reth things to be applied that are of a more cooling quality, then the Bubo doth. 3. Lastly, Blaines, or Eruptions, and Spots, are cured, only by driving forth; for which purpose minister Treakle or Mithridate inwardly, to procure sweat: or this oyntment following will be good to draw them forth. Take of hogs-grease one pound, Ʋnguentū. boyle it a little with the leaves of sage, tyme, rosemary, of each halfe a handful; strain it, and in the straining extinguish five ounces of Quick-silver, which hath been first boyled in vinegar, with the
forementioned herbes; of Sal nitrum three dragms; the yelks of three egs, boyled untill they be hard; of Treakle and Mithridate of each half an ounce; of Venus Turpentine, oyle of Scorpions, and Bays, of each three ounces; incorporate them all together in a morter, and make thereof an unguent, wherewith anoint the Patients arm-holes, and groins; avoyding the parts that belong to the head, brest, and back-bone, then let him be laid in his bed, and sweat. When the spots and pustules do all appear, it shall be convenient to use diuretick medicines. And this may suffice for a discreet student, as concerning the cure of that cruel and conta∣gious disease, called the plague. . FINIS.
