An Act for Reformation of the negligences of Constables, and of the Abuses and misdemeanors of Apprentises, Carmen, and others, of and for the better apprehension of the Offenders. WHereas many times heretofore Complaints haue beene made by diuers the Nobles and great Persons of the Realme, and others, that haue oc∣casion to passe the streets, of many rude behauiours vsed towards them by Apprentises, Carmen, and others: And now lately, an audacious and insolent affront hath bene offered to the person of the Lord Ambassador to the King of Spaine, & some of his seruants and followers to the great dishonor & scandall of the publike Gouernment of the City, & at which the Kings most excellent Maiesty (as he hath iust cause) is highly offen∣ded: which disorders are conceiued to arise and grow, partly through the neglect of Constables, who are not ready to be found when complaint is made: & partly through the default of the Inhabitants, who are not ready to ayde and assist the Constables and Officers in the apprehensi∣on of Offenders: much lesse to apprehend the Offenders themselues, and bring them to some Officer or minister of Iustice; and partly for want of good instruction and admonition giuen by Masters of Families, to their Children, Seruants, and Apprentises. For remedy whereof, and for preuention of like abuses hereafter, Be it enacted by the right Honourable the Lord Mayor of this City, the right Worshipfull the Aldermen his Brethren, and the Commons in this Common Councell assembled, and by Authority of the same, That euery Constable within the City of Lon∣don, and the Liberties therof, shal haue his Constable-staffe (during all the time that he shalbe Constable) stand at his doore, openly to be seene, to the end that euery man that hath occasion to vse the aide or assistance of a Constable, may know where to find him. And also that euery Constable, shall either by himselfe (or if hee haue iust occasion to be absent) by some fit and sufficient person deputed by him be ready to performe the duty of his place, in apprehending of Fellons, Vagrants, and other Offenders, and conueighing them to prisons fit for them: And in repressing of Riots, rescues of Prisoners, or persons led to punishment, and other disorders: and in the executing all other things pertaining to the Office of a Constable, vpon paine to forfeite twenty shillings for euery default, the same to be imployed to the vse of the poore of the Parish, where the Offence is committed.
And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any iust Complaint be heereafter made of any violence or misdemeanor that shall be done or offered to any Ambassador, Noble person, Ladies, Gentlewo∣men, or others, passing through the streets. And that any Housholder or Inhabitant shall bee required either by the Constable, his deputy, or the party greeued, to apprehend such Offender or Offenders, and detaine them vntill they may be brought before a Iustice of the peace, That then euery person and persons so required, shall accordingly ayde and assist vpon paine of such fine as to the Court of Lord Maior and Aldermen, vpon exami∣nation of the nature of the offence shall seeme reasonable. And for the better preuention of such disorders and abuses heereafter, & that all Offenders in this kind here∣after may be without excuse, It is heereby further enacted and enioyned, that all the Aldermen within their se∣ueral Wards respectiuely, or their deputies, shall forthwith giue personall warning and admonition to euerie Housholder and Master of a Family, within the City and Liberties thereof, that they themselues take know∣ledge, and do strictly charge and admonish all and euery their Children, Seruants, and Apprentises, that both they, their Children, Seruants, and Apprentises, do from henceforth carrie and demeane themselues well and orderly towards all Ambassadors, Noble persons, Ladies, Gentlewomen, and others whatsoeuer, that shall haue occasion to passe through the streets, and do neither throw, nor shoote any thing at them, nor mis-behaue themselues towards them, either in gesture, words, or action: nor shall vse vpon the Exchange, nor in any street or lane of the City, any vnciuill sport, as Trap, Squibs, Foote-ball, or the like, vpon paine of seuere punish∣ment to be inflicted vpon them, according to the quality of the offence. And to represse the rude and vnmannerly behauiour of Carmen, Carters, Draymen and others, vsing or working any Carre, Cart or Dray whatsoeuer, It is also enacted and declared by the Authority aforesaid, that not onely all and euery the Acts of Common Councell and Orders of this City heretofore made for the Gouernment of them, be put in due execution, but also that the Master and Wardens of the Woodmongers of this City, doe admonish them particularly, not to commit any such disorders hereafter that may giue iust cause of offence. And that the said Master and Wardens doe performe in all poynts, the Act of Common Councell made in that behalfe in the time of the Mayoralty of Sir Iohn Leman knight, late Lord Mayor of this City, concerning Cars and Carmen. Assuring them that a strict accompt shalbe taken thereof, and seuere punishments inflicted vpon any of them that shal offend in that behalfe, according to the quality of their offen∣ces. And all Housholders & Inhabitants are hereby likewise enioyned to be ayding and assisting to the Consta∣ble or other Officer that shall apprehend such Offenders, and themselues likewise in default of an Officer to ap∣prehend and deteine such an Offender, till he may be brought before some Iustice of the Peace, vpon peine of such Fine as to the Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen, vpon examination of the offence shall seeme reasona∣ble. ❧ God saue the King. ❧ Printed at London, by William Iaggard, Printer to the Honourable Citie of London.
