THE HUSBAND Forc'd to be JEALOUS, OR THE GOOD FORTUNE OF THOSE WOMEN THAT HAVE JEALOUS HUSBANDS. A Translation by N. H. LONDON, Printed for H. Herringman, at the Sign of the Blew Anchor, in the Lower Walk of the New Exchange, 1668.
THE HUSBAND Forc'd to be Jealous: OR, The Good Fortune of those Women that have Jealous Husbands. TImander and Clidimira having lov'd each other for some time, without any acci∣dent hapning in their Amours, considerable enough to be rela∣ted,
were at last Married, to the great contentment of them both. The Ceremonies of their Con∣tract was performed in the house of Clidimira, where after a Mag∣nificent Supper, which lasted till the night was very far spent, the Company diverted themselves very agreeably in attending the morning; which no sooner ap∣peared, but this Excellent Cou∣ple were conducted to the Church, where they were Mar∣ried with great Solemnity; which was no sooner past, but the Bride and Bridegroom sepa∣rated themselves, and every one returned to their own Houses, as well to repose, as to prepare and adjust themselves for the great Ball which was that night to be at
one of the most Famous Treat∣ing-houses in that Town; it having been the antient custom for the Richest Gentlemen of that place to make their Wed∣ding-Feasts at those kind of Houses, when they Married their Children or Relations publickly. The afternoon of that same day, as Timander was dressing himself to go to that great Sup∣per, he received this note from a Woman he esteemed very much, and in whom he absolutely con∣fided. Melasia to Timander. I desire to see you as soon as you have received this Paper, and that you will believe that had I not
been perswaded that your Life and Honour both were concern'd in what I am to tell you, I should not trouble you with this request upon a day wherein you cannot want Employment, and which you ought to dedicate wholly to Love. Melasia. Timander had no sooner read this note, but resolved to go to Melasia's House, imagining he might return home very quick∣ly, and thought the excuse he had was lawful enough to make him quit, without incivility, the best Company in the world; yet because he had been formerly suspected to have more then an esteem for Melasia, he was un∣willing upon such a day as this,
to give his Bride and the rest of his Friends and Kindred any just cause of complaint against him; and therefore he stole out alone through a back door of his Gar∣den, which led to a private Street, where he took a Chair which carried him to Melasia's House, without meeting any by the way which could discover him. He found her waiting for him in a low Parlour, where after some general discourse, she told him that she was desired by Ther∣sander, a Neighbour of hers (who was not unacquainted with the particular Friendship she had had a long time with himself) to pro∣cure for him the Honour of speaking with Timander at her House that afternoon; which at
first she had refused, telling him she could not desire that favour for him, without rendering her self very ridiculous, in sending for a man to discourse of business upon his Wedding day; but when Thersander had at last assu∣red her, that the meeting which he desired with Timander, con∣cerned the Life and Honour of them both, and that the deferring it a moment longer would be fa∣tal to them; She then resolved upon giving him the trouble of that note, which he would soon pardon when he had received the reason of it from Thersander, who waited for him in her Cham∣ber; whither if he pleased to go, they might discourse freely, without being heard or inter∣rupted.
Timander had some sus∣pition of the occasion for which Thersander had sent for him; yet he was unwilling to discover those thoughts which then pos∣sest him, to Melasia; but humbly thanking her for her charitable concern for him, he made hast to the Chamber, where Thersander who had impatiently waited for him, no sooner saw him appear, but he went toward him, and sa∣luting him with an Air which clearly discovered the trouble of his Soul, in a loud voice said to him; Sir, I thought my self ob∣liged to use this Artifice in ob∣taining the satisfaction of you this day which I expect; for al∣though I know you generous enough not to deny what I am
come to demand, yet such a day as this would have been excuse just enough to have refused any chal∣lenge I could send you; and therefore I resolved to speak to you my self. Know then (said he) that I have long lov'd Clidi∣mira, and report spoke loud enough that I was not hated by her; yet when some Domestick Affairs of mine carried me into the Countrey, you cunningly made use of that time I was ab∣sent, to demand Clidimira of her Father, and obtained his consent to Marry her; who being compel∣led to it by her Father, yielded to your happiness rather by obe∣dience then by inclination. These proceedings of yours have so in∣raged me, that I am resolv'd up∣on
a revenge, and to deprive you of life, before you receive the sa∣tisfaction of seeing Clidimira in your Arm; for should you this night have that good fortune, I should receive but an imperfect satisfaction in sacrificing you to my just resentments to morrow; and your death would be but too happy in the remembrance of having enjoyed the Fair Cli∣dimira: And therefore my re∣solution is, not to quit you this day, till you have satisfied my de∣mand. And though I were sure to dye in that Combat, replied Timander (coldly) I would ne∣vertheless defer it a few days longe because to the pleasing remembrance of having had the Fair Clidimira in my Arms, I
should adde the blessing of leav∣ing an Heir of her blood, is well as mine, that should one day re∣venge my Death. You have reason, said Thersander, that Son of yours perhaps may kill me, but I think he will want strength to do it; for the spight of seeing a Son of yours caressed by Cli∣dimira, will destroy me before he can be old. enough to think of revenging his Fathers Death. Well, let it be so, replied Timan∣der (with an Air much colder and disdainful then before) yet I have a desire to defer Fighting two or three days longer; for I know my Victory over you this day will be too cheap, beecause the thoughts that I am going pre∣sently to enjoy Clidimira, will
certainly press me on to hasten your Death. And the vexation to lose Clidimira, said Thersander, will give me no less courage; and therefore let us go out presently and try if Fortune will be your Friend. I am still unresolv'd, an∣swered Timander, whether I should satisfie you before I have seen Clidimira in my arms; yet now I think on't, said he carelesly, I will fight with you to day, since you tell me you are in a condition to defend your self so well; though I had rather stay till I had enjoy'd Clidimira, because your anger then would be raised to such a height, that it would adde to your courage, and so heighten the glory of my Con∣quest in overcoming a Rival,
whose just and violent despight will then render the most Fu∣rious of Men. Well, well, said Thersander, I pretned not to my own defence, but compel thee to defend thy self, and therefore let us go presently. Timander replyed not to these words, but went out first, looking back up∣on Thersander with an Air that shewed little fear to all his threats. In going from Melasia's House, they both desired her to let none know they had met there: So taking their several Chairs without any Attendance, they caused themselves to be set down in a little Village hard by that place, where they entered into a house, sending away their Chairs; who being gone, these
Rivals went into the Fields, where finding a place fit to their design, they drew their Swords, fighting a great while without advantage on either side; but as Fortune would have it, Ther∣sander after he had fought as va∣liantly as he had spoke audaci∣ously, received a wound, of which he dyed a minute after. Let us leave him to dye in peace, and also Timander to shift for himself, whilst we return to see what passes in the Town. The desire which these two Rivals had made to Melasia to conceal their having been at her house, and their furious looks in going from her, gave her some suspition of their design; and having rack'd her imagination
to find out the ground of their Quarrel, she remembred that Thersander had been formerly in Love with Clidimira; which con∣firm'd her in the belief that they were gone to fight; and know∣ing her fault in being the occa∣sion, she resolv'd for her own sake to conceal their having been at her house that day. In the mean time all those who were invited to the Feast, prepared to appear there in all their gal∣lantry; the house of Clidimira was all joy, every one was busie in dressing the Bride, and no∣thing was forgot that might set off her natural Charms; yet when she was drest she had the misfortune to attend very long the coming of the Bridgroom,
who was expected to conduct her to the Treating-house, where all the Company staid for her: But Clidaris, Father to Clidimira, growing weary of staying so long, and believing that his Son-in-Law came not thither because his Lodging was so neer to that house where they were all to meet, waited upon his Daughter thither himself; where he was no sooner entred but he ask'd the Company if the Bridegroom were come; they answer'd, No. He waited yet a great while longer, and then went himself to seek him at his Lodging, but was strangely sur∣prized to find that none there knew what was become of him: So this good Old Man return'd
back again to entertain the Company, which was already very great, and waited impati∣ently the hour of Supper, but were forc'd to stay longer yet, still hoping the Bridegroom would come at last; but every hour receiving a new disappoint∣ment to those hopes, they began to fret, and then to grow very angry, and that anger at last gave way to a fear that some mis∣fortune had hapned to him, and to that fear was added the los of those hopes that all day had so comforted them, and now made them desperate: In fine the sight of those delicious things before them, that would have comforted any other hearts increas'd their trouble instead o
satisfying them: The Fidlers were sent away grumbling ex∣ceedingly, though very well paid, and were so impudent to curse the Marriage, although they went from that Wedding much lighter and wiser, and eve∣ry way much better, than ever they had gone from that Treat∣ing-house in their lives: After the Fidlers were gone, the Treat∣er himself came up stairs, and told the Company, that the meat would be spoil'd if it were not presently serv'd in, and that he had spent already a bushel of Coals in keeping it warm. In the mean time the poor Bride was all in Tears in the midst of her Kindred and Friends that were comforting her; and as
for the rest who were not so fa∣miliar, and others that Fortune had brought in to that place (for at those kind of Treats there always comes more Com∣pany then is invited) they knew not how to carry themselves; there being many Persons there, more concern'd for the loss of the Supper, then the absence of the Bridegroom: Most of the Children slept neer their Mo∣thers, and those that were a∣wak'd never left crying and bawling, asking indessantly when Supper would come: On the other side, the Pages and Foot-men entertain'd themselves pleasantly; some saying, they should have the best part of the Feast if their Masters and Ladies
eat nothing; others cryed for fear their Masters should carry them away with them before they should get a share. At last it stroke One a Clock, and the Company taking every one a bit very hastily, left almost all to the Laquays and Pages, without giving them any time to eat it: All the Guests waited on the Bride to her Lodging, and left the Treater and his Men asto∣nish'd, having never yet seen such a kind of Wedding as this at their house. When Clidimira was in her Chamber, they undress'd her, but not with the usual Ceremo∣nies of such kind of days; there was no Posset nor Banquet at her going to Bed; no body
look'd pleasantly, nor was there any so merrily dispos'd as to hide themselves in the Bride-chamber; on the contrary, those that were not sad enough, yet endeavour'd to appear so; and there were some that could scarce forbear laughing to consi∣der the disappointments of that day; and all in going home dis∣cours'd upon the way of this adventure, seeking for the rea∣son of this carriage of Timan∣ders, which they could not ima∣gine came from himself, because no body had forc'd him to this Marriage, to which he had al∣ways exprest a most violent in∣clination. But whilst Clidimira sighs alone in her Bed, let us re∣turn to him that should have
possest the half of it, the poor Timander, whom we left so near an expiring Rival. Timander no sooner saw his Rival fall, but he left fighting with him; Thersander express'd some desires to speak to him, but was not able to pronounce a word, and dyed a minute after he had receiv'd the fatal stroke. This Conquerour when he saw his Rival without life, thought of nothing else but go∣ing presently to taste the plea∣sures Hymen had prepar'd for him; but it growing very late, and having spent much time, and gone further then they imagin'd to find a place unfrequented e∣nough to fight in, Timander in coming back by those unknown
ways, which instead of carrying him to the Town, led him fur∣ther from it, and to encrease his mis-fortune, was set upon by Five Thieves; and although he was one of the most Valiant of his time, yet he was far from be∣ing one of those Heroes who give death or flight to all those that assault him, how numerous soever they be. All that Ti∣mander could do, was to fight like a Valiant Man, and not like one of those Demy-Gods: He defended himself a great while, kill'd one Man, wounded ano∣ther; but he also received a wound himself, that put him past fighting for that time, and so those Robbers stript him and their own dead Companion,
leaving them both for dead, although Timander was not, though he was something near it. When he came a little to him∣self, Oh Heavens! said he, with a Languishing voice, is it possi∣ble that I am that Timander, who this morning thought himself the happiest of all Men, and who this afternoon have been so Fortunate to overcome a most terrible Rival? Look round a∣bout the World, and an adven∣ture like mine can never be found. I was yesterday at this hour in the midst of Divertise∣ments, and Fortune seemed to prepare more and greater for me to day; in the mean time, by a Caprice which that blind God∣dess alone is capable of, the
same hour she promised me all those Pleasures, she has thrown me naked in the dark into the middle of a Field, wounded and alone, and perhaps upon the point of expiring without help, or hope of receiving any, and without knowing what way to go to be delivered from this di∣stress; and all this to happen in a time when Love and Hymen accompanyed with all kind of delights, waits to conduct me to Marriage-bed. Thus this miserable Man, in∣stead of hearing his Epithalmium Song, lies cursing the Capritious∣ness of Fortune, and lamenting his unhappiness, unheard, and unrelieved by any; his Enemies you may imagine hasted not to
his relief, they stayed not so late nor charitably in that Field; there passed by no generous un∣known person to carry him to his House, and dress his Wounds, and perswade him at last to re∣late the History of his Life, which would not have taken up much time; yet notwithstanding he received help in the midst of these Disasters, and help which came from Heaven, although it was but a glimmering of the Moon, which lighted him to a Peasants house, whither he made shift to crawl; and knocking at the door, he told those people that spoke to him through the Key-hole, that he had been Rob∣bed, and was Wounded; he added to his Tale promises of a
recompence, which was more powerful with them then all he had said before, and made them open their doors to him, after they had peep'd through the window to discover what man∣ner of man he was, and whether he was wounded or not. Timander was no sooner en∣ter'd that house, but he desired them to fetch the neerest Surge∣on; which the Farmers Son ran for with all the diligence imagi∣nable, bringing with him a Sur∣geon that was by chance at that time in the house of a Gentle∣man who lay sick hard by that place. The Surgeon having search'd his wound, found it not mortal, and gave him very good hopes of a speedy recovery from
that weakness, which only pro∣ceeded from his loss of so much blood. This unfortunate Hero after he was dress'd, slept all that night very well, and in the morn∣ing writ a Letter to his Father-in-Law, to tell him the place where he was, conjuring him to come and bring Clidimira with him, desiring him to let none know that he had heard of him till he had seen him. He sent this Letter by his officious Host, with a charge not to answer any question whatsoever was made him. The Father of Clidimira receiv'd this Letter with great joy, and immediately carried it to his Daughter, who agreed with him to go privately to the
house where Timander lay; which was not very difficult, since it was at so neer a distance, they might easily go and come in a day. This good man, after he had conducted them into the Cham∣ber of his new Guest, went out, leaving them at liberty to dis∣course freely. Timander desir'd them to lay aside their fears for him, his hurt being not at all dangerous; withal he told them, since they were persons so neer and dear to him, he would not disguise any thing from them of what hapned to him since he last saw them; and he hop'd the strangeness of that sad accident that had befaln him, would be his excuse for leaving them so
suddenly that day; and then he re∣lated the whole story of his ad∣ventures, desiring their counsel what to do next, and to tell him what the world said of his ab∣sence, and whether people did not already suspect something of the truth of what had hapned to Ther∣sander. Clidaris told him, that Thersanders Kindred knew no∣thing of it as yet, and only be∣liev'd that the vexation to see his Mistress married to another man, had made him quit the Town, and that they were not in much pain for his absence since; and that Melasia had confess'd nothing of what she knew from whence they conjectur'd that she would al∣ways conceal it, for her own sake, she having been the cause of their fighting.
After this and some other dis∣courses concerning these matters, they all agreed to conceal this ac∣cident hapned to our Hero, but were much put to it to frame an excuse for his going away upon such a day, there being scarce an Apology to be found for a man that willingly absents himself on his Wedding-day, unless he had been Married by force, which he was not; and therefore not know∣ing what reason to give, they trou∣bled not themselves much, but resolved to let the World think what it pleased; and now let us see what they did. Clidaris and his Daughter ha∣ving stayed some few hours long∣er in that place, took their jour∣ney towards the Town, carrying
with them a Letter written by the Hand of Timander, and sealed with his Seal; and when the next day their house was full of those Kindred and Friends that came to make their condoling Comple∣ments, this Letter of Timander's was brought in (by a Stranger hi∣red to that purpose) Clidaris read the Letter softly to himself, appearing extreamly surprised at the news it brought, which he pretended he could no longer conceal from the Company, but shewing the Letter, he desired them to rejoyce with him at that good news it brought. But before I tell you the Con∣tents of the Letter, you must know that the Mother of Timan∣der was yet living, and dwelt in
a Countrey house some fifteen miles off that City, to which house her extream age had confin'd her so Timander cunningly writ word that although he more deserved their pity then blame for his ha∣ving been obliged to quit that person in the World which he loved best, and upon his Wed∣ding day; yet the just scor that he knew the World would put upon that action, condemning it as a want of Love to his Dea Clidimira, had been an extream affliction to him, yet he hope those Censurers of him would condemn him no longer, whe they read the truths of that Let∣ter, which were these. At his going from Church to hi own Lodging that day he was Mar∣ried,
he found upon the Table in his Chamber a Letter, which informed him that his Mother was dying, and desired to speak with him be∣fore she dyed, of some business which she would deliver to no other, and was of great consequence to himself. And just as he was reading this Letter, he saw passing by his door a Friend of his, who was going in his Coach to the Countrey, and being to pass by the door of that house where Timander's Mother lay sick, he took that opportunity of going along with him; believing the Note, which he hastily wrote to his Fa∣ther-in-law by a Laquay which he left behind, would excuse that ab∣rupt leaving him for that time, and also his dear Wife, who though he was then snatcht violently from, yet
now he desires passionately to see. This Artifice prospered well, you may imagine, since it was con∣firmed by the Parties concerned, who well enough knew the truth; as for those that were not so, they did not dive so deep into the mat∣ter, and so the Company all con∣cluded this excuse very reasona∣ble, and the whole fault was laid upon the Laquay that Timander sent to carry this Letter. Clidaris and his Daughter that had not so great a journey to make as was imagined, went the next day to the house where Ti∣mander lay, instead of going, as they pretended, to the house of his Mother: They staid with him till he was perfectly recover'd, and during their abode in that
house they heard that there was a man found dead in the Fields, whose face none knew, and there∣fore people supposed he had lain there a long time, and likewise believed he had been murther'd, because they found his Sword in the Scabbard, and he was not robb'd; they carried him to the nearest Church. All this perswa∣ded our Hero and his Company to believe this dead unknown person was the unhappy Thersan∣der; for Timander confess'd he had left him in this posture on purpose to disguise the manner of his death. As soon as this unfortunate Bridegroom was heal'd of his wound, he returned to Town with this company, and was so
happy to find none in that Town suspected the least of what had hapned; and since you may be∣lieve their Marriage is consum∣mated, it is time to speak a word or two of their persons. Clidimira was the only Daugh∣ter of her Father, her stature was low, and though she was very a∣greeable, yet none could call her a Beauty; she had that I know not what charming Air which takes so extreamly, and is often seen in those indifferent Women, but seldom or never is found a∣mongst those great and perfect Beauties, which are so Celebrated in the World: her Wit resembled her Beauty, and although it was not very great, yet it was full of those flashes which made it so
much admired in Conversation. To all these charms was added that much more attractive in the eyes of most Men, a great Estate; and that was the reason why Timander sigh'd so passio∣nately for Clidimira, his own be∣ing very small, though in revenge to that, he was one of the most accomplished Men of his time; and therefore Clidimira consented so easily to Marry him. The hu∣mour of these two Persons you shall shortly know. Six months after the Wedding of Timander and his Clidimira, he was visited by one of his nearest Kindred, that was his neighbour in the Countrey; this Person ha∣ving not conversed with him since his Wedding, and being one of a
pleasant humour, and much in∣clined to Mirth, he asked Timan∣der a hundred questions con∣cerning his Marriage, and at last he desired him to tell what kind of humour Clidimira was of. Timan∣der instead of answering to his demand, told him, that since he knew him a great lover of Novel∣ties, he would shew him a new piece of Wit that was given him that morning, and taking a Paper out of his Pocket, gave it to this Friend, which he received with much joy, and read these words, The Jealousie of Women. Although it is the common opi∣nion that Men are more inclined to Jealousie then Women, yet it
is as true, that though Nature and Custom have given the power on∣ly to the Husband, yet those Women that are once infected with this disease, disturb that Pre∣rogative of their Husbands, giving them often a trouble; which ren∣ders those Wives so insupporta∣ble, that the strongest Jealousie of all mankind is nothing, if compared with the effects which the clamour of these Women produce, of which there are in∣numberable examples. When a Man is so unhappy to find a Mistress of that humour, she makes him suffer un-imagina∣ble Torments; what business so∣ever he has, and what lawful ex∣cuses soever he makes to her, yet he must be always in her com∣pany;
who will not be perswa∣ded to believe his. Affairs can be of more importance then to visit her; and if at last she is convinc'd that in wasting his time in her company, he also loses his For∣tune; yet her humour is so Fanta∣stick, that she grows jealous of Fortune it self, and fears lest that Goddess should favour him too much, and suspects that her Ser∣vant will one day forsake her, to give himself up entirely to For∣tune. If by chance she meet him in Company, he must speak to none but to her, and appear the most ill-bred, and uncivil Man in the World, only for a quiet life with her, who will break off with him twenty times in a month; protesting she will never more
speak to him, and yet will piece with him again at every visit he makes her; and although she scolds perpetually, breaks off, gives him an angry reception, ap∣pearing always displeased, yet her Flames for him still burn; which confirms me in the opinion that Jealousie is a great sign of Love, and that notwithstanding all the troubles which the Jealousie of Women give, yet no Womans Love is to be confided in so much, as that of her that is Jealous of her Servant. You see now what a jealous Woman does before she is mar∣ried; let us now discover if she will be more reasonable after∣wards. Marrimony sometimes cures the jealousie of Men, who
had some reason to fear some o∣ther person more happy then they might snatch away that Treasure which they aim'd at, and having it not in their possession, had a just excuse for their jealousie of all those Rivals which laid claim to it as well as themselves; but Wo∣men are of another mind: They hold, that there is much more rea∣son for jealousie after Marriage then before, because the appre∣hension of losing a good we en∣joy, is much greater then that of being depriv'd of what we only hope for; and therefore a Wo∣man says, that if before she is married she would have her Ser∣vant always to attend her, now that he is a Husband, she will prove it his duty always to be
with her, scarce suffering him to stir a minute from her, though it be to go about his domestick af∣fairs; still believing he gives more time to those businesses then is necessary, or else that he is di∣verting himself with Company that pleases him better, when he is not with her. This hapning (from the odness of her humour) every day makes her insupporta∣ble to her Husband, who is not able to endure her reproachful complaints, so often and violent∣ly repeated in his ears, with sharp upbraids and continual murmur∣ings, because he courts her not now at the same rate he used be∣fore she was his Wife, when he entertain'd hone but her self in all Companies where they met;
which now she bawls to have him do still, giving him a dreadful look if he fix his eyes (though by chance) upon any other Woman in the room. But she appears for this the more ridiculous to all the World, who discovering her jealousie, rallies her severely, and makes her Fantastick insolent hu∣mour the diversion of most con∣versations, whilst in the mean time she is busie in following her Husband into all places, and spares no cost to find out all his intrigues, being assisted with that excellent help, Jealousie, which added to a Womans craft is very ingenious in making those kind of discoveries; but this knowledge is so far from curing, that it exaspe∣rates her disease to that abomina∣ble
height that none can express but those poor unfortunate hus∣bands that so often suffer it with∣out complaint, who if they were ask'd can better describe then I, How far the Fury of a Jealous Wife can Transport her. And therefore I will not ven∣ture to say more to it then this; There is no sight in the World so terrible, as a Woman in this con∣dition; her Eyes, her Actions, &c. all express her a Fury, and if by chance she hold her peace, her very looks are dreadful enough to make the boldest man to tremble. What is become then of that softness so charming and natural to that Fair Sex? It is for ever
banished from the first minute this cursed Jealousie siezes them, and to their great mis-fortune; for if they could but once call it back again into their looks, their Husbands would quickly be re∣conciled to them; but the Jea∣lousie of these Women abhors the only remedy that can cure their Disease; for if ever any Wife would lay aside that Fury which so Transports her, and com∣plain to her Husband with a good grace; if she could overcome her passion so far as to sigh only loud enough to be heard by none but himself, and instead of complain∣ing of him to all the World, stifle those fiery sighs which so justly are called the Children of an un∣discreet rage, and makes her ap∣pear
so ridiculous to the lookers on; if she did only appear to him in that lovely soft charming Me∣lancholy, against which there is no Mans heart so hard as to re∣sist; then she would get that vi∣ctory which she loses in those o∣ther mistaken ways, which that ill Conducter, Jealousie, leads her to her own ruine; and it is most cer∣tain, that those quarrels which so often arise between a Man and his Wife, would never begin, or else quickly end, if the Wife would but make her complaints with mildness: but the miserable di∣stemper of Women is such, that when once they have begun to declaim loudly against their Hus∣bands, they can never give over, whether they have cause or not;
their Jealousie so blinds them, they are capable of no Sentiments but what that Passion inspires; and therefore the Senate of Marseilles had reason to accept the petition of that Man that asked leave to kill himself, to be delivered from the Tempest of his Wife: How well that word Tempest expres∣ses the clamour of a Jealous Wife, and shews still more and more that a Man can suffer no greater torment then that! And although it is confessed to be a great proof of Love, yet it were better let alone, for it does more hurt then good; yet a rational Man ought not to be displeased with the Jealousie of his Wife when it is not excessive, as I have shewed before; the Jealousie of
a Wife being commonly ac∣counted a greater sign of Love then that of a Husband, because most part of Men are Jealous on∣ly of their own Honour, but Women are Jealous only of their Husbands. But as there are very few of these kind of Women that I have described, I hope from the rest of that Fair Sex (who are exempt from this dangerous Passion) the justice of their votes on my side, instead of their anger for what I have writ; which will be a great strength to me in the War I shall always maintain against those fu∣rious Ladies, whose humour at last receiving a change, there may be nothing found amongst all Women but Perfections.
After this Gentleman had read this Paper, which made him laugh in many places, he repeated these lines, which he found most to his taste; The Jealousie of Wives is commonly a greater sign of Love then that of the Husband, because that most Men are Jealous of their Honour, &c. When he had again read over that part, I re∣member, said he to Timinder, that a little before you gave me this Piece, I asked you concerning the humour of your Wife, and you gave me no reply: You have no great reason to complain of that, said Timander, for since you asked me that question, I think I gave you that which pretty well resolves your doubt, and leaves me nothing more to say; yet I per∣ceive
(continued he looking sted∣fastly upon him) that this dis∣course surprizes you; but you must know that this piece, which fell by chance into my hands, and that which you have been reading, de∣scribes exactly the humour of my Wife, who I believe was the Co∣py by which it was drawn. It is scarce six months since I Married her, and since that hour her Jea∣lousie has almost made me despe∣rate. He had said more, but was interrupted by a person that came to him about some business, so his Kinsman went away, leaving them together, it is no matter whither he went; I have only undertaken the relation of the passages be∣tween Timander and his Wife, therefore let us pass on to some∣thing
more divertising. Timander having Married (as you have read) Clidimira more for Love to her Fortune, then her Person, therefore it is no wonder he was not very fond of his Wife, being none of those Husbands that make Court to their Wives as much after their Marriage as before; yet he nevertheless paid her (like an honest Man) all the respect imaginable, was extreamly civil to her, and refused her no∣thing she asked, giving her liber∣ty to live where and how she pleased, hoping that would teach her to allow him the same liberty of living according to his own Fancy; but he deceived himself, for his extream compliance gave Clidimira too much confidence,
and by little and little she at last grew not to fear him at all; and when the Jealous humour took her, made loud complaints to all the world of her Husband, not apprehending his displeasure in the least. Timander on the other side was very little concerned for this Jea∣lous humour of his Wife, and al∣tered not his custom of going a∣broad very often to divert him∣self; and being a Man as gallant in his Humour, as handsome of his Person, he pretended Love in ma∣ny places, and often complained of a Passion which seldom trou∣bled him, making Court to all the Women he liked. Not long after he was Married, it was his Fortune to see a very
handsome Woman called Almazi∣ana, and was so happy to be pla∣ced near her at a publick Feast: none are ignorant how a man well read in Gallantry behaves him∣self at such an Entertainment, where he had time enough to make his Wit sparkle in the Con∣versation before the Meat is brought in. Timander made good use of his time, and so charmed the Fair Almaziana and her Mo∣ther, that he obtained their per∣mission to visit them at their house; which he failed not to do very often, and with such assidui∣ty, that he gained all the esteem of the Mother, and tenderness of the Daughter, who knew not that he was Married, till an accident hapned, which I am going to tell
you, which entangled this Mon∣sieur not a little. The Mother of Almaziana came to him one day and said, Sir, I have much acknow∣ledgment for your kindness to our House, and Passion you have so long expressed to my Daughter; and therefore I do with all my heart give you my consent to Marry her this day if you please. Timander was surprized at this dis∣course, not knowing what answer to make; for if he confest him∣self a Married Man, he feared a certain banishment from the old Ladies house, whose Daughter he by a frequent conversation had began to like with a more then ordinary esteem; and therefore without much pumping for an answer, he promised the old Lady
to Marry her Daughter very sud∣denly, trusting to his Wit for a new pretence every day to put her off, till he had accomplished his design. The first it presented him was this, he said he had writ a Letter to a Kinsman of his who was gone to Italy, for his consent, whose approbation concerned him very much, and till that Let∣ter was answered he could not Marry, but he hop'd it would not be long in coming, and that she would give him leave to stay for it, which was much against his will. But see how Fortune thrusts it self into Affairs, to which she is not called! It hapned that Clidimira was informed of all these passages by a Merchant that
went often to the house of Alma∣ziana; Clidimira was in such a rage at the hearing of this, that being unable to go to Almazia∣na's house (by reason of some in∣disposition of health) she presently writ a Letter to the Mother of that young Lady, stuffed with all the railing she could invent a∣gainst her Husband, sparing not the old Lady her self, who she passionately reproached for per∣mitting her Daughter to be Cour∣ted so easily: So that the next vi∣sit which Timander made to Al∣maziana, he was amazed at their cold reception of him; the old Lady asked him if he would find no other excuse to defer his Mar∣riage with her Daughter, though his Friend in Italy should give his
consent, or if he had not in that Town some other inclination be∣sides her Daughter. Almaziana seeing him non-plust, told her Mother that she injured Timander in believing it was Love that hin∣dered him from performing his promise to Marry her; for she knew well enough, that the only person in the world who had power to oppose it, was one that he hated extreamly. Timander hearing her speak so, presently imagined they meant his Wife, and began to suspect some body had told them he was Married; but still believing they were not certainly informed of the truth, he denied all, till, they shewed him his Wives Letter, which he no sooner read, but he turned those
denials into excuses, and spoke a hundred pleasant things upon the resistless power of Almaziana's Beauty: but yet for all that he was forbid the house. As soon as Timander received his dismission from thence, he went home, and far from quarrel∣ling his Wife for the Letter she had writ, he patiently suffer∣ed (without answering one word) all the reproachful Lan∣guage that the most violent anger and the cruellest jealousie could put into a Womans mouth. Clidimira finding by that si∣lence of his, that her jealousie was not without cause, set her self to watch her Husband's actions so narrowly, that she discovered the best part, and not only interrupt∣ed
all his divertisements by her Spies, but followed him her self into all Companies whither he went, and there she made the laughing world a witness of her Follies: but when she saw that signified nothing, and the greatest part of the shame fell to her own share, she began to think that the only way to take him off from that way of Life, was to make him jealous; which she resolved to do without inujring her Vertue. Some time after she had made this resolve, she went to visit one of her Neighbours, where there was much Company, who having spoke to divers Subjects, they at last came to jealousie. Clidimira disputed to admiration against all those that condemned that Passi∣on,
declaring that that Woman who had a jealous Husband, was perfectly happy. Every one con∣tradicted her, and chiefly Argan∣tes, who was one of the greatest Gallants of that place, and had long time defended the side he had chosen against all the Argu∣ments of Clidimira; but at last he told her he yielded her the Victo∣ry, which he had so long disputed with her, only to have the ho∣nour at last of being Conquered by so charming an Enemy. Af∣ter that the discourse changed to another Subject, in which Argan∣tes and Clidimira took no part, but entertained one another all the time that conversation lasted: he promised her to write a Piece for her of the advantage of all
those Women that have Jealous Husbands, and to make it more agreeable, he would set down the greatest part of those expressi∣ons which she had so wittily de∣clared in their favour; he also desired her permission to wait up∣on her at her own house, which she granted him; he gave her a visit two days after, she no sooner saw him, but she challenged the performance of his promise, which he presented her in these words; The good Fortune of Women that have Jealous Husbands; or the Apology of Jealousie. All those who are acquainted with the Passions of women, know very well that their Love is vio∣lent,
and their Hatred is exces∣sive, and that their desires are to be loved at their own rate, will not think it strange that they should profess themselves happy in having Jealous Husbands, be∣cause Jealousie is a sign of Love; and whatsoever is a sign of Love, cannot certainly displease those Persons that Love Passionately, and desire to have that Love re∣turned: yet the most part of the World would perswade, that Jea∣lousie is less supportable then Hatred, and that it cannot but be extreamly troublesome; and therefore I would here endea∣vour to discover all the advanta∣ges and delights of it. The jealous have in all Ages been so unfortunate, that by a
big and strange injustice, they have been still condemned by the greatest part of the World, with∣out having yet been so happy to find any person that would un∣dertake their defence; but on the contrary, most People agree in declaiming against them, they dare not shew a fear of losing a person they Love, without expo∣sing themselves to be called trou∣blesome and ridiculous persons; as if the fear of losing what is beloved (which is in all others called a demonstration of Love and Reason too) were only Cri∣minal in the jealous, whose fear of losing what they Love, is caused by the Beauties, which they discover in that object, and whose excellencies makes them
believe others may admire as well as they; and from that fear grows their Distemper, which is so much condemned by the greatest part of People, who rather then they will leave any excuse for these who are unfortunately touched with jealousie, and to justifie their censures of the thoughts and actions of these miserable persons, are also unjust to Beauty it self, which in all Ages has been so adored; and that Beauty to which so many Temples have been, they now seek to deprive of all its Ornaments, rather then they will want the satisfaction of condemning the jealous with more applause, not allowing them sentiments so just and natu∣ral, which have been in all Ages
authorized by custom and reason both, and are still allowed to o∣thers, not only for all other things that are Beautiful, but also for all Beautiful Persons. There are more Women then are believed, that make frequent complaints against those Persons who perswade Husbands that they grow troublesome to their Wives in those visible proofs of affection, of being too often seen in their company; and truly those Women do not complain without cause; for the Husbands of these days are too much en∣clined to harken to those perni∣cious Councellours, who con∣demn all publick expressions of hindness between Man and Wife, calling it jealousie, and accusing
those Husbands for distrustful ill natur'd Men, and have at last made it the fashion to cry down all fond Husbands as the most cri∣minal amongst Men. These Cen∣surers do not only cry down this vertue so rarely found amongst Men, but they make it pass for a ridiculous humour, and no Man dare now adays be seen in his Wives company without expo∣sing himself to the publick Ral∣lery; as if Men Married their Wives only to be rid of their company, and Women took Hus∣bands only to see them no more; for if a Man comes into his Wives Chamber before night, he is look'd upon as a troublesome impertinent; and if he stay at home much, his Wife is pitied
by all the Town as the misera∣blest Woman in the world; let her do or say what she will to contradict that report, nay, though she is Passionately fond of her Husband, and expresses it in great raptures, no body believes her, all conclude it is her vertue alone that makes her speak so. Strange injustice of the People of this Age! that will force or imagine that these persons can live in any satisfaction when they are separated from that half of themselves, without whose com∣pany it is impossible for them to taste any true delight or lawful satisfaction; and since I have told you that most women take delight in that part of jealousie, which is called the most troublesome,
I mean the company of their Hus∣bands; let us now see if they will take less satisfaction in those other effects which this Passion produces. If to express a fear of losing what one Loves, if to believe that Beauty is to be Loved by all per∣sons that look upon it, and if the assiduity of Husbands to their Wives, are by these condemners of jealousie accounted such hor∣rible crimes; judge then what opinion they have of the careful and suspitious part of it which yet never Alarms an honest Wife but to make her vertue the more known, and affords her many pleasures and advantages which I will shew you, after I have a lit∣tle examined what these Criticks upon Love require from a Hus∣band,
and a Lover in the disco∣very of their Passions. Although there is no Lover that ought not to fear that what he is not yet possessed of, may be carried from him by some o∣ther more happy man, and there∣fore may justly be jealous of his misfortune; and although the jealousie of a Lover is only this reasonable fear, yet he is not per∣mitted (without drawing upon himself the hatred of his Mistress) to make the least complaints of her, or to discover any resent∣ment against his Rivals; but on the contrary, he must be civil to those cruel Enemies of his that seek to deprive him of all his happiness, nay, although he some∣times too clearly discovers them
very near the accomplishment of their designs to ruine him. Is there any Laws in the World so severe as those that are imposed upon jealousie? Must a Man give no testimonies of Love for fear of being called jealous, and be either insensible, or else endeavour to appear so? Must he Carress his Enemies, and find out a way to be Victorious without fighting, or doing any thing to shew the greatness of his Courage? He must besiege a Heart without making use of Love to take it in, although no other Arms but those of Love have force enough to cause that heart to yield; yes, he must do and suffer all this, or else be looked upon as a troublesom Chagrin, ill-humoured Person;
and so that heart which ought to be the reward of him who Loves most, is often given to him who appears the most insensible. But if these Testimonies of Love are so troublesome from a Lover, and (as these blind Cri∣ticks say) deserve the hatred of his Mistress; those that a Hus∣band gives are insupportable, and ought to make him hated by his Wife; all that comes from him displeases (if we must believe them) they condemn his Love and all the proofs he gives of it; they blame his jealousie and all its effects; what then shall we call Love, since they condemn it and all its effects, and will acknow∣ledge it no longer? They would (without doubt) have it live in
indifferency; for if a man ex∣press a passionate fondness of his Wife, or by all his actions assures her that she is not indifferent to him, then presently these people say, he is an enemy to his own re∣pose and also to hers; they would have married men love coldly, or at least without discovering any remainder of that Fire which they so much complain'd of be∣fore Marriage: They also find fault with all those little cares which some Husbands take to shew their kindness, concluding that they are signs of Hatred, not of Love, and that all those who make use of them, hate even in loving: but though they will have it that Love produces Hate, &c. must it needs follow that
Hate produces Love? will the passions produce their contraries, to authorize the Caprices of these men, and to better their cause? or if they should confess (with some, who though they are on their side, yet are less severe) that in the midst of that Hatred, Love does discover it self; yet how will they reconcile these two great passions? can two things so opposite consist together? can a man hate what he loves, and loves without ceasing? It is true, Jea∣lousie and the little doubts that usually accompany it, does give some trouble to the person belo∣ved; yet nevertheless that pain serves only to give a better relish to the following pleasures, as the rigours of Winter sets off the de∣lightful
Freshness of the Spring: How pleasant to Lovers are those little quarrels which Jealousie creates! how full of pleasing rap∣tures and ravishing joys are those little skirmishes in the Wars of Love! how agreeable and charm∣ing is that reconcilement of those Lovers who repent of their Jea∣lousie! All true Lovers will con∣fess and acknowledge that an Age of suffering the most cruel torments imaginable is absolute∣ly forgot, and largely recompen∣ced in the charming extasie of that sweet moment of their re∣conciliation; the pleasures it af∣fords are so great, that if they could be exprest, yet they would seem incredible; therefore I will only say, that if the joys which
Loves War gives are so great, what can express those delights its Peace affords? But we see every day (say these Censurers of Jealousie) that even amongst these pleasant quar∣rels arising from the doubts of Lovers, there are some that last very long, and are very trouble∣some both to the Lover and the person belov'd, and though this Jealousie is at last cur'd with much satisfaction, yet it has been the cause of all the past vexati∣ons; and therefore it is said with reason, that Jealousie creates in∣numerable evils, though she ap∣pears but once, yet she is the foundation of all those disturb∣ances, &c. And that is one of the strong∣est
of their proofs, for all those things they impute to jealousie, which they affirm nothing can de∣stroy; I will endeavour to prove the contrary, and describe here the hatred of a Jealous Person, though I confess, if all things were judg'd by appearances, I should accomplish my design with much difficulty, there being some acti∣ons of Jealous Men that seem very often to express more hatred then Love to the Person beloved; yet it is a true saying when they complain most, Love is in their Hearts, al∣though Hate be in their Mouths. Let us now examine what kind
of Hate this is that reaches not the Heart, and whether or no it causes any pain to the Person be∣loved. Those Women who have some∣times been the object of this kind of Hate, know very well that Love accompanies it, although he disguises himself, taking Hatred for a vail; yet the covering not being large enough, some parts of him will be seen, he is easily known through all disguises, and that of Hatred of this kind is too little and too thin to hide him; his rays pierce that Curtain ea∣sily, so as it may be said, Love stands behind that vail of Hate which Jealousie causes, even as the Sun that shines behind those envious Clouds that sometimes interpose themselves.
So this beloved Person having been acquainted with the usual effects of this jealousie, is not at all Alarm'd by it, and remains with∣out fear, whilst all the world is afraid for her, and pities her con∣dition; she knows the advantage will be hers in the conclusion, and looks upon that hatred (so dread∣ful in the opinion of others) as a resemblance of those storms, which when they are blown over, render the day more Fair, and the Calm that follows more delight∣ful; and this makes her rejoyce even in the midst of the Tempest. But lest some mistake that Hatred I have endeavoured to de∣scribe (which cannot hide Love, and is only caused by the little doubts and fears of jealousie) and
take it for that other kind which the world calls Hate, I think it not unnecessary to speak a word of it in this place. That which the world calls Hatred, is a Passion that cannot endure the object which created it, nor hear it men∣tioned without Fury; it wishes nothing but ill, will not be ap∣peased, all its transports are vio∣lent, affects nothing but War and Treason, threatens perpetually, and takes a Pride in being Invin∣cible. But that Hatred which I have told you of, does nothing resembling to this; it Loves passi∣onately that which creates it, and never hears it nam'd without satis∣faction, wishing it nothing but good; and all its Transports are Raptures of Love; and it may
justly be called a Hatred proceed∣ing from Love, because it is be∣got by an excess of that Passion, and it loves and seeks after no∣thing but Peace; it desires not to be eternal, and is born only that it may quickly dye, complains only to be appeased; and where∣as that other sort of Hatred desires to lose the sight of that object which created it, calling it insup∣portable; this Hatred (which I mean) Courts it to her, and hates it only because she Loves it; in fine, it is nothing but an angry Cupid that desires to be strokt and kiss'd, and though he take the name of hatred to disguise him∣self, yet he is too well known to be long hid, and cannot leave loving, though he may desire to hate.
That which was spoken by a French Lady to her Lover, Ony ina haine pour toy va jusques à l'extréme, si l'on peut toutesfois hair ce que l'on aime, proves this truth; and let us see, that although ha∣tred is sometimes in the will, yet it is never in the power of a Lover. Thus you see the difference that is between hatred and hatred, between the common hatred, and that which is caused in the heart of a Lover from the doubts of jealousie, which may subsist with Love, which is impossible for the other kind of Hate, unless Love and perfect Hatred could be re∣conciled. Nevertheless, to convince all those who condemn jealousie, and to let them see that it is not the
cause of so much ill as is imputed to it; let them assure themselves, that there is nothing at all of what I have said, if a Man find his supi∣tions true, and that he is not de∣ceived by appearances, and so comes to an expressible hatred of the person beloved. But what is the hatred of a Lover? What is the hatred of a Husband? has it not deceived all those who confided in it? what do they not do to stifle it in them∣selves, and to destroy it absolute∣ly? what do they not do to kin∣dle that Fire which they put out so much against their will, and which they do desire to re-kindle? one look mingled with sweet∣ness, a Sigh, a Tear, one kind word of justification quickly ap∣peases
their hatred, though it ap∣peared implacable; which con∣firms this saying, A suspicion cleared, re-kindles a strong Love. Two Persons are never more united, nor more inflamed, then after a quarrel of this nature, and she that seems to have suffered most by the injustice she met with, receives now a pleasure much above her former pain, when she sees the Person beloved prostrate at her Feet and asking her pardon, expressing his fears of having lost her affection by his rashness, in suspecting her of infidelity. Caressey importunes her, and appears ashamed and
confounded at this Crime, and is more submissive and passionate then ever. Besides the pleasure and ex∣tream joy which this re-inflamed Lover gives to the person belo∣ved, she has this great advantage from it, of making good use of that time, in which a man can de∣ny her nothing, but grants all re∣quests a Woman can make, and which at another time are not so easily obtained: there is also this advantage to them both in such a reconcilement, which can hardly be made without a knowledge of the virtue of his Wife, which when the Husbands Jealousie has served him to find out, it is a ra∣vishing discovery; and since there are many things unknown be∣cause
untryed, a Jealous Husband has this advantage of an indiffe∣rent careless unsuspicious one, he may answer for his Wives virtue, which the other cannot do, having never given himself the trouble to enquire whether she were ver∣tuous or not. I have told you before, that some Women rejoyce more then is imagined in the company of their Husbands; but since I have not told you why they do so, and that these enemies of Jealousie will not believe it, I will speak a word or two concerning that. Since there is no pleasure can equal that of being in the com∣pany of those we love, we must not wonder if Women that love their Husbands are fond of their
company, complaining when they do not stay with them, and grow jealous of their absence, believ∣ing themselves hated, suspecting that their Husbands fly from them to please themselves in places where they are not, forgetting that they are married; besides, a∣nother great vexation is the ex∣pence which they believe their Husbands are at in other places, which is often but too true: and thus they weep, torment them∣selves, make complaints, and suf∣fer the greatest torments imagi∣nable, without receiving any help from those fruitless tears and doleful stories which they tell; for they are irremediable griefs, which nothing can cure unless it be the Jealousie of their Hus∣bands,
because Jealous Husbands are always with their Wives, and waiting very assiduously upon them, giving them no cause of suspicion or complaint, because they are still so happy to be with them they love; which shews that there are Women who desire their Husbands should be always with them. But if there are Women found of this humour, to wish their Husbands should always stay at home with them, there are also Jealous Husbands in the world that will not permit their Wives often to go abroad; but since they have always been condemn∣ed, and their Wives look'd on as Prisoners and Unfortunate Per∣sons, let us see whether they are
as unhappy as the World thinks them. Those Husbands that see plain∣ly that their Wives pay to them without dispute all the obedience they require, and are satisfied that this obedience proceeds from Love, return, carress them extreamly, redoubling their kind∣ness to them every moment: They receive other great advantages by their obedience, besides that of letting the World see the great power their Husbands have over them, and the great interest they have in his heart, which is very rare, and is no little glory and ho∣nour to those Women, whose Husbands, though they are al∣ways with them, yet put no re∣straint upon them at home; and
when they go abroad, they take care to bring these Wives what∣soever they fancy will please their humours, as New Fashions, Fine Rarities, &c. And it is observed, there are no Women go better drest, and wear richer Cloths, then those who have Jealous Hus∣bands, which is very agreeable to that Sex, whose ambition for Gal∣lantry is almost as powerful with them as that of Love. If all Women were of this humour of loving the company of their Husbands, if there were no Gos∣sips in the World who love Gal∣lants, and to be Courted; per∣haps I had well enough prov'd that this jealousie is not so odious as it is believed: but since it is too well known, that it sets all those
kind of Women upon the rack, it will without doubt be said that I was not able to justifie jealou∣sie in all cases; yet I wish it were true, that jealousie would but give them all those tormenting inqui∣etudes and cruel pains it is accu∣sed of, perhaps it would oblige them to alter their course of life; but these Gossips have so much wit and cunning invention, they turn all this to their own advan∣tage, as well before, as after they are Married; for whilst they are un-married, the jealousie of their Lovers gives them but little pain, because they have too little pow∣er over them, and too much re∣spective fear to those persons they adore, to torment them, by do∣ing any thing against the humour
of those Coy Mistresses, who know their own strength well enough, and use it to their own advantage; but the jealousie of their Husbands who they must fear and obey, is not the same, for that disquiets and enslaves them (at least in their own opinion) yet they nevertheless draw these great advantages usually from it. The Ambition of these Wo∣men being to be Courted, and to have all sort of Gallants, the jea∣lousie of their Husbands, instead of preventing, draws the greater number about them; some Men making Court to their Wives, be∣lieving the hatred they ought to have of their Tyrants (for so they call their Husbands) will make
the Conquest very easie; others think, that a Woman that has power to create jealousie must needs have something extraordi∣nary, although she is not hand∣some. Some fancy there is much pleasure in deceiving a jealous Man, and the rest adore her, ima∣gining it a great glory and a sign of Wit to have a Mistress that gives such jealousie, and is so much Courted by others, striving to be in the fashion; and thus the jealousie of the Husbands gives these Women what they wish, an extraordinary crowd of Gallants. But some will answer, that al∣though it is true the jealousie of the Husbands is the cause of all this Gallantry, yet these crowd of Lovers cannot defend her from
the ill humour into which that jealousie puts him, but on the contrary creates it; I grant that is most certain, yet nevertheless they usually draw their greatest advantages from that ill humour of their Husbands; for they being very cunning, they easily know how to appease them at any time, though in the mean time they use all their endeavours to make the world believe they are ill us'd, by publishing this ill humour of their Husbands, and especially to those amongst their Gallants who they cannot affect, and have a mind to banish; and also to grati∣fie those whom they do Love best, by telling them how much they suffer for their sakes, and to what dangers they are often ex∣posed
by the extream passion they have for them, from the rage of that jealous Husband who per∣ceives it. This expression of kindness from a beloved Politick Woman, gives these obliged Lo∣vers an unexpressible joy, who presently believe themselves much more beloved then they are; and in this Fools Paradise into which these gossips have led them, blinded with the fancied dangers these poor Women are exposed to for their Love, they think they can never be grateful enough, though they almost ruine their Fortunes with the vast Presents they make them; which are recei∣ved by these Women with de∣light, and many a jeer to the de∣luded Fool that presents them:
which confirms what I say, that the jealousie of the Husband is not so prejudicial to those kind of Wives as it is imagined, since it brings them in all that they care for; as in the first place, giving them a handsome occasion to rid themselves of those Men they hate, without being in the least suspected by those discarded Gal∣lants. Secondly, making them pass for handsome by some, and beloved by most, and passionate∣ly adored, and richly presented by the Men they like. This is all I can tell you at pre∣sent of the good fortune of those Women that have jealous Hus∣bands; and though I have not spoke well enough upon such a subject, yet I have in the disco∣very
of my thoughts endeavoured to shew you Joys, Pleasures, and other considerable advantages, even in the midst of what-ever is most terrible in jealousie; and I think I have forgot nothing to shew you that those troubles which are caused by jealousie, are many times the occasion of great profits even to those people that complain most; you have also read how it serves to make known the Vertue, Wit, Merit, and all the other good qualities a Wo∣man is capable of, and how it is of equal advantage to the Marri∣ed and Un-married, to the Ver∣tuous, and those that are not so, and that without it Love would lose his heat, there being no∣thing else but jealousie capable of
awakening, nourishing, and ena∣bling him to find out new and un∣thought of Pleasures; all its effects being signs of Love, whose pains are rather to be desired then fear∣ed. This being a great truth, we may justly call that Love imper∣fect and insipid, which is not ac∣companied with jealousie, nay, it is a languishing, sleepy, sottish Love, which does not understand it self, scarce knowing if he be alive or dead, and infine cannot subsist long in that estate. Clidimira having read this Pa∣per with a joy that was remark∣able enough in her eyes, told Ar∣gantes (with a smile) that she was confident he did not look upon her in the number of those Wo∣men he described at the conclusi∣on
of his discourse, because she desired to have her Husband jea∣lous, and thought no Woman happy whose Husband was not so: he replyed, he never intended it to her, nor should have a thought so unjust of her; and as for that conclusion, he only made it to shew that he had forgot nothing in that Paper to speak his opinion of jealousie, without intending to injure any person, since it was a truth so well known, that all the world were not of one humour, nor had inclinations alike. After that they talkt of divers other things, and although Clidi∣mira had a great deal of Wit, yet she nevertheless resembled those Women that love to tell what they ought rather to conceal; for
she told Argantes all she could imagine of her Husband and his humour, and the little affection she believed he had for her. Argan∣tes being one of those that only sought his own Divertisment, and easily flattered himself, drew from the discourse of Clidimira many things that were advantagious to his design, and though she had on∣ly made it to help out the con∣versation of that afternoon, yet he presently believed she did not hate him, and fancyed that if be would give himself a little trou∣ble to assault that Fort, the Con∣quest would be very easie for him; but he deceived himself, for in the end the Vertue of Clidimira let him see the folly of his thoughts, and convinc'd him that
those Women that are many times the free'st in conversation, and are apt to speak their minds freely, are the hardest for designs to work on, and the most Vertu∣ous in Reality; which those that seek to make advantages upon them, often find in conclusion, and is a truth which experience daily confirms. Argantes was already thinking and contriving what to do to make use of this good Fortune, which he fancied he saw coming towards him, when Clidimira told him, she was perswaded that the only way to work this desired change upon her Husband, was to make him jealous, which she that mi∣nute had resolved upon, and her thoughts had chosen him for the
fittest person in the world to help her in that design, if he would please to consent; which he easily granted, thanking his kind For∣tune for that blessed motion, be∣lieving now that that kind God∣dess would undertake his happi∣ness; doing all things her self for him, without suffering him to take any pains for his happiness, since she had inspired Clidimira to prevent those addresses which his lazy humour would have scrupled to make, notwithstand∣ing the greatness of his growing Passion; he offered to serve her in all things she desired, and be∣ing one of those that fear nothing, and never trouble themselves to examine what designs soever they take in hand, he considered not
at all how Clidimira's Husband would take it, thinking upon no∣thing but the accomplishing what he had now promised, and wholly took up his thoughts; and thus they began to make the poor Ti∣mander jealous. Clidimira having gain'd all her Husbands Servants, was informed of all he did, and the next day hearing that he was gone abroad in the company of Ladies, was re∣solved to follow him, and know∣ing the place where the Treat was to be given, she sent for Ar∣gantes and three or four Ladies of her acquaintance, who went to divert themselves at the same house; and Fortune to give a good beginning to their design, carried them into a room so near
to that which Timander and his company had taken, that both the Companies might easily hear and see each others actions. Clidimi∣ra set her self by Argantes, talk∣ing always with him, and often whispering in his ear, but most when her Husband lookt that way. Those that were with Ti∣mander pretended not to know it was his Wife, and were so discreet and obliging to him, seemed to take no notice of her carriage, though it afforded them wonder and divertisement enough. Timan∣der appeared with his ordinary gayety, unconcerned at all things, which he yet saw plain enough without taking of any notice; so that the mirth of both these Companies was not at all disturb∣ed
in appearance, although Ti∣mander and Clidimira were not without their troubles under this discreet disguisement of each o∣thers thoughts. Timander at his return home that night, instead of appearing vext or discomposed at what had passed that afternoon, appeared more gay and pleasant then ordinary, in hopes that way to make his jealous Wife leave off her custom of following him into all places; and knowing the design which brought her into the house where he was that afternoon, he seem'd to remember nothing of what had past that day before his face between her and Argantes: but on the contrary, Clidimira (far from imitating him) received him very coldly, and having much
ado to contain herself, was every minute upon the point of break∣ing out into a furious rage, her anger being raised to the height, when she saw so little concern in Timanders carriage; and instead of the jealousie she hoped for, saw so much pleasantness in his looks: but hoping for some effects from him, and the resolution she had taken to make him jealous, she went on, Fortune being yet on her side. Some few days after that, knowing that Timander was gone into the Publick Walks, with the same Ladies that were in his com∣pany the day before, Clidimira followed him thither immediate∣ly, having none with her but Ar∣gantes, and one of her waiting-Women;
and seeing Timander at a good distance from her, she made two or three turns about the Walks, and left her Woman with a charge not to follow her into the Walk, where she saw her Hus∣band conversing with those La∣dies; she past all alone with Ar∣gantes near the place where her Husband and those Ladies were at that time very pleasantly en∣tertained by a Lady of a very merry humour, which infinitely diverted the Company, who gave her leave to say what she pleased without contradiction from any body, though she rallied them all She seeing Argantes pass by with Timanders Wife, she told him ve∣ry pleasantly, that she never saw so handsome, well shap'd, and so
Gallant a Man as that person was, that was alone walking with his Wife, and was the day before in her company at the Treating-house. Timander knowing well enough that this Lady and all the company had a mind to rally him, took no notice of it, and answer∣ed merrily, that he had given his Wife a charge to make choice of no Gallant but one that was handsome, witty, and of a good Meen; and that now he was ex∣treamly pleased to see she had so much wit as to make so good a choice. Timander had a hundred pleasant things upon that subject whilst the Company stay'd there, reparting very wittily to the ralle∣ry of that Lady that had so long play'd upon him and the rest of
the Company; but as soon as he returned home he began to re∣flect upon all the passages of those two days past between his Wife and Argantes before his face, and adding to this reflecti∣on her having not complain'd of himself now as heretofore, though he had given her more cause to be jealous: all these things made him conclude that his Wife was really in Love with Argantes, and then he was convinc'd that (al∣though he had resolved never to be jealous) there was none could resist that Passion, and any man might fall into it whether he would or no, and that how little soever a Husband might care for his Wife, yet the spight and in∣dignation of seeing himself ralli∣ed
by the world, inspires often a more furious Jealousie then that which proceeds from the fear of losing what one loves, or seeing another have a share in that which a man ought to possess alone. When this Forc'd Jealous man was come home, he could not hide his resentments from his wife, who did not fail to give him a return sharp enough upon the same subject, in his own Lan∣guage, though with much more noise; but at last they reconcil'd themselves with reciprocal pro∣mises of giving no more cause of Jealousie to each other. The Ca∣resses and renewed Protestations of Love which usually attend those reconcilements between a Husband and his Wife, were not
wanting at that time, and Ti∣mander from that hour staid much oftner at home with her then he had ever yet done. Thus Clidi∣mira's wishes were accomplish'd, and she did not at all repent (as yet) the having made her Hus∣band jealous, still resolving to reclaim him this way as often as he returned to his old courses: but as it is no easie matter to change inclinations, or to alter an old habitual custom of life, whatever resolution any man may make, none is so much master of himself to do it; for the reformed Ti∣mander quickly returned to his old ways, not being able to re∣strain himself any longer; which Clidimira observing, made no more fruitless complaints as here∣tofore,
but betook her self to her new found-out way of re∣claiming him. She was in these thoughts when Timander came to tell her he had earnest business into the Country for some few days; Clidimira at another time would not have re∣frained her tears and a thousand prayers to divert him from going away, or to importune him for a speedy return to her; but the re∣solution she had taken, hindered her sorrows from appearing, and she perswaded her Husband in∣stead of seeking to divert him from this journey. Timander was scarce got out of Town, when Clidimira went to visit one of her Kindred who lo∣ved her exceedingly; she was no
sooner entered that House, but those Tears which she forc'd her self to keep in (before her Hus∣band) burst out very passionate∣ly, her Face expressing all the signs of a violent grief for the ab∣sence of Timander, who she fear'd was gone into the Countrey for no other end but to divert him∣self in some other Conversation which was more delightful to him then hers. Her Kinswoman seeing her in that deplorable con∣dition, used all her art to comfort Clidimira, perswading her at last to remain with her till her Hus∣band came home, which he did eight days after, his journey ha∣ving only been for Divertisment, as Clidimira imagined; when she heard he was returned, she made
haste home to meet him, carrying Argantes with her, in hopes to re∣kindle her Husbands jealousie, which design took effect. Ti∣mander grew very angry, Clidi∣mira did so too, and though he had made this appointment of go∣ing into the Countrey so private∣ly, that none knew of it, and pre∣tended to ride Post to disguise his designs from Clidimira; yet she spoke to him with that cunning, that he apprehended she knew all the passages of that journey of Pleasure, which put Timander ex∣treamly out of countenance, and obliged him to hasten that mi∣nute the peace with her, that is as easie to be concluded between a Man and his Wife, as it is difficult between great Princes.
Although to go about the ma∣king a Husband jealous, is an en∣terprise that must be Fatal to all those Women that undertake it; yet Clidimira prospered so well hitherto in that attempt, that she never gave her Husband any cause to be jealous of her, but when she had most reason to complain of him: but as many things hap∣pen un-fore-seen, let us now see whether the way which she takes to change her Husbands humour, will always be so advantagious to her. Timander after this last recon∣cilement with his Wife, appeared very much reformed, as he did the time before, and stayed much at home with his Wife; but yet he was not altogether so kind to her,
nor did he caress Clidimira with so great a Fondness as his former repentance expressed; so that she now began to think him jealous in earnest, believing he staid at home only to watch her actions, which was to her a great satisfa∣ction (though mingled with some fear) for her humour was such, that she chose rather to be ill used by her Husband, then to see him go abroad, which yet he loved too well to forbear any longer, and growing weary of staying at home, and acting against his Incli∣nations, he resolved to be his Wives Goaler no longer. As long as Timander's humour of staying at home continued, Clidimira had desired Argantes not to visit her more, or speak to her
in any place where he saw her; but as soon as ever her Husband re-took his old customs, she writ to Argantes to visit her as former∣ly, who failed not to obey her, and oftner then he was wont; and as he had his designs as well as Clidimira had hers, he avoided the sight of Timander, which this ver∣tuous Lady having observed, she told him one day that she had ta∣ken notice of his actions, and therefore desired him since he had undertaken to oblige her, that he would do it without inte∣rest, and ground no fruitless hopes upon the mis-understand∣ing that hapned sometimes be∣tween her Husband and her self, or else never to see her more. Argantes knew very well that the
care he had lately taken to avoid her Husband, besides those other signs of Love he had too foolish∣ly expressed, was the occasion of her speaking to him in that man∣ner, and therefore he resolved upon obeying her, rather than lose his hopes, which he now commits to Fortune; and in those visits he made her, took no care as formerly to avoid the sight of Ti∣mander, or expressing his grow∣ing passion in those ways which Clidimira did not approve; to pre∣vent the regret that he might one day have for not having all things in his power to assist his good for∣tune, he resolved to make Clidi∣mira some considerable Present, and having some loose Diamonds in his Cabinet, he carried them to
a Jeweller of his acquaintance, and desired him to adde some of his own to those, and make a hand∣some pair of Bracelets: In the mean time he continued his fre∣quent visits to the Wife of Timan∣der, who acted a part at that time that astonished all the world; for the oftner Argantes visited his Wife, the less he seemed to take notice of it, used him very civilly, and diverted himself as at other times, speaking to Clidimira with as much seeming indifferency, as if there never had been such a person as Argantes in the world. This made Clidimira desperate, because she knew not what to do next to make her Husband jea∣lous, being ignorant that he was now more jealous then ever, and
carried himself so indifferently, only to find out what he had a desire to know more clearly. Cli∣dimira in the mean time made Argantes visit her at all hours, morning, night, &c. whispered to him even before her Husband as she did before, who still seem'd to take no notice of it at all; and if things had continued longer at this pass, she would have loudly quarrell'd her Husband for not falling out with her; which ne∣vertheless he resolved to do, ma∣king use of his patience only to find out the certainty of his Wife's Love to Argantes by more visible signs, which he intended to punish severely in his own time, which perhaps would have been a great while a coming; for if
Fortune (that is sometimes trea∣cherous and wicked) had not gi∣ven him an opportunity of decla∣ring his resentments, he might have waited long enough for a day of venting his Passion, Clidi∣mira being too vertuous to do any thing directly against her ho∣nour, though her indiscretion was great in all those just causes of Complaint she gave her husband. Behold now how Fortune render∣ed her at last the most unhappy person alive, and although it may be said, she was partly the cause of it her self hitherto, yet it is as true, that she contributed nothing to the conclusion of her part in this History, as you shall find in the following relation. As Timander was going out one
day in one of his Chagrin hu∣mours, he was call'd in passing by a Jewellers house, by a person that had sold him formerly many fine rarities, who told him he had fill'd his Shop with many Curiosi∣ties (since he had been there) which he knew would please him very much. Timander going in, and having viewed all the rare pieces of work in that place, he at last cast his eye upon one of the Jewellers men that was at work upon a very fine pair of diamond bracelets; he asking whose they were, they told him they were be∣spoke by a Gentleman that dwelt hard by his house, whose name was Argantes; Timander having ask'd when they would be finish∣ed, and they telling him the next
day, he made no more questions, for he presently suspected they were for Clidimira, but went a∣way, fancying that if he could find out that, he should quickly discover all the whole Intrigue between Argantes and his Wife. The next day Argantes recei∣ving the Bracelets from the Jew∣eller, studied some time what he was to do, and which way he should present them where he in∣tended, and at last resolved to write to Clidimira, and accompa∣ny the declaration of his Love with so rich a Present; the rea∣sons were very many that put him upon that course, he saw that Timander suffered him every day at his house, without expressing the least signs of jealousie, and
that he went on still in that care∣less way; that Clidimira shewed more resentment then ever against the indifferency of her Husband, even beginning to hate that un∣faithful man: besides all these considerations, Argantes looked upon this present as considerable enough to open the eyes of any woman, and began to think that the ill treatment she formerly gave to the declarations of his Love, was perhaps because he made his addresses with empty hands. All these thoughts moved him to write to Clidimira, to tell her he loved her, and with that Letter to send his Present, hoping that although Clidimira should abso∣lutely refuse to hearken to his Love, yet the greatness of that
Present would prevent his ba∣nishment, not caring for any thing so he might declare his Passi∣on; nor feared he any thing more then her banishing him her house, hoping from Time, his Passion, and Wit, and those other qualifi∣cations he discovered in himself, to obtain her at last, as many young men of this Age foolishly perswade themselves into a belief that no Beauty how great soever can resist their Charms, or defend themselves from falling into those snares which their wits lay to catch them: And thus Argantes built his hopes, holding it for a certain rule, that those places which appear so well fortified, and hang a flag of defiance to the Besiegers to frighten them with a
belief of their great strength and obstinate resistance, are often seen to render sooner then is imagined. And having thus strengthned his resolutions, he presently writ a Letter, which with the Bracelets he intended to carry himself, and putting them into his Pocket, he went that afternoon to visit Clidi∣mira, in whose Chamber he had observed a day or two before, there stood a little Box, with the Key always in it; and having seen Clidimira lay in that Box some Bracelets of her own Hair, and which she had wrought on∣ly for her Divertisement, Argan∣tes resolved to steal out those, in exchange of his Diamond Brace∣lets; which he easily could do, Cli∣dimira not using him with much
Ceremony; for since he was by his frequent visits so familiar in the house, she often left him alone in her Chamber, whilst she went about her Domestick affairs: yet that afternoon he waited long for an opportunity of acting his de∣sign, but at last she going as far as the stairs to speak to one that brought her a message, which was not very quickly delivered, Argantes had an opportunity of putting his Letter and Bracelets into the Box, and taking out the Bracelets of Hair, he crammed them hastily into the first bit of Paper he found in his Pocket, and went away immediately after, as much satisfied as if he had found great Treasure, though for his Diamonds he carried away no∣thing
but Hairs: which above all things shews the extravagancy of Lovers. Argantes that was the most con∣tented Man in the world in being thus rid of his Diamonds, was no sooner gone out of Clidimira's Chamber, then Timander (who had in design waited all this while in his Closet) entered the room, in hopes to discover something of that which he as yet did but sus∣pect, and with an air mingled with scorn and anger, he asked Clidimira to shew him the Brace∣lets that Argantes had newly gi∣ven her; she answered with much assurance, that she did not know what he meant by that question; for Argantes nor no other Man had never yet made her any Pre∣sents:
in saying that, she remem∣bred that she had laid those Brace∣lets of Hair in that little Box which stood open, and fearing that if her Husband searching there should come to see them, and fancy she made them for some Gallant, though she only wrought them to divert her self, she went to take them out, which it seems she could not do without being perceived by Timander, whose Eyes were every where at that time, and who stepping towards his Wife, snatched the Paper from her as she was conveying it into her Pocket; and unfolding it ha∣stily, he pulled out those Brace∣lets of Diamonds, to the amaze∣ment of Clidimira, who knew or thought of nothing more then the
seeing those Bracelets of her Hair which she had laid up in that place; but whilst she was struck with wonder, Timander read these words; To the Fair Clidimira. Although I here present you with Bracelets of Diamonds in∣stead of those of Hair which I have taken away, yet think not Fair Clidimira, that I believe mine more considerable then these wrought by your fair hands, which I confess are unvaluable; and if I would here make use of those Complements that are usually made, even to those Women that are infinitely below you in all things, I might here tell you, that
these Diamonds have not so great a Lustre as those of your Eyes; but alas! how Fatal is that Lustre of theirs to all that look upon them? and though the sparkling light of these Diamonds causes them to be admired, yet the daz∣ling Splendour of your fair Eyes commands Adoration from all those that look upon them; and we may behold the one without trembling, yet none can look up∣on on the other without fear; if the one shines and does not burn, yet the other shines and burns at once; if the one rejoyces the sight without enflaming the Soul, yet the other never appears with∣out piercing the very heart which it enflames, and causes a Rebelli∣on in all the Senses: but since it
is impossible for me to hinder this effect, who find as much difficulty in captivating your Heart, as it self does find little in rendring mine your Slave, I have never∣theless the confidence to believe I may revenge my self upon your fair Arms by giving them those Letters, which if I am so happy to see them carry, I may well boast the good Fortune of enchaining what is most lovely in the uni∣verse, and perhaps of softning what is most cruel in all the world; but to make me thus Fortunate, you must shew for the future as much pity as you have hitherto expressed goodness to Argantes.
I am very glad Madam, said Ti∣mander to his Wife in a rallying tone, to find by this Letter how much goodness you have shewed to Argantes: It is long since I be∣gan to believe it, though I never was so certainly informed of it as now by his own hand; you are obliged to continue your favours to him, he is very acknowledging, as these Presents he makes you sufficiently testifie; and these Bracelets are so dazling and so rich, that there is no heart so hard which they would not perswade to Love, especially when they come to speak for so Gallant a Man as Argantes. I know not, re∣plyed Clidimira, what reason you have to say these things to me, who am very ignorant from
whence these Bracelets come, nor did I ever see the Letter you have read. I see very well, answered Timander, that you Love the per∣son that writ it so extreamly, that you are never weary of it, and make these pretences of having never seen it, only to hear it read once more; which I will do to please you, because I Love you better then perhaps you think I do; with that Timander read the Letter aloud, to which Clidimira hearkned very attentively, making very many protestations of her Innocence, telling her Husband that she was confident that Ar∣gantes had put a trick upon her, conveying these things unto her Box some time or other when she was gone out of her Chamber,
which was true enough; but truth signified nothing at that time, her mis-fortune being above her in∣nocence, all she said to prove it was to no purpose, appearances being all against her, and so sad was her condition, that Timan∣ders snatching the Paper out of her hand, which she so innocently attempted to steal, only to pre∣vent a crime, not knowing there was so great a one committed in that place, and Argantes treache∣rous exchange of the Bracelets, and all things what-ever that seemed most to justifie her, made against her; and Timander, though his amazement gave him time to harken a little to her justificati∣ons, yet at last quitted that cold∣ness with which he had begun, and
grew extreamly passionate, telling his Wife she could not deny that Argantes had those Bracelets of Hair, for he had writ it there with his own Hand; and that he had given her those of Diamonds was as clear, for he had snatched them himself from her, as she was steal∣ing them out of the Box to con∣vey them from his knowledge; he told her, certainly no person was ever known to bestow Brace∣lets of Hair without some inclina∣tions to those to whom they gave them; nor was there any body ever known to receive Presents of such a value as those Diamond Bracelets were, without an inten∣tion of being acknowledging for such a favour; nor was there any Man so foolish to be at the charge
of making such a Present, without proposing to himself a certainty of accomplishing his design. In fine, he repeated to Clidimira all the reasons he had to be jealous, not omitting the least of obser∣vations he had made since the first day he saw her in the company of Argantes; but all his Passio∣nate discourses troubled not Cli∣dimira half so much as the trick Argantes had put upon her, who was more displeased at his bold declaration of Love, then at all the reproaches her Husbands jea∣lousie could make to her; and being at her Wits end between these two Men, and having a strange desire to quarrel Ar∣gantes, she desir'd her Husbands leave to write to him to come thi∣ther,
that she might justifie her self by his Confession; to which Timander having given consent, she presently writ these words; To Argantes. What business soever you have at this time, yet you must come to me immediately after you receive this Note. Clidimira. As soon as she had ended this Note, she assured Timander that he should be convinc'd of her innocence very suddenly, for she knew Argantes would not have the impudence to affirm that she
had ever given him any Bracelets of her Hair, or received any of Diamonds from him. But this Husband thus forc'd to be jea∣lous, studying a little while up∣on all these things, began to think that this was not the right way to know the truth of this matter, and being well acquainted with the greatness of Argantes Wit, he was certain that Lover would want no Politick excuses to clear himself, and justifie his Mistress; and this thought raising his anger at them both, carried him out immediately (from the presence of Clidimira, whom now he bated to look upon) and going hastily down the stairs, with resolutions fatal to them both, he went out to find Argantes, who as (ill luck
would have it) had newly re∣ceived the Note from Clidimira, and was going to know her com∣mands, when Timander met him in the Street very near the Gate of his House, which stood in a remote corner of the Town, where very few people had oc∣casion to pass; and therefore Ti∣mander had opportunity enough to act his design, who as soon as he saw Argantes, drew upon him. Arganies received him like a va∣liant Man, but they had not time to Fight very long; for Clidi∣mira who had observed her Hus∣bands threatning looks as he went from her, and had watched his actions at the Window, made some noise, and commanded the Servants to run after their Ma∣ster,
who with the assistance of the Neighbours that had heard the noise she made, run to part them; but Argantes who had a very great care of the reputa∣tion of Clidimira, and knew that his pretended Amours to her had been long the discourse of that Neighbour-hood, fled a∣way before any of them could know him; but in flying from them he gave Timander the lei∣sure to take up a Paper, which it seems he had dropt in taking out his Handkerchief, when Timander drew upon him so ha∣stily. The curiosity Timander had to read this Paper was so great, that he very hastily dismissed the Company that were busie
about him, and scarce affording the kind Neighbours a civil ac∣knowledgment for their con∣cern of him, he desired them to go home, telling them it was nothing; and so impatiently be∣gan to read what he had so un∣luckily found. Admire now what Mis-for∣tune will do when it once be∣gins to persecute any Person. Timander had no sooner opened this Paper, then he saw it was his Wife's hand, and those Brace∣lets of her Hair wrapt up in it with these words.
To Argantes. I desire impatiently to see you, to tell you that Timander is not Jealous, which I hope will ob∣lige you to make haste; and if you have the same goodness for me you have so often expressed, it will bring you hither presently, that we may consult upon what we have to do. Clidimira.
Whilst Timander is musing upon this Letter, let us read the occasion of it. Clidimira (as we have already seen) having by her cunning, and the jealousie with which she possest her Hus∣band, forc'd this unconstant Man often to change his course of life; yet he as quickly re∣laps'd again, and Clidimira as often tryed her enperiment of reclaiming him, by the jealousie she gave him of her love to Ar∣gantes, to whom she had writ this Letter in one of those Me∣lancholy humours, desiring the Counsels of Argantes, which had hitherto been so Fortunate to her in that design. Argantes had by chance kept this Letter
in his Pocket, and that  day he exchanged the Brace∣lets, his haste (for fear of being prevented or seen by those he heard coming into Clidimira's Chamber) made him wrap the Bracelets of Hair in the first Pa∣per he found about him, which (as ill fortune would have it) prov'd to be Clidimira's Letter; who sending for him so sudden∣ly for her justification to Ti∣mander, he had no time either to look upon the Bracelets, or consider what Paper they were wrapt in. Timander having read this Letter, appeared very calm, and without passion, told Clidimira he had now all that he desired, and was so well satisfi∣ed
as to her, that he wished no more. The next day he sent for her nearest Kindred, and re∣lated to them all that had passed, desiring to resign her into their Hands, he being resolved to be troubled with her no longer. Clidimira seeing her self in that straight, discovered (in hopes to justifie her self) all the Strata∣gems she had to force her Hus∣band to be jealous, producing amongst other things that Paper, Intituled, The good Fortune of Women that have Jealous Hus∣bands; which Argantes had writ at her desire. But Timan∣der made it quickly appear, that this Paper which she brought for her justification, was a certain
proof against her; and that Argantes pretending to oblige her, had like an expert Gallant contrived and continued, as much as he could possible, the division between the Husband and the Wife; his design be∣ing only to insinuate himself by degrees into the favour of the Wife, though at first he seems to aim at nothing more then the reconciling her to her Husband, though he intends nothing less, which he plainly discovers in that Piece, called, The good Fortune of Women, &c. Where he perswades the Women to make their Husbands jealous, possessing them with those great advantages and considerable
Presents those Wives might re∣ceive from that jealousie, if they would make the right use of it: wherein he does not answer Clidimira's intentions expressed in the desire she made to him for it; for instead of placing all those great advantages in the reconcilement of a Husband to his Wife, he brings them in as received during the time of his jealousie, and from other per∣sons besides the Husband. Timander having descanted much upon this Paper which Clidimira brought to justifie her self, to no more purpose then all the rest she could say at that time for her self; he was resolved to talk no more, but
now to act in good earnest what he had resolved upon; and therefore he declared to the Company, that although he al∣ways had esteemed Clidimira too much to believe she had an ill design at first, but from what had followed, he plainly saw that she had not strength e∣nough to defend her self from surprize, and in conclusion had suffered her self to be won; of which truth these Proofs he had given them were so convincing to him, that nothing could de∣stroy, and he desired no more, being throughly satisfied of all. Her afflicted Kindred confessed she was too guilty in appearance, and that they saw no excuse for her; and so although Argantes
lost his design upon Clidimira's Virtue, yet he ruin'd her Repu∣tation for ever; which let's us see, that all those Women who too often receive the visits from sus∣pected Persons, expose them∣selves not only to the like dan∣ger, but also to that of being betrayed into greater inconve∣niencies; and if these cross ac∣cidents had not hapned, who knows whether Clidimira's Vir∣tue would have been strong enough to have held out to the last, although she was one of the most Virtuous Women of her time; yet that Virtue not being guarded by Discretion, she was at last so unhappy as to lose her Husband, and to be treated like a Criminal by her Kindred,
who ought to have protected her, and yet were the first to condemne her. They never∣theless desired Timander to per∣mit her to live in his House, without allowing her liberty to converse with any, which he upon that condition consented to; from that hour confining her, not in fear of her being Courted, for he was not of a jealous Nature, only lock'd her up safe from troubling his Di∣vertisements; having done all this for no other end, but to deliver himself from the cla∣mours of report caus'd by the jealousie of his Wife, which heretofore troubled him in all places. After the patching up this
Breach between Timander and his Wife, the Kindred of this innocent unfortunate Person sought after Argantes to revenge the injury he had offered to their Family; Timander also made search for him, but he was not to be found, his Father ha∣ving conveyed him away far in∣to the Countrey, to avoid these violent Pursuers, and great num∣ber of Enemies that threatned him. Clidimira dyed with sor∣row two or three years after, teaching all Wives (to her cost) that they must never force their Husbands to be jealous; for Patience abused turns into Fury, and the gentlest persons are the most difficult to appease when once provoked to the height;
and though they are a great while silent to injuries, yet if once their anger break forth, it is most terrible and fatal to those that provoke it, especially if it is inflamed by the sense of ho∣nour. And therefore who ever will be happy, let them not meddle with that dangerous Serpent Jealousie, which though some have placed in the num∣ber of remedies, yet it is worse then any Disease, and a Mor∣tal danger to all those that have made use of it, as experience has sufficiently proved in all Ages, as well as in this Paper. FINIS.
