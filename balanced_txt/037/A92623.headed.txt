THE ADDRESS TO THE KING. The Humble Representation of the Lords and Commissioners of Shires and Burroughs of the Kingdom of Scotland, Ʋndersubscribers, and Members of this Current Parliament now Adjourned till the Eighth of October next. NOthing save the great and general Surprise of this long distressed and at present unsettled Kingdom, upon the late Adjournment of Your most Loyal Parliament for so long a time, and in so critical a season, with the deep Concern of Your Royal Interest therein, could possibly have induced us to this so necessary a Petition. But the visible Consternation and Discouragement of thousands of Your good Subjects, delayed in the Relief and Comfort which at this time they assuredly expected, with the Advantages that We apprehend Your Majesties Enemies, both within and without the Kingdom, may think to reap by such an Interruption, being our only Motives, We cannot, We dare not be silent. And therefore to prevent these evil Consequences, We in the first place most Solemnly Pro∣test and Declare, in the Presence of God and Men, Our constant and invio∣lable Fidelity and Adherence to Your Majesties Royal Title, Right and Interest, so frankly and chearfully recognosced by Us in this Current Parlia∣ment, wishing and praying for nothing more under the Sun than Your long and prosperous Reign, as that wherein the Security of all our Lives and Liberties, and also of our Holy Religion, more dear to Us than both, is infallibly included. It was the persuasion we had of the Justice, as well as well as the Necessity, of Your Majesties Heroic Undertaking for the Delivery of these Kingdoms, with the Conviction of the Divine Confir∣mation that appeared in its glorious Success, that moved most, if not all of Us, to endeavour and concur most heartily in the late Meeting of Estates, for the Advancement and Establishment of Your Majesty upon the Throne, when some discovered their Disaffection, and were too open Retarders and Obstructers of that good Design: And it is from the same true Affection and Zeal, that we do now most heartily make the above mentioned Pro∣testation, to obviate all the Misconstructions Your Enemies may make in this Juncture. Nor are we less assured of Your Majesties most sincere and gracious In∣tentions, to perform for Us to the utmost, all that the Estates of the King∣dom have either demanded, or represented as necessary and expedient for
securing the Protestant Religion, restoring their Laws and Liberties, and redressing of their Grievances, according to Your Majesties Declaration for this Kingdom. Neither can it be imagined, that so wise and just a King as Your Majesty, will ever be perswaded, that so Loyal a Parliament as this, can he induced either to wish or design any Prejudice to, or Diminu∣tion of Your true Interest and Prerogative; but such as have slavishly served and flattered Arbitrary Power and Tyranny, will be always studying for their own sinister Ends, to state a separate Interest betwixt King and People, a Practice which we are confident your Majesty abhors. But that we may clear our selves upon this present occasion to Your Ma∣jesties full satisfaction, and refuting of all Misrepresentations we can incur on any hand, we shall briefly rehearse to Your Majesty, the Votes pass'd in this present Parliament, to which the Royal Assent is not given, with such short Reflections, as we hope may tend to the better Vindication of all con∣cern'd. The First Act upon which the Vote of Parliament has pass'd, is that, De∣claring the Priviledge of the Estates of Parliament to Nominate and Appoint Committees, as they shall think fit; and excluding therefrom the Officers of State, unless they be chosen: And omitting what the Parliament hath al∣ready represented to Your Majesty as reasons of their Vote; it is humbly conceived, that this Act is exactly framed to the extent of that Grievance, which together with the rest, is desired in the Instrument of Government, to be redressed unto us in Parliament. The Second was an Act Abrogating the Act of Parliament 1669. asserting the King's Supremacy over all Persons, and in all Causes Ecclesiastical; and this Act is so exactly conform to the Second Article of the abovementioned Grievances; and the foresaid Act of Supremacy in it self is so dangerous to the Protestant Religion, as well as inconsistent with the Establishment of any Church-Government, that we doubt not Your Majesty will ever ap∣prove all that voted to it. The Third, is an Act anent Persons not to be employed in publick Trusts; and all the Ruins and Destresses of this Kingdom, have so certainly flowed fro the Persons therein noted, especially, such as by their contriving of, and concurring in the Dispensing Power, have thereby eminently indangered our Religion, and overturned all the Fences of our Liberties and Properties (which we have good ground to believe the Parliament would have exten∣ded but to few Persons) And Your Majesty in Your Declaration, hath so justly charged the same upon evil and wicked Counsellors (the only Persons pointed at in this Act) that We are perswaded that You will find it absolut∣ly necessary for attaining all the Ends of Your Majesties glorious undertak∣in for our Relief.
The Fourth is an Act concerning the Nomination of the ordinary Lords of Session, and the Election of the President, To wit, that in a total Vacation they by tryed, and admitted or rejected by Parliament, and in a particular Va∣cation they be tryed aed admitted, or rejected by the other Lords: And that the President be choosen by the Lords themselves, conform to our old Pra∣ctique and express Statute. And this Act is so agree able to Practique Laws and Acts of Parliament, and so necessar for the true and equal administra∣tion of Justice (the great security of all Kingdoms) that Your Majesty will unquestionably approve it. The Fifth and last is an Act Ordaining the Presbyterian Ministers yet alive, who were thrust out since the First of January 1661, for not Conforming to Prelacy, and not complying with the Courses of the Time, to be restored. And this Act is in it self so just and so consequential from the Claim of Right, and agreeable to Your Majesties Declaration, that less in common Equity could not be done. And here Your Majesty may be pleased to con∣sider, That tho Prelacy be now by Law abolished, yet these few Ministers not exceeding Sixty (tho restored, as they are not, for want of the Royal Assent to the foresaid Act, would be all the Presbyterian Ministers le∣gally established and provided for in Scotland. It is not unknown to Your Majesty what have been the sad Confusions and Disorders of this distressed Country under Prelacy, and for want of its an∣cient Presbyterian Government; and now the whole West,, and many o∣ther Parts of Scotland, are at present desolate and destitute, having only Mi∣nisters called by the People upon the late Liberty, without any Benefice or Living, or convenient place to Preach in. It is also certain, that there are many Hundreds of forefaulted and fined Persons who are yet waiting to be restored and refounded, according to the Claim of Right, and Your Ma∣jesties gracious Instructions thereanent. It is true, the last Thing proposed by Your Majesties Commissioner in Parliament, was a Supply of Money for Maintenance of the Forces so neces∣sary for our present Defence; and We should have proven our selves ungrateful to Your Majesty, and false to our own Interest and Security, if We had absolutely refused it: but there being a sufficient and certain Food to main∣tain all the Forces, and support all other incident Charges of the Govern∣ment for some Months; all that we demanded was, That some things vi∣sibly necessar for Satisfaction of the Country, and the better enabling and and disposing them to pay the said Supply, might be first expeded. We are confident that the Vote of Parliament, which was only for a short De∣lay, will not give your Majesty the least ground of Offence. And now having presumed to lay these Things before Your Majesty with all humble Submission, purely out of Duty for preventing the evil Con∣structions of Your Majesties Enemies, and for our own just Vindication;
We humbly beseech Your Sacred Majesty graciously to consider what is here represented; and in Prosecution of Your Majesties Acceptance of the Claim of Right, and Your Declaration emitted for this Kingdom, to take such Courses as You in Your Royal Wisdom shall think fit, for Passing the foresaid Acts of Parliament, and redressing all our other Grievances. And We Your Majesties most humble Petitioners and faithful Subjects, shall, as in Duty bound, ever Pray for Your long and prosperous Reign ever Us▪ FINIS.
