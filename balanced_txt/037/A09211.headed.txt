REVERENDISSIMO IN Christo patri Domino Iohanni Londinensi Episcopo vigi∣lantissimo.
QVm vt inquit Apostolus, reuerendissime Pater, non sublimitate sermonis vel sapientiae annuntiandum est Dei te∣stimonium, nec persuasorijs huma∣nae sapientiae sermonibus praedican∣dum, sed spiritus & potentiae de∣monstratione: id est probatione, quae fit certis & necessarijs rationibus, Iesum Christū & hunc crucifixum, in infirmitate, in timore, & tre∣more multo agnoscere simulac pro∣fiteri oportet. Magnopere me haec atque his similia indesinenter ani∣mo inuoluere conducunt, quonam modo hac nostra aetate rudiores (qui quidem verba proferre, sed non intelligere possunt) Iesu Christi mortem aliáque quae ad huius vitae  normam, & ad futurā immortalita∣tem magnopere cōducunt, intelli∣gerent. Simplici igitur modo, atta∣men in Dei timore ad simpliciū in∣formationē edificationém{que} princi∣palia quidem ac etiam particularia, tum fidei, tū Decalogi, orationis{que} dominicae parte mēbrá{que} breuiter componere statui. Vestro igitur stu¦dio magná{que} Dei Ecclesiae cura co∣gnitis ac diuulgatis: ita vehemētius tuae reuerentiae has meas perpauas Questionum & Respontionū anno∣tationes dedicare, sub{que} tui honoris nomine promulgare, me (quasi cal∣caribus indigentem) stimulauêre. Hanc a tuo Honore meam industri¦am quamuis minutissimā, acceptá fore sperans ad Dei misericordiam, gratiam, pacém{que} qui omnium es Creator, Gubernator, ac conserua¦tor, Honorem tuum precibus mei commendo. Tui honoris obseruantissimus, Thomas Pearston.

In answering for thée, what professi∣on did they make? A. That I should be brought vp in the feare of God, and so serue him. Q. Why was thy name giuen thée? A. Because I should alwaies remem∣ber when I am called by my name, that I was christened to bee Christes
member, Gods childe, and an heire of heauen: Q. Is it enough to acknowledge this? A. No. except wee endeuour to come thereto. Q. Thou saidest that thy sureties did professe that thou shouldest be brought vp in the feare of God, and serue him: which is the way to serue him? A. In obaying his commandements. Q. Which is the way to bring vp one in the feare of God? A. To teach them to knowe Iesus Christ. Q. What is Iesus Christ? A. The end of the law. Q. How must Iesus Christ be known? A. By faith. Q. How can one belieue the Artickles of faith, hath he power of him selfe to belieue them, and all things contained in them? A. No verely, for of our selues wee can not doe any thing. Q. How so? whence haue we this faith then? A. From heauen, it is Gods gift, and
not our disposition. Q. Séeing thou sayest this gift of faith doth come from heauen, and that it is Gods. Tell me how we might get vs this faith. A. By hearing Gods word preached. Q. Is it enough to heare Gods worde to be preached, and so to goe our way? A. We must both heare it and kéepe it. Q. How many things doth Gods word teach vs? A.

So, then I perceiue thou doest con∣fesse it to be Gods word? A. Yea that doe I. Q. VVhat doest thou gather in those wordes? I am the Lord. A. By this word, Lord, I gather that he is of power to punish the offenders. Q. What comfort haue wee in these? which brought thée out of the lande of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. A. I gather this comfort, that God is the deliuerer of me and all the faithfull from hell, as he deliuered Israel from Egypt. Q. What doest thou learne by this commandement? Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me. A. I learne hereby to reioyce onely in the Lorde God, and to rest in him one∣lye.
Q. What shall we say of those that trust  in Saintes and Angels, and make them as interecessors to God for them? doe they fulfill this commandement? A. They can not. Q. How so? A. Because they rest not onely in Iesus Christ. Q. In the second commandement why doth God forbid the making of Ima∣ges, and the likenesse of any other thing? A. Because they dishonour him. Q.

I am commanded reuerently to vse the name of God, in all my doings that I goe about. Q. What are you forbidden to doe? A. All swearing, cursing and banning of any thing that he hath made. Q.

In hearing & learning the holy word of God. Q. It is apparant that in this fourth cō∣mandement is expressed to kinds of la∣bour, the one of the bodie, the other of the minde, the one earthly the other heauenly, are both these labours forbid∣den in this commandement? A. No, but the one. Q. VVhich is forbidden?
A. The bodely labour. Q. Then thou confessest that the spiritu∣all & heauenly labour ought to be done: what should wee séeke for in this hea∣uenly labour? A. The kingdom of heauen and the righ∣teousnesse thereof. Q. What shall we say of those that will not come at the Church to learne the way to heauen and to vnderstande the right pointes of Gods lawe? A. Such regarde not Gods commande∣ment. Q. In the fift cōmandement what mea∣neth this word honor? A. To honour, is to obey, feare, relieue and serue. Q. What meaneth this worde? father and mother. A. By father and mother I vnderstande all that haue any office or authoritie o∣uer vs. Q. As how for example?
A. As the Prince ouer the people, the maiestrates ouer the places where they rule, the ministers ouer their charge or parish, the maisters and dames ouer  their seruants, fathers and mothers o∣uer their children. Q. Doest thou hereby acknowledge that those that are ouer others, should teach them that are vnder them? A. They ought to learne Gods word to ye end they might teach others ye same. Q. Ought not the subiects, townesmen, seruants, and children to be diligent in learning of Gods word? A. Yea, if not, they disobey Gods com∣mandemet. Q. VVhy is the promise of long life ad∣ded to this commandement? A. To encourage vs vnto the better per∣formance of our dutie in obeying. Q. In this sixt commaundement, Thou shalt doe no murther, doth God onely forbid the outward act of murther, and not also the consent vnto murther? A. Yea, he forbiddeth the consent vnto murther. Q. Doth it forbid nothing else? A. It also forbiddeth vs anger & malice. Q. What doe those that reuile, mocke & despise others be they neuer so simple? A. Such doe also against this comman∣dement.
Q. What say you of pride, surfetting and dronkennes, whether be they murther or not? A. They be ye greatest kind of murther. Q. How so? A. Because they hurt the soule and doe great dishonor to God which made vs to set forth his glorie. Q. In the vij. commandement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, what doth the Lord require at our hands? A. To kéepe our bodies as fit vessels for the holy Ghost to dwell in. Q. Doth he only forbid the outward fact of whoredome and adulterie? A. He forbiddeth vs the very thought and enticement to such lewdnes, as well as the outward fact. Q. What meaneth this eight comman∣dement, Thou shalt not steale. A. That I should refraine from hurting any, by taking from them that which is theires. Q. Doth this worde steale signify no∣thing but taking away and robbing? A. Yea: if I kéepe from another that
which he hath laboured for, I steale be∣cause I giue him not his duetie. Q. What are we commanded? A. To liue a contented life. Q. What shal we say of those that kéepe the knowledge of Gods worde from the simple and ignorant, which Christ would haue to be taught? A. Such also steale, because they doe withhold the truth. Ioh. 10. 10. Q. What art thou taught by this ninth commandement, Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour? A. I am taught to speake nothing but truth, neither for the loue nor hatred of any. Q. What doe you say of lyers, slaunde∣rers, and such as are busie bodies, med∣ling of such thinges as they haue no∣thing to do withall. A. Such regarde not this law of God. Q. What is this tenth commandement, Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house, wife, goodes, seruant, nor any thing els which is his? A. It is a bridle vnto my minde. Q. What learnest thou to doe by it?
A. To resraine from wishing any thing at all to my neighbours hurt or hinde∣rance, be it neuer so small. Q. VVhat is the short summe and effect of the tenne Commandements? A. To loue God aboue all thinges, and my neighbour as my selfe.. Q. Art thou able to kéepe these comman∣dements of thy selfe? A. Of my selfe I am not able to kéepe the least of the tenne, if I could tell which it were. Q. How shall we then satisfie the lawe? A. By Christ, for he hath fulfilled it for vs. Q. Should we liue careles because Christ hath fulfilled the lawe? A. God forbid. Q. VVhat must we doe then? A. Learne to pray vnto the Lord God in the only name of his sonne Christ Ie∣sus our Lord. Q. How must it be then that we pray? A. Thus, Our father which art in hea∣uen, &c. Q. Why doest thou call God father?
A. Because by faith in Christ we be cho∣sen  for the children of God. Iohn. 1. 12. Q. Why sayest thou our father, and not my father. A. Because he is not only my father, but also the father of all the faithfull. Q. Is God no where but in heauen? A. Yes, he is in all places at once, and therefore in our Créede, we call him al∣mightie. Q. VVhy doth our maister Christ teach vs to say heauen? A. Because in praying we should lift vp our mindes to heauen whether hee is gone before. Q. VVhat desire you in this petition? Hallowed be thy name. A. Here we desire God to giue vs grace that we may reuerently estéeme of his holy word which teacheth him vnto vs. Q. What more doe we pray for? A. That we might liue a holy life agrée∣able to his word. Q. VVhat doth Christ teach vs to pray for, in this petition? Thy kingdome come.
A. That the loue of God might be amōg vs, and that his worde which teacheth  him vnto vs, might fréely of vs be re∣ceaued. Q. How should this bee knowen, that Gods loue is among vs? A. By this, if we haue loue one to an o∣ther. Q. VVhat more are we taught? A. VVe are also taught to pray for a pa∣tient wayting for of his comming to iudgment. Q. Are we not also in this petitiō taught to pray for the encrease of faith? A. Yea, for the more that our faith en∣creaseth, the more doth Gods kingdom encrease. Q. In that Christ teacheth vs to pray that Gods will may be done, in earth as it is in heauen: what doth he séeme to forbid? A. In teaching vs so to pray, hee woulde not haue vs to séeke our owne wils, or to sticke to our owne wisedom.
Q. Then it foloweth yt we pray against pride, couetousnes, extortion, vsury, bri∣bery, excesse, dronkennes; whoredome, theft, lying & such like vices, for these be the will of man, & contrarie to the will  of God. A. VVe doe so I confesse. Q. If we pray against those sinners, and to be endewed with righteousnesse, and yet take a delight in them: what doe we? A. Euen mocke with God, and so doe heape punishment vpon our selues for it. Q. Because I sée this to be against mee, should I not therefore pray? A. If we should not pray, we were the despisers of his commandement. Mark. 14. 38. Q. VVhat are we here taught to aske? giue vs this day our daily bread. A. All thinges necessarie to this present life. Q. Why doth he teach vs to pray day∣ly for dayly bread? A. Because without his dayly blessing our food could giue small nourishment vnto vs. Q. What desire ye in this petition: For∣giue vs our trespasses.
A. Here I desire his mercy: for vnlesse he be pitifull vnto vs, we are readie to  fall into vtter destruction. Q. What meaneth the condition? As we forgiue them that trespasse against vs. A. Here we desire, that it may bee his pleasure to giue vs grace that we may be ready to pardon those that haue of∣fended vs. Q. Why doe you say? Leade vs not into temptation? A. Here we pray that God will not suf∣fer vs to be ouercome of temptation: but that being for our profit or tryall, we might boldly bee strengthened in him to abide that which his pleasure is to lay vpon vs. Q. Why is this added? For thine is the kingdome, the power and the glory for euer. A. This doth teach vs to confesse that all rule and authoritie doth come from God, and ruleth all thinges according to his will. A. VVhy sayest thou, Amen, in the lat∣ter end of the prayer?
A. By that word I desire the Lord God to graunt all thinges which before I  prayed for. Q. Tell me the effect in few wordes of all that thou hast saide vpon the Lordes Prayer? A. I desire Gods grace to doe his will, and thinges necessarie both to body and soule. A Prayer. THe Lord giue vs grace to lay these thinges vp déepely in our harts, and alwaies to be mindfull of them, as it be∣hooueth his true and faithfull Children in Christ Iesus. So be it. FINIS.
