THE PEOPLE AND SOVLDIERS OBSERVATIONS, ON THE SCOTCH MESSAGE TO THE PARLIAMENT, CONCERN∣ing the KING; 5. of November 1647. By the scope whereof, all who will be satisfied with Reason, or with mens practices more then their words, may have full resolution to this more usuall then doubtfull Question: Whether the King, Lords, Commons, Scotts, City, Clergy, and Officers of the Army, have sought more their own private ends then the publick weale of this Nation? The words of the Message here follow in order. Right Honourable, AS upon the removal of his Majesty from Holdenby, against his will, by a party of the Army under the command of Sir Shomas Fairfax, we expressed our sense and the resentment of the Kingdome of Scotland of that violent action, so the Committee of Estates of the Parliament of Scotland, finding that his Maje∣sty is still kept within the power of that Army, thought themselves obliged to indeavour to know the certainty of His condition, in obedience to his commands, wee have applied our selves to His Majesty, that from himselfe we might know the truth there∣of, who was pleased to shew us his usage, ever since he came from New-castle, but for his present condition he really confesseth he cannot, but referres us to know it, from the two Houses of Parlia∣ment, and the Army.
Dear Brethren (wee may well say) here yee expresse (in very patheticall words) the tendernesse of our affections to∣wards this forlorne successour of all the numerous race of your tyrannicall Kings, of which many not being a tenth part so wicked as this, yee have rewarded otherwise; it is a wonder that such high minded people as ye, can so underva∣lue your selves, as still and alwaies to stoop your stiffe necks, rather to the heavy manarchiall yoake of cruell tyrants, then to pitty and free both your selves and your posterities, from all kind of slavery and misery, having now a fairer occasion and more precious opportunity, then ever yee had hereto∣fore, or may possibly ever have hereafter. If yee were as just in your practices, as yee are wise in your conceits, yee would have long a-goe either alone, when he was under your power, or since, by advice and assistance of our Parliament and Army, rather called him to a strict ac∣count, impeached him of most high treason, and arraigned him for all his great abominations, oppressions, murthers, and destructions throughout all these three bleeding Nati∣ons (even from the death of his Father, untill he was catch∣ed in the midst of his sins, ripe enough for the sickle of Gods judgements) then anywise to be so zealously affected, and tender hearted concerning his usage since yee delivered him at New-Castle, and how he hath learned the lesson of obedi∣ence to the Armies commands, now after he hath forfeited his authority, and lost his tyrannicall sting. Certainly, it may well be deemed by his usuall double-dealing, that if he had you once more under his arbitrary power, as the Army hath justly both taken and kept him all this time, untill now that he was conveied away to act more mischief; he would so remember your taking up armes (though in your owne defence) against him and his forces both at home and here, for all that is come and gone, and notwithstanding all your kindnesse and tender
care now of him, he would teach you perfectly to know what he meaned and intended, when he both proclaimed you all Rebels and Traitors, and levied such strong forces by Sea and Land against you; and all for your refusing his popish Service-book. But it seemeth, that yee (especially unto whom he hath either given or promised great offices and honourable titles) have so well learned some new court lessons, that yee have quite forgotten your good old fashions, even to esteem of Kings as of other mortall men, and not to idolize them, nor hide their haynous faults, as most of our vulgar fort havetoo long foolishly done, even to our gaeat griefe, and both their and our vexation, yea, yee had rather like the men of Lysra, who in their blind and supersticious zealo, both called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius, and would have offered sacrifice to them, if those Appostles had not in∣terrupted them, then anywise like discreet men, who should diseerne between those who ought to be honoured and res∣pected, and such as deserve to be tryed and punished. Have yee so soon forgotten how he made the best and greatest of you, not only know the newes, but feel the smart, that his little finger was heavier then his Fathers loynes (wereof too many of us want not enough of such experi∣ence also, and that by all kind of oruell oppressions, in things both spirituall and temporall; heavy taxations, persecuti∣ons, and neither hearing nor regarding petitions, but impri∣soning, banishing, exiling yea, and intending to execute your own grand Commissioner, whom he hath since prefer∣red to be your Chancella▪ (upon what termes they two best know) never observing any agreement, performing any promise, nor regarding either saith, truth or justice more to you then us, but all in hypocisie, deceit, and King-craft, (al∣waies acting and prosecuting what his Father devised and contrived) even by plotting, conspiring, and all sort of Ma∣chivelian
dealing, to extirpate, root-out, undermine, and destroy as well all kind of goodness, faithfulness and justice, as good peaceable and true hearted people. A few instances may suffice, because not only the sight of a great parte thereof is still so cleare before our eyes, but the smart of all, is yet so recent and fresh in our memories and apprehensions, howsoever ye like unthrifty Schollers, have rubbed and worn both all the remembrance of your lessons, & marks of your stripes, out of your minds, & from off your backs, with high titles, great offices, new promises, and lof∣ty hopes: Have yee likewise rubbed out of your memories, all his cheating of you (by meanes of Henderson the great, at first one of your high Priests, and next one of his Chaplins) of all his royall performance of that agreement which he made wtth you at Dunce-law, and you; surrendring to him of Edenburgh-Castle, and his planting therein both a number of our Country Papists▪ and aboundance of our ammunition, by which instruments and meanes, he made many of you so sight, sob, weep and groane (yea and leave Edenburgh town) that yee were ready to curse, both the day of that a∣greement, and the birth-day of all those that had any hand in it: Have ye also forgotten how (by his means) our Coun∣try Papists blew up with a train of gunpowder, a Castle full of your Nobility, gentry and Ladies, in the aire; neare Barwick where your Generall narrowly escaped? And do ye not re∣member how in your last Parliament when he was present, that the one day he gave you (as it were, a purse full of gold and jewels in the one hand, even all and whatsoever yee de∣sired, or at least required, but in the other hand a Scottish-dagger, whereby he would have killed and devoured you all before yee was aware? For at his own palace did he not ap∣point a dozen to kill each one a man at one appointed hour of your meeting, even a dozen of the chiefest of you, whom he thought were his greatest opposers, or most able, and poli∣ticke, to crosse his popish and bloudy designes?
Was not this bloodie attempt so contrived and ordered, that your Generall was the first man to have been thus trea∣cherously stobed, and cowardly murthered, and then as his Majestie conceved any of you opposit to him in your places to have proceded against you, and all the rest as his Majestie should bee Gratiously pleased; even as wee see Butchers doe with their fat Oxen: But it pleased God, both to discover and prevent that plot for your good, if yee have so much grace as to make a happy use thereof, now in your great need; which (as some of our Country-men report) was on∣ly discovered by meanes of him, who was imployed to kill your Generall: And also of the like plot at that same time to have beene here against some of our Parliament mem∣bers, which wee thankfully remember was prevented by some of your Nation, howbeit it tooke, such a wofull ef∣fect in Ireland, that it still continueth almost to the destructi∣on thereof, besides a greater multitude of other enormi∣ties, plots, cruelties and oppressions, then either tongue or pen can expresse. Mess. Both Houses (by many professions and ingagements) have de∣clared to the Kingdome of Scotland, that they would take care of the preservation of his person, his just power and greatnesse, (which both Kingdomes have sworn not to diminish) and the Par∣liament of Scotland upon the Kings going to Holdenby, did de∣clare against all harme, prejudiee, injury, or violence to be done to his royall person, Therefore in pursuance of the trust commit∣ted to us, wee make this addresse to the Honourable Houses, con∣ceiving it needlesse to apply our selves to the Army, who wee sup∣pose are and ought to be under their command, desiring to know from them the certainty of his Majesties condition: And the ra∣ther that wee are informed, their are intentions in the Army of the removing him from Hampton-Court.
Observ. Whatsoever our Parliament hath declared to the Kingdome of Scotland, for taking care of the Kings person, it is in reference to that ensnaring covenant, which yee (by meanes of your deceitfull Clergy) fastened upon our corrupt Commissioners, when they agreed with you to assist our for∣ces, and so they unjustly upon our Parliament, and the Par∣liament upon the whole Nation; and yet in the Covenant by vertue of that agreement (wee suppose) there is no absolute promise nor oath to preserve the Kings person, power nor greatnesse, whether he be a King or a tyrant, discharge his du∣ty, or betray his trust; but only a conditionall promise and vow of his preservation, whil'st he sheweth his fidelity by his activity in the defence of our just Lawes and Liberties, and no otherwise: which if hee ever did since that time, but rather more cruelly & tyrannically used his Norman power then ever hee did, wee even refer the judgement thereof to God, the world and your owne consciences. But your Parliament and Nation in stead of trying him according to Law and justice, declare against all harme, pre∣judice, injury or violence, to bee done to his Majesties royall person; as if he had been borne a Law-less Libertine, even to doe all kind of mischief to thousands, ten thousands and hundreds of thousands; and yet never be so much as once questioned himselfe, or scarce those who assisted him. If he urged, threatened and raised cruell warres against you, for refusing that masse-booke, which hee undertoke (with all the rable of Popery) to plant amongst both you and us, in that his most vile and flatering Letter to the Pope, yet extant in print: why then doe not yee deal with him, as the only party with whom yee have to doe, and not trouble us with your Covenant, Reformation nor religion (whether it bee good or bad) more then wee trouble you with ours; as yee did both ingeniously prophess and faithfully promise, in your declaration for assisting our Parliament and Nation. Reas. 6.
Have yee likwise forgotten, what love and respect all of us (whom yee now most cruelly and unjustly both hate, and stir up our enimies to persecute) did beare unto you, not on∣ly by our former Parliament, who absolutly refused him all kind of aide and assistance to come against you, but likewise, by our unanimous chusing rather to undergo his highest dis∣pleasure (according to our free and rationall principles) then to take up armes to assist him in that unjust quarell. Besids, in that Declaration, yee acknowledge that we have been your nearest and dearest freinds, being willing & ready to help and assist you in all your straits and extremities: and therfore if ye either suffer or cause us to sink in such miseries ye protest there; that ye not only betray our safety but your own (as standing & falling together) & so ye there conclude, that yee will doe to us herein as yee would bee done unto: and in di∣vers of your other Remonstrances and Declarations, yee thankfully remember great aide and assistance which ye have receved of us; chiefly, at the expelling of the French out of your Nation in the dayes of your Queene Regent, which fa∣vours yee vow and Imprecate never to forget. Now, seeing yee thus confesse, professe, protest and promise, both to our greate credite and your owne greate comfort, what Neighbourly kindnesses yee have received of us, and what respect therfore yee owe unto us: whence then cometh this great change, both of your affections, resoluti∣ons, words and actions? cannot yee rest contented with your own misery and slavery, and not like Satan to tempt or in∣slave others? For it seemeth to us, that yee love such unwor∣thy conditions better then either your lives or estates, and have almost these nine yeares both adventured the one and consumed the other, in pretending to fight against a a cruell tyrant, and yet all this time intending to fight for a cruell tyrant (as yee too well taught our deceitfull Parlia∣ment) and that yee and your posterity may be still hence∣forth,
as yee have been alwayes heretofore, not only his and his predicessours slaves, but as hee useth you, so yee may stil use (or rather abuse and enslave) all the poore people under you, after that lamentable and base example of France. Doubtless, yee are a hundred-fould worse (as well in this respect as in many others) then the Isralits in the daies of Sa∣muel, who lusted to have a King like other Nations; for they not yet feeling the evills and inconveniences which would accompany a King, though they had sufficient notice given them thereof by the Prophet; but yee have enough of such greevous and lamentable experience already your selves, besides what yee (both as eye and eare witnesses) well know both we and Ireland have; even that hee (who is now your best beloved Country man) hath most cruelly exercised (at least) all the grevous oppressions which Samuell fore-tould of King Saul; and therefore, except hee repent, as God gave that wicked King in his anger to Israell, and tooke him away in his wrath; so doubtlesse he gave; and will take your King, whom yee still both respect and endevour to excuse and de∣fend in all his most hainous Sins, Abominations, Murthers, Injustices, Tyranies and oppressions; far exceeding either Saul, Jeroboam, Ahab, Ahaz, or Ammon, if not all of them. Yet notwithstanding all this, yee (like wise merchants who take and keep all advantages against unskilfull custo∣mers) still hould so fast and stick so closse to your bargain, which yee made with our corrupt Parliament, when yee saw them in such a straight, that they were in feare and danger of both their lives and estates, by his wicked meanes, and their owne unjust dealings; and that even besides your hyre and wages, yee (by the device, meanes and assistance of the chief∣est incendiaries of all these bloodie warres, even your ambi∣tions, covetous and pernitious Clergy, confederating with ours) most unjustly procured your deceitfull Covenant to
be both taken by our Parliament, and forced upon the whole Nation; and consequently your humane religion, under the colour of reformation; though it passeth the limits and bounds of all their Commissions or abilities; seing thereunto they never had the consent of the free people of this Nation who both chused and trusted them; yea and are like to bee called to an exact and strict account by them, both for these and many hundreds more of other wrongs, treacheries and acts of Injustice; especially, in that they would not call him to an account for all his tirranny and wickednesse, exercised over the free people of this Nation, since the begining of his Raigne, nor deale with him according to his deserts; neither before these warres began, nor when they began, nor yet ever since they have beene, (though they might often∣times) and so to haue prevented both the effusion of much blood and the destruction & wasting of manifold treasures and estates: And howsoever yee Commissionars, in pursuance of the trust commited to you, by those that sent you, will make your adresse only to our Parliament, conceiving it nedlesse to apply your selves to the army, who ye suppose are and ought to bee under the Parliaments command; yet yee are to con∣sider, that the Parliament are but the Commons of Englands servants, as well as the Army; as yee know Prophets and Priests of ould, or Bishops and Ministers of late, are not supe∣riours to Kings (in temporall matters at least) though they be imployed by the people, to put the Croun on their heads, and take their Oaths for the faithfull discharging of their Offices; yea and in regard our Parliament have run them∣selves over head and eares into so manifould gulfes of injust∣ice, that they nither deserve the title nor respect which is due to a Just, discreete, faithfull and carefull Parliament: and and therefore they now lye (as it were) prostrate on their knees, as well at the mercie of the Commons of England
as your good King doth at this present; so that all their sub¦tile propositions & treaties with him, nor yet the City, Cler∣gy, nor corrupt Officers of the Army to help them, will nei∣ther availe nor prevent the fearfull Interrogatories, which possibly and speedily may be demanded of either; then ye will have ocasion to take up such a mourning and lamentati∣on for your good King, who hath so advanced your glorious Reformation, as both Jerem. the Prophet, and all Judah with the singing women, did for the death of good King Josiah, in the Valley of Megiddo. Mess. The Kingdome af Scotland finding that their stabili∣ty, and happinesse doth so much depend upon the safety and preser∣vation of his Majesties royall person, &c. Obser. Now, yee having both expressed your owne fer∣vent desires and sincere affections towards your good King, have also endevoured to make our Parliament and Nation doe the like: yee come in the third place to shew the cause of all this great businesse; namly, whereupon your stability and happyness doth so much depend; which yee attribute to The safety and preservation of his Majesties royall person. It is a wonder, that yee should either bee so ignorant or void of shame, as to expresse so impudently and evidently such vile untruths, flatteries and contrarieties, even against both your owne experiences, understandings and conscien∣ces, chiefly in these late and sad dayes, both of your affliction and ours, which yee well know hath been all by his meanes; being a most cruell scourge to plague both you and us for all our hainous sins, as Nebucadnezar was in punishing Israell for theirs: and therefore yee (upon that sandy ground of your owne humours and conceits,) doe run the hazzard of the following resolution. Mess. And being resolved that no alteration of affaires shall ever separate them from that duty allegiance they ow unto him, nor from their constant resolvtions to live in all loyalty and obedience
under his government, have often shewne their earnest desires, and contributed their utmost endevours, towards the composure of these unhappy differences. Ob. Here yee would say, if dissimulation would permit you, no wickednesse, oppression nor tyranny that he and all his hellish Cavaliers, bloudy papists, prophane Countiers, flattering favorits, and domineering Bishops, can commit, shall ever separate you from the performance of that duty of Allegiance ye owe unto him, and constant resolusion yee have to live in all loyalty and obedience under his govern∣ment, and that yee have been very active towards the com∣posure of these unhappy differences. All which words may perhaps feed the fancy of the sim∣ple and ignorant multitude, who are alwaies ready to be de∣luded by such meanes, but they will never savour nor smell of any goodnesse, justice, nor integrity to any impartiall discreet, or judicious men: because they proceed either of very weake or corrupt principles, of a slavish disposition, or blind affection, without either sense, reason, due, or true satisfaction, though yee make him (as it were) your joy and your Crowne Mess. And the Houses of Parliament having by their Votes of the 26th. of Oct. last, intimated to us their resolusions to ap∣ply themselves to his Majesty, and that they are preparing Propo∣sitions to be tendred to him; Wee doe desire that they may be ex∣pedited and communicated to us; that according to our many en∣gagements and relations there may be still a conjunction of coun∣cels, in those things that are for the common peace, ond joynt in∣terests of both Kingdomes. And for the better asserting of them, for clearing his Maje∣sties doubts, and for the giving, and receiving muturall satisfa∣ction: Wee doe desire (in the name of the Kingdome of Scotland) that there may be a personall Treaty with the King, as the best and rediest meanes to obtaine the joynt desires of both Kingdoms;
And for that effect, that the King may bee invited to come to London, with that honour, freedom, and respect due to his Ma∣jesty, or (at least) remaine at Hampton-Court, and not under the power and constraint of Souldiers, where both Kingdomes may make their free applications to him, without any danger of such stop, or affront as hath been alredy commited against a Commissi∣oner of Scotland: and for which no reparation hath bin made, and that his Majestie bee no more carried about with the Army at their pleasures. &c. Here is still a continued course of great businesses (as well now after, as it was throughout all the warres) of addres∣sing of Parliaments and states, as well English as Scots, by Pro∣positions to be tendred to him, with all expedition, and communicated to you for unity and peace sake; as if judges should present petitions, and offer conditions▪ of peace unto such malefactors as stand guilty at their Bar. 2. Ob. And for the better &c. Here is a great deale of stuffe to little purpose, truly it is a pitty yee were not as dis∣creet as yee would appear to be; by meanes of your Priestly generation, yee are still of such a strange disposition, that al∣though yee doe resort to all Nations your selves, yet yee will permit none to dwell among you, who are more able or bet∣ter principled then your selves, and might possibly instruct you, both in spirituall and temporall freedomes, better then all your teachers and Lawyers: witnesse your hard usage from time to time, (chiefly in the first three yeares of your late troubles) what numbers of our people resorted amongst you, thinking there had been some hopes to have made you a free-principled, discreet and absolute free people, and not to be carried away neither by wicked Kings, nor time-ser∣ving Priests; but some of our people, as well as your owne, had imprisoning instead of reasoning, and both of them bad entertainment for endeavouring your good. And concerning the Kings coming to London, doe yee
not know, he may come thither, with that honour, freedome and respect which is due unto him, and yet with little con∣tent either to himselfe or to you? Yee make so much of a dissembling Absolon, a cruell mur∣derer, and bloudy tyrant, as wee have great cause to be jea∣lous, that yee have left your first love which yee appeared to have, and that yee have not such a measure of discretion as to discerne between good and evill, nor between those that lash, whip and scourge you, yea, and both makes you gather straw, and performe your whole task of bricks too; and those who tell you the truth for your present and future good, yee both persecute even with a deadly hatrered, and indeavour more to force your Religion by the sword, then anywise to convince by the word; so that if neither sword nor pestilence can humble you, God hath both famine and other judge∣ments which doubtlesse will doe it. Mess. These we conceive to be the most probable and effectuall meanes for attaining a happy peace, settling of Religion, restoring his Majesty to his just Rights, and continuing, and strengthen∣ing a good understanding betwixt these Kingdomes, which are most earnestly desired by the Kingdome of Scotland, and shall bee constantly and faithfully endevoured by &c. Obs. If ye conceive that these corrupt courses, which so tend to justifie the wicked and condeme the just, are the most probable & effectuall meanes, for obtaining these your ends; yea, and being so contrary to your just protestations against his proclaimations, & your takeing up armes against his for∣ces; wee desire that yee would either shew how this can bee possible; or how this your great and suddain change cometh, or else, acknowledge your errour herein; seeing there is nei∣ther any beginning nor appearance of repentance in him, notwithstanding all his deceitfull Protestations and bloudy warres in all the three Nations: otherwise, ye will both in∣curre blame, and come short of obtaining a happy peace,
restoring him to his just rights, and both continuing and strengthening a good understanding between these Nations, though it be never so much both desired by you and en∣deavoured by your Commissioners in your behalfe. But supposing yee cannot shew how such a thing is possi∣ble, we will endeavour therefore to shew you, how farre yee have both changed your minds, & in our apprehensions, de∣generated from the perfect rules of equity and justice in two years time, that ye may learn to lay a more solid founda∣tion where upon to build your stability & happines, then on the sandy foundation of the safety & preservation of a wick∣ed mans person, though of never so great a majesty & royalty (as yee say) and by such corrupt flattering and deceit full meanes, yea, and unjust tearmes and titles, to justifie and protect him in all his wickednes, both against your selves and us: wee send you back againe, to read and consider once more, your own generall assemblies Remonstrance, publish∣ed to the view of the world, June 12. 1645. Chiefly page 3. line 16, 17, 18, 19. and page 5. line 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. and page 6. l. 19, 20, 21, 22. The words are these; When wee call to mind, that God accepteth not the persons of men, and that the greatest are not to be winked at in their sinnes; wee make bold to warne your Majesty freely, that the guilt which cleaveth fast to your Majesty, and to your Throne is such, as (what∣soever flattering preachers or unfaithfull councellers may say to the contrary) if not timely prevented, cannot but involve your selfe and your posterity under the wrath of the ever-living God, for your being guilty of the shedding of the bloud of many thou∣sands of your Majesties best subjects, and for what other causes your Majesty is most conscious, and may best judge and search your own conscience. Now having paraleld your present practices with your former judgements, even of late dayes, whereof at first wee esteemed more highly, then either then or since, howbeit it
doth now clearly appear, that ye have not been sound at all howsoever wee as all Christians ought to take every thing' in the best or most charitable sense, untill time discover mens intentions by their actions, according to our Saviours rule, to know the Tree by the fruit; for instance, it appears plain∣ly to us now, even by your practices ever since, that in your little Book called Your lawfulnesse of comming into Eng! a ad, Reas. 6th. Yee have either a bloudy or (at the best) a compulsive intention, to root out, or at least to compell all of what soever degree, estate or condition, to be one with you in Religion, by which unjust resolutions, do ye not pre∣sume above what is meet, and even usurp the worke both of Gods word and Spirit? If this kind of dealing, be any-wise a doing as yee would be done unto, we referre it both to your afore-said declarati∣an, and to your owne consciences; for if yee would not bee pleased, that any person or state should urge and beat you from your Religion, why then dare yee presume to urge or beate either us from ours, or any others from theirs; but still to doe as yee would be done unto, for whatsoever measure ye give, the like ye shall receive. And have yee forgoten, is it so out of your minds, that yee began all these bloody warres, against your good King, in the very same quarrell? was it not because it was his Maje∣sties Royall and gracious pleasure, to compell you to serve God by his Bishopes and Popish booke, otherwise then yee were perswaded, or at least accustomed? And if so (which ye cannot yet deny, because it can be so aboundantly proved) why then will yee be so arrogant and wicked, as still to prose∣cute such an un-godly attempt, and persecute honest and peaceable people? but rather to learne of Christ, to hee meeke, humble and lowly, endevouring alwayes to convince by the word, but never to force by the sword. Again, it cannot be denied, but even thankfully remem∣bred,
that ye not only lent us your helping hand, even a pow∣erfull army, whereby yee forced a Parliament to be called a∣mong us, when our King made it no lesse then treason to mention a Parliament (being then in the highest of his nor∣man tyranny and malice against our birth-rights and liber∣ties) but likewise, yee continued your army a whole yeare with us, untill yee set us in a right Parliamentary posture; and saw both wicked men punished, and just men advanced before yee departed, yea and yee went all away with as great honour, credit and respect as (we suppose) such a great army in any forraigne Nation ever did. Upon which ground, and that yee have been alwaies est∣emed a valiant people, and an unconquered Nation howso∣ever yee be in bondage to your Kings) and did carry your selves wisely in all the particulars of your owne defence a∣gainst the Kings power and forces, we called you into our Nation with an army to help and assist us against the King; and in the first place yee took in New-Castle againe from his forces, and sent us Coles both of your owne and from thence, for our moneyes; when many had begun to burne bed-steeds and tables above the space of too yeares, for want thereof: But herein was your failing, yee began and ran well but who did let you that ye would not goe on to the end of your races, why would ye not be as carefull to assist our forces and discharge your owne duties in all other places and services since, as ye were to exact your arreares, and so to have made a speedier end of these warres. Howsoever, upon this view of mutuall duties and favours thus given and received; it is our earnest desire, for a better union betwen us, then either such a Covenant or kind of religion can make, that there may bee no further pursuance of us, in a coercive way unto either, more then we indevour against you in what we professe or practice, but that LOVE, which is the greatest Commandement of all, may begin and encrease again betwen us as brethren, friends and neighbours, & so continue throughout all generations.
