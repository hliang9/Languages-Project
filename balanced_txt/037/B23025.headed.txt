Advertisements to avoid being Deceived. READER, WHereas about Four Months last past there was published a little Paper in these fol¦lowing words, viz. The Rich may command, be bowed unto and flattered for re∣ward; but the Poor may intreat and be rebuked with a scornful look: therefore these are to give notice to all that are poor in City or Countrey, that are either Sick or Lame, may under God have Cure of the worst of Diseases curable for nothing; if they repair to the Sun in Gutter-lane near Cheapside, London, &c. yet nothing without God. Since which there hath been many wonderful Cures performed by a Chymical Powder, called, The Metallick Eagle; the which Medicine and Cures hath given great cause of Admiration, and brought great resort to the place and person aforesaid: Now so it is, Some Practicio∣ners of Physick and others, in hope to advance their reputation and mercinary profits, do pretend to have the same Medicine of their own preparation. Some of which persons I could name, but shall forbear, until I find them farther to persist, &c. But I do assure all persons that none of these pretenders have or can have this Medicine, unless they buy it of me, as some do; the secret having yet not been made known to two persons in the world besides my self; neither is it of that light moment, to be made common; for I be∣lieve there is not the like Medicine extant; unless the Grand Medicine of the Philosophers, and I know not any that dares to pretend to have obtained that as yet. Thus I thought good to warn the innocent and detect the presumptuous, that the world, as now it is  may no longer be deceived or imposed upon. Farewel, your Friend R. F. Philalethes.
