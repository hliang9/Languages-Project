WHereas it is Manifest that of late Years the Currant Coin of this Kingdom hath been greatly Diminished by Clipping, Rounding, Filing and Melting the same, and likewise many False and Counterfeit Coins have been Clipped for the better Disguising thereof: And for as much as it is Apparent that these Practices of Diminishing the Currant Coin is very much occasioned by those who Drive a Trade of Exchanging Broad Money for Clip∣ped Money, and by other Arts and Devices.

And for the better preventing the Clipping, Diminishing or Impairing the Currant Coin of this Kingdom; Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person what∣soever shal Buy or Sell, and knowingly have in his Custody or Possession, any Clippings or Filings of the Currant Coin of this Kingdom, he shal for every such Offence forefeit the said Clippings or Filings, and also the Sum of Five hundred Pounds, One Moiety to his Majesty, and the other to the Informer, to be Recovered, as aforesaid, and shal be also Branded in the Right Cheek with a Hot Iron with the Letter R, and until payment of the said Five hun∣dred Pounds shal suffer Imprisonment.
