ΜΟΡΜΟΝΟΣΤΟΛΙΣΜΟS, SIVE Lamiarum Vestitus. A POEM ON THE KING AND QUEEN OF FAIRY. Translated into Latine, by Mr. WALTER DENNESTONE. Printed in the Year, MDCXCI.
TO THE VIRTUOSI. YE Virtuosi hav't to you assign'd The Natural causes of all things to find. We cloath the Fairies in their proper dress: And leav't to you, What force they have? to guess. AD PHILOSOPHOS. NAturam, & veras rerum perpendere caussas Sorte datum vobis, Ingeniosa cobors. Corpra nos Lemurum tenui velamus amictu: Dicite vos, Quae vis? quis vigor insit eis?
On the KING of FAIRY. UPon a time the Fairy Elves, Having first array'd themselves, Thought it meet to cloath their King, In Robes most fit for Revelling. (2) He had a Cobweb-Shirt more thin, Than ever Spiders since could spin; Bleach'd in the whiteness of the Snow, When the Northern Winds do blow. (3) In that Waste and open Air No Shirt half so Fine or Fair: A rich Waste Coat they did bring Made of the Trout-flies Golden Wing. (4) Dy'd Crimson in a Maidens blush. And lin'd with Humming Bees soft Plush. At which his Elf-ship 'gan to fret And sware 'twould cast him in a sweat. (5) He for his Coolness needs would wear A Waste coat made of Downy Hair, New taken from an Eunuchs Chin, It pleas'd him well; 'twas wondrous thin. (6) His Hat was all of Ladies love, So passing light that it would move If any Goat or Humming Fly But beat the Air in passing by. (7) About it went a wreath of Pearle Dropt from the Eyes of some poor Girle, Pincht because she had forgot To leave clean Water in the Pot, (8) His Breeches and his Cassock were Made of the Tinsel Garsummer: Down it's seam there went a lace Drawn by an unctuous Snails slow pace.
In Oreadum Regem. MOnticolae quondam Lamiae circundatae amictu Corpora praetenui choreis & lusibus apto; Talibus inde suum Regem quo{que} vestibus ornant Quae deceant numeros{que} leves festasque chorêas. (2) Ejus araneoli scutulata subucula filo Rarior, eximiae quod texuit artis Arachne: Intactaeque nivis fuit insolata nitore, Quam rigidus gelidâ Boreas diffundit ab Arcto. (3) Nec sub Hyperboreo tam pura camisia tractu Usque adeò tenuis tamque alba apparuit usquam: Proxima cura fuit tunicellam imponere Regi Hepiali textam mirè ex aurantibus alis. (4) Virginis eximiae roseo quae tincta rubore, Atque apis Hyblaeae duplicata est vellere molli: Tum fremere & jurare Heros gestamine tanto Pressus, & exili manare à corpore sudor. (5) Post, refrigerii caussâ, subtile theristrum Curari fecit consutum more decoro, Nuper ab Eunuchi malâ & lanugine sumptum: Hoc placuit, quia erat tenui subtemine textum. (6) Ejus erat (capit is tegumentum insigne) galerus, U referunt, è femineo conflatus amore; Qui levis usque adeo fuit ut trepidaret ad auram, Quam musca aut cynips praetervolitando feriret. (7) Ambijt hunc circum speciosa & gemmea spira Ex oculis tenerae tremulis modò lapsa puellae; Quam malè multarunt Lemures quòd linquere in ollâ Oblita est puras, nocturno tempore, lymphas. (8) Denique fiebant saga cum femoralibus ejus Lineolâ è tenui per summa cacumina campi Extenâ, quorum suturam rara tegebat Iustita ducta pigri limacis tramite pingui.
On the QUEEN. NO sooner was their King attyr'd as never Prince had been, But as in duty was requir'd they next array their Queen. (2) Of shining threed shut from the Sun And twisted into line, On the light Wheel of Fortune Spun was made her Smock so fine. (3) Her Gown was very colourd fair The Rain-bow gave the dip; Persumed by an amber Air, Breath'd from a Virgins lip. (4) The Stuff was of a Morning dawn When Phebus did but peep, But by a Poets Pencil drawn In Chloris lap asleep. (5) Her Vail was white and pale-fac'd by Invented by a Maid, When she (poor Soul) by some bad spy Had newly been betray'd (6) Her Necklace was of subtile tye Of glorious Atoms, set In the pure Black of Beauties eye, As they had been in Jet. (7) Her Shoes were all of Maiden-Heads So passing thin and light That all her care was how to treed; A thought had burst them quite. (8) The revells ended, she put off Because her Grace was warm: She fann'd her with a Ladies scoff. And so she took no Harm. FINIS.
In REGINAM. POstquam Rex tali fuit insignitus a mictu Membra cui Regum nulla tulere parem. Mox etiam, veluti ratio poscebat & aequum, Reginae parili corpora veste tegunt. (2) Illius ex auro clarâ de lampade solis Emisso, scitè facta erat interula. Stamina cujus erant solerti pollice ducta, Sortis in ambiguae torta levique rotâ. (3) Palla fuit, qualem spectabilis induit Iris, Quam varius radiis pingit Apollo suis. Talis odor, qualis fragranti spirat ab ambrâ, Halitus aut qualis Virginis esse solet. (4) Materies fuit Aurorae de lumine primo Phoebus ubi Eois surgit honorus aquis. Peniculo vatis qui pingebatur amatae Chloridis in gremio membra quiete levans. (5) Candidulumque habuit velamen, pallidulumque, Dextra puellaris texuit illud opus. Qui color idem erat ac pellucet in ore puellae Prodita ab infausto quae modo forte viro. (6) Illius alba decens ornabat colla monile Formosum pulchris conspicuisque atomis: Quae velut in puro nigroque gagate fuissent Impositae, miris emicuere modis. (7) Calceolique sui perquam tenuesque levesque Facti de claustris virginitatis erant. His igitur verita est incedere, namque pusillus Sensus amoris cos rumperet absque morâ. (8) Ludis exactis, quoniam sudore madebat Confestim vestes exuit ipsa suas. Et se femineo vannavit scommatc demum Nec quidquam damni pertulit inde sibi. FINIS.
