An Excellent New Song OF The Unfortunate WHIG's. To the Tune of, The King enjoys his own again. [1] THe Whigs are but small, and of no good Race, and are Belov'd by very few; Old Tony broach'd his Tap in e'ry place, to encourage all his Factious Crew: At some great Houses in this Town, The Whiggs of High Renown, And all with a true Blue was their Stain; For since it is so, They have wrought their overthrow Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again. [2] They all owne Duty to their Lawful Prince, and Loyal Subjects should have been, But their Duty is worn out long since, by the Association seen: But these are the Whiggs, That have cut off some Legs, And fain would be at that Sport amain; For since it is so, They have wrought their overthrow, Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again. [3] And yet they are the Sham-pretenders, and they swear they'll support our Laws, These be the great Defenders of Ignoramus and the Old Cause: They'll defend the King, By Swearing of the Thing, These are the cursed Rogues in grain; For since it is so, They have wrought their overthrow, Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again. [4] The True Religion that shall down, which so along has won the day, And Common-Prayer i'th Church of e'ry Town, if that the Whiggs could but bear the Sway: For Oats he does begin, Now for to bring them in, As when he came mumping from Spain; For since it so, They have wrought their overthrow, Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again. [5] How all their Shamming Plots they would hide, yet they are Ignorant they say, When as Old Tony he was Try'd, and brought off with Ignoramus sway: Then Oats he was Dumb, And could not use his Tongue, This is the Shamming Ro—in Grain; For since it is so, They have wrought their overthrow. Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again. [6] Then let all true Subjects Sing. and Damn the power of all those, That won't shew Loyalty to their King, and assist him against his Whiggish Foes: Then in this our happy state, In spight of Traytors hate, We will all Loyal still remain; For since it is so, They have wrought their overthrow, Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again. [7] God preserve our Gracious King, with the Royal Consort of his Bed, And let all Loyal Subjects sing, that the Crown may remain on Charles's head: For we will drink his Health, In spight of Common-Wealth, And his Lawful Rights we will maintain, For since it is so, They have wrought their overthrow, Old Tony will ne'r enjoy his own again.
