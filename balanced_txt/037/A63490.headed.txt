THE Explanation of the FRONTESPIECE SEE the sad Trophies of our Civil Wars, The fatal Period of Intestine Jars▪ Behold th' insulting Monster! with what Pride, Mounted on high, she does in Triumph ride? Whilst at her Feet three weeping Beauties lye, Three Nations doom'd t'Eternal Slavery. Unhappy Albion! she that was ere-while Albion the Fair, the Free, the Fort'nate Isle, The Fear and Envy of all Foreign Lands, Now takes inglorious Shackles from her Hands. The Northern Thistle hangs her snowy Head, To see her Edinburgh Castle so called, till taken by O∣liver Crom∣wel. Maiden Castle ravished: Bleeding Jerney's ready to Expire, Her heart-strings broak, as well as tuneless Lyre: See where a Murder'd Monarch breathless lies! With her own Sword there wounded Justice dies. Lo! where the Pop'lar Darling Liberty, That aëry nothing Name does captive lye, Her Pinions clipt; her Finger lets you see There's nothing but Repenting Thought left free. So caged Philomel securely Sings, But having got the Freedom of her Wings, While to her Native Woods she clips away, Poor Philomel becomes the Faulcon's prey. So from the Fold and the slain Shepherd's Eye, Fond Flocks regain their desart Liberty; But in Exchange of Government and Laws, They meet their Death from Wolves devouring Jaws. More foolish, sure, and much more brutish Men, Once thus deceiv'd, to be deceiv'd again? Thus Scepters, Crowns, Religion, Justice, Laws, Became the Triumphs of the Black Old Cause, Whilst Wing'd Ambition, groundless Jealousie, Flaming Rebellion, Dismal Anarchy, To roll her hissing Wheels each Foaming strives; Needs must they go, whom such a Jehu drives! But would you know the End of this Carreer? He best can tell, ask the Black Charioteer.
A TRUE COPY OF THE JOURNAL OF The High Court of Iustice, FOR THE TRYAL OF K. CHARLES I. As it was Read in the House of Commons, AND Attested under the hand of PHELPS, Clerk to that Infamous Court. Taken by J. NALSON, LL D. Jan. 4. 1683. With a Large Introduction. LONDON, Printed by H. C. for Thomas Dring, at the Harrow at the Corner of Chancery-Lane in Fleet-street, 1684.
TO THE READER. THere is one thing which I thought my self obliged to give the Purchasers of these Papers some satisfaction in, before they come to Read them; and that is, Why, since I am Imbarqued in a General Design of giving an Impartial Account of the Transactions of those dismal Revolutions, from the Scotish Rebellion, to the Execrable Murder of this deplorable Prince, two Volumes whereof are already Extant, I should anticipate that Work which cannot be compleat without this very Journal; and therefore why it should come out single, and in some sort before the due time? In answer to which, I have much to say, and that which I hope may be very satisfactory to others, as well as it hath been to my self. For, I did seriously consider, by the slow Progress of that Heavy Work, which I wish had fallen upon more able Shoulders, that though I may without Vanity affirm, I have toiled in it with such Assiduity and Zeal, as hath not been extreme propitious either to my Health or Estate, yet such is the multiplicity of the swelling Matter; so great is the Difficulty of sifting out Truth, notwithstanding the little distance of Time; and the Materials for Composing those Collections are to be drawn together from so many remote and distant Quarters, that it cannot be rationally expected by others, I am sure from former tryal, it is not to be hoped by my self, that a Work of that Nature and Proportion should be finished without the assistance of a considerable time, and even so much the more, because I am obliged out of the desire I have to accom∣plish it, to play the good Husband with the Oyl of both my Lamps of Life and Fortune, since if either of those happen to be burnt out, the other will not light the Work to its Journeys End. I then further considered with my self, how long this very Original Journal had slept in Obscurity, and that there was nothing of that Nature so in every Circumstance and Punctilio authentique and convincing of that Horrid Murther made Publique, I blamed those who had so long concealed it, and considering how great a Wonder it was, that it had not been lost, and quam multa cadunt inter Poculum suprema{que} labra; how possible it was still to be lost, I thought I ought not to be guilty of what I thought was blamable in others, but that it ought to be made Publique, lest Posterity should lose one of the most irrefragable Demon∣strations of the Recorded Villany of those Persons and Principles, and for want thereof, come to call in question the Truth of the Charge against these Factious Rebels and Regicides of the Dissenting Separation. I saw with what unwearied Industry, the present Dissenters, Presby∣terians, Independents, Baptists, and other Sects, indeavoured to palliate, extenuate, nay and even wholly deny the Guilt of that Royal Blood; I saw all this, and from their former Actions, and later Attempts, from
the nccessary Conclusions which follow from their Positions and Prin∣ciples, I could not but foresee Dangerous Consequences of permitting them to Seduce the Nation into an Opinion and Belief of their Innocence and Sanctity: And upon the strength of these and many such like Motives, I thought my self under the most pressing Obligations of Duty, of Interest, and of Conscience, to do all that I was able towards the Preservation of His Majesties Royal Person, Dignity, and Government, the Safety of the most Glorious and Apostolical Church in the World, and the Establishment of the Peace and Happiness of the English Nation, of the Danger which threatned all these, I could not but entertain most terrible apprehensions, if these their avowed and impla∣cable Enemies were quietly permitted to go on proselyting the People to their Party, for want of a Faithful Discovery and Free Exposure of their Horrible Wickedness, Hypocrisies, Treasons, Rebellions, and Execrable Practices and Doctrines, which are Destructive and Ruinous of all Government, Religion, and even Humane Society. And this being to be proved by their own Writings, and under their own Hands, I thought I was not to neglect the Opportunity of doing this Service to the Publique, especially considering that we have their own Words to confirm us in the just Apprehensions we have of them, which assure us that our Fears and our Danger from them are very just and too well grounded, both upon their Confession and our own Experience. Now many things herein recited would not so well have fallen in with the Historical Account of those Times, and to give but even an Abstract or a bare Catalogue of all the Seditious, Treasonable, Hor∣rible Sermons and Vile Pamphlets of that Age would fill some Volumes; and therefore I thought I might with greater decency to the Design of those Collections, not only spare them there, but with greater advan∣tage also to the present Juncture of our Affairs, and the Circumstances of the Nation, give a short Account of them in the Introduction to the Tryal and Murder of the King, to which they were in reality the bloody Preface, and in a Book of a smaller Price, which therefore in probability would fall into more hands. This I hope will be sufficient to preserve me in the good Opinion of the Loyal and Ingenuous, who will not think it an Injury to indeavour by this Precaution to serve them though a little too forwardly for the Regular Course of the following Collections; and for any persons of a different Character, since I am assured that this Discourse whenever it should come, would not be very agreeable to them, I am not so foolish as to be sollicitous for the displeasure of those, whom I should be much more foolish, if I should ever hope to please.
TO HIS Royal Highness JAMES DUKE of YORK, ALBANY, AND ULSTER, &c. ROYAL SIR, HOW much the English Name and Na∣tion are obliged to Your Royal High∣ness, the voluntary Exposing of Your Illustrious Life to the most hazzardous and Dreadful of all Combats and Dangers, for their Interest and for their Glory, will be an Eternal Testi∣mony so long as Fame shall be able to celebrate them with her immortal Trumpet; and not to mention that Bravery and Conduct which in a thousand Occasions You have shewn at Land. Those Terrible Actions
upon the British Ocean, whose Thundering Eccho's have transported Your Glory to the remotest Shores, will for ever rank Your Name among the greatest and most famous Captains of the World. One would think it impossible, that even while the Laurels were yet fresh upon Your Conquering Brow, there should be found any so enviously Malicious, to endeavour to blast them; and with a base Ingratitude, by con∣spiring Your Disgrace, Your Ruin and Destruction so to repay Your Merit, and their Deliverance and Preser∣vation from the Hostile Attempts of Powerful and En∣croaching Neighbours, who by cutting the smews of our Traffique, endeavoured to divest His Majesty of his glorious Inheritance the Sovereignty of the four Seas, and His Subjects of those Riches which Maritime In∣dustry entituled them to. But this is the natural effect of those Principles of Zealous Separatists, the implacable Enemies not only of Your Royal House and Person but even of the Mo∣narchy it self; and certainly none but such prodigious Monsters whom no Goodness is capable of Obliging, nor Innocence of Escaping, could so suddenly have Ex∣tinguished the Remembrance how freely Your High∣ness had Exposed Your Illustrious Life to Preserve not only the Reputation, but the just Dominion of the Sea to the English Nation, as to be induced contrary to all the Laws of God or Man, and all the Obligations of Duty, Gratitude, and Humanity, to endeavour to Disinherit and Exclude Your Royal Highness, from Your Hereditary Right of Succession, to the Land. And to those who measure them according to their for∣mer
Actions, it will appear no Wonder to find the pre∣sent Dissenters so exactly resembling their Parents and Predecessors in Cruelty, Ingratitude, and Treason; or that they should so violently endeavour to Exclude the Son from the Right of Succession, who so inhu∣manely and barbarously Excluded his Father from the Possession both of his Crown and Life, and our Gra∣cious Sovereign, so long as they had the least Power, from his undoubted Right, the Throne of his Illustrious Ancestours and Predecessours. But if their endeavours for Exclusion, fill'd the minds of many who did not throughly understand their Design, with surprize and amazement, their late Explanation of themselves, by the infamous Commentary of the most ungenerous Treason, have fill'd their hearts with Hor∣ror and Detestation against such base Actions and Brutish Principles, as lead men under pretence of Religion and Conscience to the most ignominious and Cowardly Vil∣lany of Assassinating Sovereign Princes. But His Majesty and Your Royal Highness hav∣ing by the immediate Care of Heaven, Escaped these Dangers, as it fills all Loyal Hearts with Dutiful Joy; so it instructs them, from their Danger, of the inseparable Necessity of their Interest and their Duty; and that they ought not only to satisfie themselves with a Passive Loyalty, but to Ʋse their most Active En∣deavours to contribute what lies in their Power, to Se∣cure the Publique Peace, and support the Govern∣ment. And as it is the Interest so it is the Glory of the Church of England, that She hath not the least blemish of Disloyalty in Her Beautiful Face, but that
Her Fidelity to the Crown hath been Tryed to the Ʋttermost, and She hath Constantly endeavoured to sup∣press the Growth and Progress of these Fatal Principles, Destructive of all that is Great and Good, and for my own particular, as I esteem it my greatest Honour to be one of Her meanest Servants, so I look upon it as my chief∣est Glory, if I can be capable of doing any Services against these Wicked and Dangerous Principles, which may in∣cline Your Highness to pardon the presumption of this Ad∣dress, and the Ambition of avowing my self, Great Sir, Your Highnesses most Humble and most Obedient Servant J. Nalson.
THE INTRODUCTION: OR, PREFACE TO THE JOURNAL of the Proceedings of the High Court of Iustice, FOR THE TRYAL OF King Charles I. Of Blessed Memory. THERE have been few Ages or Regions of the World, which have not produced Monsters of Ingratitude and Cruelty, Treachery and Hypocrisie, the blackest and basest of all Crimes; Popularity and Ambition have blown from every point of the Compass, and have raised such Tempests through∣out
the Worlds vast Circumference, that few places can be found, which have not suffered under their violent Effects, the Deluges and Inundations of Treasons, Con∣spiracies, and Rebellions: The miserable Wrecks of King∣doms and Empires, shatter'd and broken by their Fury, are still visible in the Maps of History and Chronology; and if we enquire more curiously into the Fate and Fall of the most Glorious Monarchies and Flourishing Govern∣ments that have been in the Universe▪ we shall find, That treacherous Ambition hath ever undermined the Founda∣tions, and that successful Ʋsurpation assisted by Popular Frenzie, hath thrown down their lofty Battlements, and laid them level with the Dust. Most wretched certainly have those Places and People been, wherever these two Enemies of Mankind have enter'd; for these extraordi∣nary Changes and Revolutions, however begun with the most plausible Pretences of The Publick Good, the Re∣dressing of Grievances, Asserting of Popular Liberty, Repres∣sing of Tyranny, or Reforming of Government, have always been managed with vast Expences of humane Blood, have been accompanied with all manner of Outrages, Vio∣lence, Cruelty, Injustice, Rapine, Destructions, and horri∣ble Mischiefs; and have been consummated and finished in the Slavery, even of those, who had so prodigally ex∣pended their Blood and Treasure to promote those Ʋ∣surpations. Nor is it necessary to establish the truth of this Assertion, by introducing a long train of Examples, since it is so obvious, as at first sight to occur to the memory and ob∣servation of such, as have any manner of acquaintance with the Histories of former Times, or have almost in any sort travelled beyond the Smoke of their own Fires. But certainly, no Age, no Time, no Country, is able to afford us a Parallel to that horrible Tragedy which was so lately Acted upon our own Theatre: Never was there a more horrid, premeditated Conspiracy, whose Founda∣tions were laid so deep, so secret, and with so much devi∣lish Art: Never was any Treason, after it once came to look abroad, and was fledg'd into the Cockatrice of Rebellion, more furious and impetuous: Never any Rebellion more
dismal, bloody, wicked, or outrageous; and never did Pros∣perous Treason animate the Traitors to those unheard of flights of insolent Wickedness, so as not only to sub∣vert the Government, and dethrone their Soveraign, but to Arraign and Judge, Condemn and Execute their King, with all the solemn and impudent Formalities of pre∣tended Justice, even in the Face of the Sun, and view of the whole World, as if they would at the same instant de∣fie both the Vengeance of Heaven and Earth. Nor was it the least degree either of the Artifice or Villany of those Execrable Conspirators, that, like the Devil, they came clothed in Samuel's Mantle, and covered their Rebellion with the Popular Varnish of Religion, which they did with that success, that not Mahomet himself, that prodigious Impostor, ever seduced the wild Arabians, with his Pidgeon and pretended Inspirations, to those degrees, that these Sanctimonious Rebels did the credulous Herd (for they deserve no better name) of their Partisans and Followers: Nor was it a few Wild and Crazy Enthusiasts only, that made these pretensions, and that wicked use of them, to such extraordinary Commerces with Heaven, even when they were out-doing Hell in Mischief, but the whole Lump and Mass of the Faction, Presbyterians, Independents, the Assembly of their Divines, the Leading men of the Fa∣ction, and the following Crow'd great and small, of what Sects or denominations soever, however mortally disagree∣ing in other things, all of them according to their degrees, more or less, unanimously laid a claim to Inspirati∣on, and an immediate Familiarity with God Almighty: Nothing was more frequent in their Mouths, than seek∣ing God, and they were sure to find him in their Extempore Effusions, which they arrogantly boasted were the dictates of the Holy Ghost, and which, to depress the Established Li∣turgie and stated Forms, was, by way of Eminence and Excellency, by them termed praying by the Spirit. The suc∣cesses, which, for reasons best known to the Supreme Wis∣dom, followed their Rebellious Arms, they boldly called the Return of those Prayers, and by an impious insolence, peculiar to them, they Intituled God to the most transcen∣dent wickedness, indeavouring to consecrate Murder, Treason,
Sacrilege, Perjury and all their most horrible Impieties, by ascribing them to the immediate direction, and almost Mi∣raculous Cooperation of Divine Providence: And with this Devilish Hypocrisie, they so dazled the infatuated Vul∣gar, and less discerning minds of the People, that what they so arrogantly boasted, came to be almost as easily, and ge∣nerally believed, That that Cause must needs be Gods, which was carried on by a praying People; and being successful must needs be blessed; and that, as they fought for God, which they ne∣ver failed to proclaim, so he reciprocally ingaged in their Party, and fought for them. Thus the Famous Doctor of the Independents, could, with the utmost Effrontery, ha∣rangue the People at this rate, Where is the God of Marston-Moor? and the God of Naseby? is an acceptable Expostu∣lation in a Gloomy day. O what a Catalogue of Mercies has this Nation to plead by in a time of trouble! God came from Naseby, and the Holy one from the West, Selah. (Owens Eben-Ezer. p. 13. And indeed this was the constant Method of these Impostors, to magnifie themselves and Cause, and to give both Courage and Reputation to their Party, by intituling God to the dismal Consequences of lucky Rebellion. But the Vizard by continual use was at last worn so thin, that the ugly and real Devil began to appear through the painted Angel of Light; and those Reforming Saints, began to tread so heavy upon the neck of the Nation, that they found they had mistaken shrewdly; and that it was a Cloven-foot, with which these high pretenders to the Clo∣ven-tongues, trampled upon, and broke in pieces, the Go∣verment, Ancient Laws, Liberties, Properties, and even Re∣ligion it self, and that the Cause, which before was said to be God's, was in reality at last nothing but their Own; a per∣fect Foot-stool, by which they mounted themselves to the Throne of Soveraign, boundless, and unaccountable Power. For the Royal Prerogative, the true supporter of the Peoples Liberties and Laws, being gone, and the Royal Party and Power broken, I find Tomasin's Col∣lection of Petiti∣ons Anno 1647. a Petition, Dec. 9th. 1647. from the Counties of Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, Essex, Herts, Berks, Bucks, Oxon, Suffolk, Northampton, Dorset, Sommerset, Lan∣cashire, Lincolne, Cheshire, Durham, Cumberland, Worcester,
and Warwick, most grievously and lamentably complai∣ning of Free Quarter, and their Miseries under the Op∣pression of the Army, and of the Insolence of the Soul∣diers, who would frequently call them to their Faces, Con∣quered Slaves, and treat them accordingly; as also com∣plaining of the Remonstrances, and other Papers of the Army, destructive of all Liberty, and even of their darling Parliaments, which they had so often, and so solemnly Pro∣tested, Covenanted, and Vowed to defend and maintain. But the Faction wholly threw off the useless Mask them∣selves, when having entirely subdued the scattering Re∣mains of the Loyal Party, the Army by their interest in the Commons-house, most of the Principal Officers having been obtruded upon the Nation, as their Representatives there, and none daring to oppose them, began not only to usurp the Soveraign Power, but to subvert the very Foundations of the Ancient English Government, and by the Destruction not only of the King, but of the Mo∣narchy it self, to erect a new Democratique Tyranny un∣der the name of The Common-wealth of England: In which the People, though nothing less was intended them, were in themselves Originally, and by deputation in their Representatives, pretended to be the Supreme Authority of this Nation; but in reality these Representatives, who became such by the prevailing Authority of the Sword, and not by free Elections, being just so many boundless and unlimited Tyrants, whose Will was a Law, and to whose imperious pleasure all the rest of the Nation were con∣strained to submit, and take from their hands the most Arbitrary Yoke of Vassallage and Slavery; every thing lay at the discretion of their Mercy, the Laws, the Lives, the Liberties, the Estates of all, without distinction or dis∣crimination, the Peer and the Peasant were wholly and entirely subjugated to their uncontrolable Jurisdiction; and as to Religion, their first and great Pretence, that was left to shift for it self, all men being left at Liberty to chuse any or none; and it was all one now to these glorious Reformers, whether a man were an Infidel, a Pagan, a Mahometan, or a Jew, provided he had the wit to say it was his Conscience, and make Profession to live peaceably, and acquiesce under
to introduce them, to fill the heads of the People with fu∣rious Fears, and raging Jealousies, and at the same time both to alienate the Affections of his People from their King, and by Disobedience to his Ecclesiastical Laws, to teach them a Contempt even of his Secular Power, and to put them even into the nearest approaches to Sedition, and to seem to want nothing but a favourable occasion to pre∣cipitate them into a new Rebellion; all this considered, one cannot but be tempted to think that this ingrateful impe∣nitence, and obstinacy, menaces these obdurate Sinners with some Uncommon and Remarkable Vengeance. Amongst all their other Arts, so dangerous and destru∣ctive to the present Constitution of our Government, I cannot think it either the smallest or least dangerous, which the Dissenters, from the Monarchick Government as well as the Church of England, have made use of; for though nothing of Fact can be more notoriously true, than that they actually either Murther'd the late King, or were Aid∣ing, Abetting, and Assisting to such as did, yet to preserve some Reputation to their Party, and that they may be able to increase it, by such as they can by their pretensions to Purity and Sanctity delude, they constantly endeavour to shift all the Guilt of this Execrable Regicide from them∣selves, and charge it upon others; the Fact, they are well aware, is so ugly and wicked in its own Nature, and ac∣companied with so many aggravating Circumstances, that there are few Natures, who would not at first sight start at it, as at the Apparition of some terrible Daemon; this therefore must be totally denied, where it may with suc∣cess, or palliated by making the King Guilty of the War, and of his own Murder, the Effect of it; full well do these Deceivers know, that if the poor infatuated People were really perswaded and convinced, that the Leaders of their Party, and the precious Men their Teachers, had been Guil∣ty of such a detestable Murder, even the Dictates of com∣mon Sense, Reason, and Natural Religion would instruct them, That such Guilty Miscreants, whose Hands blushed with Innocent Blood, must needs be unfit to lift up to Heaven, the just Avenger of it; and that such Men must needs be very unfit and unproper Guides and Conductors
of others to Heaven, who had travelled so far in Re∣bellion, the High Road to Hell, without ever looking, or making one step backwards by Repentance. The Presbyterians therefore in this particular have ever stood high upon their Justification, as being therefore Innocent of the Guilt of this Royal Blood, because then when the Fatal Stroke was given, they were luckily displa∣ced from the Helm of State, by the prevailing Faction and Interest of the Independents: The Independents, when they are charged with this barbarous Fact, they endeavour to transfer all the blame from themselves and Party, by throwing it upon a Junto of ill men, who then Governed, and had gotten all the Power; and though those very bloody and infamous Traitors, Cromwel, Ireton, Peters, Nye, &c. were, while living, esteemed by them most Heroick and renowned Saints, and would have Pillars and Monu∣ments erected to their immortal Memories, had they Power equal to their Kindness to those Glorious Villains, who are still the Idols of their Hearts; yet they would make this pass for excuse sufficient for the whole Compa∣ny of their Perswasion, that they were not every individu∣al man of them actually upon the Trial and Condem∣nation of the King, or set their Hands and Seals to the Warrant for his Execution: So that consenting to, appro∣ving, and applauding the Fact when done, must pass for Innocence, that so they may plead Not Guilty, though af∣ter all this, the Survivers of those differing Factions, and their Successors in the same Principles, were never heard or known to manifest so much, as, in the cheap way of words, their unfeigned detestation, and abhorrence of that wick∣ed Rebellion, which brought the King to that deplorable Death; and I think, without breach of Charity, I may in∣troduce their Famous Baxter, who is the whole Schisme in Epitome, neither Presbyterian, Independent, &c. but both, and all of them, speaking the true sense of the whole body of the Separation; and I am confident, if they had all one Mouth, and he were the Tongue (the Office he would chuse) he would speak for them in his Language of the Ho∣ly Common-wealth; I cannot see that I was mistaken in the main Cause, nor dare I repent of it, nor forbear the same, if
it were to do again in the same state of things. (Baxters Holy Common-wealth, pag. 486.) And therefore, if this Argument happens to be started, though the late Statute, which makes some sorts of Lan∣guage Treasonable, render them more cautious and reserv∣ed, yet they will plead for themselves, that Matters were carried to those Extremities, much beyond the intention of those who first took up Arms against the evil Counsel∣lors, and had no ill Design either against the Person of the King, or his just Power and Prerogative; but they will dye before they will acknowledge, that the War on the Parlia∣ments side, let the pretended Reasons be what they will, was unjust and unlawful, and that the taking up Arms by Subjects against their King, is not only unlawful but damnable: Now the maintaining of this Opinion of the Lawfulness of the War, was that which in reality cut off the Kings Head▪ And will be the Eternal Parent of future Rebellions, so long as it is propagated and received. For if Subjects may upon any colourable pretensions, which can never be wanting so long as Men are Wicked enough to invent them, be allowed to take up Arms against their King; it is morally impossible but things must proceed to the utmost Extremities; for he that draws his Sword against his King, must throw away the Scabbard; and it is a Crime of so high a Nature, that tho' there should be found a King of so God-like a Temper, as really to pardon the greatest Rebels, yet the Consciousness of their own Guilt, and the perpetual apprehensions of deserved Punishment, will never permit such Rebels to believe his intentions real and sincere, and therefore the uneasiness of their fears, naturally conducts them to cure their Fears, and consult their future Safety, by removing the Cause of their distrust and danger. But however these two Factions, and the Spawn of them, may endeavour to palliate this horrid Guilt, and, that they may be the better enabled to maintain their Party and in∣crease it, may endeavour to acquit themselves by crimi∣nating one another, nothing is more evident, than that both these Factions of the Presbyterians and Independents, and the other lesser Sects and Schismaticks which sprung
from their Roots, were actually Guilty of the Kings Mur∣der; and that not only by their fomenting and carrying on the War against him, whereby he was reduced to those Extremities, that he was forced to throw himself upon the Perjured Scottish Presbyterians, who sold him to the Eng∣lish Independents, who Murdered him, but also by not hindring and preventing the doing of it. For it is a most certain Truth, Qui non prohibet, cum potest, jubet. For instance, Two Thieves bind an honest Man and rob him, one is for dispatching him out of the way, that he may not ever be in a capacity to prosecute them, the other pretends, he does not so well approve of that last Extremity; while they are in the contest, the honest Mans Servant comes up, and finding his Master in that condition, puts himself in a posture to attempt his Rescue; now he who was pretend∣edly against the Murder, though he could well enough di∣spence with the Robbery, if he had meant sincerely, ought rather to have assisted the Loyal Servant in his Generous and Dutiful Design; and it had then been easie to have deliver∣ed the despoiled Prisoner, at least from the danger of Death; but instead of this, he joyns with his former Companion, and assists him first to dispatch the Servant, who indea∣voured his Masters Deliverance, and then sits him down, while his Companion sends his Fetter'd Master to keep him Company. Now do I appeal to God and Men, whe∣ther both these men were not involved in equal guilt, as well he, who help'd to bind, disarm, and rob the Master, and opposed the honest indeavour of his Servant to deli∣ver him, as he who actually imbrued his Hands in their innocent Blood. The Case is exactly the same, but under this more hai∣nous aggravation, that Royal Blood is much more valuable and Sacred, than that which runs in Common veins. The Zealous Presbyterian Saints began the late Rebellion, and the Independents and other Schismaticks, being associated with them in that Traiterous Combination or the Solemn League and Covenant, they joyntly and unanimously pro∣secuted the War, and, by murdering of such of his Loy∣al Subjects, as out of Duty and Conscience came to his assistance, having subdued his Forces, they got his Person
into their Power. The Independents, having in the mean time gotten the Ascendant of Power over the Presbyteri∣ans, were absolutely for assuring their Usurpation by the King's death; on the other side the Presbyterians, more out of detestation of the Independents, who now began to deride their Discipline, and have their Blew-Cap-Reforma∣tion, as they termed it, in the utmost contempt and ha∣tred, than out of true Loyalty and Duty to the King, were for shackling of His Majesty with Parliament Fetters, and so to let him live; hoping under the protection of his Authori∣ty and Name, to re-establish their own Power, and sub∣due the Independents: And for this purpose was all the noise of a Personal Treaty with the King, during his Confinement at Cairsbrook Castle in the Isle of Wight; in which, if they had meant honourably and sincerely, they might have had such Conditions as would have brought sufficient advan∣tage and reputation, both to their Cause and Interest: But so stiff were they in their Demands, and so cautious to put strong and lasting Fetters upon His Majesty, that the whole Treaty came to nothing. In the mean time the Royalists, seeing the gasping condition of the King and Monarchy, and that nothing but the most abject Vassallage was to be expected from those Men, who were resolved to make their King a Royal Slave; they summoned their scattered Force to make one Vigorous Attempt for his deliverance: Now, had the Presbyterians joyned in that generous De∣sign, in all humane probability, the King had been rescued from his Captivity among the Independents; by which means they might have obtained honourable Conditions of Oblivion, Security and Accommodation for the Present, and Reputation for the Future: But so far were they from this, that mortally hating the Loyal Party, they contribu∣ted all that lay in their power to assist the Independent Army under Fairfax, or indeed Cromwel, for the other was but a Cypher, utterly to ruine and subdue the slender Remains of Loyalty which had taken Arms in Kent and Essex; which when it was accomplished, by the surrender of Colchester, and the Execution of the Noble Capel, Lisle, and Lucas, the Independents fell presently upon their Bloody Project of cutting off the King, and subverting
the Monarchy, which they also effected, the Presbyterians all this while sitting still and looking on: Whereas, had they ever heartily opposed such a detestable Wickedness, their Party was then so considerable, that, with the Addi∣tion of the Loyal Interest, which was not so dead, but that upon the least hope it would have revived and joyned them, they might have given such a shock to the Inde∣pendent Faction, that they would difficultly, if ever, have been able to accomplish or execute their Execrable Design against the Life of the King; but so far were they from this, that there was not the least Attempt to oppose the Traytors, or prevent the Treason. Nay, had the Rabble of the City and Suburbs, which were much at the Devo∣tion of the Presbyterian Interest, had but half so much Zeal to hurry down to Westminster, to oppose the Murder of the King, as they had before times to oppose him, and cry up Priviledge of Parliament, in the beginning of the Tumults, it is very disputable, whether Cromwel, with all his black Myrmidons, would have had the Courage to strike the Fatal Stroke. But the Presbyterians are only Coura∣gious in Rebellion, but perfect Cowards in the Cause of Loyalty. But to these little palliating shifts, to which the Presbyte∣rians and Independents have been reduced, to varnish and guild over their Infamous Actions, they have now very lately found out another, and that is, to vindicate themselves, by charging the whole Contrivance and Execution of this hellish Murder of the late King, upon the Papists: And though nothing in the World is more ridiculous or re∣mote from the truth in most demonstrable Matter of Fact, yet it is incredible, how much the belief of this senseless Fiction and Romance has gained upon this new Genera∣tion of the Vulgar Proselytes of the Dissenters: And I speak it of my own knowledge, that in Discourse with di∣vers of them, when I have made use of this Argument of the Wickedness and Infamy of the most Eminent Pa∣trons of their Religion, who, as Mr. Baxter confesses of himself, when he tells us, I have been in the heat of my Zeal so forward to Changes and Ways of Blood, that I fear God will not let me have a hand in the Building of his Church,
Hypocrisie unveil'd, R. Baxter's Letters to Dr. Hill, pag. 11.) must needs be ill men, and worse Guides to Heaven, and have, from their guilt of the Kings Blood, indeavou∣red to reclaim them from following the Witchcraft of such dangerous Principles, and to bring them home to the Communion of the Loyal and Primitively obedient Church of England; I have been amazed to hear, with what confidence they have vindicated their Leaders and Party, from the least share or imputation of the guilt of that Horrid Murder, and averred with as much confidence, that the late King was murdered by the Papishes, as they call them, as if it had been true beyond all contradiction. I have no design, to turn Advocate for the Romish Re∣ligion, and profess my self to have a most deep detesta∣tion and abhorrence for Sanguinary, Traiterous, Sediti∣ous, Disloyal, and King-killing, or deposing Principles, in any Religion or Perswasion whatsoever, and do firmly be∣lieve, that, That Religion which holds, justifies, or tole∣rates such Principles, is so far Erroneous, False, and Dam∣nable: But this being a perfect piece of Leger-de-main, pur∣posely calculated to deceive the Common-people into a good opinion of the worst, and most dangerous Ene∣mies of the Monarchy, the Dissenters, and thereby to enable them still to spread the Venom of their Principles, under the Vail of Innocence, and to make this Innocence ap∣pear by transferring the Guilt of their former Actions upon others, I think it of so mischievous Consequence, that it ought to be obviated, and the falshood detected and made evident by the Beams of most irrefragable Truth. And therefore, for ever to silence all these foolish and frivolous Arts and Palliations, and to take away the Fig-leaves, which these guilty sinners have so Artificial∣ly patch'd together, and to shew to the whole World from their Own Memoirs, that it was the very real Pres∣byterians, Independents, and other Sectaries, their Associ∣ates, and no other, who were actually guilty of the whole Scene of this horrible Murder of the King. The Orignal Journal of the whole proceedings of that detestable Murder, and the previous Tryal, which was drawn up by the Order of the Regicides, and presented
then to the Commons-House, and there publickly read, and approved for a true Record, and which is attested un∣der the Hand of Phelps, the Clerk to that pretended High Court of Justice, having by pure accident, shall I call it, or particular Providence come to my hands, and ha∣ving the opportunity to take a true Copy or Transcript of it, I thought my self bound in Conscience, by the Duty which I owe to my King, and the Peace and happi∣ness of my Country, to make it publick; that, if it were possible, all true English-men might be made sensible of the horrid Guilt and danger of such Men, and such Prin∣ciples, and so far consult their own, and the Interest of their Posterity, as to endeavour such a true and thorough Reformation, as can only make the present and future Ages happy, which can never be hoped for, so long as the Whoredoms and Witchcrafts of this Painted Jezabel of the Old Presbyterian and Independent Cause, are continued and cherished among us: And most assuredly, it is the Duty of every good Christian and Loyal Subject, to contribute the utmost of his endeavours to suppress the Growth of such dangerous Principles, as drive men so fu∣riously headlong, with the pretences of Religion, to the most daring and desperate Extremities of Treason and Rebellion, and to the very Precipice of Damnation. I do not herein pretend, to exceed the Limits of a pri∣vate Person, or hereby foolishly to undertake to pre∣scribe Measures to the Government in the Management of this Important Affair; but within my own Sphere, I cannot but think my self and all other private Persons, according to their Capacity, Opportunities, and Power, under an indispensable Obligation to oppose and indea∣vour to stop the Impetuous Torrent of these wicked, bloo∣dy, and unpeaceful Opinions and Principles, which have once before drowned this Nation in Bloodshed and Mise∣ry, and who by their swelling and breaking over all the banks of Law, Duty, and Obedience, threaten us with continual dan∣ger and apprehensions of a more cruel and dreadful Inunda∣tion: and I esteem my self warranted to oppose them, by their Example, since the diligence, assiduity, and restless endea∣vours, with which they do, to a single man of the Party,
pursue their Ends and Wicked Interest, makes it absolute∣ly the Duty as well as Interest of all such as are Loyal, who love their Country, Church, and King, as heartily, unani∣mously, and zealously to make head against them, and en∣deavour to crush this Cockatrice in the Egg, which other∣wise will most certainly disclose a fiery flying Serpent. And I cannot see any Expedient so probable to succeed, as the exposing them naked and stript of their Artificial Trappings, Painting, and Counterfeit Gems of Sanctity and Innocence, with which they are wont to impose upon the Minds of credulous and easie People. I shall only therefore bring them to be surveyed by the light of Nature, Reason, Interest, and Religion, and that I may do them the most Impartial Justice, shew them to the World in the Glasses of their own making; and, if there they do not like the Figure and Image which they make, they ought only to quarrel their own deformities, which will not in any Glass, except that of their own flattering and false Opinion, afford them any Shape less Monstrous and Ugly. And I verily perswade my self, that were the Common-People of this Nation throughly instructed by those, whose Duty it is to perform that Charitable Office, in the black Consequences, which necessarily, naturally, and unavoida∣bly follow the Principles of those Leading Men of the Se∣paration, and made sensible how much they are the Ene∣mies to our Peace and Happiness, both here and hereaf∣ter, even Nature and Humanity would teach Men to abandon them, as the most dangerous Cheats and cruel Impostors; and they, who now admire the Beauty of these Painted Sepulchres, the Seditious Meeting Houses, were they aware of the Devil's Trap-Doors of Rebellion and Dam∣nation, which are there planted, would be more cautious of crouding into them: And were it possible, as I think it is easie, if it were vigorously indeavoured, to convince the deluded Vulgar, who have these Mens Persons in such ad∣miration, and who are so apt to be inchanted with the Songs of these bewitching Syrens, that under all those fair Words and sanctimonious Pretences, this Whining about Gospel Liberty and Persecution for Conscience, this Puking at decent Ceremonies, and more decent and beautiful Order
and Government, this bellowing against Antichrist, Popery, and Prelacy, there is all this while concealed, the Ruine of their Country, the Destruction of the Government, the Subversion of the Laws, Sedition, Tumults, Insurrections, Murder, Fire and Sword, Slavery and Infamy, and at the last Eternal Damnation, and endless Torments, certain∣ly they would not only forsake, but detest and abhor those Impostors and Deceivers. Now all this is as demonstratively true, as to the matter of former Fact, and future Consequence, as God is true and just, and as that is True and Canonical Scripture, which from the Mouth of Gods infallible Spirit, assures us, without any Limitation or Reservation, without any Ex∣ception or Dispensation, That whosoever resist the Higher Powers, resist the Ordinance of God, and shall receive to them∣selves Damnation. Now, if Rebellion be resisting the Higher Powers, as certainly if that be not, nothing is, and if we be able to prove those of the Separation, to a single Man of them, Guilty of it, either in Fact or in Principles, or in Both, then are they certainly within the danger of this Terrible Sentence: Let the Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, &c. therefore shew us a Dispensation as Authentick, as this Command, to tolerate Them and their Disciples, to raise Seditions, to defame their King and his Government, to cancel the Obligations of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, to contemn the Laws, to disobey the lawful Commands of their Superiors, and at the last, if they have strength and opportunity, to take up Arms and Rebel, and if they prevail to shake off the Yoke of Subjection and due Obedience, Imprison and Murder their King, dis-inherit his Lawful Heirs and Successors, to all which, their Principles have led them, and Naturally and Eter∣nally will lead them; and then indeed they may, as they presumptuously do, promise Heaven to Themselves, and Followers: But till they are able so to do, and to pro∣duce a New Gospel, with a Patent of Indulgence from Christ and his Apostles, to supersede the Obligation of his former Commands, and to change not only the Names but the Nature of things, by turning Rebellion into Reli∣gion, and violating the Laws of God and Man into Obe∣dience,
they will remain under the unavoidable danger of the intolerable Penalty, annexed to Resisting the High∣er Powers, and in conclusion, will most assuredly find a Hell instead of a Heaven, and Damnation in the place of that Happiness, which the Heads of the Separation do as con∣fidently promise to their Followers, as they vainly expect from their Teachers. Whether it have proceeded from mistaken Charity, or, which is much worse, from a Cowardly Timorousness of fal∣ling under the Indignation of the Dissenters, and conse∣quently of most severe Revenge, if ever they have pow∣er to execute it, I cannot tell; but truly in my Opinion, the not pressing of these necessary Truths upon the People, of the unlawfulness of Rebellion, upon any pretence what∣soever, and their danger of Damnation, in following these Hellish Principles, of Popular Soveraignty, Reformation by Blood, Tumults, and the Power of the Sword, of the Lawfulness of Deposing, Judging, and inflicting Capital Punishments upon Soveraign Princes; and the want of ex∣posing the necessary Consequences of these and such like Fatal Opinions, and shewing them the horrible Influences, they have formerly had upon the Peace and Happiness of the Nation, it is to be feared, hath contributed too much to the increase of the Vulgar part of the Faction. And truly this necessary work is so easie to be done, from plain matters of undeniable Fact, that there need be no recourse to Rhetorical Amplifications, or Hyperboli∣cal Expressions, to move not only the Passions, but the Reason of all Mankind to the utmost degrees of Hatred and Abhorrence against such dreadful Principles: The Treasons, Conspiracies, the Wars, the Rapines, the Hypocri∣sies, Perjuries, and Sacrileges, the Butcheries, Oppressions, Murders, and those Rivers of Innocent Blood, and, which surpasseth all, the Blood of their King, through which these Separatists have waded, to obtain by the Power of Rebellion and the Force of the Sword, an usurped So∣veraignty, and unlimited Arbitary Dominion over the People of these Nations, thereby to render the freest People of the World, the vilest Slaves in the Universe, are certainly such undeniable Truths, which are justly charge∣able
upon them, as are sufficient to set such an Eternal Brand of Infamy upon those, who have been guilty of them, as would render it impossible for them to deceive the People by their other Arts, and pretended Sanctity; and truly their making Religion stoop to their base Designs, and thereby prostituting that which is most Sacred, to the most unhallowed Actions, and most unparallel'd Wickedness, would be so far from doing them any ad∣vantage, that, to all honest, virtuous, and religious Minds, it would make them appear more horrible and odious, because becoming thereby more mischievous and dan∣gerous: for the Devil, transformed into the shape of an Angel of Light, is no less a Devil for his stoln brightness, and the very stealing of that Glorious Shape ought rather to make him be esteemed of the worst sort of those In∣fernal Spirits, because he only takes it upon him, to be thereby inabled to do the more Mischief to Mankind, and to cheat them out of Happiness, by pretending to make them Happy: And if the Embasing, Washing, and Counterfeiting of Money, be such a deceipt, as hath meri∣ted Capital Punishment, and hath rendred the Offenders Infamous and Odious to all men, because it robs them of some part of their share of the Riches of this World, how much more Odious and Capital an offence is it, against God and Man, to Embase and Counterfeit Religion, and to cheat men of their Souls and Bodies, by stamping the Impress and Superscription of Heaven upon the Metal of Hell, and putting off this false Coyn for Good, Cur∣rant, and Eternal Treasure? Now let the Dissenting Separatists disclaim and disa∣vow this Imposture with never so much Scorn or Confi∣dence, and make the wonted boasts of their Sanctity and Purity, reprobating all others, besides themselves, yet if the Apostle St. James 3. cap. 15, 16, 17. ver. St. James have any Authority with them, let him be the Judge and Umpire of the difference, He affirms that the Wisdom (or Religion, for Religion is the only Wisdom), which is from above, is not only Pure, but Peaceable, Gentle, Easie to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, The word  im∣ports rerum sta∣tus inconfusus inturbatus, sine lite. unturbulent, and without Hypocrisie, and that the Religion which produces Strife, Envying, Confusion and
every evil Work, is so far from being of Divine Original▪ and descending from above, that it is earthly, sensual, and devilish: This is the Criterion, the Touch-stone, which we challenge the shining Chymical Religion of the Separatists to indure the Assay by, and I am assured, if we must try the truth of their Faith by the standard of their own Works, and this Apostolical Rule, it will be utterly impossible for them, to make out their Title to that true Religion, which they they do so arrogantly boast of, and so wholly appropriate to Themselves and Party, that though Heaven be capacious enough to entertain the Inhabitants of a thousand Earths, yet can they not allow one inch to any, besides those of their Perswasion: And 'tis no wonder, if their own narrow Souls perswade them, they are only in the narrow way; but the Pharisees, their Predecessors in Principles and Pretensions, were never the nearer to entring into the Glorious Gates of Eternity, for their being so busie in framing Bolts and Locks to exclude all others from entring into those Bles∣sed Regions. And not to pass over even the Narrow Seas, and there to trace these Turbulent Men and their Principles through all the Paths of Mischief, which they have beaten in For∣reign Countries, whereby they have forfeited all Right to St. James's Character of the true Religion, which is peaceable, as well as pure; our own dear England, our Cities, or Towns, our Villages, our prophaned Temples, and our Holy Altars thrown down as Idolatrous, our blushing Fields, and our bleeding Laws, our gasping Liberty, and expiring Religion, our Estates consumed with Arbi∣trary Taxes, and heavy Impositions unknown to our ge∣nerous Ancestors; so many Oppressions, Exactions, Plun∣der, and Free Quarter, such vast Treasures borrowed up∣on the Publick Faith, Sequestrations and Compositions exhausted, so many thousand Lives as perished in the late Calamitous Rebellion, the entire subversion of the Go∣vernment, and the barbarous Murder of a Lawful King, thousands of living Witnesses and Sufferers under the Cruelty and Bondage of their Ʋsurpation, nay, their own Authentique Records, Declarations, Protestations, Cove∣nants and Associations, and, which is more than all these,
their own Consciences are Witnesses before God and the whole World of Men and Angels, that the ways of Peace are not known to them, or make any part in the Composition of their Religion; but that, notwithstanding their high Pretensions to Purity, Seditions, Tumults, Insurrections, Treason and Rebellion are the Fruits and Effects, the Con∣sequences and Conclusion of the Separation, which begins with Whining in a Conventicle against Ceremonies and Persecution for Conscience sake, but in the end advances into the open Field with the loud Arguments of Drums and Trumpets, the thundering Language of the Cannon, and in downright defiance and opposition of Lawful Government and Authority by Arms and Violence, or the baser ways of secret Treasons and Assassinations. Had there been indeed but one single Instance of the mischievous and dangerous inclinations of these com∣bined Factions, it were sufficient for ever to ruine their Re∣putation amongst wise and sober minded Men: But they have given so many repeated Testimonies of their hatred of the present Government both Civil and Ecclesiastical, and of a restless, turbulent, and unreclaimable Temper, obstinately resolved upon the first opportunity to Attempt the Subversion and Ruine of them both, that there can∣not be the least excuse found out to plead in mitigation of their Crimes: But to all their former Guilt, and the very late disturbances and seditious behaviour of which they have, under the new Denomination of The True Protestants, been most notoriously guilty, the detection of this last Execrable Conspiracy to take off the most Gra∣cious and Indulgent Prince in the World, and his Illustrious and only Brother the Duke, by the most infamous me∣thod of Assassination, is such a demonstrative Evidence of their implacable Malice, that they cannot add any thing more Black and Wicked, to render them, till they abandon these Trayterous Principles, most detestable and odious to all Loyal Subjects and good Christians. The Faction indeed stand much upon their Tiptoes again, now their first Consternation for the Discovery is over, and because they are not to a single man found upon a Muster-Roll among the infamous Conspirators, would from thence
argue a kind of Innocency in the Party: But let any Per∣son consider, that so great an undertaking, as the Sub∣version of this well-built Government, and the justifying of such horrid Methods, by which it was to be begun, was never possibly to be effected by a few Heads or Hands; and that there being an absolute necessity to second the first Blow by a most considerable Force of Arms, and it will be impossible to doubt, but that the Conspirators, though they did not Communicate the Particu∣larities of their Treasonous Design to every Individual person, from whom they expected assistance, yet made themselves most assured of assistance, from a Powerful Party, which should joyn with them to perfect their Execrable purposes. For it is impossible that so many Men, as are known to be of the Conspiracy, both by their own Confession, and the Testimony of so many unexceptionable Witnesses, and Circumstances, should all of them by consent become Ideots and Madmen, to think of accomplishing such ama∣zing Treasons by Miracles or the Strength of Imagina∣tion; it is true, a small number of such desperate hellish Villains, as were imbarqued in the most wicked Enter∣prize, might (I am all horror to name it,) with their Blunderbusses have Assassinated the King and his Royal Brother; but it must be a numerous Party, who must have seconded that Cursed Blow, so as to inable them to overcome all the succeeding Difficulties and Oppositions, which they could not but foresee they must encounter with, from the Loyal Party, who by the Shaftsbury Asso∣ciation, and the well known Malice of the Exclusioners, which comprehended the whole Faction of the Dissenters, would quickly have discovered who were the Traytors, and Murderers of the King and his Brother, and would certainly most vigorously have opposed them, and the progress of their Designs of Ʋsurpation. Now from what Quarter of Heaven, or from what Subterranean Caverns must this assistance come? Did they expect any of Elisha's Flaming Battalions, or an Army of Aery Combatants? or had they a promise of Forty Thousand Black Bills, that would fight without hands, or a Levy of St. Jago Pilgrims, to make use of these
Black-Bills, to defend and support their blacker Cause? They must certainly be all Lunaticks indeed and Madmen, if they relyed upon an invisible Power. Nor is it to be doubted, but that, how much soever they would have in∣tituled God to the Cause, as their Ancestors and Prede∣cessors in Rebellion had done, yet, like them, they would not so absolutely have reposed their trust in Him, but that they would wisely have thought, the best of their way was to make use of the Arm of Flesh, and a Sword of Steel, which they knew by experience would prove a bet∣ter defence than the Shield of Faith, or their pretended Sword of the Spirit, and enable them to settle Christ in his Throne (as the Presbyterians use to cant it) by dispos∣sessing the King of His: But besides the Old Army Officers, who were to command them, there must be an Army to be commanded; and who could these Levies consist of, but the Factious Schismaticks and Dissenters, who having list∣ed themselves under Separation, the very Standard of the Old Cause, no man in his Senses can doubt, but, had her bloody Colours, wrought with Liberty of Conscience, and Colledges Motto, No Popery, No Slavery, been once displaid in the Field, whole Troops of Zealous Volunteers would, in the Language of their Addresses, have offered their Lives and Fortunes, and hazarded their Souls and Bodies in her service, against the Tyranny of King-ship, the useless∣ness and danger of Peerage, and the Antichristianism of Prelacy and Popery: Pentland Hills, and Bothwel Bridge give us good assurance of the Inclinations and Forwardness of these pretended Saints, to take up Arms and propagate the Gospel by the wrong Sword; though if they were not infatuated, even to Perdition, the discovery of their Treasons, and the baffling of their repeated attempts a∣gainst Gods Vicegerent, were sufficient to convince them, how disagreeable their Practices, and the Principles which lead them, are to the Divine Majestie and Supreme Monarch of the World. But that which puts this matter out of all dispute, is the Testimony of their own Consciences. The Plot, saith Walcot, one of the Conspirators, is laid broad and deep; and Collonel Sidney professeth boldly, that he dies a Martyr
that Old Cause, in which he had from his Youth been trained up: The Dissenters esteem him no less; Now do I appeal to themselves, if they do not think the Cause, for which he Glories that he died a Martyr, a Righteous Cause? Nay, and Gods Righteous Cause too? If they do not think so, why do they so zealously embrace, and, so far as they may without danger of the Laws, encourage, sup∣port, and defend it, by continuing so pertinaciously in their Separation, the very Badge and distinguishing Cha∣racter of those, who have devoted themselves to it? Most assuredly, if they did not think so of it, they would for ever abandon it. And if they do think and believe, that it is Gods Righteous Cause, they will judge themselves un∣der the most powerful Obligations in the World, upon occasion offered, to be assistant with their Persons or Purses to maintain it, and even to fight the Lords Battels against the Mighty: And were it possible to keep the Two Devils of Fear and Dissimulation from jogging their Elbows, and pulling them by the Sleeves, to make them conceal the depth of their Hearts, I do strongly as∣sure my self, that they would boldly tell the World, and proclaim it by the sound of Trumpet and beat of Drum, That they esteem nothing they possess, not their very Lives, too precious, if they may be instrumental in car∣rying on the Glorious Reformation of the Old Cause. And here are the Dimensions of this late Conspiracy, the depth and breadth of the Plot, which Walcot mentions; which is not one hairs breadth narrower, or one inch shallower, than the united Strength, Power, and Interest of the whole Faction of the Dissenters; who would once again have adventured not only Bodkins and Thimbles, Plate, Money, Horses and Arms, but their Lives also, to set up this Golden Calf of their Old Cause, had not God been more Gracious and Merciful to them and the whole Nation, than to suffer them, by Success in this Wicked Enterprize, to run headlong to our Ruine, and their own Damnation. Let it suffice, That all Wise Men know, that the strength of this detestable Conspiracy was built upon no other Foundation, than the Hopes and Confidence▪ which the
Traytors had, from some of the Principal of them, of the Assistance, the Vigorous, Unanimous Assistance of the Dis∣senters; and that all Good, Honest, and Loyal men believe it; nay, that they who seem most to dispute or doubt it, are conscious to themselves of their own good wishes, not only to the Principal Traytors, but even to the Treason; and since it is well known they have long ago abandoned all shame for such Imputations, nothing but the disap∣pointment of their hopes and expectations, could be the Cause of that Universal damp, consternation, amazement, and dejection which were so visibly painted in their Fa∣ces, that one might know them by those Marks from other men, as they walk't the Streets: And though they are somthing recovered out of the trance of their Sor∣rows, and have reassumed some part of their wonted cou∣rage and confidence, yet even that courage betrays their guilt, whilest they wholly imploy it to discredit all belief of the truth of this Conspiracy: And it is almost impossible, to give a more infallible Demonstration for the certainty of any thing in this World than for this, and that they must of necessity be in some sort or other Guilty them∣selves, who Ridicule, Extenuate, Palliate, Applaud, Justi∣fie, and use all the Arts imaginable, not only to make their Party appear Innocent, but to make the whole Plot an Artifice and a Contrivance, and to arraign the Su∣preme Power and the Justice of the Nation as Guilty, by the Condemnation and Execution of the Principal Tray∣tors and Accomplices in the Treason: And certainly they have no thoughts of abhorrence and detestation of such black and execrable Villanies, nor any intentions to aban∣don them, who do so warmly hugg and cherish the on∣ly Cause of this, and so many other Treasons, Plots, and Conspiracies both against the late King and his present Majestie, their wicked Principle of Separation, which is the Mother of all those Seditions, Insurrections, and Re∣bellions, which to their cost these Nations have so often felt. For when Men have once separated themselves from the Ecclesiastical, they do at the same instant cut the Cords and Ligaments of Obedience to the Civil Govern∣ment;
they, by usurping Soveraign Power to dispense with the Obligation of any one Law, bid open defiance to the very Essence of all Laws, and, without the consent of King, Lords, and Commons, undertake to Abrogate, Re∣peal, and make not only void, but unlawful, and unjust, and intolerable such Acts of Parliament, as were by the Common Consent of the King and the Three Estates of the Realm, Enacted to retain the Subjects in their due Obedience, and cannot without shocking the very Founda∣tions of the Government be cancelled by any other Au∣thority, than that which at first gave them being: So that they are in actual Rebellion even at the first step, though not in actual Arms, and open Hostility, against the King, the Laws, and the very Constitution and Life of the Go∣vernment, which consists in the Power and Authority of making Laws, and exacting Obedience to them: Now this disobedience to the Laws, and thereby disowning the Authority which made them, naturally leads the trans∣gressors to fear the Penalties of those Laws which they have violated, and to dread the threatning edge of the Sword of Justice, the Guardian of those Laws, with which the Supreme Magistrate is by God intrusted, to punish the Disobedient, and preserve the Peace and Tranquillity of Human Society; Now Fear is only so much the El∣der Brother of Hatred, as Esau was to Jacob, that smooth Supplanter, ever lays hold of the Heel of its hairy Bro∣ther; and when men are once advanced to hate what they fear, they do immediately proceed to wish, desire, and indeavour to put themselves out of the reach of danger, from what they both fear and hate. When these two Passions thus adopted into the Family of Religion, have once taken full possession of Mens Minds, it is not long before they Precipitate them into the Search of all Ways and Contrivances how to secure themselves; which because they cannot immediately obtain, they presently fall to accusing the Laws of Injustice, and the Magistrates of Tyranny and Persecution, that so their disobedience may find a Refuge under the shelter of their pretended Inno∣cence, for which they can have no other Foundation, but the Charging the Laws themselves with want of Equity
and Justice: Nor is the Government only to be thus ac∣cused as unrighteous, and despised as unjust; and obe∣dience to its Laws renounced as unlawful, but their fear and hatred put them upon all the Out-side Acts of Hypocritical Piety, and dissembled Sanctity, that by them they may win both Pity and gain a Party, and so in∣trench themselves in the Fortifications of Numbers, hoping for Impunity, at least from the Multitude of Offenders, which when they have gained, they are not sparing of their secret Menaces, how unsafe it may be to Exasperate, and how Impolitique for the Government, by compelling them to Obedience, to force them to ex∣tremities. No sooner have they gained this Point, and that they apprehend that the Scale is turned, and that the Government, of which they before stood in so much Fear, begins now justly to be in fear of them, but they presently become Insolent in their Actions, Seditious in their words, Frequent in open Menaces, and Bold Petitio∣ners to their Prince for such Favours and Indulgences, as they are well assured, if he grants, he must be ruined, and if he denyes, they are resolved to endeavour by Force to extort them from him, and the Sum of all their Desires at the last centring in their being intrusted with the Pow∣er of the Sword, the difference at last comes to fall under the Fatal Decision and Arbitrement of the Sword. And how matters must be managed, when they come to that dismal Period, and are referred to the determina∣tion of that Ʋmpire, I think little need to be said, and it is yet too fresh in memory, to be again repeated; most certainly War, and especially a Civil War, can never go unattended by the calamitous Legions of Misery, Ruine, Oppression, Murder, Desolations, and all the Licentious Mischiefs, which the Rude and Mercenary Spirits, of which the Inferior Military Men are always composed, can be guilty of. This is the Rare texture of the Spiders Web of Sepa∣ration, in the Centre whereof the Devil of Rebellion sits Enthroned, and though the out-lines of the Circumfe∣rence seem all composed of Innocence, Purity, and Re∣formation, yet when once men come but to touch and
buz about the smallest Cords of this Fatal Net, like foolish Flies they are intangled and caught, and the farther they proceed, and the more they strive, the more are they wrap∣ped and inclosed in the Snares of the Devil. Thus does Separation begin with mistaken Zeal for Re∣ligion, which by easie steps insensibly transports men to defend one Errour by a thousand, and to commit the most horrid impieties and most dreadful sins, to support and maintain that, which they call their Religion: Thus have we seen the Tears of the Widows, and heard the Cries of the Orphans, robbed of their Husbands, Parents, and Estates, for the Glory of God: We have heard the groaning of the Prisoners, and those appointed to die; we have seen so many Loyal Free-Subjects, without and against Law, Reason, and Humanity, brought to Axes, Gibbets, and Halters, and all pretended to be done for God's Righteous Cause and Glory: Robbing of Churches, and defacing of Temples, Crimes which Heathen Idolaters would have blush'd at, were all for the Glory of God too, and the Ho∣nour of his Cause. Nay, there is scarce that horrible kind of Impiety, Blasphemy, or any sort of Wickedness to be named, which was not committed during the late Rebel∣lion under this Pretence; and the most barbarous and in∣humane Outrages, which the afflicted Royalists suffered from these pretended Saints, are so great and many, as it is impossible to recount them, all which were so far from being punished by the Ʋsurping Powers, that they were en∣couraged, applauded, justified, and rewarded as accepta∣ble Services to God and the Parliament; Even Cruelty was become so great a Virtue, that it was one of the choicest subjects of Discourse, and with which the Boanergeses of the Faction were wont from the suffering Pulpit to enter∣tain the People, and Prophane the Temples of the God of Peace, with Exhortations to War and Blood. Well might the God of Peace and Purity send that dismal Fire of London to purge those Temples, whose Beams and Stones had been so tainted by the Leprous breath of Rebellious Preachers, that no whiting or scraping, according to the Mosaick Me∣thod of cleansing Leprous Houses, was sufficient to cleanse them, so as to be fit for the offering up of the Sacrifices of
Prayers and Praises to the everlasting Prince of Peace, or to have the Holy Dove, condescend to dwell among men, and assist their Devotions in those Holy Places. And that I may not seem falsly to accuse them, I will give two or three Instances of this Bloody Divinity; though I could produce a thousand, and they who delight to paddle among such Bloody Tenents, may be sufficiently furnished out of the Printed Sermons of the late Times, a considerable Collection of which may with little pains be seen in my very Excellent Friend, the Malleus Schis∣maticorum, Mr. L'Estranges first and second Books of Dis∣senters Sayings, under the Heads of Reformation by Blood, and The War Justified, &c. Cut down the Malignants, (so was the Royal Party na∣med) with the Sword of Justice, Root them out, and con∣sume them with Fire, that no root may spring again. (Wal∣ker's Sermon, Jan. 29. 1644.) If the Devil himself had fill'd the Pulpit, that Old Walker, who like a Roaring Lion goes to and fro seeking whom he may devour, could not certainly in fewer words have expressed more Com∣prehensive Cruelty, or a more Barbarous Thirst after Humane Blood. But you shall hear another. There is no dallying with God now, saith Case, much delay hath been used al∣ready, too much; God is angry, and he seems to ask this once more, Will you strike? Will you execute Judgment, or will you not? Tell me; for if you will not, I will: I will have the Enemies Blood, and yours too, if you will not exe∣cute Vengeance upon Delinquents, for the Day of Vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my Redeemed is come, Isa 63. (Case, before the Commons, 1644.) Never could the Lips sure of any, who pretended to fear the Divinity which they ador'd, except a Presbyterian's, dare to affront him by such a positive, audacious, and blasphemous Prosopopeia; herein shewing himself a false Prophet by putting on his Horns of Iron, and pushing on every side of him for Blood and Slaughter; never did any wretched and unin∣spired Mortal so presumptuously and peremptorily un∣dertake to speak the Soveraign will and pleasure of the Merciful Creator, as this bold Schismatick does in this most
sanguinary Decree, as if he had been admitted into the Cabinet Council with the Almighty, and had not only out-gon St. Paul who travelled to the Third Heavens, but had received a more ample Commission, than that Apostle, to relate, what the other tells us, 2 Cor. Cap. 12. Ver. 4. was unspeakable and not lawful for a Man to utter: But God be praised, who hath assured us by the Mouths of his Inspired Servants, the Prophets, that he hath no Pleasure in the Death of his Enemies, as this false Pro∣phet would have us believe; and hereby we may easily discover, that it was he, who was a Murderer from the beginning, who inspired them with these Bloody Doctrines, and this Method of abusing Scripture, at which we know he has a most notable Talent. But if any Person desire to see a Summary of the sanguinary desires of the Separatists, he may consult a Pamphlet Intituled, Justices Plea, Printed and Published August, 1st. 1644, of which this is the Abridgment. The Cruel Miscreant addresses himself to the Assembly of Divines, (and by that, he should be a Presbyterian) and vehemently exhorts them to move the High and Honora∣ble Court of Parliament, that Justice may be speedily and severely Executed upon all the most Disloyal and Treacherous Enemies of the Kingdom. For, saith he, One, if not the main, provoking Cause of all our Miseries, is that Wrath-provoking Sin of Impu∣nity, and not Executing Justice and deserved Punishment upon Eminent Offenders and Malefactors amongst us. Then he falls upon quoting and misapplying Scripture, and the History of Achan, Joshua 7th, and from thence pro∣ceeds to charge the Blood of Bohemia, the Palatinate, Ro∣chel, the Isle of Rhee, Ireland and England, upon the King and Loyal Party, whom according to the Presbyterian Rhe∣torick he Styles Papists, Atheists, Pontificians, and Malignants of all Sorts and Sexes; and, adds he, some of them are put into our Hands as so many devoted Achans, accursed ones, yet of all of them, but one Capital Offender, ex∣cept some Inferiour ones, Three in London, and as many at Bristol, brought by our Renowned Joshua's (meaning the Faction of the Two Houses) to deserved Death and Destruction. (P. 1.)
The Remedy, saith he, of England's Malady, which is a State Gangrene, is the serious, zealous, and unpitying Execution of Justice upon the said Malefactors, and by no means out of Pretence of sinful Pity or Partiality to spare the Lives of any, whom God hath thus appointed to Death. And this he endeavours to prove to be a Duty, first, from Precepts, Gen. Cap. 9. Ver. 6. Whosoever sheddeth Mans Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed. This is a general Rule, saith he, and, from one end of the Bible to the other, admits of no Exception either of Princes or Peasants, No∣ble or Ignoble. (So that here you see is a Fatal Blow di∣rectly levell'd at the Kings Neck by the Presbyterian Do∣ctrine, though the Independents robb'd them of the power of putting it in practice) but he goes forward, leaving the impressions of his Cloven-footed Tutor upon every step he takes, and falls with him to his Scriptum est, quo∣ting 1 Sam. Chap. 15. Ver. 2, 3. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, I remember that which Amaleck did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the Way, when he came up from Egypt. Now go, and smite Amaleck, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both Man and Woman, Infant and Suckling, Oxe and Sheep, Camel and Ass. (The Roya∣lists were the Amalekites, and the most Religious King in the World was, in Presbyterian Dialect, Agag; and this was the Doom, to which they were adjudged by these pretended Saints, and that too as peremptorily, as if God had told them his Will by immediate Revelation, as he did to Samuel, and had declared the King and his Loyal Subjects his unpardonable Enemies, and as Wicked Ido∣laters, as were the Amalekites, and their King Agag.) But the killing Blow was alway that passage, Revelations Chap. 18. Ver. 6. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works, in the Cup which she hath filled, fill to her double; and then to be sure they came to the dashing out the Brains of the Babylonish Brats, the Cavaleers, against the Stones. Lastly, adds he, that of the Prophet Jeremy, which I most humbly and heartily desire all our Grave and Godly Parliamentary Worthies should be most often and extraordinarily minded of, Jer. Chap. 48.
ver. 10. Cursed be he, that doth the work of the Lord deceit∣fully, and Cursed be he, that keepeth back his Sword from Blood. Here's a Precept, cries out this Son of the Horseleech, with a witness indeed, a Precept under no less than a Curse, yea an ingeminated Curse, to shew the certainty and seve∣rity of Gods displeasure in the neglect of it; yea we see, it is called a dealing deceitfully with God and Men, to do it slightly, much more not to do it at all; the Lord give those, whom it most nearly concerns, care and conscience timely and truly to set upon it. (Page 3.) But lest the Authority of perverted Scripture-Pre∣cepts should not be sufficient to stimulate and instigate the Heads of the Faction to so much Cruelty, and so many indiscriminating premeditated Murders, he proceeds to furnish Presidents to fortifie his bloody Doctrine; and first, saith he affirmatively, Phineas Executed Judgment on Zimri and Cozbi. Upon which Text, adds he, as Reve∣rend and Mellifluous Mr. Marshal in his Sermon observes, That one man, by his Holy Zeal, may be a means to save a whole Kingdom; how much more then a whole Par∣liament, punishing Offenders in a Legal way by the Rule of Justice. Then he produces Jehu, Executing Vengeance upon Joram and Ahaziah, two Kings, and slaying the seventy Sons of Ahab, and the two and forty Brethren of Ahaziah King of Judah. 2 Kings Chap. 9 and 10. From Positive he proceeds to Negative Presidents, as he calls them, to shew that God was displeased for neg∣lecting Executing Vengeance upon Capital Offenders; instancing in the Quarrel between the Benjamites and Israelites, Judges Chap 20th. the whole Chapter being, as he saith, the very Case of England; comparing the King and his Party to the wicked Benjamites, who had com∣mitted and justified that inhumane Rape upon the Le∣vites Concubine, and the Parliament and Faction to the true Israelites. Then he tells you the story of Ahab's per∣mitting Benhadad to escape, 1 Kings Chap 20. ver. 42. And he said unto him, thus saith the Lord, because thou hast let go out of thy hands a man whom I appointed to utter de∣struction, therefore thy Life shall go for his Life, and thy People for his People. Then he instances in Saul's forfeiting
his Kingdom for sparing Agag, King of the Amalekites, 1 Sam. Chap. 15. Ver. 23. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath rejected thee from being King. (A strong push for Deposing and Murdering the King, as being rejected of God, as Saul was.) But in regard this was addressed to People, who had Pretended most wonderful tenderness of Conscience, lest there should be any remains of that, he comes now to hardning of them by answering an Objection. Obj. What is all this to us of the Ministry? Answ. It concerns you all very much, and you also in the first place, even You, Reverend Gentlemen: Such as are Arch-Enemies to God and his most Righteous Cause, who have suck'd the Blood of Gods precious Ones, are now held in Prison among us; they are only imprison∣ed, but some only pincht in their Purses and set at Liberty, at least from danger of Death: And this I say, nay God says, Justice is grievously neglected, and the just Wrath of God highly incensed and exasperated against us for the same. Now you, Reverend Gentlemen, are Sentinels and Watchmen, Ezek. Chap. 3. Ver. 7. and Chap. 33. Ver. 7, 8. And you are to give timely and serious warning to the Superior Magistrates, Esa. Chap. 58. Ver. 1. Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voices like Trumpets, to Advise, Preach, Petition to purpose, our most Noble and Honorable Par∣liamentary Worthies, to put in serious, zealous, and speedy Execution, this God-pleasing, Wrath-appeasing Work of Severity, and exactly punishing all Grand Offenders, and Arch-Adversaries of God and the Kingdom, whosoe∣ver they be. Then he reminds them, that Justice was done on the Earl of Strafford by the City of London's means, who, a∣bout two years since, with an Unanimous and Zealous consent Assembled gravely and advisedly together, and in a sober and substantial manner by their most hum∣ble Petition, craving and crying out for Justice against that pernicious Traytor, and Cruel Crafty Enemy of the State, the Earl of Strafford, accordingly obtained the thing desired.
And now he comes to intitle God to this Bloody Divi∣nity, and, as if he had adored some of the inhumane Idols of the Pagans, to bespeak Hecatombs of Humane Sacri∣fices to honor and serve him with: Say, saith he, What Honor and Dignity hath been done to God for all the late Victories? Much by the Parliament; but whatever hath been, all is too little; and therefore some Extraordi∣nary and Eminent Work, tending to the High Honour of the Lord, our most glorious wonder-working God; no∣thing like destroying those Achans and Agags, whether Great by Place, or Noble by Birth. But then again, his almost smothered Conscience gets a little breath to cross his sanguinary Divinity with an Objection, whilest he stops her Cries with an imperti∣nent and shuffling Answer. Obj. But what, saith he? Nothing but Blood and Cruel∣ty? Make the Parliament a Parliament of Blood? May not Mercy be as Honourable, as thus fiercely shedding Blood? Answ. I, or rather Gods Word saith, Who art thou that darest call that Act Bloody, which God himself calls Justice and Judgment, and wherein God is so delight∣ed. Secondly, I say not all, but as the Prophet Jeremy, Chap. 15. Ver. 2. Thus saith the Lord, such as are for Death to Death; and such as are for the Sword to the Sword, and such as are for the Famine to the Famine, and such as are for the Cap∣tivity to the Captivity. (So that you see, the tender Mer∣cies of a Presbyterian are Cruelty, and the Merciful Schis∣matick is not altogether for Hanging, Drawing, and Quartering; no, good Man! he is only for Sword, Fa∣mine, and Captivity, for some of them; and I dare say, had the abused Text had Plague, Fire, and Water in it, the Compassionate Creature would graciously have con∣descended to spare the Malignants from Death, to have Committed them to those other lingring Punishments: But here's no Quarter to be given, not one grain of Mercy to be found in his Heart, no Pardon to be had or hoped, and, in the Battel of Presbyterian Vengeance, none are like to escape.)
But now he comes to wind up his Bloody Bottoms, and concludes, That this Advice is given in singleness and sincerity of heart, for that he may say with David, What have I done, is there not a Cause? Here is the very Heart, the Soul, the Conscience of a True Protestant Schismatick, and indeed the very Spirit of Separation laid naked and open to the view of all Mankind. Here's a Window into the very Bosome of the Faction; where one may see Revenge and Cruelty, Malice and Murder, Hatred of Monarchy, and Contempt of Kings, and ten thousand other Impieties lodged in every corner of his breast. How would these Cruel People now like the Lex Talionis, Adonibezek's Law, not only to have their Toes and Thumbs cut off, but, according to their own Divinity, since they are most manifestly Guilty of what they falsly accuse the Loyal Party, to be Condemned to all the Seve∣rites, which they have so uncompassionately allotted to others: But they are out of that danger, our Religion teaches us a far different Temper, and would they give the Government any tolerable assurance, that it were pos∣sible for them to be peaceable, and forbear pulling the Penalties of the Laws, made for its security, upon their own Heads, they might grow old, and go in quiet to their own, if they would let others hope to do so to their Graves. I will add but one Instance more, and that shall be of Mr. Love, whose unpeaceful Zeal was one great occasion of the breaking off the Ʋxbridge Treaty, by which means so many thousands of poor Souls were sent in the suc∣ceeding Wars, to Untimely and Bloody Deaths. Men, saith he, who lye under the Guilt of much Innocent Blood are not meet persons to be at Peace with, till all the Guilt of the Blood be expiated and avenged, either by the Sword of the Law, or the Law of the Sword. 'Tis the Sword, not Disputes and Treaties, that must end this Controversie; (just point blanck contrary to the Text, which is exactly according to the Presbyterian Divinity). Wherefore turn your Plow-shares into Swords, and your Pruning-hooks into Spears, to fight the Lords Battels, to avenge the Blood of Saints, which hath been spilt; it must be avenged either by us, or upon us. (Loves Sermon at Uxbridge Treaty, 1644.)
And so it happened; Providence it seems taking him at his Word; and some part of that Innocent Blood, which was shed by his incitement, being by those of his own Party, according to his Oraculous, tho' otherwise in∣tended, Prediction, avenged upon himself; which because it fell out by a very uncommon accident, and known to very few, Providence seeming to interpose between him and a Pardon, which was intended for him, and to shew us, that vir sanguinum non dimidiabit dies suos, Blood-thirsty Men shall not live out half their Days, I think it will not here be impertinent to my Design, or unprofitable either to the present or future Times, to make publick the Re∣lation of it, which I had from the Mouth of a very Loy∣al, Worthy, and Credible Person; which was thus. That the Independents, after the Murder of the King, having made themselves absolute Conquerors, and Masters of the Sword, and thereby snatched the Lawrels of Victory from the Presbyterian Brows, who had, together with them, born the heat and burthen of the Day, and sweat so hard in the Common Cause; and that they had now every where crushed their fair hopes of Erecting their rigorous Discipline in the Establishment of a National Church-Government, according to the Geneva and Scot∣tish Model, so that the Sneaking Presbyterians were even forced to content themselves with a bare Toleration, be∣ing every hour affronted by the Huffing Independents, and every moment menaced with Ruine, by taking away the burthen of Tithes, the maintenance of their Cause and Ministers; they began to consult which way to retrieve themselves from those desperate Events, which seemed, like black Clouds, to hang over their Heads, ready to discharge themselves and all their Storms and Thunder upon them. And seeing no way more probable, than to follow the Example of their Dear Brethren of Scotland, they cast their thoughts upon a Treaty with the King, then in Exile; but that this was out of pure kindness to them∣selves, and not in the least to the King or his Interest, it is most evident, both because they utterly refused therein to joyn with the Loyal Party, and that even Mr. Love himself, with his latest Breath upon the Scaffold, assures us,
That it was true, he did oppose in his Place and Calling, the Forces and Tyranny of the late King; and, were he alive again, saith he, and should I live longer, (the Cause being as then it was) I should oppose him longer. The Crafty Independents, whose jealousie of the Pres∣byterian Interest and Power made fearful of them, and those fears vigilant, having their Spies, Emissaries, Infor∣mers, and Intelligencers in every Corner, even in the Kings Court, during his Exile, quickly got the scent of this Pres∣byterian Intrigue; and Love, as a Principal Man of the Presbyterian Faction, being most zealous and forward, and, by reason of his precipitate boiling temper of Spirit, less circumspect and cautious, was immediately Discovered, Apprehended, Tryed, Convicted, and Condemned for this High Treason against the State. But he being the Minion of the Presbyterians, and they considering, what a wound of Infamy it would give to their, even expiring▪ Reputation thorow the whole Nation, if he should die for this Crime of supposed Loyalty, there∣fore extraordinary Intercessions and Applications were made to the Commons, then Styled The Supreme Authority of the Nation, for his Deliverance; all his faithful Zeal and memorable Services in former Times were recoun∣ted, and the danger of disobliging and losing the Pres∣byterian Interest and Kindness; and how hazardous it might be to the Common-wealth, not yet well setled, if, by such severities, the Presbyterians should be provoked to joyn with the Malignant Party, were among other Sollicitati∣ons represented and insinuated to the Grandees of the In∣dependent Party. But this Supreme Authority of the Nation having now struck their Top-sail to Cromwel, who wore the Flag of Soveraignty, even over this goodly Supreme Authority, till such time as they had sent a dispatch to their Great Dictator Oliver, to consult his Soveraign Will, and to know from his Lips, upon which all Mens Destinies now depended, their Supremeships at Westminster durst not con∣descend to give Love a Pardon for his Life, only Execu∣tion was respited for some little time. Cromwel, being then absent in Scotland, upon the Receipt of this Account from the Slaves, whom he was pleased to
call his Masters, having taken the matter into his grave De∣liberation, returns his Answer in a private Letter to one of his Confidents, but I cannot positively charge my Me∣mory, whether Scot or Martin; and therein, according to his Politicks, considering, that at present his hands were full, and fearing, lest the English Presbyterians should rise at his back, and joyn with the Scottish Kirk-Party, with whom he was now ingaged, he graciously Condescends, that Love should be for a considerable time Reprieved, and, upon good Security from Him and his Party of their future be∣haviour, Pardoned. Now by what Impulse or Direction God only knows, two or three Gentlemen, who had formerly been of the Kings Army, happening to travel the Northern Road, and meeting the Post, who, among others, was charged with this Letter, and inquiring of him, Whether he had; any Scotch Letters, to which he innocently replyed, He had; a Curiosity seized their Imagination to peep into the Secrets of the Ʋsurping Powers; and therefore taking the Post aside out of the High Road, into a convenient place, and opening his Male, they took out and opened the Scottish Pacquet, and, among others, this of Cromwels, which carried a War∣rant for a Reprieve for Love; upon the reading of which, one of them immediately cried out, Oh! that is the Rogue, that ruin'd us, by breaking off the Treaty at Ʋxbridge; and thereupon putting that Letter in his pocket, they restored the rest to the Post, telling him, there were his Letters again, and immediately mounting, and putting Spurs to their Horses, they pursued their intended Journey. The Pacquet arriving at London, and several Letters from Cromwel to diverse Persons, without one single Syllable concerning Love, the Party took it for granted, that this Silence was intended as an absolute Denial: And therefore, not daring to draw upon themselves the high displeasure of Cromwel, either by a second Importunity to save him, or by a Delay of Execution, in a few days after the War∣rant for his dispatch into the other World was signed, and he, who had been instrumental in bringing so many Noble Heads, and even the Kings, to that Infamous and Un∣timely Death, had himself the Honour of the Axe, and to
have the blood of so many Innocents, as was shed by his Party, avenged upon himself, according to his Sangui∣nary and Prophetick Divinity. But, while my Pen runs in this full Carreer against these Cruel and Sanguinary Principles, it is more than probable, that the usual Courtesie of the Faction will bestow the Title of a bloudy-minded Persecutor upon me; and that the intent of this Exposure of their Positions is designed purposely to Expose their Persons to the Hatred and severest Punish∣ments of the Laws and Government. Now though, while I keep my self to the strictest Rules of Truth, I should little value the worst of their Imputations, yet considering, that they are wont to extend their Calumnies from single Persons to the whole Order of our Church, I have too much Duty and Tenderness, for the Reputation of that Glorious and truly Apostolical Church, whereof I esteem it my greatest Honour to be one of her meanest Ser∣vants, to suffer the least Spot, through my willing default, to sully her Beauteous Face: I must therefore make my most Solemn Protestation, that, as I have not the least Ani∣mosity to any Mans Person, so I have not the least Incli∣nation that prompts me to any kind of Cruelty; nay, it is my perfect abhorrence of Blood and Cruelty, that com∣pels me for the Satisfaction of the Importunities of my own Conscience, to use my utmost Industry to prevent the effusion of Humane Blood. It is to prevent the growth of these Fatal Principles, which, if not in time suppressed and subdued, threaten again to break out among us, and open the Veins of these Miserable Nations: It is because I would with my utmost Power hinder these deluded people, who become distracted with the Raving Poison of such Divi∣nity, either from Executing their Bloody Treasons and Malice upon others, or running themselves to Exe∣cution upon the Sword of Justice. It is against the Im∣mortal mischief of the Principles, and not the Mortal Lives of the deluded Professors of them, that I level all my blows; and that our Grand-Children may learn Wisdom from our harms and dangers; and know how to distinguish by their Fruits the Cedar Government of Monarchy, from the Bramble Government of Faction and Ʋsurpation; that
they may know the true difference between the truly A∣postolical, Loyal, and Obedient Church of England, and those false Schismaticks, who call themselves True Protestants, but are of the Synagogue of Satan:Revel. Chap. 2. ver. 9. That they may under∣stand the difference betwixt those Glorious Stars, the An∣gels of the Churches, the Bishops, which are for ever fix∣ed in the powerful Right-hand of the Son of God, and those New Lights, unfixed Meteors, wandring Stars, for whom,St. Jude. ver. 13. St. Jude tells us, is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. As for Exasperating the Government against them, as it is not my design, and, that I address my whole discourse by way of Caution to private Persons; so they ought rather to accuse their own Actions and not my Words, if the Government be justly Exasperated against them. And indeed, as it would be a very foolish Presumption in me, to pretend to advice, so it would be a superfluous Vani∣ty to go about to exasperate the Government, since it is most certain the Government knows them sufficiently already, and if the Tongues and Pens of all mankind were for ever silenced, their own Mouths, Pens, Words and Actions never cease to make Proclamations against them∣selves, and to provoke the Government, even at no less Peril, than not only its Well-being, but its very Being, to take such Effectual Care of them, as to secure the Mo∣narch and Monarchy, the Church and Apostolical Hierarchy, from the continual Attempts of their unwearied Practices both secret and open against them. And it is a Duty, which not only the Government owes it self by the most Primitive and Innate Law of Self-Preservation, but it is bound by all the Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, and by all the Obligations, both Divine and Humane, by the strongest Reasons of Wisdom and Interest, to protect and defend the Loyal, Dutiful, Peaceable, and Obedient Subjects, against the wicked Designs of the Seditious, Unruly, and Rebellious. And, as every Good man may modestly challenge this Protection from the Go∣vernment, so ought every Honest Man heartily to lend his best assistance towards the Support of that Power, from which he expects Protection, by detecting the De∣signs,
exposing the Artifices, and weakning the Force of its implacable Enemies, and such our Separatists have proved themselves sufficiently to be, had there been no other Pens, but their own, imployed against them. And because the whole World, to whose hands these Papers shall come, shall witness for me, that I have Trea∣ted them at a far more temperate Rate, than these Bre∣thren in Iniquity have treated each other in their mutu∣al Quarrels, in their Censures, and exposing each others de∣structive Principles: And that, if they find themselves pierced through the very heart of their Reputation, they may, with the Eagle in the Fable, perceive, that the Ar∣row, from which they received their Mortal wound, is feathered from their own Wings; I will present the Rea∣der with a Dialogue, taken out of their own Writings, and in their own proper Language, which possibly may not be indivertive, and, I hope, not unuseful or unserviceable to the design of Exposing, and, if possible, Exploding these Wicked, Turbulent, and Factious Opinions out of the Minds of Mankind. And that it may be known which are their Words, and what is only inserted to reduce it into the form of a Familiar discourse, those Expressions, which serve only to tack it together, are printed in Italick, the other in the ordinary Roman Letter. Independent. Here's a stir indeed! What a bustle do these Presbyterians make for Reformation of Church-Government? We must put in An Humble Supplication to the King and Parliament, in opposition to these Motions of the Pres∣byterians for a Reformation. (Independents Petition, Prin∣ted at Amsterdam. 1641.) Presbyterian. And what art thou? Independent. A poor Suppliant of the Congregational way, who am come, with some others of our Church, to present our Humble Petition to the King and Parliament, for some Liber∣ty and Indulgence to be shewed to the Tender Consciences of our Gathered Churches. Presbyt. What? An Independent! A Brownist, a Separatist, I warrant you; None else would oppose this glorious Reforma∣tion and Endeavour to set Christ upon his Throne.
Indep. Good Sir! be not scandalized at the Name or the Thing. We are for the purity of the Gospel, according to the Pattern in the Mount. Presbyt. Oh! You are one of that new-born Bastard Sect of Independency, which is nothing but a Confoun∣ding Ataxy, Rent upon Rent, and a Schisme of Schismes, until all Church Community be torn into Atomes; every three Men (nay every three Women, among you) dissociating themselves into an , a Will-Worship of their own devising, which fondly and madly you call a Church. But where, I pray, and in what corner of the world, hath this aëry Independency been asleep until these days? Quo consule? Under what Kings Reign was it born? Where may I hear, that it hath a being? Where may I read, (below the World in the Moon) that ever it had a being? I will be bold to brand it with the name of a new-minted Seminary for all Self-Pride, Heresie, Schisme, Sedition, and for all Libertinisme: An Outside seeming Saintship, a Pestilence to all Govern∣ment, except a Traiterous and clouted Anarchy. (Sir Edward Deerings Speeches, Page 82. Sect. 2.) Indep. I perceive, Sir, your Worship is a member of the most Honourable House of Commons, and, I hope, you will en∣tertain a better Opinion of your weak Brethren, whose Ten∣der Consciences cannot come up to all your Heights. Presbyt. Never, Never, I assure you. Independency! Why it is a Genus Generalissimum of all Errors, Heresies, Blasphe∣mies, and Schismes; compounded of, first, a Jew, arro∣gating to be, with them, the peculiar People of God: Se∣condly, Christian, in acknowledging the Scriptures, some of them at least, tho' Pharisees themselves, and Publica∣ning all the World, whereas True Religion is like Jacobs Ladder, Stat pede in terris, caput inter nubila condit. Third∣ly, Turk, submitting all to the Fate and Power of the Sword, Religion, Laws, and Liberty, that Idol of the People. (Walkers History of Independency, at the beginning.) Independ. Good your Worship, what ever you think of us, be pleased according to the trust reposed in you, as one of our Representatives, to deliver our Petition to the House, where I hope we have many Friends; you know there hath passed a
Vote of the Commons of England for it, and I hope you have too much Honour for that Body to deny that Request. Presbyt. I know indeed very well, that your Schisma∣tical Party hath been so Clamorous with Petitions, that a Vote was passed in your Favour, That it is the un∣doubted Right of Subjects to Petition, and afterwards to acquiesce in the Wisdom and Justice of the two Houses. (Hist. of Indep.) Indep. Ʋpon the Foundation of that undoubted Right it is, that we Address our selves to that Honourable Assembly. And you will see by the contents of our Petition, that it is time for us to stir, and that we have reason to complain. For as to the Motions of the Presbyterians for Reformation in Church Government, in the whole, First, there is much Self-seeking; for to what end is it motioned, to have Pa∣rish-Ministers raised up to an equal Height (as it were) of Power, and Authority with the Bishops, but that They and the Bishops together, keeping from the people their Rights and Liberties in the Gospel, may equally Lord it, and do what they please without control? But our hope is, that the Parliament, being Men in whom the Lord hath put Wisdom and Understanding, will for their Brethren and Companions sake, yea, and for their own Souls sakes too, prudently foresee the Evil, and prevent the Motion, and not put Authority into their hands, who will be, if they have it, as great Persecutors of the Saints, as the Prelates formerly have been, and so instead of one Lordly Domineering Bishop in a Diocess, we shall then have one in every Parish, and in some more, to oppress and suppress all such as walk up to their Light more Closely and Conscionably in all Gods ways; and what we speak, we speak no more than what we have had wo∣ful Experience of, and can make good by Proof. But in the next place, we cannot but take notice, of their mix∣ing of Heaven and Earth together, motioning for a Discipline which is a very Hotch-Potch, a Gallimaufrey compounded of Episcopacy, Presbytery, and Popery, think∣ing in likelyhood to please all sides, by framing, like the Samaritans, a Worship of Sundry Religions: But the Lord sees their Halting, and will one day reward them
for it in their own bosoms, as they have deserved; and for these Reasons, we desire the removing of this devised Liturgy and Hierarchy, and that Christs true Ministry, Worship, and Government may be established by Act of Parliament (Petition of the Independents, supra citat.) Presbyt. But when you have Petitioned, you do not Acquiesce in the Wisdom and Justice of the two Houses, who would have you quietly to attend the intended Reformation, which they hope to perfect ere long by those Arms, which they have raised to rescue the King from the Hands of his Evil Councellors, and bring him back to his Great Council the Parliament. Indep. Alas! Alas! What do you tell us of Acquiescing? What Favour can tender Consciences expect from Rigid Pres∣byterians, who are resolved to set up their Discipline above all Power, and to enslave both King and People. Presbyt. What can they expect but a Kingdom of Righte∣ousness, and that the King should be made the most Glori∣ous King in Christendome, as his Parliament hath promi∣sed him: That the Parliament should injoy their Priviledges, the People their Liberties, and be freed from Monopolies, Ship-money, and the Antichristian Yoke of Prelacy: and a National Church-Government according to the Word of God, and the Solemn League and Covenant be established. Indep. Ah Sir.! From thence arise all our Fears: Which are notably confirmed from former Experiences, wherever Pres∣bytery hath obtained Power. For as to the King, he must never flatter himself with any hopes from the Presbyteri∣ans: Their Government carries such a special Enmity against Monarchy, A shewd Maxime from the Pen of one, who knew them nùs & in cue. That whosoever will Found the one, must rase the Fundamentals of the other: For this little upstart Hierarchy can be little acknowledged, where Kingly Power is. This Epidemical Pest of Scotland was baptized by their Charity into a National Form in the Minority of King James, when the great Lords and Cler∣gy, ruling all, divided Stakes, so that when he came at age, and thought to grasp a Scepter, he found a Manacle, for it had consumed the Monarchie to a Skeleton; the unlimited Power of the Convention of Estates, and General Assembly especially, like the Rod of Aaron,
was such a budding Evil, that it devoured the Rod of Moses. For, where they prevail, they will allow the King nothing but a Name without Substance; the Bishops nei∣ther Name nor Substance; And as for the People, they must expect no more favour from them than the Prince: For they leave the Lords, and Gentry, nothing but Slavery; and the Commons, Tyranny under the meanest of their fellow-Subjects. And to say truth, Solomon's great Vanity is a Prime Mystery of Presbyterian Government, Servants on horseback, and Princes on foot, for they assert, That Ma∣gistrates of what Degrees or Rank soever, ought to use the Sword as they advise or command; and compel others to submit to the Decree of the General Assembly. And with what furious violence did they press their Covenant, sequestring all that refused to take it? So that they tread down all by a Moarnival or Two of Tyrants, no less Monstrous perhaps for Pride than Ignorance in every Parochial Inquisition. And should their Government be established in England, for 24 Diocesses, we should have 1000 Presbyteries, besides the Torture of Classes, Pro∣vincial Juntos, Synods, Assemblies. And how many of the Clergy must be called off from their Charges, to take upon their shoulders the Weight of Government, which was their only Argument against the Bishops? And cer∣tainly, Tyranny is more supportable in a few than many hands; and there is nothing to be expected but a fiery Tryal, where the Furnace of Discipline is so excessively heated, as it is by the Presbyterians; there being in one Ordinance of theirs about the Lord Supper, no less than Eighty sins named, excluding the Persons accused of any one of them from it, all which are left to the Malice of their Elders to accuse, as they did Susanna. So that a Ci∣tizen shall not dare to dispose of his Estate; wear good Apparrel; get ten, twenty, or thirty per Cent. by Lawful ways of Trade, without the leave of the Elders. And then for the Men of the Long Robe, what will be∣come of them? For all matters of Controversie will come before the Consistory. And after all this, Lay-Eldership is a meer decoy, the Preaching Presbyters will do all, and the other must stand or fall according to his Report at
the General Assembly. (The Case of the Kingdom Stated by M.Marchemont Needham. N. Shewing the several Interests, Printed, 1647. Presbyt. Kings and Parliaments have found a Notable Advocate of you, I have heard your Party speak other Lan∣guage, even the most Wicked Blasphemies against this Re∣forming Glorious Parliament: And to what purpose are your Fawning Applications to them, whose Authority you do not own? Pray do but hear this Paper read, Upon sight and con∣sideration of the Votes of Parliament, Dated Die Veneris, 20 Februarii, 1645, and upon the Ordinance: Dated Sabbati 14 Martii 1645. Intituled, an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament for keep∣ing of Scandalous Persons from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the enabling of Congregations for the choice of Elders, and supplying defects in former Or∣dinances, and Directions of Parliament, concerning Church-Government. Resolved by Tender Conscience, with the consent of Gods Holy Word and Spirit assembled to∣gether, That the Word of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, without the Word of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, is no warrant for Tender Con∣science to joyn with ungodly Parishes, in the choice of Spiritual Elders to Govern Gods Spiritual House. Resolved, &c. That the Lords and Commons Assem∣bled in Parliament have the Civil Government over the Bodies and Estates in Observe this Reservation, for in ordine ad Spiritualia, draws all things of civil nature to their Juris∣diction. Civil things, but the Lord Je∣sus in Spiritual. Resolved, &c. That the Kingdom of England and Domi∣nion of Wales, and the Parish Churches and Chappels therein, have not yet been proved to tender Conscience to be Churches of Christ: Nor have the Directions that passed both Houses, bearing Date, 19 August. 1645. Nor the supplying Ordinance since, nor hath any thing of that nature been proved to be according to the Word of God, and that Tender Conscience never read of Classes's, nor Parochial Congregations in the Bible. Resolved, &c. That therefore such Election of Parochi∣al Congregational Elders, the Warning thereof, and the Sermon preparatory is, in the Judgment of tender Consci∣ence, a taking Gods Name in vain.
Resolved, &c. That the Major part of the Parishes, being Ungodly, will chuse Ungodly Elders; and that not all such, as have taken the National Covenant, are fit to chuse Godly Elders; that many persons under Age, and Servants without Families, are more Godly than their Parents and Masters that keep Families, and in Christs Church not to be excepted against in the Choice of Church-Officers, seeing that all Saints, both Jews and Gen∣tiles, Bond and Free, are all one in Christ, Gal. Chap. 3. ver. 28. And that his Saints are not to have the Faith of Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory, in respect of Persons. Resolved, &c. That the Lord Mayor, and Cities Presidents, or any Presidents which tend, or have tended to the taking away or obstruction of the Settlement or Establish∣ment of the Antient bounds of Liberty of Conscience, cannot amount in the least to be any binding President to Tender Conscience. Finally, It is Resolved, &c. That the Lord of Tender Conscience is Lord of all Lords and Laws, and never Or∣dained to bring in any thing into his Worship, but that which First was by his own Institution; and that therefore all Acts, Ordinances, Votes, Protestations, Declarations, &c. made, or which hereafter, without the Word of God, shall be made by any Person or Persons whatsoever, shall be of no Force against Tender Conscience, in the Worship of God; and that though such Humane Acts, Ordi∣nances, &c. take hold only of all those Men that have the Mark of the Beast, but that Tender Conscience, and the Friends thereof, shall be Exempted there-from. May 1. 1646. Ordered to be Printed, Christian Meekness Clerk to Tender Conscience. [Several Votes of Tender Conscience, Printed, July 28. 1646.] Pray, do you own this Paper, good Mr. Independent? Indep. Why truely, Sir, I do own it, and since you are so hot upon inslaving of poor Tender Consciences, I am to deal plain∣ly with you, and to tell you, that the Manner of a true, pure, and perfect Reformation is hidden from your Eyes; You Presbyterians are Friends to the Midnight of Popery, your Directory is the Golden Calf of your own Invention,
your Two Children are Power and Maintenance: The An∣gel of the Lord hath Smitten you with Blindness, as he did the Sodomites, else you would have found the Door of the Visible Church: Your Way is a persecuting Way: Your Blind Guides would all be Controllers; You are like your Fore-Fathers, the Blood-Thirsty Bishops; you Pollute, Pro∣phane, and Trample under Foot Christs precious Truths; you derive your Ordination from the Antichristian Pre∣lates, and are the Second Beast, Rev. Chap. 13. ver. 2. What can be said bad enough of this Sect of the Blasphemous, Persecuting, Treacherous Presbyterians, Popish Presbyterians, Prophane Presbyterians? 'Tis you that, wherever you come, are guilty of all Divisions in Towns, Cities, Families; you, even you, Presbyterian Praters, all whose Ways are Impure, Imperfect, and Impious. Come on, Sir, I'll shew you your Picture here in a Broad-side; Do you see that Winged Heart mounting towards Heaven? that is Tender Consci∣ence; look there, on the Right hand stands the Pope with the Latin Mass-book in one of his hands, and in the other a Sword to wound Tender Conscience; on the left hand stands a Prelate in the same Posture, holding in his left hand The Liturgie; and in the middle, d'ye mark! there stands your Dapper Sir Jack Presbyter in his Cloak, in one hand a Dagger, with which he attempts to Wound the Winged Heart, and in his other hand the Directory; Look ye, all these three are linked together in one Chain, to shew, that they have all the same Design, but Presbyter is the Worst of the Three, for, if you observe, you will see he tramples upon a Crown Imperial, which he hath gotten under his Feet; but pray mark, the Curst Cow hath the shortest Horns, your Pres∣byters's Dagger is too short, and how good soever his Will may be, here's a Weight with a Chain fastened to his Bloody Dagger-hand, so that he is not able to reach the Flying Heart, but that, by the Help of her Wings, Tender Conscience mounts out of his, and the reach of all her Ene∣mies, and The more You wound my dear and precious Tender Heart; The more Your Seared ones shall feel the grievous Smart. All Three to injure me as Mortal Foe; Encreaseth your Eternal Wo, Wo, Wo. Rev. 8.13.

Most certainly, by his Foming at the mouth, the Man is distracted, and perfectly Raves; but, Sir, I shall give your Courage a Cooling Julep, by informing the House concer∣ning you. Indep. What do you tell us of the House, or the Parliament? I must tell you, that opposing of Independency is a perfect Theomachy, a plain Fighting against God. We are under the Government of Christ alone: No Power on Earth, or Earthly Lawgivers, may, can, or ought to give Laws for the Government of the Church. Neither Kings, nor Parliaments, nor Synods, have Authority to prescribe Laws or Rules for Church Government, to make Coactive Laws to bind Conscience to Conformity, or to inflict Mulcts or Penalties for contempt or disobedience. For the Members of Parliament are chosen but by a Secular Rout, by the Generality and Riff-Raff of the World, Papists, A∣theists, Drunkards, and Swearers. And the Parliament's Claiming this Power is seven times more undermining and destructive of their Power, Honor, Peace, and Safety; it is claiming the incommunicable Prerogative, and Regali∣ties of Heaven; an attempt to make themselves equal with God. Truth Triumphing over Falshood, &c. by W. Pryn, Printed by the Order of the House of Commons, June, 2. 1644, In the Epistle Dedicatory to the Parliament. Presbyt. You give the Parliament good incouragement to favour you; But I doubt not, but they, and all honest Men, are sufficiently sensible of, and acquainted with, your Temper and Incli∣nations, but lest they should not, I shall take the Liberty to inform Them and the Whole Nation, That if Independent Government be suffered at this insolent rate, in time it cannot but over∣throw all other Sorts of Ecclesiastical Government, and Civil too by the same Principles; for in reality it de∣stroys all Civil Power, Magistracy, Corporations, Parlia∣ments, Courts of Justice; for what ever Meekness they may pretend, Independency is such a Turbulent, Dangerous, Unquiet, Schismatical Government, as will un-King, un-Parliament,
Parliament, un-Church a Nation, nay un-Nation them. For it makes each several gathered Congregation, an abso∣lute Monarchy, Church, Republick, and Nation within it self. It is a Model of Government more Rigid, Un∣charitable, Unsociable, Papal, Tyrannical, Anti-Monar∣chical, Anti-Synodical, Anti-Parliamentary, than any Go∣vernment whatsoever.

Nay for that commend me to you Presbyterians; You are for a King that shall be no King, a King of Clouts. Have not you taught us, That Parliaments are the Supreme Power, and that Kings are Subordinate to them? That a King hath no Power to impose Taxes; to give Por∣tions to his Children? That he cannot displace a Judge? That he is bound to confirm what is concluded by the States? That he is Obliged not to depart from the Parlia∣ment? That they may Summon him to Appear before them; Question him, Restrain him, Allow him only a Pen∣sion to support him; Order his House, Appoint him Coun∣sellors, Appoint him Governors; Separate his Queen from him; Void his last Will; Seize his Revenues; Keep his Forts; Raise Arms against him; Bring in Foreigners; Banish him; Make Peace and Wars; Force him to resign his Right to the Crown; Force him to resign his Crown; Determine the Right of Succession to the Crown; Chuse their own Judges; Rescind the Kings Acts; Imprison him, put out his Eyes, strangle him; Absolve his Subjects from their Allegiance; Depose him; Disinherit him; Remove him at the Peoples pleasure; Elect another, Christian or Infidel? (Pryn's Soveraign Power of Parliaments; Ordered to be printed by the Committee for Printing, and Licensed by John White, Printed for Micha∣el Sparke, Jun. June 23. 1643.) Presbyt. You are very Brisque in Charging us with what, if it be a Crime, you are as guilty of, as We: For Indepen∣dency, if admitted, ruines not only Monarchy, but even our Soveraign Power of Parliaments, and cassates all Obe∣dience. For you make Laws for your selves, which
your Congregations must submit to, or be Excommu∣nicated and delivered up to the Devil; you affirm, That every particular Congregation is a Complete, Intire, Ab∣solute, Spiritual Republick, Corporation, Body, and City of God, of it self, and of absolute Authority within it self, subject to no other Jurisdiction, than that of Christ, and his Word, and Spirit; and not under any Congre∣gation, Synod, or National Church, or humane Power whatsoever; and that the Parliament cannot make Canons or Rules to bind it, nor perscribe any Church-Govern∣ment or Discipline to it: And in short, Independency is flat Popery, holding themselves, as the Pope doth, sub∣ject and accountable to none but Christ, as you may see in Alv. Pelag. de planctu Ecclesiae, lib. 1. Art. 6.13.31.34, 35.37. And every Independent Minister is a perfect Pope. (Pryns Truth triumphing over Falshood, supra citat.) Nay, one of your Ministers in the Summer Islands, one White, was openly pronounced, in the presence of God and the whole Congregation, to be Supreme Head of that Church next under Christ, and none above him. And your manner of entring into your Congregational way shews your true Tem∣per; for after Confession of Sins, the Proselytes are ad∣mitted and received, and enter into Church-Covenant to stand to and maintain their Church and Discipline, Orders, Governors, and Government, to the uttermost of their Power and Abilities, and to strive therein, even un∣to Blood. (Letter from Summer Islands from one Richard Beak, who at 74 years of age was imprisoned 13 Months, for opposing this White and his Independent Congregation.) But I hope the Parliament will serve you, as they did your busie Socinian Teacher Goodwin, and stop all your Mouths with a silencing Ordinance. Indep. They served that precious man so indeed, for his Book called Theomachia, An excellent recompence for his kind∣ness to them, which was, if any fault, Error Amoris, not Amor Erroris in him, and designed to prevent their dash∣ing against this Stone, which will one day break all Power in pieces, (Truth Triumphing, &c.) But never trouble your selves, for we do not, with your Parliament Ordinances▪ which are but Parliament Toyes, (Martins Eccho) the People
never trusted the Parliament with Church Government, which they themselves have not, and therefore cannot give it: For what cannot be given, cannot be received; but had you the Arch-Bishops Power, I find you would exceed him in Cruelty of Persecution, you are the Par∣liaments Evil Genius, egging and inciting them to Acts of Tyranny against an Innocent People, and had you Command, you would Censure, Fine, Pillory, Imprison, Banish, and differ little from Bonner and Gardiner in Queen Maryes Days; (A help to understand Mr. Pryn) for you are neither better nor worse than a company of Pro∣phane Apostates, Popish, Jesuitical Incendiaries, Haters of Gods People; and while we are fighting and hazarding our dearest Lives for the Subjects Liberty, as Mr. Lil∣burn too truly said of you, we are in danger of being brought into Egyptian Bondage, in this and other parti∣culars by the Black-coat Presbyterians, who I am affraid will prove more Cruel Task-masters, than their dear Brethren the Bishops. For what I pray is the inhansing and ingros∣sing of Interpretations, Preachings, and Discipline into the Presbyterians Hands, but a meer Monopoly of the Spirit, and worse than the Monopoly of Sope. The Ordinance, That no Unordained Persons Preach, is a Pa∣tent of the Spirit, to get the whole Trade into their own Hands, to rob the People with what Ware and Price they please, to look in their Faces and pick their Pockets. (A Fresh Discovery of some prodigious new wandring Blazing Stars and Fire-brands, Styling themselves New Lights, by W. Pryn, 1645.) Presbyt. Nay, you and your un-ordained Independent Preachers, have made brave work in the Pulpit: It would make ones Hair stand an end, to hear what hath been taught by Ignorant, Impudent Mechanicks; and what Damnable Blasphemies and Heresies have been broached by them among the People, for Soul-saving Truths: Such as these. That Christs Righteousness is a beggarly Righteousness; That Christ's Blood did not purchase Heaven for any Man; That Christ shed his Blood for Kine and Horses, as well as for Men; That the Devils and Souls of Men are Mortal, and none but God Immortal; That we are only to believe the Scriptures,
as they are agreeable to Sense and Reason; That the Scrip∣tures are uncertain, insufficient, and not an Infallible Rule of Faith; That the Scriptures cannot be said to be the Word of God, Christ only being so; That the Scriptures of the Old Testament do not bind Christians under the New; That Adultery and Drunkenness are not Sins; That Prayer in Families is unlawful; That Christ's Suffer∣ings were only for our Example, not to purchase Hea∣ven for us; That no Man was cast into Hell for Sin, but only because God would have it so; That Christ will destroy all Government, Lawful, and Unlawful; That God was never displeased with Men for Sin; if he were, it were changeableness in God; That the Church and Ministry of England are Antichristian; That Tolera∣tion of Jews, Turks, Pagans, in all Nations is the Will of God; That there is no Resurrection; That if a Wo∣mans Husband was sleeping, or absent, she may lawfully lye with another Man, because sleep is Death; That John Baptist's Doctrine of Repentance was a Leathern Do∣ctrine; That Adam's Sin deserved not Hell; That all the Heaven there is, is here on Earth; That Universities are of the Devil, and Humane Learning of the Flesh; That many shall be Saved, that were never Elected; That They are the great Anti-Christ, who deny the general Re∣demption of the whole Creation; That no Man had any thing to do to hinder it, if any Person should Wor∣ship the Sun or the Moon; That the Doctrine of Re∣pentance is a Soul-depraving Doctrine; That the Lords Day ought not to be kept, all dayes being alike under the Gospel; That Sanctification is but a Dunghill-dirty Qualification; That there is no Church, no Ordinances, nor Ministers in the World; That it is unlawful to teach Children to Pray; That Infants shall not rise again, be∣cause they were not capable of knowing God, and so not of enjoying God. (A Discovery of dangerous Heresies taught by Mechanicks. Printed April 26, 1647.) And in short, Independency is a Seminary of Schismes, and dangerous Divisions in the Church and State; a Flood-gate to let in all Heresies, Errors, Sects, Libertinisme, and even the Ma∣hometan Doctrine. (Twelve Queries about Church-Govern∣ment
against the Independents, by W. Pryn. Indep. Well, Well! You may talk what you please of Heresies, Errors, Sects, and Schismes, but this I am assured of, That all the Plagues of Egypt were but a Flea-biting to what one Presbyterial Church would be, the Pope him∣self is as truly Christian as our Presbyterie; they can never be Good to others, who are guilty of such Ingrati∣tude to the Bishops, from whom, formerly they received the Holy Ghost, with all their Spiritual Preferments, and were first put into a capacity of Lording it, as they do, over the People; whom, like ungracious Children, viperous Vermine, inhumane Cannibals, notwithstanding their Grace and Favour, they have devoured up and shared the Inheritance among them. (A Sacred Decree, &c.) Presbyterial Government is much more truly said to be Prelatical, than the Episcopal; nay both Papal and Epis∣copal Government is better than Presbyterian, more U∣niform, and have continued many Hundred of Years longer than Presbytery, and were long before Presbytery was thought of; it was but a Shift at a Pinch, that the Devil made, when neither of the other would serve his Turn, and so came up Presbyterie, but what good the Devil will have of it, I know not, for who knows the Luck of a Lowsie Cur, he may prove a good Dog.

I now find it true, what my wor∣thy Friend Dr. Bastwick saith of you, viz. A Man may truly say of Independents, Diabolus cacavit illos, they are the very Nephews of Heliogabalus, Terrible Dissemblers, and Notorious Liars; if they get Authority, down go the Churches, which must be made Tophets of; down go Gentry and Nobility, the Sons of Belial, (Bastwick's Letter to Vicars.) Remember your Solemn League and Co∣venant; pray, Mr. Independent, did not you joyn with us in it, and do you now renounce both that and the Parliament? I must tell you, That to withdraw from this Community, the Parliament, our Representatives, is next Door to withdrawing from, and renouncing God himself; nay it is a plain Renouncing of him, and Warring against
him. The Cause is Holy, Just, and Good, and God will come in for the Defence of it in his own Time; In taking the Covenant, you, as well as we, have Vowed, and we will not Repent, to oppose these Adversaries to Death; be they Bishops, Lawyers, Devils, (He is their Prince) we will oppose these to Death, nay we Vow and Covenant now to take up Arms against King and Queen, both setting themselves against God, and the Power of Godliness: For though we have taken the Oath of Allegiance, we are only Sworn to Obey the King, while he Obeys God; for what are the Princes and Nobles of the Earth, but God's Scullions to clear up and purge his Vessels ap∣pointed to Honour? Pray, Good Mr. Independent, re∣member your self and the Covenant. (The Covenant Asserted, Printed, August 14. 1643.) Indep. The Covenant cannot bind us, till one Clause viz. according to the Word of God, be determined: And having done the utmost to fulfil it, by helping you to Extirpate Root and Branch, we have done all the Cove∣nant requires, (The Case of the Kingdom stated, &c.) but besides, it is a meer Snare to catch the People with the Face of Reformation, never kept, nor intended to be kept by your selves that made and imposed it on others; for by the Covenant you were Sworn to root out all Popery, but yet you have Established Tithes, the Root of Popery, (Lilburn cited by Pryn, Fresh Discovery, &c.) and in truth it is impossible to be kept, and the Makers of it have run into wilfull Perjury, it is a Makebate, Persecuting, Soul-de∣stroying, England-dividing, and Undoing Covenant, (England's Birthright by J. Lilburn:) And therefore, as Mr. Goodwin tells you, to Violate such an Abominable and Accursed Oath, as this Covenant is, is an Holy and a Blessed Perjury, (12 Cautions by J.

Bastwick says, we must expect shortly, that, according to your frequent threatnings, you will fall to Cutting of the Throats of the Presbyterians. (Hist. of Independ. and Bastwick's Post-script to Burton.) Indep. Nay, the Truth is, We are resolved to have none of your Blew-Cap Reformation. Your Reverend Assem∣bly of Divines is such a Quagmire of Croking Frogs, com∣posed of Skip-Jack Presbyters, a Synodian Whore, a Tray∣terous Synod, so many Presbyterian Horse-Leaches, Blood-thirsty Cattle, Jesuitical Traytors, that it is a meer Con∣sistory of Devils, guided by the Holy Ghost sent in a Cloak-bag from Scotland, that there is no induring of them any longer.

'Twas e'en the Devil made the Urchin Sir John Presbyter, a poor Abject Fugitive newly come out of Scotland; but his Life is like neither to be good nor long; he will be brought to some untimely End, perhaps Hang∣ing: his Teeth and Nails must be pluck'd out, and cut off by an Independent Barber, that hereafter he may ne∣ver Bite or Scratch more; for these all hate a Tithe-de∣vouring Priest, as they hate the Devil: And for your Synod, it will soon be dissolved, and the Devil chained up.

Right Reverend Father in God, and My very Good Lord, Being required to make known to your Lordship my Judgment concerning some things propounded at my last being before your Lordship; from which Proposi∣tions though I never dissented, nor know any cause why I should be suspected; Yet being ready and willing to obey your Lordship in all things, especially in so just a demand as this, I have consulted Antiquity, and with our Modern Hooker and others, and humbly desire your Lordship to accept the satisfaction following. First, For the Church of England in General, I bless God, I am a Member of it; I was Baptized in it; and am not only most assured, it is a True Church, but I am per∣swaded, it is the most Glorious and Flourishing Church this day under the Sun, which I desire to be truly thankful for; and for the Faith, Doctrine, Articles of that Church, and the Maintenance of them, I hope the Lord will ena∣ble me to contend, tanquam pro Aris & Focis, yea I trust to lay down my Life, if I were thereunto called. Secondly, For the Governors and Government there∣of, viz. The Reverend Fathers the Arch-Bishops and Bi∣shops, I acknowledge their Office and Jurisdictions, and cannot see, but there would follow a fearful Ataxy with∣out the present Government; whereof I so approve, that I have and do willingly submit to it, and have and will press the same upon others. Thirdly, For the Ceremonies, that are in use among us, as I have already Subscribed, so I shall diligently and daily Practise; neither have I ever been accused for neg∣lect therein, where I have formerly exercised my Mi∣nisterial Function, but to them do give my full approba∣tion and allowance. Fourthly, For the Book of Common-Prayer, the Liturgie of the Church, and what is in them contained; (finding them agreeable to the Word of God) I have used, as other Ministers have done, and am resolved so to do, and have not been refractory in this particu∣lar at any time, nor do intend to be, God willing. And
to these I subscribe with my heart and hand, humbly submitting them, and my self, to your Lordships plea∣sure. Your Lordships in all Humble Service, Hugh Peter. [Fresh Discovery, &c. supra citat.] Indep. O! This was written in the Days of his Blindness, but the Lord hath Inlightened him better now. Presbyt. Oh! What Illuminations spring from Perjury, and the Power of the Sword! Does he not tell you, he had stu∣died Antiquity, and the Modern Writers too? Does he not, ex animo and from Deliberation of his Judgment, tell you, he was satisfied in every particular of the Prelatical Govern∣ment? And yet who has done more to destroy it, Root and Branch? Was he not a Professed Presbyterian, till Indepen∣dency got the Weather-Gage, and then he tacks about too. So that he must be either a most Notorious Liar and Hypocrite, in this Letter to the Bishop, or a most impious Wretch, to go against the Dictates of his Conscience, in overthrowing the most Glorious and Flourishing Church under the Sun, and fighting against Her tanquam pro Aris & Focis, instead of laying down his Life for her, and therefore e'en take him among you, we shall know you better by the Company you keep than by any other Wayes. Indep. Well, so let it be, if he had not known you, we had never had him, but Experience hath made more than him Wise, he is sufficiently acquainted with your Gorbellied Idol of Presbyterie, and the Dissembly Doctors, to have any thing more to do with them, than to tell them, That they would do the State better Service with their Cano∣nical Girdles, were the Knot tied in the Right place; or, if that be too severe, to wish them to Adjourn to Bedlam, where, as the fittest place, I leave you and them, Good Sir John Presbyter. These are the Men, and these are the Manners, these are their Positions and Principles, this is their Meekness
and Charity, their Tenderness and Unity; these are their Thoughts of Monarchy and Episcopacy, of Order and Government, of Obedience and Subjection. Here is a taste of their Divinity, Humanity, Morality, Politicks, Ethicks and Honesty, though it is Canis ad Nilum, only a few Snaps and away, for fear of the Crocodiles, and in∣deed Nilus is their proper Emblematical Parent, and they are the very Crocodiles of Religion, who are always Whi∣ning, till they are able to devour the Government: But certainly here is sufficient Deformity, to perswade all Good, Virtuous, and Religious People for ever to aban∣don them; not but that, if I thought it necessary, or that it would not Nauseate rather than Divert the Reader, I could have blotted many more Pages out of their own Ink; but truly, measuring the Inclinations of others by my own, I must ingenuously acknowledge that it gives me very slender diversion to Traffick in such Course Paint∣ing, and such Ugly Colours; but there is a necessity, that he, who must Paint the Infernal Legions of Darkness, should dip his Pencil in the deepest Black, and pourtray Defor∣mity: And that he, who would, from the Life, draw the exact Picture of Presbyterians, Independents, and other Sects, must fetch the best Colours to do it with, from their own Shops. And truly it is a satisfaction to me, that I have not had this drudgery put upon me, but that these Monsters have drawn the Lineaments of their own hide∣ous Shapes and Figures: And whatever Opinion the present Separatists may have either of me or of their Predeces∣sors, I think, though I might have displaid their Princi∣ples, which are equally Monstrous and Dangerous, in the proper Colours of Truth, yet I should not have bespat∣tered my self at this gross rate, to render them more ug∣ly: And indeed, let who will dress these Principles in the Whitest Garb, they will look like Negro's, who though Apparrelled in the cleanest Linnen, will be Negro's still: But certainly, as there can be no Exceptions against the Persons who have given these Characters, they being the Principal Champions and Heroes of these two powerful Sects of the Presbyterians and Independents, so there can be no doubt of the Truth of their Characters; for like
skilful Combatants, as by long tryal they best knew each others defects, so they addressed themselves most vigorously to attack each other in the weakest places, and one may well perceive by the mutual Wounds they give and receive, that they both wanted the Armour of Truth: And most assuredly, if all, they charge each o∣ther to be Guilty of, be true, Hell hath nothing able much to surpass them in Blackness, and if they be false, nothing that can equal them in Malice and Falseness; so that let their Accusations be true or false, they manifestly prove each Faction to be most intolerably Wicked, Faithless, Mischievous, and Dangerous to all Mankind, and even to Humane Society: And for my own parti∣cular, I cannot see, how it had been possible to have found any Arguments so capable to undeceive and deliver the deluded People of this Nation out of that strange fond Opinion, which they have entertained of such Sanctimo∣nious Impostors, as these, with which they themselves have furnished us against themselves; and this, I hope, may like∣wise excuse the Repetition of such Treasonable Positions, such unmannerly and bitter Invectives, such fierce Accusati∣ons, and such horrible Crimes, as these two Factions are by their own Mouths and Pens convicted to be Guilty of. But their greatest Guilt is still behind, the very Quin∣tessence of those Envenomed Anti-Monarchical Principles refined into one Dismal Act. For notwithstanding all these mutual Quarrels, they were still most Harmoni∣ously consenting and united in the Prosecution of the King, as the Common Enemy: And after all the Mise∣ries of a Cruel, Bloody, and Unnatural War, in which they had involved the Kingdom, they proceeded at the last to Consummate all their former Wickednesses, by the most Execrable Design, that ever the Sun lent Beams to the Day to behold, the Murder of the Ornament of Mo∣narchy, the Miracle of Piety, and the Vice-gerent of Hea∣ven upon Earth, the King; their King; their Natural Liege Lord and Soveraign; seeking the Security of their for∣mer Treasons by his Ruine; and palliating their Rebel∣lion, by Murdering first his Innocence, and then his Sa∣cred
Person, and indeavouring to cover all their Former Crimes by committing Greater. For the Independent Faction, under Cromwel's Favour, who had now openly declared himself of that Party, having now got into their Possession the uncontrolable Power of the Sword; they first Endeavour to get the King, now a Prisoner to the Parliament, into the hands of the Army, which was now wholly Independent, the Prebyterians being thrust out of all Military Employs, this was in a little time, by Cromwel's Power, effected by one Joyce, a Creature of his, who when he had given him an Account of the Success of that Commission, That's well, said Cromwel, for now I have the King in my Power, I have the Parliament in my Pocket. The next step was, to make sure of the City of London, which, by the mischief it had done the King, was of too great Importance to be slighted, and of great Necessity and Advantage to be gained: They were very sensible, should London heartily and unanimously oppose them, that heavy Weight would be able to turn the Scale, and very much Traverse, if not Hazard the intire Ruine of their Designs: This Cromwel knew so well, that he was wont to say to his Confidents, That London must be brought to more absolute Obedience, or laid in the Dust. A Declara∣tion well worth the Consideration of that Noble City, and a Caution to them for ever to be aware of these Treache∣rous Factions, who, if their Interest required it, and their Power were able to effect it, would make no Difficulty to Execute the Menace of that Infamous Ʋsurper. But to proceed, in order to the gaining of this Point, they first Court the City to a Neutrality, but the City declining that, and there being some Overtures of an Accommoda∣tion with the King, which Cromwel and his Party most dreaded, he Threatens to March up with the Army to London, whereupon, the Citizens Hearts misgiving them, and the Independents having gained upon diverse Consi∣derable Members of it, it was Resolved, to try to divert that Storm, whereupon they send Fowke, Gibbs, and Estwick, to Treat with the Army, who like perfidious and timerous Slaves, betrayed their Trust, and those that Employed
them in that Affair. For the Result of their Negotiation was, That the City should relinquish the Power of the Mi∣litia, and leave the Establishment of it to the Council of the Army; That they should deliver up all their Forts, the Line of Communication, the Tower with all the Arms and Ammunition, to the Army; That they should disband their Forces, demolish all their Out-works and Fortifications, and suffer the whole Army to March through the City; all which to the Eternal Dishonor of those Pusillanimous Cowards, only Valiant in Rebellion, they presently after most Triumphantly put in Exe∣cution. This great Rub being so fortunately surmounted, they now began to open the Dismal Scene, and that, they might extinguish the least remaining Sparks of Loyalty, they fall to Menacing such, as durst, in the least, Oppose them. For upon the Debate, which happened concerning the Nulling of all Acts, Orders, &c. from July 26. 1647. to August. 6. Sir Arthur Hasilrig openly declared in the House, That some Heads must fly off, and that, he feared, the Parliament of England would not Save the Kingdom of England, that they must look another way for Safety: And many other threatning Speeches were made by Sir H. Vane Jun. Sir John Evelyn Jun. Prideaux, Gourdon, Mildmay, Scot, and Cornelius Holland; and in conclusion, a Letter, with a Remonstrance full of Invectives and Menaces, from the General Fairfax and the general Council of the Army, was produced, by which Means they gained that Point also. Upon the 24. of December the four Bills, whereby the King was to be Devested of every thing, but the Empty Name, were sent to the King, as the Conditions of re∣storing him to his Liberty and Crown. And upon the third of January, the Kings answer was Read and Debated; upon which Sir Thomas Wroth broke out into this Extra∣vagant Speech, (fitter for Bedlam Himself, or rather Tyburn, than St. Stephen's Chappel,) That Bedlam was appointed for Mad-men, and Tophet for Kings: That our Kings of late had carried themselves, as if they were fit for no place, but Bedlam; and therefore Moved, first to Secure
the King, and keep him close Prisoner in some Inland Castle, with strong Guards. Secondly, to draw up Arti∣cles of Impeachment against him. Thirdly, to lay him aside, and settle the Kingdom without him; and for his own particular, he said, he valued not what Form of Government they set up, so it were not by Kings and Devils. This was Seconded by Ireton, who spoke the Sense of the Army, and said, That the King had denyed Safety and Protection to his People, by denying the four Bills: That Subjection to his was but in lieu of Protection from him to the People; that This being denied by the King, they may well deny any more Subjection to him, and settle the King∣dom without him; That it was expected, after so long Pati∣ence, they should now shew their Resolution, and not desert those Valiant Men of the Army, who had ingaged for them beyond the possibility of retreat. And to put the thrust home to the very Heart of the King, towards the latter end of his Speech, laying his Hand upon the Hilt of his Sword, that Sorcerer Cromwel stood up, and spake to this Effect: That it was now expected, that the Parliament should Govern and Defend the Kingdom by their own Power and Resolution, and to teach the People no longer to expect Safety and Go∣vernment from an Obstinate Man, whose Heart God had hardened; That, they who had defended the Par∣liament from so many hazards, difficulties, and dan∣gers, with the expence of their Blood, would defend them herein, with Fidelity and Courage, against all Oppositi∣on whatsoever; therefore, that they ought not to teach them, by neglecting their own and the Kingdoms Safety, in which their own is included, to think themselves be∣trayed, and left to the Rage and Malice of an irreconci∣lable Enemy, whom they had subdued for the Parlia∣ment's sake, and therefore in probability likely to find his future Government of them insupportable, and more inclined to Revenge than Justice, lest otherwise Despair should teach those Valiant Men, to seek their Safety in some other means, than adhering to the Parliament, when they shall plainly see, you will not stick to your
selves: and how destructive such a Resolution in them may be to you all, added he, I tremble to think, and leave to you to Judge. Whereupon the Question was immediately put, Whe∣ther the Two Houses should make no more Addresses or Ap∣plications to the King; and, the House being Divided, with the Yeas, were 141. with the Noes, 91. So it passed in the Affirmative. But matters did not run so smoothly, as they had ho∣ped; For the general Cry of the Nation was for a Perso∣nal Treaty with the King: This was violently opposed by the Independent Faction, and because there appeared great Inclinations in the City to favour the King, they Threatned, That after they had done with Colchester, they would Humble that Proud City of London. And to the Eternal Shame and Confusion of these Pretenders to Conscience, and to Tender Conscience too; the Reader shall hear that hideous Animal, upon this occasion, bray out the Bloody and Treasonable Thoughts of the Party possessed with this Legion, in one of those Pamphlets, which, according to their constant Practice, when they have the Press at Liberty, they Print and Disperse abroad to poyson the abused People, and to incite and animate them to Disloyalty, Treason, and the most Flagitious Villanies, under pretence of following the Directions and Di∣ctates of Conscience. The Paper wears this Title, The Voice of Conscience to all Well-meaning Citizens. Printed July 16. 1648. And thus he Harangues the People. If you desire to see a longer and more Bloody War, and London (as the Chief Seat thereof) weltring in its own Blood; your Wives, Children, and Families starved and pined to death through Poverty, Famine, and want of Trade; if you would overthrow Parliaments for ever, and subject both them, and all People, to the Will of the King and his Courtiers; if you desire to see Foreigners invade you on all Hands, and many Armies at once Quartered upon your Land, putting hard for a New Conquest of this miserable divided Nation; and if you desire to see your Wives and your Daughters ravished before your Faces, and
your Childrens Brains Dasht against the Stones by lustful and Blood-thirsty Cavaleers; then follow the Steps of your Wealthy head-strong Aldermen and Common-Council-Men, in their hasty pursuance of a Personal Treaty with the King, or which is all one, removing him out of the Armies Power: For if you do, flatter not your selves, but be assured, [most Impious Confidence,] as certain as God is in Heaven, you will see those Miseries come to pass, and that swiftly too, you▪ will be devoured in an instant without Hope of Remedy. But if you abhor, and would prevent those Mischiefs, then avoid and detest their Ingagement; fly from it as from a Serpent, it being a Viper bred in your own Bow∣els to destroy you; and if you have unadvisedly subscri∣bed it, Repent speedily, and Recal your Hands. They most grosly delude you, and abuse the Parlia∣ment, in pretending they are able, nay willing to Prevent or Suppress Tumults; Trust them once, and they will desire no more; they will soon make it past a Treaty: And when you lye at their Mercy, complaining of the Breach of their Ingagements, they'l Deride and Spurn you; and you shall not dare to open your Mouths against them, but if you do, it shall be your Death; Night nor Day, you shall not with Safety go out of your Doors, but Stabbing and Pistoling will be common at Noon-day. Oh therefore, all ye that Honor God, see this Excee∣ding Danger before it be too late; have Patience; wait upon God in his Way; run not to Egypt for help; lean not on so broken a Reed; consider how this City hath been threatned, and by whom; how often Plots have been covered under Treaties; destroy not all your Mercies through Impatience; forsake not a Just God (who hither∣to hath Preserved you,) for any Ʋnjust Man that hath long sought by all Means to Destroy you and Enslave you, leap not out of the Pan into the Fire. Wait but a while, and you will see both City and Na∣tion flourish; distrust not; he that Believeth maketh not haste: Fear not, and you will soon see the Salvation that God is preparing for you by just Means. This Way, which
ye are now put upon, being the most dangerous that can be, and such as cannot be blessed: And had your Aldermen and Common-Council-Men any thing of God in them, they would rather seek satisfaction for all the In∣nocent Blood that hath been spilt, than for a Personal Treaty, which instead of ending your Troubles, as they would make you believe, will be but the beginning of new Sorrows; which indeed, is but just with God; Suppose the point of this Reasoning were turned against these Tender Conscienced Re∣bels, how would they approve of such Divinity, and Perillus his Law —nec lex est justior ulla. for as he justly punisheth Sin without respect of Persons, so he re∣quireth, that all whom he hath Authorized with Power, should Impartially do the like; for of all the Sins and A∣bominations of the Land, Murder and Innocent Blood (chiefly of so many thousands and ten thousands) is one of the most Crying Sins and Abominations; and until that be done away by just satisfaction, according to the Laws of God and Man, there is no appearance of any well-grounded Peace, whereof the Scots and their Con∣federates so much boast; but rather of utter Ruine to all the Three Nations. For as the Lives of Saul and Ahab were taken, the one for sparing Agag King of Amaleck, and the other Ben∣hadad King of Assyria, so it is as likely and possible, as it is just and equitable, That God will in the first place, so deal with those who have justly accused the Grand Enemy of our Peace, if they instead of Prosecution, make as unjust an Agreement, contrary to the Revealed Will of God, 1 Sam. Chap. 15. ver. 8. and 1 Kings Chap. 20. ver. 42. and particularly in Isaiah, Chap. 14. verses 18.19, 20, 21. where he expresly tells us, All the Kings of the Nations, even all of them, lye in Glory, every one in his own House: But Thou art cast out of thy Grave, like an abominable Branch, and as the Rayment of those that are slain, thrust through with a Sword, that go down to the Stones of the Pit, as a Carcase trodden under foot. Thou shalt not be joyned with them in Burial, because (observe how directly the Villain turns the point of the Sword of the Spirit of the Word of God against the Kings Heart, to in∣courage the Regicides to pierce it with the Sword of U∣surpation) thou hast destroyed thy Land, and slain thy Peo∣ple; the Seed of evil doers shall never be renowned. Prepare
Slaughter for his Children, for the Iniquity of their Fathers, that they may not rise nor possess the Land. This is the Voice of the Conscience of Separation, and how convincingly well it pleads fot the Kindness and Esteem of all Loyal Subjects, and for the Favour and Indul∣gence of Crowned Heads, let this Paper be an Eternal Witness. If this be Conscience, all People, but Kings more especially, had need to insert it into their Litany, From the Tender Conscience of Dissenting Separatists, Li∣bera Nos Domine. And most assuredly, if the True Re∣ligion, of Christ and his Apostles, teach and enjoyn all men, for Conscience sake, and under the Penalty of Eternal Damnation, to be Subject to Lawful Kings and Go∣vernors, though Heathens, Infidels, and Idolaters, as Ne∣ro was, when that Command was imposed, nay, and a most cruel Persecutor too; that must needs be a False Religion, and an Evil and Wicked Conscience, which does not only teach Rebellion, but is so Loud and Clamo∣rous to incite Subjects, contrary to all the Obligations and Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, to seek the Ruine, Death, and Destruction of their Lawful, a Just, Religi∣ous, and Christian King. But the Faction, who now were absolutely resolved upon the Kings Death, were not content with their Pens to incite the People to expect it; but, that they might ac∣complish their Execrable purpose, they fell again to Purg∣ing and Impeaching such Gentlemen, as had but the su∣spicion of Loyalty, or had done any thing towards a Personal Treaty: And Skippon, who, from a pitiful Wag∣goner under Sir Francis Vere, had by his lucky Rebellion advanced to be a Major General, a Member of the Com∣mons, and Governor of the City, Moved, That all Per∣sonal Treaters might be Excluded. So said, so done; and no sooner said and done, and the Coast on that side clear, but it was Moved in the House to proceed Capi∣tally against the King. Whereupon Cromwel, the most Superlative Hypocrite in Nature, by whose forelaid Con∣trivance all this Affair was pre-concerted, stood up, and, as if he had been surprized, said, That if any Man moved this upon Design, he should think him the Greatest
Traytor in the World; but since Providence and Necessi∣ty had cast them upon it, he should pray God to bless their Counsels, though he was not provided on the sudden to give them Counsel in so Weighty an Affair. However, upon this Motion, An Ordinance for the Tryal of the King was immediately brought in, Read and Passed that very day; and the next being the 28th. of December 1648. it was carried up to the Lords for their Concurrence. But the Remainder of that House, how Undutyful soever they had formerly been, yet, most of them, for all had not, had so much Courage and Ho∣nour left, as would not permit them, for their Own, and the sake of their Posterity, to give their Content to that Ordinance, which, by utterly stopping the Fountain of all Honour, must render them, who derived theirs from thence, not only most Ingrateful, but Infamous in all future Ages: And therefore after the Reading of it, This Ordinance was by the Major part Rejected, and the House Adjourned themselves for seven days. This Counterbuff, so little expected by the Faction, who thought they had humbled the whole Nation into that abject state of Cowardly Slavery, that none could be found so hardy as to oppose them, did wonderously Gall and Sting these Conscientious Traytors; but their Zeal, or rather Pride and Ambition, were now at the Spring-Tide, and being swell'd by the Tempest of Absolute Power, they were resolved to surmount all dif∣ficulties and oppositions; and being about to Cut up the very Root of Majestie, it is no wonder, if they made no scruple of Lopping the Branches of Honour: And therefore, The Commons of England, as they called them∣selves, many of whom were never born to an Inch of Freehold, immediately cut this Gordian Difficulty of the Negative, and indeed the whole Power of the Peerage by these Three Keen Votes. Resolved upon the Question, That the People, under God, are the Original of all Just Power. Resolved, &c. That the Commons of England in Par∣liament Assembled, being Chosen by, and Representing the Peo∣ple, have the Supreme Power of the Nation.
The Explanation of the Court, with some Animadversions. THE King sitting in a large Elbow-Chair, covered with Crimson Velvet▪ with Gold Fringe and Nails, and a Velvet Cushion, in a distinct Apart∣ment, directly over against the Lord President; between the space al∣lotted for the Counsel of the Common-wealth, standing on the right hand of the King, and the like (vacant) space leading from the Head of the Stairs to the Kings Apartment aforesaid. These three several Divisions (all level with the Floor of the Court) were hung with Turky Carpets, and Matted. In the Partition allotted for the King was also placed a small Table covered with a Turky Carpet, and a Standish and Paper set thereon, if his Majesty should have occasion for it. Note, The King, of the mere Motion, special Grace, and singular Dispensation of his (So∣veraign) Commons, was permitted, and did sit with his Hat on all the time; nay, at the very moment of pronouncing the Bloody Sentence. (See the Journal Page 25.) Thus they, who thought it not Manners to take off his Hat, yet thought it no Sin to take off His Sacred Head. The Lord President Bradshaw sitting in an Elbow-Chair, advanced upon the first rising of the Court, having a large Desk fixed before him, covered with a Velvet Fall, and a large Velvet Cushion thereupon. John Lasle sitting on the right hand of the Lord President. William Say sitting on the left hand of the Lord President. These two being appointed to be his Lordships Assistants. Note, That the said Lord President and his said Assistants, being all three of the Long Robe, sate in their Gowns, the rest of the Commissioners in their usual Habits, as Gentlemen and Souldiers. Note, That the said Lord President sat in a black Tufted Gown till the day of the Fatal Doom, what time he changed it for a Bloody Scarlet Robe, and had the Insolence to bid the King take particular Notice thereof, thinking possibly by such his barbarous Insulting Pedantick Threats to strike Terror into the King, with which yet the King was nothing moved or concerned. Andrew Broughton, John Phelps, The two Clerks appointed to attend the Court, being seated at the Feet of the said Lord President, under the Covert of his Desk, (Journal Page 12.) The Table placed before the said Clerks, whereon sometimes lay the Common-Wealths Mace and Sword of State or Justice: Sometimes, I say, for at other times, the said Sword was advanced in the head of the Guards, with Partizans standing in the Court, on the right hand of the King, as he sate, and the said Mace was sometimes hand∣ed by their Serjeant at Arms, on the out-side of the Bar, nigh the King on his left-hand. But in this they are to be pardoned, it being the first time they had Kinged it, and there∣fore it was not to be expected that they should be so ready and exact in their Ceremo∣nies. The Scale of Benches (which were covered with Scarlet Bays, and the Foot-steps mat∣ted) reaching up from the floor of the Court within 5 or 6 Foot of the very Glazing of the west Window of Westminster-Hall, whereon sate the rest of the Commissioners. The Atchievement of the Common-wealth of England. Which surely the Usurpers had caused there to be fixed, (like the Hand writing on the Wall,) in direct view of the King to let him know, That His Kingdom was numbered and finished, and Monarchy it self abolished. Well hoping at the sight thereof his Royal Countenance would change, and his Knees smite one against the other: But his Sacred Majesty not conscious of, nor dreading any thing, which they had either the Malice, or Impudence to Act, Affront, Affright, or Charge him with, viewed it with his own, to wit, an undaunted, unchangeable Countenance, and with a Majestick gate (Lyon Passant like) made towards the place they had prepared for him at his own leisure, while the Impati∣ent Serjeant at Armes, on the other side the Partition▪ was fain to attend his Princely Motion with the Mace Shouldered, and who was visibly struck with such Astonishment, that he went Trembling and Quaking, scarce able to support the Mace, or to hold up the Bar to let the King into his Apartment aforesaid, where the King presently sat himself down in the Chair set there for him; and upon all occasions offered him by the Court, always rose up with that Presence of mind, and Princely Meen, that made the Commissi∣oners shamefully hang down their Heads; none of them bearing up, but the Frontless Lord President, who throughout brazened it like the True and Trusty Chief Commissioner of the bold Usurpers, while the King never seemed in the least concerned at what he had to say, or durst to say or do unto him; the King not giving them the Glory or Pleasure to say within themselves, That they had at last made him yield, or at least dismayed him. With which his Princely Courage and Constancy the Spectators on the Scaffolds being justly and highly affected, they could no longer forbear, but burst out into loud Acclama∣tions, God bless your Majesty, God save the King. And which were seconded and return∣ed as loud from the thronged Multitude in the Hall, which made the Commissioners as it were start and look about them, to find themselves thus deceived in the People, it being easie to believe they expected their Crucisiges, and not those Hosannahs. Whereup∣on Order was given to the Cryer, and to the Officers attending in the Hall also, strictly to Charge and Command Silence, which yet did hardly prevail with the People.
Oliver Cromwell sitting on the right side of the Escocheon or Shield, as the Suppor∣ters of the Common-wealth. Henry Martin sitting on the left side of the Escocheon or Shield, as the Suppor∣ters of the Common-wealth. I do not remember there was any Escrote or Motto; for how wicked soever, they then thought, That God was such an One as Themselves, yet did they at present forbear to declare so, they being not then at that Height at which they soon after arrived in their Coyn; The Blasphemous Motto whereof [on the Reverse] was, God with us. The Galleries and Scaffolds on either side the Court thronged with Spectators. The Floor of the Court Matted, and kept clear and open, (as here represented) by the Guards on either side, no person being permitted to abide between the King, the Counsel, and the Court, but the known Officers and Messengers, appointed to attend the Court. Note, That the Level of the Floor of the Court was raised very high from the Ground, and also made close up with Boards from the Ground, about three Foot higher than the Level of the Court Floor; so that the Commissioners (whose safety seeems principally Consulted in this new Model) could not be discerned (much less pressed upon) by the Multitude in the Hall, but at some considerable distance. But his Majesties back parts (sit∣ting and standing) were always visible to the People below in the Hall, he being placed as you see on the outer Line of the Pales of the Court. This Court extended it self in length and depth from the west Window of Westmin∣ster-Hall, as far as the stone Steps now leading up to the Courts of the Chancery, and the Kings-Bench, and in Breadth, from Gallery to Gallery, belonging to the said Courts re∣spectively, covering and over-laying both the said Courts. For the Usurpers thought it not enough to destroy and abolish the ancient Fundamental Laws, the envied Ornaments of Monarchy, and the Safeguard both of the King and People. And to commit all the Liberties of England to the safe Custody of Keepers of their own appointing; and who were to be Answerable to them for their Escape, unless they also overwhelmed and trod under foot the said Courts also from whence those wholesome Laws were wont duly to be dispensed to the Nation, that their place might no where be found, but for ever be forgotten; for when they had once killed, and taken Possession also, they then deserted and laid desolate those ancient Tribunals, and planted the Courts of their Keepers of the Liberties of England, and of their Ʋpper Bench, forsooth, along the North side of Westminster-Hall, whence they distributed to the enslaved People such Liber∣ties, Priviledges, and Laws, as they thought fit to afford them. A Passage (lined with Souldiers on both sides,) leading from the Court of Wards into the High Court of Justice, and through which the Commissioners coming from the Paint∣ed Chamber, made their entry into the said Court. The Place where the moving Guard with Partizans (who together with the Serjeant at Arms, and a Person carrying the Sword of State or Justice always came along with the Commissioners from the Exchequer Chamber into the Court,) stood, sitting the Court. The place where the moving Guards with Partizans (which always attended the King, from Sir Robert Cotton's House up into the said Court, and back thither again) stood, sitting the Court. The passage leading from the Stair head, to the distinct Apartment appointed for the King, as aforesaid. Note, This passage was (railed and hung with Turky Carpets, and) always kept Barr'd and Empty, on purpose, as is to be supposed, that none might come near the King to advise, or assist him in any wise. The Partition where the Counsel of the Common-wealth, viz.—Cooke, —Dorislaus, and— Aske, stood alone on the Right hand of the King, as he was sitting. The Stairs by which the King ascended up into the Court out of Westminster-Hall. The Passage leading into Westminster-Hall, from Sir Robert Cotton's House, where His Majesty was kept un∣der strong Guards, in readiness when the Court should from time to time order him to be brought up. This Passage was planted thick with Souldiers on both sides, who, as his Majesty passed through them, to and from the Court, were wont to blow their stinking Mundungoes in his Royal Face, without any re∣proof of their Officers, who at that time durst not distaste the Souldiers, nor appear Guilty of any the least Respects, if they had any for the King; Of which base rudeness, and affront, the King yet made no Complaint, though he gave them to understand he was sensible of it, by his often putting away the offen∣sive smoak with his Hand. A large free Passage leading from Westminster-Hall gate, streight through the said Hall, within 12 or 14 Foot of the bottom of this Court. Another such like passage (going cross the upper end of the last mentioned passage, reaching and ex∣tending it self from one side of the said Hall to the other. Note, both these Passages were strongly Rayled to keep the Multitude (who, when the Court was set, was freely permitted to fill the Hall, between the Rayls and the Wall,) from breaking in upon the Souldi∣ers, who were planted all along within the Rayles, to observe and awe the Multitude, and secure the Court. In these vacant free Passages the Officers walked to and fro in a readiness, and the Souldiers thus fenced from the Mulitude, had the free use and security of their Arms upon all Accidents, and which was thought to be no more than necessary. For how confident soever the said Commissioners might seem to be, yet certainly they had their Fears. Witness (besides all this solemnity of security in view as aforesaid) the Guards in both the Palace Yards, the Guards in Sir Robert Cotton's Garden (Journal Page 18, 19.) The brick∣ing up the Door in the passage going out of the Hall towards Heaven. The strong Guards in the Courts of Request, and Court of Wards (where no Stranger, upon any terms, was permitted to stay, the Com∣missioners being to pass through those Guards from the Painted Chamber into the Court; by which it appeared they had Fears within and without, and on every side, else what meant those other Guards also placed above in the Leads on the out side the Hall (and other suspected places) mentioned in the Jour∣nal Page 19.) if it were not to prevent the danger, which they feared might otherwise have come from thence upon them; where they sat, indeed, a very fair Mark for any Person that had been but half so bloody-minded as themselves. The thronging Multitudes between the Rayles and the Hall Walls. The Officers walking up and down in the said free Passages (between the Souldiers standing within the Rayles) ready to give the necessary Orders and Commands upon all occasions. The Pageants of this Mock-Tribunal is thus represented to your view by an Eye and Ear Witness of what he saw and heard there.

The Tenor whereof followeth, viz. The Act. An Act of the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, for Erecting of a High Court of Ju∣stice, for the Trying and Judging of Charles Stuart, King of England. WHereas it is notorious, That Charles Stuart, the now King of England, not content with those many Encroachments which his Predeces∣sors had made upon the People in their Rights and Freedoms, hath had a wicked Design totally to Subvert the Ancient and Fundamental Laws and Liberties of this Nation, and in their place to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government,
and that besides all other evilways and means to bring this De∣sign to pass, he hath prosecuted it with Fire and Sword, Levied and maintained a cruel VVar in the Land, against the Parlia∣ment and Kingdom, whereby the Country hath been miserably wasted, the Publick Treasure Exhausted, Trade decayed, thousands of People murdered, and infinite other mischiefs com∣mitted; For all which high and treasonable Offences, the said Charles Stuart might long since justly have been brought to exemplary and condign Punishment: VVhereas also, the Par∣liament well hoping that the Restraint and Imprisonment of his Person, after it had pleased God to deliver him into their hands, would have quieted the distempers of the Kingdom, did for∣bear to proceed Judicially against him; but found by sad Experience, that such their Remisness served only to encourage him and his Complices in the continuance of their evil practi∣ces, and in raising of new Commotions, Rebellions, and Inva∣sions; for prevention therefore of the like or greater Inconveni∣ences, and to the end no Chief Officer or Magistrate whatsoever may hereafter presume traiterously and maliciously to imagine or contrive the Enslaving or Destroying of the English Na∣tion, and to expect Impunity for so doing, Be it Ordained and Enacted by the Commons in Parliament, and it is hereby Or∣dained and Enacted by Authority thereof, That Thomas Lord Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, Es∣quires, Sir Hardress Waller, Knight, Philip Skippon, Valentine Wauton, Thomas Harrison, Edward Wha∣ley, Thomas Pride, Isaac Ewer, Richard Ingoldsby, Henry Mildmay, Esquires, Sir Thomas Honywood, Thomas Lord Grey of Groby, Philip Lord Lisle, Wil∣liam Lord Mounson, Sir John Danvers, Sir Thomas Maleverer Baronet, Sir John Bourchier, Sir James Har∣rington, Sir William Allanson, Sir Henry Mildmay, Sir Thomas Wroth, Knights, Sir William Masham, Sir John Barrington, Sir William Brereton, Baronets, Robert Wallop, William Heveningham, Esquires, Isaac Pennington, Thomas Atkins, Rowland Wilson, Aldermen of the City of London, Sir Peter Wentworth, Knight of the Bath, Henry Martin, William Purefoy, Godfrey Bosvile, John Trenchard, Herbert Morley, John Berkstead, Matthew Tomlinson, John Blackis∣ton, Gilbert Millington, Esquires, Sir William Con∣stable,

The Manner of the Tryal of Charles Stuart King of England. ON Saturday, being the 20th. Day of January, 1648. the Lord President of the High Court of Ju∣stice, his two Assistants, and the rest of the Commis∣sioners of the said Court, according to the Adjourn∣ment of the said Court from the Painted Chamber, came to the Bench, or Place prepared for their Sitting, at the West End of the Great Hall at Westminster; di∣vers Officers of the said Court, one and twenty Gentlemen with Partizans, and a Sword and Mace marching before them up into the Court, where the Lord President, in a crimson Velvet Chair fixed in the midst of the Court, placed himself, having a Desk with a crimson Velvet Cushion before him: the rest of the Members placing themselves on each side of him, upon several Seats or Benches prepared, and hung with Scarlet for that purpose. The Lord Presi∣dent's two Assistants sitting next of each side of him, and the two Clerks of the Court placed at a Table somewhat lower, and covered with a Turky Carpet; upon which Table was also laid the Sword and Mace, the said Guard of Partizans dividing themselves on each side of the Court before them. Three Proclamations are made for all persons that were Adjourned over thither, to draw near. The Court being thus sate, and Silence enjoyned, the Great Gate of the Hall was set open, to the in∣tent that all persons (without exception) desirous to see or hear, might come unto it: upon which the Hall was presently filled, and Silence again ordered and proclaimed. After Silence proclaimed as aforesaid, the Act of the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, for Erecting of a High Court of Justice for Trying and Judging of CHARLES STƲART King of England, was openly read by one of the Clerks of the Court.
The Act being read, the Court was called, every Commissioner present, thereupon rising to his Name. Commissioners present. Westminster-Hall, Jan. 20. 1648.

Thomlinson, who had the Charge of the Prisoner, with∣in a quarter of an hours space brought him, attended by Col. Hacker, and two and thirty Officers with Par∣tizans,
guarding him to the Court, his own Servants immediately attending him. Being thus brought up in the Face of the Court, the Serjeant at Arms with his Mace receives him, and conducts him straight to the Bar, having a crimson Velvet Chair set before him. After a stern looking upon the Court and the People in the Galleries on each side of him, he places himself in the Chair, not at all moving his Hat, or otherwise shewing the least respect to the Court; but presently riseth up again, and turns about, looking downwards upon the Guards placed on the left side, and on the multitude of Spe∣ctators on the right side of the said great Hall, the Guard that attended him, in the mean time dividing themselves on each side the Court, and his own Ser∣vants following him to the Bar, stand on the left hand of the Prisoner. The Prisoner having again placed himself in his Chair, with his Face towards the Court, and Silence being again ordered and proclaimed, the Lord President in the Name of the Court, addressed himself to the Prisoner, acquainting him, That the Commons of Eng∣land Assembled in Parliament, being deeply sensible of the Evils and Calamities that had been brought upon this Nation, and of the innocent Blood that had been spilt in it, which was fixed upon him as the principal Author of it, had resolved to make Inquisition for this Blood, and according to the Debt they did owe to God, to Justice, the Kingdom, and themselves, and according to that Fundamental Power that rested, and Trust reposed in them by the People, other Means failing through his Default, had resolved to bring him to Tryal and Judgment, and had therefore constituted that Court of Justice, before which he was then brought, where he was to hear his Charge, upon which the Court would proceed according to Justice. Hereupon, Mr. Cooke, Sollicitor for the Common-wealth, standing within a Bar, with the rest of the Councel for the Common-wealth on the right hand of the Prisoner, offered to speak; but the Prisoner, having a Staff in his hand, held it up, and softly laid it upon the said Mr. Cooke's Shoulder two or three times, bidding him hold; nevertheless, the Lord Pre∣sident
ordering him to go on, Mr. Cooke did according to the Order of the Court, to him directed, in the Name, and on the behalf of the People of England, exhibit a Charge of High Treason, and other high Crimes, and did therewith accuse the said CHARLES STƲART King of England; praying in the Name, and on the behalf aforesaid, that the Charge might be accordingly received and read, and due Proceed∣ings had thereupon; and accordingly preferred a Charge in writing, which being received by the Court, and delivered to the Clerk of the Court, the Lord President in the Name of the Court ordered it should be read. But the King interrupting the reading of it, the Court notwithstanding commanded the Clerk to read it, acquainting the Prisoner that if he had any thing to say after, the Court would hear him; whereupon the Clerk read the Charge, the Tenor whereof is as followeth, viz. A Charge of High Treason, and other High Crimes Exhibited to the High Court of Justice by John Cooke Esq Sollicitor General, appointed by the said Court, for, and on the behalf of the People of England, against CHARLES STƲART King of England. THat He the said CHARLES STUART, being admitted King of England, and therein trust∣ed with a limited Power to govern by, and according to the Laws of the Land, and not otherwise; and by his Trust, Oath and Office, being obliged to use the Power commit∣ted to him, for the Good and Benefit of the People, and for the Preservation of their Rights and Liberties; Yet nevertheless, out of a wicked Design to erect and uphold in himself an unli∣mited and Tyrannical Power to rule according to his Will, and to overthrow the Rights and Liberties of the People, yea to take away and make void the Foundations thereof, and of all redress
and remedy of misgovernment, which by the Fundamental Con∣stitutions of this Kingdom, were reserved on the Peoples behalf, in the Right and Power of frequent and successive Parliaments or National Meetings in Councel, He the said CHARLES STUART, for accomplishment of such his Designs, and for the Protecting of himself and his Adherents, in his and their wicked Practices, to the same Ends, hath Traiterously and Maliciously Levied War against the present Parliament, and the People therein represented; Particularly, upon or about the Thirtieth day of June, in the Year of our Lord 1642. at Be∣verley in the County of York; and upon or about the Thirti∣eth day of July in the Year aforesaid, in the County of the City of York; and upon or about the four and twentieth day of August in the same Year, at the County of the Town of Not∣tingham, where, and when he set up his Standard of War; and also on or about the twenty third day of Octob. in the same Year, at Edge-Hill and Keynton Field, in the County of Warwick; and upon or about the thirtieth day of Novem∣ber in the same Year, at Brainford in the County of Mid∣dlesex; and upon or about the thirtieth day of August, in the Year of our Lord 1643, at Caversham-Bridge near Reading in the County of Berks; and upon or about the thirtieth day of October in the Year last mentioned, at or near the City of Gloucester; and upon or about the thirtieth day of November in the Year last mentioned, at Newbury in the County of Berks; and upon or about the thirty first day of July in the Year of our Lord 1644. at Cropredy-Bridge in the County of Oxon; and upon or about the thir∣tieth day of September in the last Year mentioned, at Bod∣wyn and other Places near adjacent, in the County of Corn∣wall; and upon or about the thirtieth day of November in the Year last mentioned, at Newbury aforesaid; and upon or about the eighth day of June in the Year of our Lord 1645. at the Town of Leicester; and also upon the fourteenth day of the same Month in the same Year, at Nazeby-Field in the County of Northampton. At which several Times and Places, or most of them, and at many other Places in this Land, at several other times within the Years afore-mentioned; and in the Year of our Lord 1646. He the said CHARLES STUART hath caused and procured many Thousands of the free People of this Nation to be slain, and by Divisions,
Parties, and Insurrections within this Land, by Invasions from Foreign Parts, endeavoured and procured by him, and by ma∣ny other evil ways and means, He the said CHARLES STUART hath not only maintained and carried on the said War both by Land and Sea, during the Year before menti∣oned, but also hath renewed or caused to be renewed the said War against the Parliament and good People of this Nation, in this present Year 1648. in the Counties of Kent, Essex, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex, and many other Counties and Places in England and Wales; and also by Sea. And par∣ticularly He the said CHARLES STUART hath for that purpose given Commission to his Son the Prince, and others, whereby, besides multitudes of other Persons, many such as were by the Parliament intrusted and employed for the safety of the Nation (being by him or his Angels corrupted to the betraying of their Trust, and revolting from the Parliament) have had Entertainment and Commission for the continuing and renewing of War and Hostility against the said Parliament and People, as aforesaid; By which cruel and unnatural Wars by him the said CHARLES STUART Levied, Continued and Renewed as aforesaid, much innocent Blood of the free People of this Nation hath been spilt, many Families have been undone, the Publick Treasury wasted and exhausted, Trade obstructed, and miserably decayed, vast Expence and Dammage to the Nation incurred, and many parts of this Land spoiled, some of them even to desolation. And for further Prosecution of his said evil Designs, He the said CHARLES STUART doth still continue his Commissions to the said Prince, and other Rebels and Revolters both English and Foreigners, and to the E. of Ormond, and to the Irish Re∣bels and Revolters associated with him; from whom further Invasions upon this Land are threatned, upon the procurement and on the behalf of the said CHARLES STUART. All which wicked Designs, Wars and evil Practices of him the said CHARLES STƲART, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a Perso∣nal Interest of Will and Power, and pretended Prerogative to himself and his Family, against the Publick Interest, Com∣mon Right, Liberty, Justice and Peace of the People of this Nation, by and for whom he was intrusted as aforesaid.
By all which it appeareth, that He the said CHARLES STƲART hath been, and is the Occasioner, Author, and Con∣tinuer of the said unnatural, cruel and bloody Wars, and there∣in guilty of all the Treasons, Murders, Rapines, Burnings, Spoils, Desolations, Dammages and Mischiefs to this Nation acted and committed in the said Wars, or occasioned thereby. And the said John Cooke by Protestation saving on the behalf of the said People of England, the liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other Charge against the said CHARLES STƲART, and also of replying to the Answers which the said CHARLES STƲART shall make to the Premises, or any of them, or any other Charge that shall be so exhibited, doth for the said Treasons and Crimes, on the behalf of the said People of England, impeach the said CHARLES STƲART, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murderer, and a Publick and implacable Enemy to the Commonwealth of England, and pray that the said CHARLES STƲART King of England, may be put to answer all and eve∣ry the Premises, and that such Proceedings, Exami∣nations, Trials, Sentences and Judgments may be thereupon had, as shall be agreeable to Justice. Subscribed, John Cooke. The Prisoner, while the Charge was reading, sate down in his Chair, looking sometimes on the High Court, and sometimes on the Galleries, and rose again, and turned about to behold the Guards & Spectators, and after sate down looking very sternly, and with a Countenance not at all moved, till these words, viz. CHARLES STƲART to be a Tyrant, Traytor, &c. were read; at which he laughed as he sate in the face of the Court. The Charge being read, the Lord President, in the Name of the Court, demanded the Prisoner's An∣swer thereto. But the Prisoner declining that, fell into a Dis∣course of the late Treaty in the Isle of Wight, and de∣manded,
By what lawful Authority he was brought from the Isle thither? upbraiding the Court with the many un∣lawful Authorities in the World, instancing in Rob∣bers and takers of Purses, pleading his Kingship, and thereby a Trust committed to him by God, by descent, which he should betray, together with the Liberties of the People, in case he should answer to an unlaw∣ful Power, which he charged the Court to be, and that they were raised by an Ʋsurped Power; and affirmed, that He stood more for the Liberties of the People, than any of the Judges there sitting, and again demanded, by what Authority he was brought thither? To which it was replied by the Court, That had he been pleased to have observed what was declared to him by the Court at his first coming, and the Charge which he had heard read unto him, he might have informed himself by what Authority he was brought before them; namely, By the Au∣thority of the Commons of England Assembled in Parlia∣ment, on the behalf of the People of England: and did therefore again several times advise him to consider of a better Answer; which he refused to do, but persisted in his Contumacy. Whereupon, the Court at length told him, That, they did expect from him a Positive An∣swer to the Charge; affirming their Authority, and gi∣ving him to understand, that they were upon God's and the Kingdom's Errand, and that the Peace stood for, would be better had and kept when Justice was done, and that was their present Work; and advised him seriously to consider what he had to do at his next appearance; which was declared should be upon Monday following, and so remanded him to his former Custody. The Prisoner all the time having kept on his Hat, departed, without shewing any the least respect to the Court; but going out of the Bar, said, He did not fear that Bill; pointing to the Table where the Sword and Charge lay. The Prisoner being withdrawn, three Proclama∣tions were made, and the Court Adjourned it self to the Painted Chamber on Monday Morning then next, at Nine of the Clock; declaring, that from thence they intended to Adjourn to the same Place again.
But that the Reader may have the entire Relation of this deplorable Tragedy, I have from the most Authentick Prints inserted at large the interlocutory Passages between the King and Bradshaw, of which Mr. Phelpes in his Journal, gives only a succinct Account; which take as follows: His Majesty with his wonted Patience, heard all these Slanders and Reproaches, sitting in the Chair, and looking sometimes on the Pretended Court, sometimes up to the Galleries, and ri∣sing again, turned about to behold the Guards and Spectators; then he sate down with a Majestick and unmoved Countenance, and sometimes smiling, especially at those Words [Tyrant, Traytor,] and the like. Also the Silver Head of his Staff happened to fall off, at which he wondered; and seeing none to take it up, He stooped for it himself. The Charge being read, Bradshaw began. Sir, You have now heard your Charge read, con∣taining such Matters as appear in it: You find that in the Close of it, it is prayed to the Court, in the behalf of the Commons of England, that you Answer to your Charge: The Court expects your Answer. King. I would know by what Power I am called hither. I was not long ago in the Isle of Wight, how I came there, is a longer Story than I think is fit at this time for Me to speak of: but there I entred into a Treaty with both Houses of Parlia∣ment, with as much Publick Faith as its possible to be had of any People in the World, I Treated there with a number of Honourable Lords and Gentlemen, and Treated honestly and uprightly; I cannot say but they did very Nobly with Me: We were upon a Conclusion of the Treaty. Now I would know by what Authority (I mean Lawful; There are ma∣ny Ʋnlawful Authorities in the World; Thieves and Rob∣bers by the High-ways: but I would know by what Authori∣ty) I was brought from thence, and carried from place to
place, and I know not what. And when I know by what Lawful Authority, I shall Answer. Remember, I am your King, your Lawful King, and what Sins you bring upon your heads, and the Judgment of God up∣on this Land. Think well upon it, I say, think well upon it, before you go further from one Sin to a greater. Therefore let me know by what lawful Authority I am seated here, and I shall not be unwilling to answer. In the mean time, I shall not be∣tray my Trust; I have a Trust committed to me by God, by old and lawful Descent, I will not betray it, to answer to a new unlawful Authority: Therefore resolve me that, and you shall hear more of me. Bradshaw. If you had been pleased to have observed what was hinted to you by the Court at your first coming hither, you would have known by what Au∣thority; which Authority requires you in the Name of the People of England, of which you are Elected King, to Answer. King. No, Sir, I deny that. Bradshaw. If you acknowledge not the Authority of the Court, they must proceed. King. I do tell them so: England was never an Elective Kingdom, but an Hereditary Kingdom for near these thousand Years: Therefore let me know by what Authority I am called hither. I do stand more for the Liberty of my People, than any here that come to be my pretended Judges; and therefore let me know by what lawful Authority I am seated here, and I will Answer it, otherwise I will not answer it. Bradshaw. Sir, How really you have managed your Trust, is known; your way of Answer is to inter∣rogate the Court, which beseems not you in this con∣dition. You have been told of it twice or thrice. King. Here is a Gentleman, Lieut. Col. Cobbet, ask him if he did not bring me from the Isle of Wight by force. I do not come here as submitting to the Court. I will stand as much for the Priviledge of the House of Com∣mons, rightly understood, as any man here whatsoever: I see no House of Lords here, that may constitute a Parliament; and the King too should have been. Is this the bringing of the King to his Parliament? Is this the bringing an end to the Treaty in the Publick Faith of the World?
Let me see a Legal Authority warranted by the Word of God, the Scriptures, or warranted by the Constitutions of the King∣dom, and I will answer. Bradshaw. Sir, You have propounded a Question, and have been answered. Seeing you will not answer, the Court will consider how to proceed. In the mean time, those that brought you hither, are to take Charge of you back again. The Court desires to know whether this be all the Answer you will give, or no. King. Sir, I desire that you would give me and all the World satisfaction in this. Let me tell you, It is not a slight thing you are about. I am sworn to keep the Peace, by that Duty I owe to God and my Country; and I will do it to the last breath of my Body. And therefore you shall do well to satisfie, first, God, and then the Country, by what Authority you do it. If you do it by an Ʋsurped Authority, you cannot answer it: There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you Power, to account. Satisfie me in that, and I will answer; otherwise I betray my Trust, and the Liberties of the People: And therefore think of that, and then I shall be wil∣ling: For I do avow, That it is as great a Sin to withstand Lawful Authority, as it is to submit to a Tyrannical, or any other ways Ʋnlawful Authority. And therefore satisfie God, and Me, and all the World in that, and you shall receive my Answer. I am not afraid of the Bill. Bradshaw. The Court expects you should give them a final Answer. Their Purpose is to Adjourn till Monday next: If you do not satisfie your self, though we do tell you our Authority, we are satisfied with our Authority; and it is upon God's Authority and the Kingdoms; and that Peace you speak of, will be kept in the doing of Justice, and that's our present Work. King. For Answer, Let me tell you, you have shewn no Lawful Authority to satisfie any reasonable man. Bradshaw. That's in Your Apprehension; We are satisfied that are your Judges. King. 'Tis not My Apprehension, nor Yours neither, that ought to decide it.
Bradshaw. The Court hath heard you, and you are to be disposed of as they have commanded. So commanding the Guard to take him away, His Majesty only replied, Well, Sir. And at his going down, pointing with his Staff to∣ward the This must be a Mistake for there was no Axe there; but it is Bill in Phelpe's Journal; which Bill was the Charge, which the King meant, when now, as also before, he said, He did not fear that Bill. Axe, He said, I do not fear that. As He went down the Stairs, the People in the Hall cried out, God save the King; notwithstanding some were set there by the Faction to lead the Cla∣mour for Justice.

Ordered, That the Committee for nominating the Officers of this Court, together with the Committee for nominating the Guards, do consider of an Allowance for Diet of the Officers, and what other satisfaction they shall have for their Ser∣vice. Col. Harvey informeth the Court, That he was de∣sired to signifie unto this Court, in the behalf of Mr. John Corbet, Member of this Court, that his absence is not from any disaffection to the Proceedings of this Court, but in regard of other especial Employment that he hath in the Service of the State. Here the Court considered of the King's Carriage on the Saturday before, and of all that had then pas∣sed on the Courts behalf, and approved thereof, as agreeing to their Sense and Directions; and perceiv∣ing what the King aimed at, (viz) to bring in que∣stion (if he could) the Jurisdiction of the Court, and the Authority whereby they sate; and considering that he had not in the interim acknowledged them in any sort to be a Court, or in any Judicial capacity to determine of his Demand and Plea, and that through their sides he intended to wound (if he might be per∣mitted) the Supream Authority of the Commons of Eng∣land, in their Representative; The Commons Assembled in Parliament, after Advice with their Councel Learned in both Laws, and mature Deliberation had of the Matter, Resolved, That the Prisoner should not be suffered to bring these things in question which he aimed at, touching that Highest Jurisdiction, whereof they might not make themselves Judges, and from which there was no Appeal. And therefore Order and Di∣rect, viz.
Ordered, That in case the King shall again offer to fall in∣to that Discourse, the Lord President do let him know, That the Court have taken into consideration his Demands of the last Day, and that he ought to rest satisfied with this Answer, That the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, have Constituted this Court; whose Power may not, nor should not be permitted to be disputed by him, and that they were resolved he should answer his Charge. That, in case he shall refuse to Answer, or acknowledge the Court, the Lord President do let him know, that the Court will take it as a Contumacy, and that it shall be so Re∣corded. That, in case he shall offer to Answer with a Saving Not∣withstanding of his pretended Prerogative, That the Lord President do in the Name of the Court refuse his Protest, and require his Positive Answer to the Charge. That, in case the King shall demand a Copy of the Charge, that he shall then declare his intention to Answer; and that declaring such his intention, a Copy be granted unto him. That, in case the King shall still persist in his Contempt, the Lord President do give Command to the Clerk to demand of the King in the Name of the Court, in these Words follow∣ing, viz. CHARLES STUART, King of England, You are accused in the behalf of the People of England, of diverse High Crimes and Treasons; which Charge hath been read unto You; The Court requires you to give a Positive An∣swer, whether You confess or deny the Charge, having deter∣mined, that You ought to Answer the same. Ordered, That the Commissioners shall be called in open Court, at the Courts Sitting in the Hall, and that the Names of such as appear shall be Recorded. Hereupon, the Court forthwith Adjourned it self into Westminster-Hall.
Westminster-Hall, 22 Jan. 1648. Post Merid. The Commissioners coming from the Painted Cham∣ber, take their Place in the Publick Court in Westmin∣ster-Hall, as on Saturday before; and being sate, and the Hall Doors set open, Three Proclamations are made, for all Persons that were Adjourned over to this time, to give their Attendance, and for all Persons to keep Silence, upon pain of Imprisonment.

The Court being called, the Serjeant is commanded to fetch his Prisoner. The King is again brought Prisoner to the Bar, as on Saturday before; Proclamation is made for Silence, whilst Pleas of the Commonwealth were in hand, and Order given to the Captain of the Guard to take in∣to his Custody such as should disturb the Court. Mr. Sollicitor moved the Court, that the Prisoner might give a Positive Answer to his Charge, or other∣wise that the Court would take the Matter of it pro Confesso, and proceed thereupon according to Justice; which being pressed by the Court upon the Prisoner, and their Judgment again made known unto him, That he was to Answer his Charge, otherwise that his Contumacy would be recorded. The Prisoner, that notwithstanding, still insisted upon his former Plea, and that the Court had no Power, nor the Commons of England, who had consti∣tuted it, to proceed against him; upon which, the Clerk of the Court, by Command, and according to former Order, required his Answer in the Form pre∣scribed: and the Prisoner still refusing to submit thereto, his Default and Contempt were again Re∣corded, the Prisoner remanded, and the Court Ad∣journed it self till the next day, being Tuesday, at Twelve of the Clock, to the Painted Chamber; withal, giving Notice, that from thence they intended to Adjourn to this Place again. Sunday having been spent in Fasting and Seditious Preaching, according to the Mode of these Impious Hypocrites, who used to Preface Rebellion and Mur∣der
with the Appearance of Religion; the Illustri∣ous Sufferer was (as is before in Phelpe's Journal re∣lated) placed before the infamous Tribunal; vvhere their Mercenary Sollicitor Cooke opened the Tragick Scene thus, displaying his Talents of Impudence and Treason. Cooke. May it please your Lordship, my Lord President, I did at the last Court, in the behalf of the Commons of England, exhibit and give in to this Court a Charge of High Treason, and other High Crimes against the Prisoner at the Bar; whereof I do accuse him in the Name of the People of England; and the Charge was read unto him, and his An∣swer required. My Lord, He was not pleased to give an An∣svver; but instead of ansvvering, did there dispute the Au∣thority of this High Court. My Humble Motion to this High Court, in the behalf of the Kingdom of England, is, That the Prisoner may be directed to make a Positive An∣svver, either by vvay of Confession or Negation; vvhich, if he shall refuse to do, that then the Matter of Charge may be taken pro confesso, and the Court may proceed according to Justice. Bradshavv. Sir, You may remember, at the last Court you vvere told the occasion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge read against you, containing a Charge of High Treason, and other High Crimes against this Realm of England; you have heard likewise that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you should give an Answer to that Charge, that thereupon such Proceedings might be had, as should be agreeable to Justice: You were then pleased to make some Scruples concerning the Authority of this Court, and knew not by what Au∣thority you were brought hither: You did divers times propound your Questions, and were as often answered, That it was by Authority of the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, that did think fit to call you to Account for those High and Capital Misdemeanors wherewith you were then charged. Since that, the Court hath taken into consideration
what you then said: they are fully satisfied with their own Authority, and they hold it fit you should stand satisfied with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a positive and particular Answer to this Charge that is exhibited against you. They do expect you should either confess or deny it: If you deny, it is offered in the behalf of the Kingdom, to be made good against you. Their Authority they do avow to the whole World, that the vvhole Kingdom are to rest satisfied in, and you are to rest satisfied vvith it; and therefore you are to lose no more time, but to give a positive Ansvver thereunto. King. When I was here last, 'tis very true, I made that Question; and if it were only my own particular Case, I would have satisfied my self with the Protestation I made the last time I was here, against the Legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be Tryed by any Superior Jurisdiction on Earth: But it is not my Case alone, it is the Freedom and the Liberty of the People of England; and do you pretend what you will, I stand more for their Liberties. For if Power without Law, may make Laws, may alter the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Subject he is in England that can be sure of his Life, or any thing that he calls his own: Therefore, when that I came here, I did expect particular Reasons, to know by what Law, what Authority you did proceed against Me here; and therefore I am a little to seek what to say to you in this Particular, because the Affirmative is to be proved, the Negative often is very hard to do: But since I cannot perswade you to do it, I shall tell you my Reasons as short as I can. My Reasons why in Conscience, and the Duty I owe to God first, and my People next, for the Preservation of their Lives, Liberties and Estates, I conceive I cannot answer this, till I be satisfied of the Legality of it. All Proceedings against any Man whatsoever— Bradshaw. Sir, I must interrupt you; vvhich I vvould not do, but that vvhat you do, is not agreea∣ble to the Proceedings of any Court of Justice. You are about to enter into Argument and Dispute con∣cerning the Authority of this Court, before vvhom you appear as a Prisoner, and are charged as an high
Delinquent: If you take upon you to dispute the Authority of the Court, we may not do it, nor will any Court give way unto it; you are to submit unto it, you are to give a punctual and direct Answer, whe∣ther you will answer your Charge or no, and what your Answer is. King. Sir, By your favour, I do not know the Forms of Law; I do know Law and Reason, though I am no Lawyer professed: But I know as much Law as any Gentleman in Eng∣land, and therefore, under favour, I do plead for the Liber∣ties of the People of England more than you do; and there∣fore if I should impose a Belief upon any man without Reasons given for it, it were unreasonable: But I must tell you, that by that Reason that I have, as thus informed, I cannot yield un∣to it. Bradshaw. Sir, I must interrupt you; you may not be permitted: You speak of Law and Reason; it is fit there should be Law and Reason; and there is both against you. Sir, The Vote of the Commons of England Assem∣bled in Parliament, it is the Reason of the Kingdom; and they are these too that have given that Law ac∣cording to which you should have Ruled and Reign∣ed. Sir, You are not to dispute our Authority, you are told it again by the Court; Sir, it will be taken notice of, that you stand in contempt of the Court, and your contempt will be recorded accordingly. King. I do not know how a King can be a Delinquent; but by any Law that ever I heard of, all men (Delinquents, or what you will) let me tell you, they may put in Demurrers a∣gainst any Proceeding as Legal; and I do demand that, and demand to be heard with my Reasons: if you deny that, you deny Reason. Bradshaw. Sir, You have offered something to the Court; I shall speak something unto you the Sense of the Court. Sir, neither you nor any man are permitted to dispute that Point; you are concluded, you may not demur to the Jurisdiction of the Court; if you do, I must let you know that they over-rule your Demurrer: They sit here by the Authority of the Commons of England, and all your Predecessors and you are responsible to them.
King. I deny that; shew me one Precedent. Bradshaw. Sir, You ought not to interrupt while the Court is speaking to you. This Point is not to be debated by you, neither will the Court permit you to do it: If you offer it by way of Demurrer to the Jurisdiction of the Court, they have considered of their Jurisdiction, they do affirm their own Jurisdi∣ction. King. I say, Sir, By your favour, that the Commons of England was never a Court of Judicature; I would know how they came to be so. Bradshaw. Sir, You are not to be permitted to go on in that Speech, and these Discourses. Then the Clerk of the Court read, CHARLES STƲART, King of England, You have been accused on the behalf of the People of England, of High Treason, and other High Crimes; the Court have determined that you ought to Answer the same. King. I will Answer the same so soon as I know by what Authority you do this. Bradshaw. If this be all that you will say, then, Gentlemen, you that brought the Prisoner hither, take charge of him back again. King. I do require that I may give in my Reasons why I do not Answer; and give Me time for that. Bradshaw. Sir, 'Tis not for Prisoners to require. King. Prisoners, Sir! I am not an ordinary Prisoner. Bradshaw. The Court hath considered of their Juris∣diction, and they have already affirmed their Juris∣diction: If you will not answer, we will give Or∣der to Record your Default. King. You never heard my Reasons yet. Bradshaw. Sir, Your Reasons are not to be heard against the highest Jurisdiction. King. Shew Me that Jurisdiction where Reason is not to be heard.
Bradshaw. Sir, We shew it you here, The Commons of England: and the next time you are brought, you will know more of the Pleasure of the Court; and it may be, their final Determination. King. Shew Me where ever the House of Commons was a Court of Judicature of that kind. Bradshaw. Serjeant, Take away the Prisoner. King. Well, Sir, Remember that the King is not suf∣fered to give in his Reasons for the Liberty and Freedom of all his Subjects, Bradshaw. Sir, You are not to have Liberty to use this Language. How great a Friend you have been to the Laws and Liberties of the People, let all Eng∣land and the World judge. King. Sir, Ʋnder favour, it was the Liberty, Freedom, and Laws of the Subject that ever I took—defended My self with Arms: I never took up Arms against the People, but for the Laws. Bradshaw. The Command of the Court must be obeyed: No Answer will be given to the Charge. King. Well, Sir. Then Bradshaw Ordered the Default to be Recorded, and the Contempt of the Court, and that no Answer would be given to the Charge. The King was Guarded forth to Sir Robert Cotton's House. The Court Adjourned to the Painted Chamber on Tuesday at Twelve of the Clock, and from thence they intend to Adjourn to Westminster-Hall, at which time all Persons concerned are to give their Attendance.
His Majesty not being suffered to deliver his Rea∣sons against the Jurisdiction of their Pretended Court, by word of Mouth, thought fit to leave them in Writing to the more impartial Judgment of Posterity, as followeth; HAving already made my Protestations, not only against the Illegality of this Pretended Court, but also, That no Earthly Power can justly call Me (who am your King) in question, as a Delinquent; I would not any more open My Mouth upon this Occasion, more than to refer my self to what I have spoken, were I in this Case alone concerned: But the Duty I owe to God in the Pre∣servation of the True Liberty of My People, will not suffer Me at this time to be silent: For, how can any Free-born Subject of England call Life or any thing he possesseth, his own, if Power without Right, dayly make New, and abro∣gate the Old Fundamental Law of the Land? Which I now take to be the present Case. Wherefore, when I came hither, I expected that you would have endeavoured to have satisfied Me concerning these Grounds which hinder Me to answer to your Pretended Impeachment: But since I see that nothing I can say, will move you to it (though Negatives are not so naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will shew you the Reason why I am confident you cannot Judge Me, nor indeed the meanest Man in England: For I will not (like you) without shewing a Reason, seek to impose a Belief upon My Subjects. There is no Proceeding just against any man,Hereabout I was stopt, and not suf∣fered to speak any more con∣cerning Reasons. but what is vvar∣ranted either by God's Laws, or the Municipal Laws of the Countrey where he lives. Now I am most confident, This Days Proceeding cannot be warranted by God's Law; for, on the con∣trary, The Authority of Obedience unto Kings, is clearly war∣ranted, and strictly commanded both in the Old and New Te∣stament; which, if denied, I am ready instantly to prove. And for the Question now in hand, there it is said, That, Where the Word of a King is, There is Power; and who may say unto Him, What dost Thou? Eccl.
8.4. Then for the Law of this Land, I am no less confident, That no Learned Lawyer will affirm, That, An Impeach∣ment can lie against the King; they all going in His Name: And one of their Maxims is, That, The King can do no Wrong. Besides, The Law upon which you ground your Proceedings, must either be Old or New; if Old, shew it; if New, tell what Authority warranted by the Fun∣damental Laws of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the House of Commons can erect a Court of Judica∣ture, which was never one it self, (as is well knovvn to all Lavvyers) I leave to God and the World to judge: And it vvere full as strange, that they should pretend to make Laws vvithout King or Lords House, to any that have heard speak of the Lavvs of England. And admitting, but not granting, That the People of Eng∣land's Commission could grant your Pretended Power, I see nothing you can shew for that; for certainly you never asked the Question of the Tenth Man in the Kingdom; and in this way you manifestly wrong even the Poorest Ploughman, if you demand not his free Consent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your Pretended Commission, vvithout the Consent at least of the Major Part of every Man in Eng∣land, of vvhatsoever Quality or Condition, vvhich I am sure you never vvent about to seek; so far are you from having it. Thus you see that I speak not for My ovvn Right alone, as I am your King, but also for the true Liberty of all My Subjects; vvhich consists not in the Power of Govern∣ment, but in Living under such Laws, such a Go∣vernment, as may give themselves the best Assurance of their Lives, and Property of their Goods. Nor in this, must, or do I forget the Privileges of Both Houses of Parliament; vvhich this Days Proceedings do not only violate, but likevvise occasion the greatest Breach of their Publick Faith, that (I believe) ever vvas heard of; with which I am far from Charging the Two Houses; for all Pretended Crimes laid against Me, bear Date long before this Treaty at Newport; in which, I having conclu∣ded as much as in Me lay, and hopefully expecting the Houses Agreement thereunto, I was suddenly surprized, and hurried from thence as a Prisoner; upon which account I am against My Will brought hither; vvhere, since I am come, I
cannot but to My Power defend the Ancient Laws and Liber∣ties of this Kingdom, together with My own just Right. Then, for any thing I can see, the Higher House is totally ex∣cluded. And for the House of Commons, it is too well known that the Major part of them are detained or deterred from Sit∣ting; so as, if I had no other, this were sufficient for Me to protest against the Lawfulness of your Pretended Court. Besides all this, the Peace of the Kingdom is not the least in My Thoughts; and what hopes of Settlement is there, so long as Power reigns without Rule or Law, changing the whole Frame of that Government under which this Kingdom hath flourished for many hundred Years? (nor will I say what will fall out, in case this lawless, unjust Proceeding against Me, do go on.) And believe it, the Commons of England will not thank you for this Change; for they will remember how happy they have been of late Years under the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, the King My Father, and My Self, until the beginning of these unhappy Troubles, and will have cause to doubt that they shall never be so happy under any New. And by this time it will be too sensibly evident, that the Arms I took up, were only to defend the Fundamental Laws of this King∣dom, against those who have supposed My Power hath totally changed the Ancient Government. Thus having shewed you briefly the Reasons why I cannot submit to your Pretended Authority, without violating the Trust which I have from God for the Welfare and Liberty of My People, I expect from you either clear Reasons to convince My Judgment, shewing Me that I am in an Error, (and then truly I will Answer) or that you will withdraw your Pro∣ceedings. This I intended to speak in Westminster-Hall on Mon∣day, January 22. but against Reason, was hindred to shew my Reasons.

Here the Court sate private. And taking into consideration the Proceeding of the last Court the last day, fully approved of what
in their behalf had been then said and done; and likewise taking into consideration the Demeanor of the King at the said Court, have notwithstanding re∣solved to try him once more, whether he will own the Court; and to that purpose, Ordered, That the Lord President do acquaint the King, in case he shall continue contumacious, that he is to expect no further time; and that the Lord President do therefore in the Name of the Court, require his Positive and Final Answer; and if he shall still persist in his obstinacy, that the Lord President give Command to the Clerk to read as followeth, viz. CHARLES STƲART King of England, you are accused on the behalf of the People of England, of divers High Crimes and Treasons; which Charge hath been read unto you: The Court now requires you to give your final and positive Answer by way of Confession or Denial of the Charge. Nevertheless, if the King should submit to answer, and desire a Copy of his Charge, that it be granted him by the Lord President; notwithstanding, giving him to know, That the Court might in Justice forth∣with proceed to Judgment for his former Contuma∣cy and Failer to Answer, and that he be required to give his Answer to the said Charge the next day at One of the Clock in the Afternoon. Whereupon, The Court Adjourned to Westminster-Hall forth∣with.
Westminster-Hall, 28 Jan. 1648. Post Merid. Three Proclamations being made, and Attendance and Silence commanded as formerly, The Court is thereupon called.

The Court being called, the Serjeant is required to send for the Prisoner, who was accordingly brought to the Bar, where he took his Seat as formerly. Pro∣clamation is thereupon made for Silence, while the Pleas of the Commonwealth are in hand, and the Cap∣tain of the Guard commanded by Proclamation, to take into custody all that shall disturb the Proceed∣ings of the Court. Mr. Sollicitor Cooke addressing himself to the Court, repeated the former Delays and Contempts of the Prisoner, so as that no more needed on his part, but to demand Judgment; yet offered notwithstanding the Notoriety of the Facts charged, mentioned in the Commons Act, appointing the Tryal, to prove the Truth of the same by Witnesses, if thereto requi∣red; and therefore prayed, and yet (he said) not so much he, as the innocent Blood that had been shed, the cry whereof was very great, that a speedy Sen∣tence and Judgment might be pronounced against the Prisoner at the Bar according to Justice. Hereupon the Court putting the Prisoner in mind of former Proceedings, and that although by the Rules of Justice, if Advantage were taken of his past Contempts, nothing would remain but to pro∣nounce Judgment against him, they had nevertheless determined to give him leave to Answer his Charge; which, as was told him in plain terms (for Justice knew no respect of Persons) to plead Guilty or Not Guilty thereto. To which he made Answer as formerly, That he would not acknowledge the Jurisdiction of the Court, and that it was against the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; that there was no Law to make a King a Prisoner; that he had done nothing against his Trust; and issued out into such like Discourses. Upon which, the Courts Resolution was again re∣membred to him, and he told, That he had now the third time publickly disowned and affronted the Court; That, how good a Preserver he had been of the Fundamental Laws, and Freedoms of the Peo∣ple,
his Actions had spoken; that mens Intentions were used to be shewed by their Actions, and that he had written his Meaning in bloody Characters throughout the Kingdom, and that he should find at last, though at present he would not understand it, that he was before a Court of Justice. Hereupon, in the manner appointed, the Clerk in the Name of the Court demanding the Prisoners Answer to his Charge, and the same refused, the Default was Recorded, the Prisoner remanded, and the Court Adjourned to the Painted Chamber. Painted Chamber. The Court according to their former Adjourn∣ment from Westminster-Hall, came together from thence into the Painted Chamber, where they sate pri∣vately; and Ordered as followeth, Ordered, That no Commissioner ought, or shall depart from the Court, without the special leave of the said Court. This Court took into consideration the managing of the Business of the Court this day, in the Hall, and the King's Refusal to Answer, notwithstanding he had been three several times demanded and requi∣red thereunto, and have thereupon fully approved of what on the Courts part had then passed, and Re∣solved, That, Notwithstanding the said Contumacy of the King, and refusal to plead, which in Law amounts to a standing mute, and tacit Confession of the Charge, and notwithstanding the Notoriety of the Fact charged, the Court would neverthe∣less however examine Witnesses, for the further and clearer satisfaction of their own Judgments and Consciences; the manner of whose Examination was referred to further Con∣sideration the next Sitting, and Warrants were accordingly issued forth for summoning of Witnesses. Mr. Peters moveth the Court as a Messenger from the King, viz. That the King desires he might speak with his Chaplains that came unto him privately; but the House of Commons having taken that into
their Consideration, the Court conceived it not pro∣per for them to intermeddle therein. The Court Adjourned it self till Nine of the Clock to morrow morning, to this Place. What passed in the Hall more at large than is related by Phelpes in this Days Transactions, see in the fol∣lowing Discourse. The King being brought in by the Guard, looks with a Majestick Countenance upon his Pretended Judges, and sits down. After the second O Yes, and Silence commanded, Cooke began more insolently; Cooke. May it please your Lordship, My Lord President, This is now the third time, that, by the great Grace and Fa∣vour of this High Court, the Prisoner hath been brought to the Bar, before any Issue joyned in the Cause. My Lord, I did at the first Court exhibit a Charge against him, containing the Highest Treason that ever was wrought upon the Theatre of England, That, a King of England, trusted to keep the Law, that had taken an Oath so to do, that had Tribute paid him for that end, should be guilty of a wicked Design to subvert and destroy our Laws, and introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, in the defiance of the Parliament and their Autho∣rity, set up his Standard for War against the Parlia∣ment and People; and I did humbly pray, in the behalf of the People of England, that he might speedily be required to make an Answer to the Charge. But, My Lord, instead of making any Answer, he did then dispute the Authority of this High Court. Your Lordship was pleased to give him a further day to consider, and to put in his Answer; which day being Yesterday, I did humbly move, that he might be required to give a direct and positive Answer, either by Denying or Confession of it: But, my Lord, he was then pleased for to Demur to the Jurisdiction of the Court; which the Court did then over-rule, and command him to give a direct and positive Answer.
My Lord, Besides this great Delay of Justice, I shall now humbly move your Lordship for speedy Judgment against him. My Lord, I might press your Lordship upon the whole, That according to the known Rules of the Law of the Land, That, if a Prisoner shall stand as contumacious in contempt, and shall not put in an issuable Plea, Guilty or Not Guilty of the Charge given against him, where∣by he may come to a fair Tryal, that as by an implicite Confession it may be taken pro confesso, as it hath been done to those who have deserved more favour than the Prisoner at the Bar has done: But besides, My Lord, I shall hum∣bly press your Lordship upon the whole Fact. The House of Commons, the Supreme Authority and Jurisdiction of the Kingdom, they have declared, That, it is notorious that the Matter of the Charge is true; as it is in truth, My Lord, as clear as Crystal, and as the Sun that shines at Noon-day: which, if your Lordship and the Court be not sa∣tisfied in, I have notwithstanding, on the People of England's behalf, several Witnesses to produce. And therefore I do hum∣bly pray (and yet I must confess, it is not so much I, as the in∣nocent Blood that hath been shed, the Cry whereof is very great for Justice and Judgment; and therefore I do humbly pray) that speedy Judgment be pronounced against the Pri∣soner at the Bar. Bradshaw went on in the same strain. Sir, You have heard what is moved by the Councel on the behalf of the Kingdom against you. Sir, You may well re∣member, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget what dila∣tory Dealings the Court hath found at your hands: You were pleased to propound some Questions; You have had Your Reso∣lution upon them. You were told over and over again, That, The Court did affirm their own Jurisdiction; that it was not for You nor any other man to dispute the Jurisdiction of the Supreme and Highest Authority of England, from which there is no Appeal, and touching which there must be no Dispute; yet You did persist in such Carriage, as You gave no manner of Obe∣dience, nor did You acknowledge any Authority in them, nor the High Court that constituted this Court of Justice.
Sir, I must let you know from the Court, that they are very sensible of these Delays of yours, and that they ought not, being thus Authorized by the Su∣preme Court of England, to be thus trifled withal; and that they might in Justice, if they pleased, and according to the Rules of Justice, take advantage of these Delays, and proceed to pronounce Judgment against you: yet nevertheless they are pleased to give direction, and on their behalfs I do require you, that you make a positive Answer unto this Charge that is against you. Sir, in plain terms (for Justice knows no respect of Persons) you are to give your Positive and Final Answer in plain English, whether you be Guilty or not Guilty of these Treasons laid to your Charge. The King, after a little Pause, said, When I was here Yesterday, I did desire to speak for the Liberties of the People of England; I was interrupted: I desire to know yet whether I may speak freely or not. Bradshaw. Sir, You have had the Resolution of the Court upon the like Question the last day; and you were told, That having such a Charge of so high a Nature, against you, your Work was, that you ought to acknowledge the Jurisdiction of the Court, and to answer to your Charge. Sir, if you answer to your Charge, which the Court gives you leave now to do, though they might have taken the Advantage of your Contempt; yet, if you be able to answer to your Charge, when you have once answered, you shall be heard at large, make the best Defence you can. But, Sir, I must let you know from the Court, as their Commands, that you are not to be permitted to issue out into any other Discourses, till such time as you have given a Positive Answer concerning the Matter that is charged upon you. King. For the Charge, I value it not a rush. It is the Liberty of the People of England that I stand for. For Me to acknowledge a New Court that I never heard of before, I that am your King, that should be an example to all the People of England, for to uphold Justice, to maintain the Old Laws, indeed I know not how to do it.
You spoke very well the first day that I came here on Satur∣day, of the Obligations that I had laid upon me by God to the Maintenance of the Liberties of my People; the same Obliga∣tion you spake of, I do acknowledge to God, that I owe to Him and to My People, to defend as much as in me lies, the Anci∣ent Laws of the Kingdom; therefore until that I may know that this is not against the Fundamental Laws of the King∣dom, by your favour, I can put in no particular Answer. If you will give Me time, I will shew you My Reasons why I cannot do it; and this— Here being interrupted, he said, By your favour, you ought not to interrupt Me. How I came here I know not; there's no Law for it, to make your King your Prisoner. I was in a Treaty upon the Publick Faith of the Kingdom; that was the known— Two Houses of Parliament, that was the Representative of the Kingdom; and when that I had almost made an end of the Treaty, then I was hurried away, and brought hither; and therefore— Bradshaw. Sir, You must know the Pleasure of the Court. King. By your favour, Sir. Bradshaw. Nay, Sir, By your Favour, You may not be permitted to fall into those Discourses: You ap∣pear as a Delinquent; You have not acknowledged the Authority of the Court. The Court craves it not of You; but once more they command You to give Your Positive Answer. Clerk, do your Duty. King. Duty, Sir! The Clerk reads. CHARLES STƲART, King of England, You are accused, in the behalf of the Commons of England, of divers High Crimes and Treasons; which Charge hath been read unto you: The Court now requires you to give your Positive and Final Answer by way of Confession or Denial of the Charge.
King. Sir, I say again to you, so that I might give sa∣tisfaction to the People of England, of the clearness of My Proceeding, not by way of Answer, not in this way, but to satisfie them, that I have done nothing against that Trust that hath been committed to Me, I would do it; but to acknowledge a new Court against their Priviledges, to alter the Fundamen∣tal Laws of the Kingdom, Sir, you must excuse Me. Bradshaw. Sir, This is the third time that You have publickly disown'd this Court, and put an Affront upon it. How far You have preserv'd the Priviledges of the People, Your Actions have spoke it; but tru∣ly, Sir, Mens Intentions ought to be known by their Actions: You have written Your Meaning in bloody Characters throughout the whole Kingdom. But, Sir, You understand the Pleasure of the Court. Clerk, Record the Default. And, Gentlemen, You that took Charge of the Pri∣soner, take him back again. King. I will only say this one Word more to you; if it were only My own Particular, I would not say any more, nor interrupt you. Bradshaw. Sir, You have heard the Pleasure of the Court, and You are (notwithstanding You will not understand it) to find that You are before a Court of Justice. Then the King went forth with the Guard. And Proclamation was made, That all Persons which had then appeared, and had further to do at the Court, might depart into the Painted Chamber; to which Place the Court did forthwith Adjourn, and in∣tended to meet at Westminster-Hall by Ten of the Clock next Morning.

And this Deponent told the King, that his Business was much retarded, and that neither Col. Thomas, nor any other could proceed to Action, through want of Commission.

And this Deponent also saith, That after sundry Meetings between him and the E. of Bristol, about the drawing of the Independents unto the King's Cause against the Parliament, the Substance of the Dis∣course, at which Meetings the said Earl told this Deponent, was communicated to the King, he, this Deponent, was by the said Earl brought to the King to confer further about that Business; where the King declared, That he was very sensible that the Independents had been the most active men in the Kingdom for the Parliament against him; and thereupon perswaded this Deponent to use all means to expedite their turning to Him and his Cause: And for their better encouragement, the King promised in the Word of a King, That, if they, the Independents, would turn to him, and be active for him against the Parliament, as they had been active for them a∣gainst him, then he would grant them whatsoever freedom they would desire: And the King did then refer this Deponent unto the E. of Bristol, for the further prose∣cuting of the said Business.

The Prisoner is brought to the Bar, and Proclama∣tion is again (as formerly) made for Silence; and the Captain of the Guard ordered to take into his Custody all such as should disturb the Court. The President stood up, with an intention of address to the People, and not to the Prisoner, who had so often declined the Jurisdiction of the Court; which the Prisoner observing, moved he might be heard be∣fore Judgment given; whereof he received assurance from the Court, and that he should be heard after he had heard them first. Whereupon the Court proceeded, and remembred the great Assembly then present, of what had for∣merly passed betwixt the Court and the Prisoner, the Charge against him in the Name of the People of England, exhibited to them, being a Court constitu∣ted by the Supream Authority of England, his refu∣sal three several days and times to own them as a Court, or to answer to the Matter of his Charge, his thrice recorded Contumacy, and other his Contempts and Defaults in the precedent Courts; upon which, the Court then declared, that they might not be want∣ing to themselves, or to the Trust reposed in them, and that no mans Wilfulness ought to serve him to prevent Justice; and that they had therefore thought fit to take the substance of what had passed, into their serious consideration, to wit, the Charge, and the Pri∣soners Contumacy, and the Confession which in Law doth arise upon that Contumacy, the Notoriety of the Fact charged, and other the Circumstances material in the Cause; and upon the whole Matter, had resol∣ved and agreed upon a Sentence then ready to be pro∣nounced against the Prisoner: But that in regard of his desire to be further heard, they were ready to hear him as to any thing material which he would offer to their consideration before the Sentence given, rela∣ting to the Defence of himself concerning the Matter charged; and did then signifie so much to the Priso∣ner; who made use of that leave given, only to pro∣test his respects to the Peace of the Kingdom, and Li∣berty of the Subject; and to say, That the same made
him at last to desire, That having somewhat to say that con∣cerned both, he might before the Sentence given, be heard in the Painted Chamber, before the Lords and Commons; say∣ing, it was fit to be heard, if it were Reason which he should offer, whereof they were Judges: And pressing that Point much, he was forthwith answered by the Court, and told, That, that which he had moved was a declining of the Jurisdiction of the Court, whereof he had Caution frequently before given him. That, it sounded to further delay, of which he had been too much guilty. That, the Court being founded (as often had been said) upon the Authority of the Commons of England, in whom rested the Supream Jurisdiction, the motion tended to set up another, or a co-ordinate Jurisdiction in derogation of the Power whereby the Court sate, and to the manifest delay of theif Justice; in which regard, he was told, they might forthwith proceed to Sentence; yet for his further satisfacti∣on of the entire Pleasure and Judgment of the Court, upon what he had then said, he was told, and accordingly it was declared, that the Court would withdraw half an hour. The Prisoner by command being withdrawn, the Court make their recess into the Room called The Court of Wards, considered of the Prisoners Motion, and gave the President Direction to declare their Dis∣sent thereto, and to proceed to the Sentence. The Court being again set, and the Prisoner re∣turned, was according to their Direction, informed, That he had in effect received his Answer before the Court withdrew, and that their Judgment was (as to his Motion) the same to him before declared; That, the Court acted, and were Judges appointed by the Highest Authority, and that Judges were not to delay, no more than to deny Justice; That, they were good words in the great old Charter of England, Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli differemus Justitiam vel Rectum. That, their Duty called upon them to avoid further Delays, and to proceed to Judgment; which was their unanimous Resolution.
Unto which, the Prisoner replied, and insisted up∣on his former Desires, confessing a delay, but that it was important for the Peace of the Kingdom, and therefore pressed again with much earnestness to be heard before the Lords and Commons. In Answer whereto, he was told by the Court, That they had fully before considered of his Proposal, and must give him the same Answer to his renewed desires, and that they were ready to proceed to Sentence, if he had nothing more to say. Whereunto he subjoyned, He had no more to say; but desired that might be Entred which he had said. Hereupon, after some Discourse used by the Presi∣dent, for vindicating the Parliaments Justice, explain∣ing the Nature of the Crimes of which the Prisoner stood charged, and for which he was to be condemn∣ed; and by way of Exhortation to the Prisoner, to a serious Repentance for his high Transgressions a∣gainst God and the People, and to prepare for his E∣ternal Condition; The Sentence formerly agreed upon, and put down in Parchment-Writing, O Yes being first made for Silence, was by the Courts Command, solemnly pro∣nounced and given: the Tenor whereof followeth. Whereas the Commons of England Assembled in Parlia∣ment, have by their late Act, Entituled, An Act of the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, for Erect∣ing of an High Court of Justice for the Trying and Judg∣ing of CHARLES STƲART K. of England; Authorized and Constituted us an High Court of Justice for the Try∣ing and Judging of the said CHARLES STUART, for the Crimes and Treasons in the said Act mentioned; By vertue whereof, the said CHARLES STUART hath been three several times convented before this High Court, where, the first Day, being Saturday the Twentieth of Jan. instant, in pursuance of the said Act, a Charge of high Trea∣son and other high Crimes, was in the behalf of the People of England, Exhibited against him, and read openly unto him, wherein he was charged, That he the said CHARLES
STUART, being admitted King of England, and therein trusted with a limited Power, to govern by and according to the Law of the Land, and not otherwise; and by his Trust, Oath and Office, being obliged to use the Power committed to him, for the Good and Benefit of the People, and for the preservation of their Rights and Liberties; Yet nevertheless, out of a wicked Design to erect and uphold in himself an Ʋnlimited and Tyran∣nical Power to rule according to his Will, and to overthrow the Rights and Liberties of the People, and to take away and make void the Foundations thereof, and of all Redress and Remedy of Misgovernment, which by the Fundamental Constitutions of this Kingdom were reserved on the Peoples behalf, in the Right and Power of frequent and successive Parliaments, or National Meetings in Councel, he, the said CHARLES STƲART, for accomplishment of such his Designs, and for the protecting of himself and his Adherents in his and their wicked Practices, to the same End, hath trayterously and maliciously Levied War against the present Parliament, and People there∣in represented, as with the Circumstances of Time and Place, is in the said Charge more particularly set forth; And that he hath thereby caused and procured many Thousands of the free People of this Nation to be slain; and by Divisions, Par∣ties and Insurrections within this Land, by Invaisons from Fo∣reign Parts, endeavoured and procured by him, and by many other evil ways and means, he the said CHARLES STƲART hath not only maintained and carried on the said War both by Sea and Land, but also hath renewed or caused to be renewed the said War against the Parliament and good People of this Nation in this present Year 1648. in several Counties and Places in this Kingdom in the Charge specified; and that he hath for that purpose given his Commission to his Son the Prince, and others, whereby besides multitudes of other persons, many, such as were by the Parliament intrusted and employed, for the Safety of this Nation, being by him or his Agents corrupted, to the betraying of their Trust, and revolt∣ing from the Parliament, have had Entertainment and Com∣mission for the continuing and renewing of the War and Hosti∣lity against the said Parliament and People; and that by the said cruel and unnatural War so levied, continued and renewed, much innocent Blood of the free People of this Nation hath been spilt, many Families undone, the Publick Treasure wasted,
Trade obstructed, and miserably decayed, vast expence and dam∣mage to the Nation incurred, and many parts of the Land spoil∣ed, some of them even to desolation; and that he still continues his Commission to his said Son, and other Rebels and Revolters, both English and Foreigners, and to the Earl of Ormond, and to the Irish Rebels and Revolters associated with him, from whom further Invasions upon this Land are threatned by his Procurement, and on his behalf; And that all the said wicked Designs, Wars and evil Practices of him the said CHARLES STƲART, were still carried on for the Advancement and Ʋpholding of the Personal Interest of Will, Power and pretended Prerogative to himself and his Family, against the Publick Interest, Common Right, Liberty, Justice and Peace of the People of this Nation; And that he thereby hath been and is the Occasioner, Author and Continuer of the said unnatural, cruel and bloody Wars, and therein guilty of all the Treasons, Murthers, Rapines, Burnings, Spoils, De∣solations, Dammage, & Mischief to this Nation, acted and com∣mitted in the said Wars, or occasioned thereby: Whereupon, the Proceedings and Judgment of this Court were prayed a∣gainst him, as a Tyrant, Traytor and Murtherer, and publick Enemy to the Commonwealth, as by the said Charge more fully appeareth: To which Charge being read unto him as aforesaid, He the said CHARLES STƲART was required to give his Answer; but he refused so to do. And upon Monday, the twenty second day of January instant, being again brought before this Court, and there required to answer directly to the said Charge, he still refused so to do; whereupon his Default and Contumacy was Entred: and the next day, being the third time brought before the Court, Judgment was then prayed against him on the behalf of the People of England, for his Contumacy, and for the Matters contained against him in the said Charge, as taking the same for confest, in regard of his refusing to Answer thereto: Yet notwithstanding, this Court (not willing to take advantage of his Contempt) did once more require him to Answer to the said Charge, but he again refused so to do; Ʋpon which his several Defaults, this Court might justly have proceeded to Judgment against him, both for his Contumacy, and the Matters of the Charge, taking the same for confest, as aforesaid.
Yet nevertheless, this Court for their own clearer Information, and further satisfaction, have thought fit to examine Witnesses upon Oath, and take notice of other Evidences touching the Matters contained in the said Charge, which accordingly they have done. Now therefore upon serious and mature deliberation of the Pre∣mises, and consideration had of the Notoreity of the Matters of Fact charged upon him as aforesaid, this Court is in judgment and Conscience satisfied that he the said CHARLES STƲART is guilty of Levying War against the said Parliament, and People, and maintaining and continuing the same; for which in the said Charge he stands accused, and by the general course of his Government, Councels and Practices before and since this Parliament began (which have been, and are noto∣rious and publick, and the Effects whereof remain abundantly upon Record) this Court is fully satisfied in their Judgments and Consciences, that he hath been and is guilty of the wicked Designs and Endeavors in the said Charge set forth, and that the said War hath been Levied, maintained and continued by him, as aforesaid, in prosecution and for accomplishment of the said Designs; And that he hath been and is the Occasioner, Author and Continuer of the said unnatural, cruel and bloody Wars, and therein guilty of High Treason, and of the Mur∣thers, Rapines, Burnings, Spoils, Desolations, Dammage and Mischief to this Nation, acted and committed in the said War, and occasioned thereby. For all which Treasons and Crimes, this Court doth adjudge, That he the said CHARLES STƲART, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer and Publick Ene∣my to the good People of this Nation, shall be put to Death by the severing of his Head from his Body. This Sentence being read, the President spake as followeth; The Sentence now Read and Published, is the Act, Sen∣tence, Judgment and Resolution of the whole Court. Whereupon the whole Court stood up and owned it. The Prisoner being withdrawn, the Court Ad∣journed it self forthwith into the Painted Chamber.

The more full Account of this Days Action, take as follows.

Sir, You shall be heard before the Judg∣ment be given; and in the mean time you may for∣bear. King. Well, Sir, Shall I be heard before the Judgment be given? Bradshaw. Gentlemen, It is well known to all or most of you here present, That the Prisoner at the Bar hath been several times convented and brought before this Court, to make Answer to a Charge of Treason and other high Crimes exhibited against him in the Name of the People of England:Here a La∣dy interpos'd saying, Not half the People; but was si∣lenced with Threats. To which Charge being required to Answer, he hath been so far from obeying the Commands of the Court, by submitting to their Justice, as he began to take upon him to offer Reasoning and Debate unto the Autho∣rity of the Court, and to the Highest Court, that
pointed them to Try and Judge him: But being over∣ruled in that,, and required to make his Answer, he was still pleased to continue contumacious, and to re∣fuse to submit to answer. Hereupon, the Court, that they might not be wanting to themselves, nor the Trust reposed in them, nor that any mans Wilfulness prevent Justice, they have thought fit to take the Matter into their consideration; they have considered of the Charge, they have considered of the Contumacy, and of that Confession which in Law doth arise upon that Contu∣macy; they have likewise considered of the Notorie∣ty of the Fact charged upon this Prisoner: And upon the whole Matter, they are resolved, and are agreed upon a Sentence to be pronounced against this Prisoner. But in respect he doth desire to be heard before the Sentence be read and pronounced, the Court hath resolved that they will hear him. Yet, Sir, Thus much I must tell you beforehand, which you have been minded of at other Courts, That if that which you have to say, be to offer any debate concerning the Jurisdiction, you are not to be heard in it. You have offered it formerly, and you have struck at the Root, that is, the Power and Su∣pream Authority of the Commons of England; which this Court will not admit a Debate of, and which indeed it is an irrational thing in them to do, being a Court that acts upon Authority derived from them. But, Sir, if you have any thing to say in Defence of your self concerning the Matter Charged, the Court hath given me in command to let you know they will hear you. King. Since I see that you will not hear any thing of De∣bate concerning that which I confess I thought most material for the Peace of the Kingdom, and for the Liberty of the Subject, I shall wave it, I shall speak nothing to it: But on∣ly I must tell you, That this many-a-day all things have been taken away from Me, but that that I call dearer to Me than My Life, which is My Conscience, and My Honour: And if I had a respect to My Life more than the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, certainly
I should have made a particular Defence for my self; for by that at leastwise I might have delayed an ugly Sentence, which I believe will pass upon me. Therefore certainly, Sir, as a man that hath some understanding, some knowledge of the World, if that my true Zeal to my Countrey, had not overborn the care that I have for my own Preservation, I should have gone another way to work than that I have done. Now, Sir, I conceive that an hasty Sentence once past, may sooner be repent∣ed of, than recalled: And truly, the self same desire that I have for the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, more than my own particular Ends, makes me now at last de∣sire, That I having something to say that concerns both, before Sentence be given, that I may be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and Commons. This Delay cannot be prejudicial unto you, whatsoever I say. If that I say no reason, those that hear me must be Judges, I cannot be Judge of that that I have. If it be Reason, and re∣ally for the Welfare of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, I am sure on it, it is very well worth the hearing: Therefore I do conjure you, as you love that that you pretend, (I hope it is real) the Liberty of the Subject, the Peace of the Kingdom, that you will grant me this Hearing before any Sen∣tence be past. I only desire this, That you will take this in∣to your consideration; it may be you have not heard of it before∣hand. If you will, I will retire, and you may think of it: but if I cannot get this Liberty, I do protest, That these fair Shews of Liberty and Peace are pure Shews, and that you will not hear your King. Bradshaw. Sir, You have now spoken. King. Yes, Sir. Bradshaw. And this that you have said, is a fur∣ther declining of the Jurisdiction of this Court, which was the thing wherein you were limited be∣fore. King. Pray excuse Me, Sir, for my interruption, because you mistake Me. It is not a declining of it; you do judge Me before you hear me speak. I say it will not, I do not decline it; though I cannot acknowledge the Jurisdiction of the Court, yet, Sir, in this, give Me leave to say, I would do it, though I did not acknowledge it; in this I do protest, it is not the decli∣ning of it, since, I say, if that I do say any thing but that
that is for the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, then the shame is Mine. Now I desire that you will take this into your consideration: if you will, I will with∣draw. Bradshaw. Sir, This is not altogether new that you have moved to us, not altogether new to us, though the first time in person you have offered it to the Court. Sir, You say you do not decline the Jurisdicti∣on of the Court. King. Not in this that I have said. Bradshaw. I understand you well, Sir; but never∣theless, that which you have offered, seems to be con∣trary to that Saying of yours; for the Court are rea∣dy to give a Sentence. It is not as you say, That they will not hear their King; for they have been ready to hear You; they have patiently waited Your plea∣sure for three Courts together, to hear what You would say to the Peoples Charge against You: To which You have not vouchsafed to give any Answer at all. Sir, this tends to a further Delay. Truly, Sir, such Delays as these, neither may the Kingdom nor Justice well bear. You have had three several days to have offered in this kind what You would have pleased. This Court is founded upon that Authority of the Commons of England, in whom rests the Supream Jurisdiction. That which You now tender, is to have another Jurisdiction, and a co-ordinate Jurisdiction. I know very well You express Your self, Sir, That notwithstanding that you would offer to the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, yet nevertheless You would proceed on here; I did hear You say so. But, Sir, that You would offer there, whatever it is, must needs be in Delay of the Justice here; so as if this Court be resolved and prepared for the Sentence, this that You offer they are not bound to grant. But, Sir, According to that You seem to desire, and be∣cause You shall know the further Pleasure of the Court upon that which You have moved, the Court will withdraw for a time.
This he did to prevent the disturbance of their Scene by one of their own Members, Col. John Downes, who could not stifle the Reluctance of his Consci∣ence, when he saw his Majesty press so earnestly for a short Hearing; but declaring himself unsatisfied, forced them to yield to the King's Request. King. Shall I withdraw? Bradshaw. Sir, You shall know the Pleasure of the Court presently. The Court withdraws for half an hour into the Court of Wards. Serjeant at Arms. The Court gives Command that the Prisoner be withdrawn; and they give Order for his Return again. Then withdrawing into the Chamber of the Court of Wards, their Business was not to consider of His Majesties Desire, but to chide Downes, and with Reproachs and Threats to harden him to go through the remainder of their Villany with them. Which done, they return; and being sate, Bradshaw commanded, Serjeant at Arms, Send for your Prisoner. Who being come, Bradshaw proceeded. Sir, You were pleased to make a Motion here to the Court, to offer a Desire of yours touching the pro∣pounding of somewhat to the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, for the Peace of the Kingdom. Sir, You did in effect receive an Answer before the Court Adjourned: Truly, Sir, their Withdrawing and Adjournment was pro forma tantum; for it did not seem to them that there was any difficulty in the
thing. They have considered of what you have mo∣ved, and have considered of their own Authority, which is founded, as hath been often said, upon the Supream Authority of the Commons of England Assem∣bled in Parliament: The Court acts accordingly to their Commission. Sir, The Return I have to you from the Court is this, That they have been too much delayed by you already, and this that you now offer, hath occasioned some little further Delay; and they are Judges appointed by the highest Authority, and Judges are no more to delay, than they are to deny Justice: They are good Words in the Great Old Charter of England, Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli deferemus Justitiam: There must be no Delay. But the truth is, Sir, and so every man here observes it, that you have much delayed them in your Contempt and Default, for which they might long since have proceeded to Judgment against you; and notwith∣standing what you have offered, they are resolved to proceed to Sentence and to Judgment, and that is their unanimous Resolution. King. Sir, I know it is in vain for me to dispute; I am no Sceptick for to deny the Power that you have; I know that you have Power enough. Sir, I must confess, I think it would have been for the Kingdoms Peace, if you would have taken the pains to have shewn the Lawfulness of your Power. For this Delay that I have desired, I confess it is a Delay; but it is a Delay very important for the Peace of the King∣dom: For it is not My Person that I loook at alone, it is the Kingdoms Welfare, and the Kingdoms Peace. It is an old Sentence, That we should think on long before we resolve of great Matters suddenly. There∣fore, Sir, I do say again, that I do put at your doors all the inconveniency of a hasty Sentence. I confess I have been here now, I think, this Week, this day eight days was the day I came here first; but a little Delay of a Day or two further, may give Peace, whereas a hasty Judgment may bring on that trouble and perpetual inconveniency to the Kingdom, that the Child that is unborn may repent it. And therefore again, out of the Duty I owe to God and to My Countrey, I do desire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the Painted
Chamber, or any other Chamber that you will appoint Me. Bradshaw. You have been already answered to what you even now moved, being the same you moved be∣fore, since the Resolution and the Judgment of the Court in it; And the Court now requires to know whether you have any more to say for your self than you have said, before they proceed to Sentence. King. I say this, Sir, That if you hear Me, if you will give Me but this Delay, I doubt not but I shall give some sa∣tisfaction to you all here, and to my People after that; and therefore I do require you, as you will answer it at the dread∣ful Day of Judgment, that you will consider it once again. Bradshaw. Sir, I have received Direction from the Court. King. Well, Sir. Bradshaw. If this must be re-inforced, or any thing of this nature, your Answer must be the same; and they will proceed to Sentence, if you have nothing more to say. King. I have nothing more to say; but I shall desire that this may be entred what I have said. Bradshaw. The Court then, Sir, hath something to say unto you, which although I know it will be ve∣ry unacceptable, yet notwithstanding they are wil∣ling and are resolved to discharge their Duty. Then Bradshaw went on in a long Harangue, endea∣vouring to justifie their Proceedings, misapplying Law and History, and raking up and wresting what∣soever he thought fit for his purpose, alledging the Examples of former Treasons and Rebellions, both at home and abroad, as authentick Proofs; and con∣cluding, that the King was a Tyrant, Traytor, Murthe∣rer, and Publick Enemy to the Commonwealth of Eng∣land.
His Majesty having with his wonted Patience heard all these Reproaches, answered, I would desire only one Word before you give Sentence, and that is, That you would hear Me concerning those great impu∣tations that you have laid to My Charge. Bradshaw. Sir, You must give me now leave to go on; for I am not far from your Sentence, and your time is now past. King. But I shall desire you will hear Me a few Words to you; for, truly, whatever Sentence you will put upon Me, in respect of those heavy imputations that I see by your speech you have put upon Me. Sir, it is very true that— Bradshaw. Sir, I must put you in mind: Truly, Sir, I would not willingly, at this time especially, inter∣rupt you in any thing you have to say that is proper for us to admit of: But, Sir, You haue not owned us as a Court, and you look upon us as a sort of People met together, and we know what Language we re∣ceive from your Party. King. I know nothing of that. Bradshaw. You disavow us as a Court, and there∣fore for you to address your self to us, not to acknow∣ledge us as a Court to judge of what you say, it is not to be permitted. And the truth is, all along from the first time you were pleased to disavow and dis∣own us, the Court needed not to have heard you one word; for unless they be acknowledged a Court, and engaged, it is not proper for you to speak. Sir, we have given you too much liberty already, and ad∣mitted of too much Delay, and we may not admit of any further. Were it proper for us to do, we should hear you freely, and we should not have declined to have heard you at large, what you could have said or proved on your behalf, whether for totally excu∣sing, or for in part excusing those great and heinous Charges that in whole or in part are laid upon you. But, Sir, I shall trouble you no longer; your Sins are of so large a dimension, that if you do but seri∣ously think of them, they will drive you to a sad
consideration, and they may improve in you a sad and serious Repentance. And that the Court doth hear∣tily wish, that you may be so penitent for what you have done amiss, that God may have Mercy at least∣wise upon your better part. Truly, Sir, for the other, it is our Parts and Duties to do that that that the Law prescribes. We are not here Jus dare, but Jus dicere: We cannot be unmindful of what the Scrip∣ture tells us; For to acquit the Guilty, is of equal abomina∣tion as to condemn the Innocent. We may not acquit the Guilty. What Sentence the Law affirms to a Traytor, Tyrant, a Murtherer, and a Publick Enemy to the Country, that Sentence you are now to hear read unto you; and that is the Sentence of the Court. Make an O Yes, and command Silence while the Sentence is read. Which done, their Clerk, Broughton, read the Sen∣tence, drawn up in Parchment. Whereas the Commons of England in Parliament, had appointed them an High Court of Justice for the Trial of CHARLES STƲART, King of England, before whom he had been three times convented, and at the first time a Charge of High Treason, and other Crimes and Mis∣demeanors, was read in the behalf of the Kingdom of England, [Here the Charge was repeated.] Which Charge being read unto him as aforesaid, he the said CHARLES STUART, was required to give his An∣swer; but he refused so to do: [Expressing the several Passages of his refusing in the former Proceedings.] For all which Treasons and Crimes, this Court doth ad∣judge, That he the said CHARLES STUART, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murderer, and a Publick Enemy, shall be put to Death by the severing of his Head from his Body.
Which being read, Bradshaw added, The Sentence now Read and Published, is the Act, Sen∣tence, Judgment and Resolution of the whole Court. To which they all expressed their Assent by stand∣ing up, as was before Agreed and Ordered. His Majesty then said, Will you hear me a Word, Sir? Bradshaw. Sir, You are not to be heard after the Sentence. King. No, Sir? Bradshaw. No, Sir; by your Favour, Sir. Guard, Withdraw your Prisoner. King. I may speak after Sentence, by your favour, Sir, I may speak after Sentence, ever. By your favour, hold: the Sentence, Sir, — I say, Sir, I do— I am not suffered to speak; expect what Justice other Peo∣ple will have. His Majesty being taken away by the Guard, as he passed down the Stairs, the insolent Soldiers scoffed at him, casting the smoke of their Tobacco (a thing very distastful unto him) in his Face, and throwing their Pipes in his way; And one more insolent than the rest, spitting in his Face, his Majesty, according to his wonted Heroick Patience, took no more notice of so strange and barbarous an Indignity, than to wipe it off with his Handkerchief. As he passed along, hearing the Rabble of Soldiers, crying out, Justice, Justice; he said, Poor Souls, for a piece of Money they would do so for their Commanders. Being brought first to Sir Robert Cotton's, and thence to Whitehall, the Soldiers continued tneir brutish Car∣riage toward him, abusing all that seemed to shew any respect, or even Pity to him; not suffering him to rest in his Chamber, but thrusting in, and smoking their Tobacco, and disturbing his Privacy. But through all these Tryals (unusual to Princes) he passed with such a calm and even Temper, that he let fall nothing unbeseeming his former Majesty and Magnanimity.
In the Evening, a Member of the Army acquaint∣ed the Committee with his Majesties Desire, That see∣ing they had passed a Sentence of Death upon him, and his time might be nigh, he might see his Children; and Doctor Juxon Bishop of London, might be admitted to assist him in his private Devotions, and Receiving the Sacrament. Both which at length were granted. And the next day, being Sunday, He was attended by the Guard to S. James's; where the Bishop Preach∣ed before Him upon these Words, In the day when God shall judge the Secrets of all Men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel.
HIS MAJESTIES SPEECH TO THE Lady ELIZABETH, AND HENRY Duke of GLOƲCESTER, January 29. 1648/9. Of His Majesties Discourse to His Children, there being Several Relations, it is thought fit to repre∣sent the Several Copies. I. A True Relation of the King's Speech to the Lady Elizabeth, and the Duke of Gloucester, the Day before his Death. HIS Children being come to meet Him, He first gave His Blessing to the Lady Elizabeth; and bade her remember to tell her Brother James, whenever she should see him, that it was his Fathers last Desire, that he should no more look upon Charles as his Eldest Brother only, but be obedient unto him as his Sovereign: And that they should love one ano∣ther, and forgive their Father's Enemies. Then said the King to her, Sweet-Heart, You will forget this. No, said she, I shall never forget it whilst I live; and pouring forth abundance of Tears, promised Him to write down the Particulars.
Then the King taking the D. of Gloucester upon His Knee, said, Sweet-Heart, Now they will cut off thy Fathers Head (upon which Words, the Child looked very stedfastly upon Him) Mark, Child, what I say; They will cut off My Head, and perhaps make Thee a King: But mark what I say, You must not be a King so long as Your Bro∣thers Charles and James do live; for they will cut off Your Brothers Heads (when they can catch them) and cut off Thy Head too at last; and therefore I charge You, do not be made a King by them. At which, the Child sighing, said, I will be torn in pieces first. Which falling so unexpectedly from one so young, it made the King rejoyce exceed∣ingly. II. Another Relation from the Lady Elizabeths own Hand. WHat the King said to Me the 29th. of January 1648. Being the last time I had the happiness to see Him, He told Me, He was glad I was come; and although He had not time to say much, yet somewhat He had to say to me, which He had not to another, or leave in Writing, because He feared their Cruelty was such, as that they would not have permitted Him to write to me. He wished me not to grieve and torment my self for Him, for that would be a Glorious Death that He should die, it being for the Laws and Liberties of this Land, and for maintaining the True Protestant Religion. He bid me read Bishop Andrews's Sermons, Hooker's Ecclesia∣stical Polity, and Bishop Laud's Book against Fisher; which would ground me against Popery. He told me, He had forgiven all his Enemies, and hoped God would forgive them also; and commanded us, and all the rest of my Brothers and Sisters to forgive them. He bid me tell my Mother, that His Thoughts had never strayed from her, and that His Love should be the same to the last. Withal He commanded me and my Brother to be obedient to Her, and bid me
send His Blessing to the rest of my Brothers and Si∣sters, with Commendation to all His Friends. So after He had given me His Blessing, I took my Leave. Further, He commanded us all to forgive those People, but never to trust them, for they had been most false to Him, and to those that gave them Pow∣er; and He feared also to their own Souls: And de∣sired me not to grieve for Him, for he should die a Martyr; and that He doubted not but the Lord would settle His Throne upon His Son, and that we should be all happier than we could have expected to have been if he had lived. With many other things, which at present I cannot remember. III. Another Relation from the Lady Elizabeth. THE King said to the Duke of Gloucester, That he would say nothing to him but what was for the good of his Soul. He told him, that he heard the Army intended to make him King; but it was a thing not for him to take upon him, if he regarded the Welfare of his Soul, for he had two Brothers be∣fore him; and therefore commanded him upon his Blessing never to accept of it, unless it redounded lawfully upon him; and commanded him to fear the Lord, and he would provide for him.

Directed to Col. John White, or any other Officer within the Tower of London, whom it concerneth.
The Court Adjourned till to morrow Morning at Nine of the Clock. Martis. Mercurii, 30 Jan. 1648. Painted Chamber, Commissioners meet. Ordered, That Mr. Marshall, Mr. Nye, Mr. Caryl, Mr. Salway, and Mr. Dell be desired to Attend the King, to Administer to him those Spiritual Helps as should be sutable to his present Condition. And Lieut. Col. Goffe is desired forth∣with to repair unto them for that purpose. Who did so, but after informed the Court, That the King being aquainted therewith, refused to confer with them; expressing, that he would not be troubled with them. Ordered, That the Scaffold upon which the King is to be Executed, be covered with Black. The Warrant for Executing the King, being ac∣cordingly delivered to those Parties to whom the same was directed, Execution was done upon him, according to the Tenor of the said Warrant, about Two of the Clock in the Afternoon of the said Thir∣tieth of January.
Mr. Phelpes makes as short Work of this part of the Narrative, as his Infamous Masters had done of their Pretended Tryal of this Illustrious Inno∣cent; and therefore to supply that Defect, take the following Account of the Conclusion of this Dismal Tragedy. Tuesday, the Thirtieth of January, the Fatal Day, being come, the Commissioners met, and Ordered four or five of their Ministers to attend upon the King at St. James's, where they then kept him; but his Majesty well knowing what miserable Comfor∣ters they were like to prove, refused to have Confe∣rence with them. That Morning, before his Majesty was brought thence, the Bishop of London (who with much ado was permitted to wait upon him a day or two before, and to assist him in that sad Instant) read Divine Ser∣vice in his Presence; in which the 27th. of St. Matt. (the History of our Saviours Crucifixion) proved the Second Lesson. The King supposing it to have been selected on purpose, thank'd him afterwards for his seasonable Choice: But the Bishop modestly declining that, undue Thanks, told him that it was the Lesson appointed by the Calendar for that day, He also then and there received of the Bishop the Holy Sacrament, and performed all his Devotions in prepa∣ration to his Passion. Which ended, about Ten of the Clock his Majesty was brought from St. James's to White-Hall, by a Re∣giment of Foot, with Colours flying and Drums beating, part marching before, and part behind, with a private Guard of Partisans about him, the Bishop on the one hand, and Col. Tomlinson (who had the Charge of him) on the other, both bare-headed, his Majesty walking very fast, and bidding them go fa∣ster, added, That, he now went before them to strive for an Heavenly
Crown, with less solicitude than he had often encouraged his Soldiers to fight for an Earthly Diadem. Being come to the end of the Park, he went up the Stairs leading to the Long Gallery in White-Hall, & so in∣to the Cabinet-Chamber, where he us'd formerly to lodge. There finding an unexpected Delay in being brought upon the Scaffold, which they had not as then fitted, he past the time, at convenient Distances, in Prayer. About Twelve of the Clock, his Majesty refusing to Dine,, only eat a Bit of Bread, and drank a Glass of Claret; and about an hour after, Col. Hacker, with other Officers and Soldiers, brought him, with the Bishop and Col. Tomlinson, through the Banquetting-House to the Scaffold, to which, the Passage was made through a Window. Divers Companies of Foot and Troops of Horse were placed on each side of the Street, which hindred the Approach of the very numerous Spectators, and the King from speaking what he had premeditated, and prepared for them to hear. Whereupon, his Majesty finding himself disap∣pointed, omitted much of his intended Matter; and for what he meant to speak, directed himself chiefly to Col. Tomlinson. I shall be very little heard of any body here; I shall therefore speak a Word unto you here. Indeed I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think that holding my peace would make some men think that I did submit to the Guilt as well as to the Punishment: But I think it is my Duty, to God first, and to my Country, for to clear my self both as an honest Man, a good King, and a good Chri∣stian. I shall begin first with my Innocence. In troth, I think it not very needful for me to insist long upon this; for all the World knows that I never did begin a War first with the Two Houses of Parliament, and I call God to witness, to whom I must shortly make an Account, that I never did intend for to encroach upon their Priviledges; they
began upon me; it is the Militia they began upon; they con∣fest that the Militia was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me. And to be short, if any body will look to the Dates of Commissions, of their Commissions and mine, and like∣wise to the Declarations, they will see clearly that they began these unhappy Troubles, not I. So that as to the guilt of these enormous Crimes that are laid against me, I hope in God that God will clear me of it. I will not (I am in Charity) God forbid that I should lay it on the Two Houses of Parlia∣ment; there is no necessity of either: I hope they are free of this Guilt. For I do believe that ill Instruments between them and me have been the chief Cause of all this Bloodshed: So that by way of speaking, as I find my self clear of this, I hope and pray God that they may too. Yet for all this, God forbid that I should be so ill a Christian as not to say that God's Judg∣ments are just upon me; many times he does pay Justice by an unjust Sentence; that is ordinary. I will only say this, That an unjust Sentence that I suffered to take effect,Ʋpon the E. of Strafford is punished now by an unjust Sentence upon me. That is, — So far I have said, to shew you that I am an Innocent Man. Now for to shew you that I am a good Christian; Pointing to the Bishop.I hope there is a good Man that will bear me witness that I have forgiven all the World, and even those in particular that have been the chief causers of my Death: Who they are, God knows, I do not desire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my Charity must go further; I wish that they may repent; for indeed they have committed a great Sin in that Particular; I pray God with St. Stephen, that this be not laid to their Charge. Nay, not only so, but that they may take the right way to the Peace of the Kingdom: For my Charity commands me not only to forgive particular men, but my Charity commands me to endeavour to the last gasp the Peace of the Kingdom. So, Sirs, I do wish with all my Soul, (and I do hope there is some here will carry it further) that they may endeavour the Peace of the Kingdom.Turning to some Gentle∣men that wrote, Now, Sirs, I must shew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in a way. First, You are out of the way: For certainly all the way
you ever have had yet, as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conquest. Certainly this is an ill way; for Conquest, Sir, in my opinion, is never just, except there be a good just Cause, either for matter of wrong or just Title; and then if you go beyond it, the first Quarrel that you have to it, that makes it unjust at the end that was just at the first. But if it be only matter of Conquest, then it is a great Robbery, as a Pyrate said to Alexander the Great, That he was the great Robber, he was but a petty Robber. And so, Sir, I do think the way that you are in is much out of the way. Now, Sir, for to put you in the way; believe it, you will never do right, nor God will never prosper you, until you give God his Due, the King his Due (that is, My Successors) and the People their Due: I am as much for Them as any of you. You must give God his Due, by Regulating rightly his Church according to his Scripture, which is now out of Order. For to set you in a way particularly, now I cannot, but only this, a National Synod, freely Called, freely Deba∣ting among themselves, must settle this, when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard. For the King, indeed I will not.— (Then turning to a Gentleman that touched the Axe, he said, Hurt not the Axe, that may hurt me.) For the King, The Laws of the Land will clearly instruct you for that; therefore, because it concerns my own Particular, I only give you a Touch of it. For the People: And truly I desire their Liberty and Free∣dom as much as any body whomsoever; but I must tell you that their Liberty and Freedom consists in having of Government, those Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be most their own. It is not for having share in Government, Sir; that is nothing pertaining to them: a Subject and a Sovereign are clear different things. And therefore until they do that, I mean, that you do put the People in that Liberty as I say, cer∣tainly they will never enjoy themselves. Sirs, it was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an
Arbitrary way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your Charge) that I am the MARTYR of the People. In troth, Sirs, I shall not hold you much longer; for I will only say this to you, That in truth I could have desired some little time longer, because that I would have put this that I have said in little more order, and a little better digested than I have done, and therefore I hope you will excuse me. I have delivered my Conscience, I pray God that you do take those courses that are best for the good of the Kingdom, and your own Salvation. Then the Bishop said, Though it be very well known what your Majesties Affecti∣ons are to the Protestant Religion, yet it may be expected that You should say somewhat for the Worlds satisfaction in that Par∣ticular. Whereupon the King replied, I thank you very heartily, My Lord, for that, I had al∣most forgotten it. In troth, Sirs, My Conscience in Religion, I think is very well known to all the World; and therefore I declare before you all, That I die a Christian according to the Profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my Father;Pointing to the Bishop. and this honest man I think will witness it. Then turning to the Officers, He said, Sirs, Excuse me for this same, I have a good Cause, and I have a gracious God, I will say no more. Then to Col. Hacker he said, Take care that they do not put me to pain. And, Sir, this, and it please you—
But a Gentleman coming near the Axe, the King said, Take heed of the Axe, pray take heed of the Axe. And to the Executioner he said, I shall say but very short Prayers, and when I thrust out my hands— Then he called to the Bishop for his Cap, and having put it on asked the Executioner, Does my Hair trouble you? Who desired him to put it all under his Cap; which as he was doing, by the help of the Bishop and the Ex∣ecutioner, he turned to the Bishop, and said, I have a good Cause, and a gracious God on my side. The Bishop said, There is but one Stage more; which,These words were spoken upon occasion of private Discourse between His Majesty & the Bishop concerning the several Stages of mans Life, and his Course through them, in allusion to Posts and Stages in a Race. though tur∣bulent and troublesome, yet it is a very short one; you may consider it will soon carry you a very great way; it will carry you from Earth to Heaven; and there you shall find, to your great Joy, the Prize you hasten to, a Crown of Glory. The King adjoyns. I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world. Bishop. You are exchanged from a Temporal to an Eternal Crown. A good Exchange! Then the King asked the Executioner, Is my Hair well?
And taking off his Cloak and George, he delivered his George to the Bishop, saying, Remember. Then putting off his Doublet, and being in his Wast-coat, he put on his Cloak again, and looking upon the Block, said to the Executioner, You must set it fast. Executioner. It is fast, Sir. King. It might have been a little higher. Executioner. It can be no higher, Sir. King. When I put out my hands this way, then— Then having said a few Words to himself, as he stood, with hands and eyes lift up, immediately stoop∣ing down, he laid his Neck upon the Block, and the Executioner again putting his Hair under his Cap, his Majesty thinking he had been going to strike bad him Stay for the Sign. Executioner. Yes I will and it please your Majesty. After a very short pause, his Majesty stretching forth his Hands, the Executioner severed his head from his Body: Which being held up and shewed to the People, was with his Body put into a Coffin covered with Velvet, and carried into his Lodging. His Blood was taken up by divers Persons for dif∣ferent ends: By some as trophies of their Villany, by others as Reliques of a Martyr; and in some hath had the same effect by the Blessing of God, which was often found in his Sacred Touch when living. The Malice of his Enemies ended not with his Life: For when his Body was carried to St. James's to be opened, they directed their Empiricks to search for such Symptoms as might disgrace his Person or his Posterity; but herein they were prevented by an honest Intruder, who gave a true account of his Sound and Excellent Temparament.
Being imbalmed and laid in a Coffin of Lead, to be seen for some dayes by the People, at length upon Wednesday the seventeenth of February, it was deli∣vered to four of His servants, Herbert, Mildmay, Pres∣ton and Joyner, who with some others in mourning Equipage attended the Herse that night to Windsor, and placed it in the Room which was formerly the Kings Bed-Chamber. Next day it was removed into the Deans Hall, which was hung with black and made dark, and Lights were set burning round the Herse. About three Afternoon the Duke of Richmond, the Marquess of Hartford, the Earls of Southampton and Lindsey, and the Bishop of London, (others that were sent, to refusing that last service to the best of Princes) came thither with two Votes passed that morning, where∣by the ordering of the Kings Burial was com∣mitted to the Duke, provided that the Expences there∣of exceeded not Five Hundred Pound. This Order they shewed to Colonel Whichcot the Governour of the Cas∣tle desiring the interment might be in St. George's Chappel, and according to the Form of the Common-Prayer: The latter Request the Governour denied, say∣ing that it was improbable the Parliament would permit the use of what they had so solemnly abolish∣ed, and therein destroy their own Act. The Lords replied. That there was a difference betwixt destroying their own Act, and dispensing with it, and that no power so binds its own hands, as to disable it self in some cases. But all prevailed not. The Governour had caused an ordinary Grave to be digged in the Body of the Church of Windsor for the interment of the Corps; which the Lords disdain∣ing found means by the direction of an Honest Man, one of the old Knights, to use an Artifice to discover a Vault in the middle of the Quire, by the hollow sound they might perceive in knocking with a staff upon that place; that so it
might seem to be their own accidental finding out, and no person receive blame for the discovery. This place they caused to be opened, and entring saw one large Coffin of Lead in the middle of the Vault cove∣red with a Velvet Pall, and a lesser on one side (sup∣posed to be Henry the eighth, and his beloved Queen Jane Saint-Maure) on the other side was room left for another (probably intended for Queen Katherine Parre, who survived him) where they thought fit to lay the King. Hither the Herse was born by the Officers of the Garrison, the four Lords bearing up the Corners of the Velvet Pall, and the Bishop of London following. And in this manner was this great King, upon Fryday the ninth of February, about three, afternoon, Silently and without other Solemnity then of sighs and tears, committed to the Earth, the Velvet Pall being thrown into the vault over the Coffin, to which was fastned an Inscription in Lead of these Words, King Charles, 1648.

THE CONCLUSION. THus fell the most Glorious Monarch, and most Admirable Monarchy of the whole Universe. By these Hands were the Manacles of Slavery, and the Yoke of the most Arbitrary Servitude put upon the Neck and Hands of the English Nation; and the same Blow which severed that Royal Head and Bo∣dy, cut the very Nerves and Ligaments of the English Liberty; and even those men who begun that dete∣stable Rebellion, upon the most Solemn Pretences of freeing the Nation from the imminent Dangers of Popery and Arbitrary Power, erected the most un∣bounded Tyranny, and gave the greatest Advantages to Popery, and the most mortal Wound to the Reform∣ed Catholick Religion, that ever it received since Rome first left us, because we left her unwarrantable, un∣sound and unprimitive Practices and Doctrines, some of which have such a Treasonable Conformity with those of our bloody Regicides, as if there were no∣thing else were sufficient to excuse the Church of Englands Departure from Rome, from the imputation of Schism. These were the men, who to amuse the People, and animate them to Rebellion, made such horrid Exclamations against Priests and Jesuits, and yet themselves Acted what the very worst men of those Orders had ever written; who reduced those Fatal Doctrines of the Lawfulness of Resisting, even by Armed Force; of Deposing and Murdering Crowned Heads; from the dull Theory whereof they so cla∣morously accused the Papists into the execrable Act and Practice; these were the glorious Founders, Pro∣moters and Encouragers of the Separation, who scorn∣ing the little Villanies of a Clement, or a Ravailac, or the more secret Methods of murdering Princes, made the very Sun blush to behold their Triumphant and Daring Wickedness; being resolved to eternize them∣selves for the most Renowned Villains, by surpas∣sing all that ever went before them; and to outdo
even Cassius and ingrateful Brutus with the sneaking three and twenty Daggers of the Roman Senators, who to recover their Commonwealth-Liberty, murdered Caesar, by solemnly murdering a most Lawful Sovereign; whereas the others, wretchedly enough, took away only the Life of a bold Ʋsurper. These are the Principles which lead men insensi∣bly from Conscientious Disobedience, to a Rebellious Conscience; and by the false Pretences of Religious Zeal, to commit such Impieties as modest Heathens, nay even some Atheists would blush at, and be ashamed to be guilty of. Nor is it for one transient Act that we accuse them, but it is the eternal inseparable Mischiefs and Conse∣quences of these Principles of Separation which we are for ever to dread; for assoon shall the Ocean quit its treacherous instability, and forget to Rage and Foam, and overthrow all its Banks upon the Sum∣mons of every impetuous Tempest, as these Turbu∣lent Principles cease to be dangerous to the Peace and Repose of Mankind, or the safety of Government. Assoon, nay sooner shall we see Lyons and Tygers, Wolves and Panthers become as tame, harmless and serviceable as our domestick Animals, as see their savage Principles permit those who come to be be∣witched with them, continue to be Innocent longer then they are Impotent: For Rebellion with its portentous Retinue, is as naturally included in Separation as Fire in a Flint, and though it may sleep there so as to de∣ceive the Ignorant, who never beleive there is fire but when their fingers are burnt, it will alwayes be ready upon the Summons of Steel to shew it self; and the Tinder Conscience of Dissenters is as obedient as Gun∣powder, to catch every Spark of Rebellion that falls into it, and improve it into a Combustion and Con∣flagration both of Church and State. Now though Sovereign Princes have the greatest Stake in this World, their Crowns and Scepters, their
Dignity, Lives and Honour, all which are mani∣festly in hazzard, where these Principles prevail; and therefore it would be a foolish presumption to think they do not know their own Interest, and most in∣sufferable Arrogance and Vanity to pretend to in∣form and instruct them; yet since they can never suffer alone, and that Private persons of all Ranks, De∣grees and Qualities, have Life, Liberty and Estates, which if their Possessors be Loyal, cannot avoid run∣ning the same course with the fortune of their Prince: Nay even those who propose to themselves the greatest advantages in Rebellion, should it prove successful, in the Conclusion are like to be the greatest Losers, the gains which they shall make by such Godliness, being the loss of their Souls and Bodies, Heaven and Eternal Happiness: Certainly it is the True interest of all English-Men, even for their own security and preservation, to endeavour to suppress the further growth and progress of their pernicious Principles of Separation. Nor is it less the interest of the Dissenters them∣selves, to abandon those Disloyal and Ruinous Do∣ctrines, Practices and Opinions, which are so de∣structive of the Peace, Happiness and Prosperity of this Nation; and by a timely repentance to attone Heaven for the former Guilt, and most especially that of the Blood of this Royal Martyr, which as it evident∣ly lies at their Door, so it cryes aloud in the Ears of the Almighty Avenger of Blood for Vengance; and let them be assured, that though hand joyn in hand, it shall not go unpunished, if they continue obstinately impenitent. Nay their Confederacies and Common Union against the King and the Church, will be their ruine, and their Associating themselves in the Closest Conspiracies, will be but the Prologue to their punish∣ment, and then that they may be broken in pieces: and truly if they were not infatuated to destruction, they could not but see the Miraculously Visible effects of Providence in the wonderous repeated Pre∣servation
of his Majestyes Sacred Person, this Church and Monarchy from so many attempts, and Traite∣rous Enterprizes of all their implacable Enemies: And if they do see all this, and will notwithstanding Run upon their own destruction, and the very mouth of Hell charged with Damnation, such de∣sperate Rage, as it renders them more formidable, so ought it to render all honest Loyal Persons more vi∣gilant and cautious against them; and to inspire them with the same, but more Noble Zeal to save their Coun∣try from Ruine, with which their Enemies are ani∣mated to seek its Destruction; and though Charity for them, commands us to pity them, yet that true Cha∣rity which begins at home, does at the same time ob∣lige us to preserve our selves, as we would do from Wolves and Tygers, and other Furious Beasts of Prey, who are ready to devour us. I know this naked Exposure of these Men and Principles, will expose me to the Rage, and entitle me to the Revenge of the Party; but if I have abused them, if I have misrepresented them, if I have traduced them, or if they are able to con∣vince me of Fiction or Falshood, let them do it; I beg no Quarter, no Mercy from them; but if what I have written be Truth, Magna est Veritas, & praevalebit, I cannot fear the Rage neither of Men nor Devils; but must let them know assu∣redly that it will to their eternal Horror, Shame and Confusion, stand the Test and abide the Tryal of the God of Truth, to whose infallible Tri∣bunal and definitive Sentence I submit my self; and let but the most angry of the Faction sober∣ly, in retired thoughts, state themselves, their Principles and Actions, as they must one day, as if they were before the Almighty Judge, and I perswade my self, they would find occasion to return me Thanks for my severe Truths, rather than to any of their Deluders for their dangerous Flattery.
Be it as it will, liberavi Animam; I wash my Hands of all the Miseries and Mischiefs which for want of Precaution, may happen either to, or from those of the Separation, by reason of these horrible Positions, Principles and Practices. THE END.

The Countermine: Or, A short, but true Discovery of the Dangerous Principles and Secret Practices of the Dissenting Party, especially the Presbyterians: Shewing, That Religion is pretended, but Rebellion is intended. And in order thereto, the Foundation of Monarchy in the State, and Episcopacy in the Church, are Under∣mined. The Fourth Impression with Additions. The Project of Peace, or Unity of Faith and Government, the only Expedient to procure Peace both Foreign and Domestick: and to preserve these Nations from the danger of Popery, and Arbitrary Tyranny. The Common Interest of King and People: shewing the Original, Antiquity, and Excellency of Monarchy, compared with Aristocracy and Democracy, and Particularly of our English Monarchy, and that absolute, Papal and Presbyterian Popular Supremacy are utterly inconsistent with Prerogative, Property and Li∣berty. The true Liberty and Dominion of Conscience vindicated, from the Usurpa∣tions and Abuses of Opinion and Persuasion. All Four Written by Dr. Nalson.
