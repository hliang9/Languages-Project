¶ The Sege of the castel of Edinburgh Imprentit at Edin¦burgh be Robert Lekpreuik. Anno. M..DXXIII.
BVschmēt of Beru mak ʒow for the g To ting ʒour drūmis & rank zont mē of weir Addres ʒour armour boūd ʒow for debait With sound of trūpet mok ʒour steids to steir Sen ʒear freikes that weil dar fecht but fel. As for exampill we haue sene ʒow ellis, Lyk as the last tym that ʒour Camp come heir Lend vs ane bourouīg of ʒour auld blak bellis. Zour camp conueyit but cūmer throw the land In gude array and rewlit by thair rank. Reddie to pas as plesit vs command, Throw all our bounds to the west sey bank. Thocht sum mē say ʒe serue bot lytill thank Suppose occatioun cum first of thame sellis. As thay haue broum ye bargane sa thay drank And rewis ye tyme yt euer thay saw ʒour bellis. I nill repeit na poleceis put doun, Sen plesit God that we aggrie to giddir. Except thay crak thair credence to the Crost. n fair well thay the find ressaue the sidder ue hir G. that will out use considder And as I dout not wil our dryue thir dangeris As scho befoir tyme send hir forces bidder To keip yis coūtrie cline ra forrane strageris. To call to mynd hir mony fauld gude dedis, First scho reformit the fals Idolatrie, I am in dout in ony realme quha redis. Of sa lang tyme with sic tranquillitie,
ie faithful iustice with ciuillitie. ie frendschip keipit to hir fis sa lang, land  say for oure vtilitie. That uer a e bettir prince in Inglād rang. That bennd done scho did conferme a pace, And maid thā freindis yt lāg tyme had bene fois with stancheīg bludesched wes not eith to ceice That men may pas not sperand quhair he gois Syne at the sege of Leith scho sparit an pois And dang the frenchmē quhilk we docht not do Quhill hame thay past in spyt of all thair nois With lose of men and left munitioun to. Quhat toung hes langage to declair at lenth Thair greit artalʒerie nor thair men of weir. Frauce wes not able to withstand thair strenth For powder, and bullet, bowls, and veher geir What chargis wes hir schips at, may I speir, Surmonting fiftie hunder thowsand frankis, And ʒit for all the graith hir grace send heie Ingraitfull people gaue hir lytill than Our Regent slaue syne as I saw ir Stryfe and contentiou rais in to the land. Treasoun, inuy, did vertue sa deuoir, Quhu all ws done as murthour did cōmand. Wes na sa stout durst tak the steir on hand Sa has the cause bene qua wer not for shame. Quhil we sic reu schip surth of Ingland sand Thay nd ane amy heir with Leuenox hame.
Conuoyt with Drurle duchtelie in deid. And as I holp mair haist wes neuer done. To Glasgw past with mony trapit steid Thair skairt the sege releuit the castell sone. Doun to Dunbartane on the morne at none, He raid bot few not fering thame agane him. Zit of that partell I prayse the Lord aboue, He chapit weill fra villanis wald haue slane him. That panefull progres I think all to tell, Sen thay ar bowit and bruderit in our band. Bot at this present tyme exem ʒour sell, Quha confort hs thair Quene send to this land. Is not the cannones euin at ʒour cōmand, Strecht to distroy the tratoures wald ouir gang vs Commonis may crye lang not that frendschip stand, And blis hir anis sic blythnes broucht amang vs. At Leith thay landit harmeles in the Heuin, With powder and ullet gunnis and vther geir. Drst all than platumes in to day is suin, Not talking na thing that belangu to weir. Sum wordmen had we or the camp come heir, Iacques Gelitam gangand lyke ane besy be. The gadiounes maand aist the trinschs heir, Quha mycht do mair but ordinance nor we. The walis wes heith we culd not weil persew thame Bot quhen we gat thame boun full deir thay bocht it Be syde the woll at syndrie tymes we slew thame, That euer thay saw vs sum of thame sorthocht it
Ane poysonit woll to drink quhat docht it. Infekit watter sowllit tha ne cheik and chin, Persauing that sorrow mair thay socht it. Bot keppit standfulis at the salatis thair in. The castell segit and all beset about, Wt foweis wyde inuerouit be slycht. Montanis and myndis leit neuer man luik out, For ordinance thay dang at day and nycht. B weirlyk volyis thocht the wallis wes wycht, Zit do wbell battrie brak thame all in inschis. Of Daueis toure in all the toune menis sycht, Thay riggein stanes come tumland ouir the trinschis The vehement schot ʒeid in at ather syde, By threttie Cannonis plasit at partis seuin. Quhill thay thair in mycht not thair heidis hyde, For Pot Gan pellettis falland from the heuin. The Bubard stanis derectite fell sa euin. That in to dykis by dint it deidly dang thame, Quhill all the houslis in the place wes reuin. The bullatis brak sa in to bladis amang thame. Continewand this ane dosand of dayis or mair, Quhill tyme apointit neuer man durst steir. The larum rang the Regent self wes thair, My Lord Ambassat to stuid verry neir. The manlie Generall lyke the god of weir, Not vsit to sleip quhen sic thingis ar a do, Our Cronall als quha is ane freik hot feir, With all his Capitanes reddie to go to.
Schir Harle Leis wes present at that charg, My Lord Burlayis sone to stuid besyde. Cottoan and Dyar saw the sowt at large. And Schir Gorge Carie no the knauis he cryde, Zit Hame and Crafurde to the laue wes gyde. With certane Soiouris of the garysoun. Four Capitanis followit at thair bak to byde, Sempill and Hectour Ramsay and Robesoun. Bot Hume wes first that ouir the walis wan, As I heir say I wes not thair my sell. The Generall say is he play it the vailʒeant man, With prayssis mo nor I intend to tell. Thocht Crafurdis ledder wes to schort ane ell, Zit ouir the walis he wan I wat not how. Dunbartan to quhen sic lyke fortoun fell, Thir wes the men that wan it I tell ʒow. The Generallis band come bauldlie at thair bak, Schir Frances Russall with ane gudlie grace. Zarlie and Erintoun nather of thame wes slak, Twa vther Careis, Knowis, and Capitane Kace. Than wes persewand at ane vther place. Breikwell, and Lammy, Mechell, & Capitan Game, Bauld Capitane Reid, that euir held to his face. Pickman, and Wood, did vailʒeantly the same. Spreill, Spadyn, Traill, Hutsoun, and all the laue, Bartoun, and Stirlie, Capitan Duberie flane. Thoise at the bak wall wes the brasche thay gaue, For lake of lederis thair thay wrocht in vane.
The men within maid sic defence agane. Thay schot gude Manfeild in athort the throit. Quhill force did faill and than I saw thame sane, Wo cry occai with the waithman noit. Halyhurtoun Strauchan with thair standarts sluid Scburne  Schattoun hes followit on thame last. ueris and Barrat baith wer men of gude, Gress one and Hanis wes laith for to be last, Crippis and Canttell to the partell past. Auld Capitā Leirmonnt with aue luik to hang thame Gude M. Setoun maid thair grumis agast, He gart the Cannones ga sa thik amang thame. Out gais the Hergbut in the Cannon glydis, Brak al in bladdis thay docht not weil abyde thame. Trotlar and filtie fell and loste the hydis. The laue sa fle thay wist not quhen to hyde thame, Dismontit cannones slew the men besyde thame. The Suddars swarfit and said thay wald not sar Te house wes gud had thay had grace to gyde thame Quhn all wes done we had not bene the nar. Let na man lipin in to warldlie strenth, Bot Gbite ground thay may na thing induir. Tratouris and treasone salbe tryit at lenth. Quhen men wald fanest all thair vices smuir Sa Grauge beleuit the madin Castelliuir. aue and sic forstis to defend his touris. Bot men with madenis quhen thay play the huir, Will anis the entrie and than the house is ʒouris.
The Madene Castell it rs ca With honour ay that nobill style it buir. With wemenis will ʒe do thame lytill wr. To iaip thame sa I think it na iniuir. Na man our Madene Castell playtt the hu ir, Bot uik appoitn ēt quhen tair wes na parel Smaikis had the wyte I say the hous wes fuis Had thay bene gratious with ane godlie quarel Thay micht not byde is for the greit munitioun, Bot drew in factiones quhan the larum rang. Sum thocht it nde to cum and sek remission And sum said best the Secreter to hang. To his ilusiones we beleuit ouir lang. Ane cruikit Ethnik and ane crewall Tod, Inuentand wiche craft ay deuysand wrang. Lat nan geue credance to ane drytant God. Thē Grang grew fleyit a wald na mait defēd at For want of watter with ane poysonn well, His men wes slane and mekle powder spend it And wantit force to fill the wais that fell Thair sbill smakrie I  ll to ten, With luik lyke Lyounes and sa lytill done. Fy druin dastartis ʒe haue schannt ʒour sell That said sa weill and syne gaue out sa sone. Durīg this pointmēt thair wes change of graith Sti gat ane burtene for thair being thair wes the credence geuin to suddatis faith aith gold and siluer and of Marchand ws

Than on the  the  vp fate: Bth  all yeid s giddes Vt  I will spend no tyms, Ta  thair breikis The suddats luiffes wes sa ouirlaid wt lyme Sn ge gold and gat the thing he seikis, Si stad beside and gat not worth twa leikis. As I heie say I wes not thair to se. Sūgat thair handfull of thie half mark sieikis Will haue na mair within ane ʒeir nor we. Whay schot na keyis to brek the coffris than, Ane day of blythnes for the men of weir. Sum stuid besyde ane wondderous sorie man Ane dutifull day for thame that lo thair geir. First saw it caue and syne thay durst not fier: Thair wes compleit the prophecie of Knox. Doun sea that Crage Kirkcaldy sall esteie, With schams and sclāuder lyke ane hundi fox. With gild of pepile sa thay brocht thame doun. As birdis but plumis spuliʒeit of the nest. Part ceyde quhair is he sat vs se the loun. Go to and sten him sa him tak na rew. Muhē thay yt bue him saw thame selfis opprest, Thay cryit for succour for to saif thair lyuis The Generallis lageing thair thay thorht it bes: Thay led him in thay war sa red for wynes.
The Regent then gat mak and To leue the spuile vnder pane of deid. He  for thing bot the Kingis munitio, As for the leue thair wes bot lytill leid. To tak the hous thair wes na mai remes, With all the suultis mycht follow he wes an. Aganis ane Haiknay I sall wed my heid, range eis not Capitan of that Craig agan. With this the Generall wes reterit a bak, Went doun to Leith quhair he had bene befoln Speik as ʒe pleis it wes ane bailʒeant ak, And Djurie deulie did his full deuoir. God gat and thākis the Quene suld haue ye glos We thank hir Maiette as the mater standis. God saue hir grace hes scho nor gart restoir, Zus captiue rebellis in the Regentis handis. By expectatioun of the commoun speiking, Wes it not thocht that Ingland sud begylt vs And sum allegit it wes the Regents seiking, To sell the King and sa thay wald outrsyle vs. Creip in our strouthis and suddanelie exyle vs O Rurall pepill rusticall and rude. We ar the men that all the warld dois style vs, Remembring ill and geue na thankis forgude. Ingratious pepill ignorant and vane, y do ʒe noit ʒour nychthoris ay with ill. Wer thay not blyith for to get hame agane, Thocht sum beleuit thay wald haue  stll.
To do you yield t thay haue schaunt  will Buith spent thair lyues & largelle of thair g lace my Ioy is ʒe had bot lytill skill, That trowit that Inglād wald haue tareit heir Quhat danger wes to bring sa greit muntioun. In for ane landis with i ane force indeid. The only caus wes to auoyid suspitioun, That men fuld say thay come not heir for greid. Thocht sum thair be of cankreit Cain seid, Sawaris of discorde dois na vther thing. Speik as thay pleis schame fal thair lippts ye leid Thay mene na thing bot tomantent the King. Haif thay not thre tymes in this threttene ʒeir, Ay quhon we socht thā send thair forces hedder Baitht Schippis & Gūnis & martial mē of weir To win our kyndnes geue we culd considdir. And now the last tyme quhen we fend to bid hir Hes scho not helpit to hols out ʒour Tod, Lang moit thir countreis leue in pace togidder And grow in freinschip to the feir of God. ☞ The Lenuey to the Regent. O richteous Regent of ane Royall race, Tratours may trimbill to behald thy fate. Fering thy furie for thair foull offences, Geue gloir to God that hes the geuin fe grace. Riches with reasoun for to reuill that place. Thow be and plantit in the sait of Princis, Geue thow wald prosper in thy iust pretentis.
That bound done lng me thy days inds. Sen God hes wrocth it I am weill , To mak of the that onlie instrument. To cause this countrie for to know the king, It wes the leuing Lord Omnipotent, That maid the Barrones sa obedaine. And not the force that thow to Did neuir Regent in this Realm . Considdering alwayis as the mater , And maid sic greance with sa lytill blude. To speik of Regentis we haue had si the, Sen God wes borne thair micht na . For wisdome, manheid, and for Godlynes, Quhair for hes God now laid this charge Bot lat, vs ken that it is onlie he. That rewlis the Realme & not thy Remember Ahab for his febilnes. Quha gart King Benhadah in his schera, Quhilk wes his wrak be war ʒe do not so. Quhair for put God the yowar in ʒour hand? To puneis lounes that hes our laid this . By murhour, treasoun, done fra ʒeit to ye. Gee ʒe obey not brekand that Command, I am in dout gee ʒour estait sall stand. Bot sone be rutit fra this Realme I seir, Spair neuer Agag for na brybe of gir. Quhat come of Saull wich his fac Ocia thair Ta reid the Bebill it will sone declair.
To fk exampillis of that  tour, My Lord of Murray wes degradit saue, For not fulfilling of the Lordis desyre. First God promouit him in the place aboue, Bot fra he saw that Iustice wes not done. He left the wickit cast the wand in fyre, Be war sic materis moue not God to yre. Geue ʒe be myndit on this mold remaine, And plesit God I wald not change agane. Lannoy to the Ambassade. My Lord Ambassade I haue lang forʒet, Quhairfor indeid I haue not done my det. And he sa cairfull for oure countrie men, For wit and wisdome worthie to be tret. In baith the landis thair is bot few to get, That wrocht sa Godlie in this muse ʒe ken. My dull indyte can not direct my pen, And thocht I culd it wald coutene ane busk. Ta put in paper all the panis he tuk. He is not borne of better qualytie, Of quiet speiche with greit moralytie. Swering nor hairdrie may he nan abyde Detest and pryde and prodigalitie. As equall Iuge but persealytie, For feid or fauour vnto ather syde. Aboue all vsees subiect leist to pryde, Ferme in his faith and full of Godlynes, With marciall hart inclynit to myenes,
Wll acht the counttis heir ae gude That sir Ambassade into Scotland send. To speik vprichtlie and the treuth declair, For na expensis did he spair to spend. Quhill pece wes brocht vnto ane finall end▪ Quhar as he fand vs at the plukup fair. With walkryfe labour and expensis sair, God knawis in Scotland quhat he had ad, With baith the sydis or he culd bring vs to. In winter weddiris baith in wind and rane, Sum tyme with seiknes sa ourset with pane. He raid throw montanes many mose and myre In frost and snaw quhen all the folkis at fane, With double bonatris for to hap thair brane. Then wes he worstand our ane wondie swyre, Sum tymes at nythe syne not to se ane fyre. Ar we addettit to  trew e strangear, That for our proffeit put him self in danger. As Caleb fend wes for to se the land, The gydis that come gart Moyses vnderstand The land wes feirfull and the pepill strang, Because he knew it wes the Lordis cōmand. He wald not stay bot stoutlie tulk on hand, Richt vnabasitlie all that gait to gang. Ourthrow thair castellis & thair gyantis dang, Brocht that to miserie maid ane myut to wrig vs He wes ye Caleb sen he come a nāg vs.
I da be bald to say this hundreth ʒeir, He wes not slangear borne mair welcum heir. or plesit the Preichours halt sa weill as he, On pure nor riche he neuer sparit his geir. And geue ane Suddart had bene schot in we He somʒeit not to ga him self and se. uha with this countrie euld sa weill agrie. To play the wise mā quhen he wes with Lordis Syne help the putrauis as the cause recordis. ou reason wald that ʒe returne a bak, We thank ʒow hartlie of the Godlie ak. Ze wrocht amang vs for to saif our blude, I ʒow beseik thir sempill wersis tak. With als gude will as ony man can mak Because ʒe knaw my cunning to not gude. Ze man excuse my rurall rymis rude, God saif our King and send him lytill a do, The Quene of Ingland and hir Counsell t. FINIS. Quod Sempill.
