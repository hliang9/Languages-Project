royal blazon or coat of arms C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By the King. A PROCLAMATION, Prohibiting the seizing of any Persons, or Searching Houses without Warrant, except in time of Actual Insurrections. CHARLES R. WHereas ever since Our arrival into England, We have made it Our great care and Study to improve the mercies of Almighty God in Our Happy and Miraculous Restauration, by endeavouring all that lay in Us, to compose and settle the minds of all Our Subjects: And in order thereunto We did freély give Our Royal assent to an act of General Pardon and Oblivion (which We are resolved inviolably on Our part to keép and observe) yet such hath beén the restless and perverse disposition of certain unreasonable men disaffected to Our Royal Person and Government, that they have lately attempted, and actually began the levying a new War, and the re∣vival (as much as in them lay) of those differences and divisions which We have so often desired and endeavoured to have buried in perpetual Oblivion: And for the bet∣ter effecting their malicious and traitorous purposes, had provided themselves with stores of Arms and other Warlike Ammunition, and many of them lay privately, and do yet lurk in and about Our Cities of London and Westminster, watching all opportunities to put their wicked designs in executi∣on: For preventing whereof, and for the preservation of Our Peace, We have been necessitated to cause diligent search to be made for such Arms, and to secure several persons, whom We had good cause to suspect to be engaged in the said wicked and traitorous designs; Which nevertheless We desired might be done in so orderly a man∣ner as such an exigence would bear, and not to the terrifying▪ disturbance, or injury of any of Our good Subjects who were lately of the Army under the Duke of Albemarle, and therein instrumental to Our Happy Restaura∣tion, or others, in their Persons, Estates, or Families. And We being given to understand, That during those late Commotions, several persons have been imprison∣ed by Souldiers and others, their Houses searched, and their Goods taken away without lawful Authority, And that thereupon opprobrious words and terms of dissension and discrimination of parties have been used and given, to Our great disservice, contrary to the before-said Act of Pardon and Oblivion; and notwithstanding Our Royal Pleasure so often published and declared to the contrary. These are therefore strictly to Charge and Command all Officers and Souldiers, and all other persons what∣soever (unless it be upon inevitable necessity of suddain and actual Rebellion or Insurrection) to forbear to mo∣lest or trouble any of Our good Subjects, either in their Persons or Estates, and not to presume to apprehend or secure any person or persons, or seize any Armes whatsoever, or to search any houses, without a lawful War∣rant under the Hand and Seal of some one or more of the Lords of Our Privy Council, or under the Hand and Seal of some one or more of Our Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, or Iustices of the Peace, in their respective Liberties and Precincts, within the several Counties, Cities, and Towns Corporate, in Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed: And We Will that the said Warrants be always directed to some Constable, or other known Legal Officer; and that no Souldiers do other∣wise interpose or meddle with the execution of any of the said Warrants, then by aiding and assisting of the said Constable, or other such known Legal Officer or Officers, as aforesaid: And all Military Officers and Soul∣diers are hereby commanded to be aiding and assisting to such Constable, or other Legal Officers, being by them or any of them thereunto required: And we do hereby declare, That aswell all those who shall hereafter be so hardy as to offend against this Our Proclamation, shall not onely not receive countenance from Us therein, but shall be left to be proceeded against according to Our Laws, and incur Our high displeasure, as persons doing their utmost to bring scandal and contempt upon Our Government. Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Seventeenth day of January, in the Twelfth Year of Our Reign, One thousand six hundred and sixty. GOD SAVE THE KING.
