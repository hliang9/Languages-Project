THREE GENERAL EPISTLES To be read in all the CONGREGATIONS Of the RIGHTEOUS, Who are gathered out of the house of Adam in the fall, into the house of Christ that never fell, to be read amongst them. G. F. Printed in the Year, 1664.
ALL friends every where who are gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, that never fell nor changed, yea into him that never fell being gathered, ye will see over all the gatherings of Adam tnd Eve in the fall, from the garden of God and the bles∣sed state, and from the image of God and the righteousness, and the holiness, that he was in before he fell; wherein all is in the confusi∣on in the fall, the sons and daughters of Adam are broken into the many gatherings, being in the fall, from righteousnesse and ho∣linesse, and the image of God and the blessed state that they were in before they fell; and so are from the witnesse of God, the spirit and the light in their own particulars: And so as Jacobs prophecy was on his death-bed to his sons, how that the gathering of all Na∣tions should be unto Shilo, who is we, and out of trouble unto Christ Jesus (mark) to Christ Jesus that never fell, who was with the Father before the world began, in whom is the light, life, and peace, and rest in this gathering, and so the gathering is out of Adam in the fall, up into Christ that never fell, and in him is safety and peace; and in this gathering you have every one a river, yea living water in your own bellies, which river comes from the fountain, for all nations are blessed in him; Christ Jesus that takes away the curse that stood over all Nations, and destroys the devil the author of it; and spreads over the blessing again, and all are blessed in him, and therefore doth blesse and curse not; and all they that are saved walks in the light of the Lamb, and so comes to the holy City that comes down from God out of heaven, in which there is no unclean thing enters, in which City there is no need of the Sun nor Moon, the Lord God and the Lamb is the light thereof: of this City which fences out all bad, and unclean, and unrighteousnesse; and the Adulterer, and the Idolater, and the Liar: and the power of the Lord God goes over all the bad; and they that come into this City are saved (as I said before) walks in the light of the Lamb. And therefore friends, all you that know the blessed truth which the devil is out of, which truth makes you bles∣sed, through which you come every one to have a crown, and so to feed upon the tree of life, through which you come to live for
ever, the leaves of which heals the wounded nations, so you that have bought the truth, sell it not for trifles, neither give it nor leave it; for that which the tempter will tempt you, is out of the truth, to outward things; but consider all the faithful all along how they suffered, and by whom, and for what, in all ages since the fall, from the foundation of the world; since the Lamb hath been slain, not joyning to men in any thing which the Sons of A∣dam have invented and set up: the sons of God nor the faithful could not joyn to; They followed the Lord, his councel, and his Word and Promises, and went thorow the great tribulations to the rest, as pilgrims and strangers to all the sons of Adams waies, religions and worships, them that were in the worship of God, and in the way of God; Christ Jesus that never fell and saw over them all. And take heed of the rough garments and rough spirit of Esaus rough nature, but mind the plain Jacob, that supplants rough E∣sau, and mind the constant truth, and take heed of the uncon∣stant; and such as are given to changing, which the Sonne gives not himself unto, for he ends the changings, the sonne Christ doth that never changes, and as every one hath received him, so walk in him that never changes, walk not in the traditions of the Jews that changed, nor the Gentiles, nor the Apostate Christians, but in (him, as I said before) Christ Jesus that never changed, and the way that never fell, nor never changed, nor never will change; then you will see over all the waies of the Priests, the Shepherds, the Prophets, and the Teachers of Adam and Eves sonnes and daughters in the fall, that do change, and do fall, and stumble, and are turned by every wind, you being in Christ Jesus that never fell, nor never changed, in whom you have life, and peace, and rest: For to preach Christ the way, the Prophet, Priest and Shepherd that never fell, and people to receive him, they come out of all them that doth fall, both Prophets, and Shepherds, and Priests wayes, and this is opposite to them all, in which they took coun∣sel against them that preached Christ the word, which was in the begining before the Jews ways and traditions were, or the Gentiles, or the Apostate Christians, and he will be when they are gone, so to preach Christ, is not to preach up the Jews traditions, nor the Gentiles, nor the apostate Christians; nor to follow the traditions
of their fore-fathers: But to follow the word, neither receive them, nor them that preach them, and to follow that which lives, and indures, and remains for ever: And this is the word that makes the Jews to grieve and the Gentiles, and doth the apostate Chri∣stians, to preach the word which was before their traditions were, and their inventions; and this is the word which makes wise men and women; and the word is the seed and Son of man, which feed is sown in the field, and the field is the world, and there is stony, thorny, and high way ground, and good ground, and so this is an universal doctrine, the universal seed that hits the stony, thorny, and high way ground, and falls upon all, only it is the good ground that brings forth fifty, or sixty, or a hundred fold; and such is the high-way ground, they are so full of the fowles and the aire, that it takes it away; and such as are sown among thorns, they are so full of the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, that the thorns choak it, and the cares of the world; they are such stony hearts that the seed hath not much earth, that when trials and persecutions comes with its heat, its scorched by the heat of the Sun, and therefore be ye all warned of these natures, both of the stony and of the thorny, and of the high-way ground, and of the fowles, and of the aire. And friends, keep down feigned flattery: keep in the truth, that brings to plain heartednesse, that all may be the good ground, that you may abound in goodnesse, and righteousnesse, and holinesse, for peace is sown to the righteous and upright in heart; and that you walk in the light, and the life, that it may be your life, that you may have treasure in your vessels, that you may enter in with the bridegroom, through the oyle in your own Lamps, that you may inherit the life that is, that is above all the foolish talkers which be out of the peace; and the second Adam, in whom the peace is, and the life; for they that be in strife against the body of Christ, are in Adam in the fall, and they are neither at peace in themselves with God, nor Christ, nor them that be in Christ; so whatever men or people professe, their end manifests them, and crowns them with death or life. So live in the Word, which all ends in the seed; this keeps o∣ver all pretences in the substance, and over the airy spirits that be out of the life, running up and down sowing dissention, tatling
and back-biting, and whispering, and setting one against another. The seed Christ is over that spirit, and he hath little roome in their hearts, for they abroad in the fields lifting up themselves high∣er then the world, but are worse to deceive the simple, but truth, and the light, and the life is over all that, in which all keep your habitation; for Adam lost his habitation, and so his sonnes and daughters who are in the disobedience, are in the fall; and the Jews lost their habitation from the love of God, and so they lost their authoritie, and was mingled among the heathen: and the Apostate Christians lost their habitation from the life and power that the Apostles were in. And so have brought all Christendom into heaps and sects about outward things, being out of the life and word, which was in the beginning before the Apostacy and the fall was; so live in the word, in that you have life, and dominion, and authority over all that which Adam and Eves sons and daugh∣ters invented, and also over all in the fall; in which word you have wisdom, as I said before, and there is a faithful witnesse, Christ, whose Name is called the word, and he is the first and the last, the beginning and the ending, the Amen. And friends, keep over all the bussings, and wars, and strife, and the talkers of such things among the sons of Adam in the fall; you that be in Christ Jesus that never fell, in whom is the peace, who makes the first Adams sons and daughters to break their swords into plough shares, and their spears into pruning hooks, that they shall not learn War any more, for they that be there are in the foolish state, but they that are in Christ are in the wise state, and have spiritual weapons though accounted by the world foolish; yea, the wisdom of God is so to the wisdom of the world, which is foolishnesse. And so you that the Lord hath blessed in outward thing for his truth keep over them and out of them, serving the Lord who hath blessed you, least you be intangled: so keep above them in the righteous life and conversation, that righteousnesse may flow to all men in all things; honesty and truth and that which doth Justice and doing justly, that may flourish; for whose conversation is ordered aright, they shall see the salva∣tion of God; keep out of all heats and passions, and over the tempestuous spirits, the ground of which is uncleannesse, which are up and down, and sudden; who makes a mountain of wicked∣nesse
and unholinesse, and keeps out of the holy mountain, which they that walk in the light of the Lord goes to, and they are taught his ways. Take heed of a false liberty in any thing to the flesh, but keep your first love and habitation in the power and truth of God, for the lowly minde, the humble, and meek, and broken, and con∣trite spirit and heart the Lord doth not despise, but exalt. Keep out of the many words of the world, and take heed of a liberty of going into them, but keep in the power of the Lord God, over all which was before all, and is over all, that your lives and conversations may preach to all men, and adorn the truth to God, and in the hearts of all men. Forsake not of assembling your selves together, as the manner of some was in the beginning of the Apostacies, which entred into the reasoning part, and so went from the exhorting daily, and the building, and the fellowship, and the comunion of the Saints in the spirit, and from the flocks, and the garden of God, which he wa∣ters with his water of life, and feeds with his bread of life; and sets open his broad rivers, of living water to drink. And such as forsakes the assemblies of the righteous, some for fear of the earth and sufferings, becomes quarrelling spirits, and so goes out of the path of the flocks footsteps, and sits not down with the flock at noon day, in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, for there the flocks meet, and there they have all a fountaine through which they have all one soul, and mind, and judgement, and heart, and spirit, and comes to be gathered out of all the separations, and sects, and fellowships, and gatherings, and meetings of Adam and Eve in the fall, and sits down in Christ Jesus that never fell where the fulnesse is and the life: Christ in whom there is no shadow, no variablenesse nor turning in him that is the way: But oh, the po∣verty, the shadows, the variablenesse, the turnings, the worships, the traditions, and the sects that be in the world among the sons of Adam in the fall, oh the riches that is in him that never fell, the peace and the life that was with the father before the world be∣gan the Amen. And friends, take heed of the Inventions and arts of the world, keep out of their rimes and their verses, for they are the arts of men and stirs up the light part, and lifts up that, that pertains to
it self, that is stirred up, that will turn in the end to the strife, or the earth, with them that lives in the Word of God that never fell, changes, nor alters, do not but as you are moved by it, that will stand and remain, in whom you may know a dwelling, life over death, and before it was; for the Serpent that got into A∣dam and Eve by disobedience, they had dominion over all things that God had made: yea, over the Serpent, and he came and told her they should be as Gods, if they would eat of the fruit that was forbidden, and they thought to have as Gods, and to be made wise, and the devil came to be god, and they came to be slaves, and so he got into Adams heart and Eves heart through their dis∣obedience, through which they lost their dominion, and the Ser∣pent came to be God of the world, the Deceiver: now saith the Lord to the Serpent, Ʋpon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shall be thy meat all the daies of thy life. So you may see how the Serpent got into Adom and Eve by the disobedience. Secondly, he ruled in all Adams sons and daughters hearts that are disobedient to the light, the truth, the power of God in themselves, and he darkens their hearts and minds, and makes them envious, and from him they have their devillish earthly wisdom, and all their invented arts and wayes that be bad, that keeps up, and stirs up the fallen nature that is sometimes puffed up, and sometimes down, through which the earth is brought out of its course, and the bonds of civility broken; so here he that rules in the disobedient, and got into Adam and Eves heart by disobedience, which is called the God of the world, whose meat is dust, who goes upon his belly, now if this ruler, and this governour of the hearts of such as are disobedient, who is called the Prince of the aire, and whirries them up into the aire, which got into Adam and Eves heart by disobedience, and rules in his sons and daughters hearts by disobedience: If he goes upon his belly, how go they that he rules, better then the Ruler think you, must the ruled go better then the Ruler. Thirdly, if this Rulers meat be dust that rules in the heart of the disobedient, which got into Adam and Eves heart by diso∣bedience, what feeds the ruled upon then, if the Rulers meat be dust; for can any feed upon life, but they that come to the light and life, and truth in their own hearts, by which truth see how he got
in by disobedience, and how he rules the disobedient: now do you think that the Devil would have any man or wo∣man, or his messengers or apostles, to obey the truth and light in themselves, then how can he rule in their hearts that went out of the truth? The Devil, the Serpent, got into their hearts by disobedience, and ruled the disobedient; and there∣fore its not like that the Devil, or his Messengers, or Prophets, or Apostles, would have any man or woman to obey the light, the truth in their own hearts; for if they obey the light the truth which the Devil is out of, and abide just, by this they come to go upright from under the slavery of him which up∣on his belly goes; they come to feed upon the life, Christ, which was with the Father before the world began; not up∣on the dust, which he feeds upon which is out of the truth, and they that he rules, are out of the truth. So its no strange thing for him and his messengers to speak against the light in the heart, for he hath made the world like a Wildernesse, all wild & rough; he that got in by disobedience, and rules in the dis∣obedient, it is not like that he would have people to o∣bey the light nor life within them, he that is out of truth, who got into Adam and Eve by disobedience, and rules in all them that are disobedient, going roaring up and down, seeking whom he may devour; and so Adam came to be lost and the Lamb came to be slain from the foundation of the world; and therefore comes Christ the first and the last to de∣stroy the Devil and his works in mens hearts, and sanctifies them by his blood, his life, which was the Sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, and destroyes the Devil and his works, through death; him that hath the power of death, and san∣ctifies and washes men and women, and presents them back again to God perfect; which the Devil would not have men and women to own perfection; who hath made them imper∣fect, nor his messengers; but it is Christ that destroyes him and his works, and saith, Be perfect, and presents men and women perfect to God out of the fall, up to Adam before he fell; and not only there, but up to himself that never fell, the Royal Seed. And in him keep your meetings, and dwell in peace and love, that the fruits of the Spirit may abound among you,
for the fruits of the flesh is in the fall, where the Spirit is grie∣ved; for there they be out of the quietnesse, and out of the rest and peace. Therefore in Christ that never fell, the peace, and rest, and light, and life, and the power and truth live; and God is well pleased, and doth accept you in his Son Christ Jesus, in the Seed, in the light, in the truth, in the power of God, in the Righteousnesse, and in the Wisdom; but God doth not accept them nor you, as they and you be in Adam, in the fall, in their own righteousnesse, in their own wisdom, out of the light, out of the truth, out of the life, and not li∣ving in it in, themselves; and so God doth accept you in Christ the second Adam, that never sell, and is well pleased with you in Christ the second Adam, that righteousnesse which was before Adam was, is in Christ that never fell, as you com out of Adam in the fall, and live in Christ Jesus that never fell. And so Christ comes to be manifest in peoples hearts, and the Son revealed, who casts out the strong man which hath kept the house, and spoils his goods, who goes into Adam and Eve by disobedience, and rules in the hearts of Adam and Eves Sons and Daughters who are in disobedience: And so Christ the second Adam must rule in all peoples hearts who are in the obedience, as he doth in all that have power and life. And so be valiant and faithful for the truth upon the earth, serving the Lord in a new life, that is in Christ Jesus, that never fell out of the old life of Adam in the fall, for the old life is in Adam in the fall, where the Spirit is grieved, and the new life is in Adam that never fell, who was born in Bethleem. Beth is a house, and lathem is bread, where the fulnesse is, who will dry up the River Euphrates with its froth, which hath run so up and down among the Sons of Adam; that people may drink at him the fountain, the water of life, through whom you come to know the mighty God of Heaven and Earth, the upholder of all things, and creator of all things, to his glory and honour, being in Christ Jesus by whom were all things, who is the top and corner stone; in whom you all have life, in him live: And so farewell; that you may have the blessing of the Lord covered upon you.
And dear Friends, keep your Hands, Tongues, Feet, Bo∣dies, Hearts clean and open, out of all pollutions and unclean∣nesse, for blessed are all you whose feet are guided in the way of peace, which is in the way of righteousnesse, through which the Immortal life is lived in. And light words, and jesting all avoid, and fables, and foolish talk; but live in the power of the Lord thats over all, through which you follow god∣linesse and holinesse, without which none shall see the Lord God. And blessed be God the Father, who hath set Christ over all, who is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, Gods faithful and true Witnesse, the Amen. In him have you the Book opened, and in him you see all things unsealed, in him manifest in you, who is your life, who was with the Father before the world began, the Amen. G. F. For in this night of Apostacy from the Spirit and power that the Apostles were in, hath all things been sealed up, and no man could open; but now is the Lamb come again, that opens the sealed Book. And all friends, keep out of all the fashions of the world, & over that unchaste spirit that invents new fashions daily, both in Apparel and Diet, therefore keep chaste in the power of God over them all, that your lives and conversation may judg them in such things, for to devour such things upon their lusts, which God hath given to the service of man.
The Second EPISTLE. FRiends, Live in the subjecting power of God, with which you see over the world, so you in this power come to be patterns and examples amongst all, and so ye are the Salt, and the Light of the world, now living in the subjecting power, that subjects the contrary down, and gives to feel the Lord God, and keeps out of fears, and that part as you keep in the subjecting power of God, is kept down; keep in the wisdome, in the subjecting power, that keeps to the wit∣ness, and answers the witness in every one; and then ye come the wisdome to receive, by which man is ordered to the glory of God, and is Justified; Lay hands on no man sudden∣ly, but answering the witness of God there is safety, and there ye are preserved, and kept over the whole world, so all friends in the subjecting power of the Lord, which subdues, and subjects down all, that nothing may Rule and Reign but the Life it self, you being kept in the power over the world, before the world began, which feels over the world, you come to answer that of God, and reach to the power of God in others, which will bring them to know the hard speeches that they have spoken against him; they that speak against the Light, speak against Christ, so Friends that be in the subjecting power of God, which was before the world began, keeps down that which is contrary to the power of God; for who comes to Christ the second Adam, that is a∣bove the first Adam which had the Command, but Christ ends it, Come into the seed Christ, come into that which is above, in the beginning before the world was made; the seed the wisdome feel; so friends, you having the thing on, the substance, Christ, feels over the whole world, and fathoms over the whole world, so in that, you answer that of God in every
one, and that is it that brings all down; here is a labourer in the field in the world, and the world is in their hearts, a labourer in the field, which is the spirit and power of God, beating down thoughts, inventions, and the inventer also; so in this friends comes into the heavenly wisdome, into the knowledge of the word of life, and growing up in it, in which the everlasting kingdome is felt, and the power felt which is endless. Now as for the word Minister, all is to come into the thing, which the Minister speaks of, the seed, such are in the thing, who are in the seed, a perfect man, so thousands are come into the thing, whose service in the world is to con∣vince them of their evil deeds, so he comes through all the dirt, and is a labourer in the field, and a Reaper in the field; so keep all in the light, and as ye come up in that, you come into the kingdome which hath no end, and he that receives the kingdome comes as a little child. Then a friend moved to work, and comes amongst them that are in the world, and when he comes back again from the world, where he hath been cutting down, and hewing, and breaking down, so now in that state, if any be moved, turn into his own, when he comes among friends, and sit down, and take heed how he speak; he will be judged except he be washed by the water of the Word; so all friends being kept in the subjecting pow∣er of God, feels the Lord; if any moved to go into the Mar∣ket, that does not feel the thing, and see the thing, such things will be gross, and some are moved to another thing, now the power, if it leads to knock down the deceit, and ye being kept in the pure power of the Lord, seeing, feeling, and knowing the intent of the Lord God, to the bringing down, and breaking down the contrary, in the subjecting power, so live in the pure power all, that keeps low, that keeps down, and keeps in the subjection of the Lord God, whereby the pure peace is preserved, you keeping in the power that goes over the world, you shall feel the power where ever it stirs or moves, and all in that state, if they be moved to do any thing, or act any thing, in Towns, in Markets, to Magistrates, or in Steeple-houses, after thou hast done it, in the same pow∣er
keep down that sees to the beginning, that sees to the book of life, if that be kept down to, man is safe and kept sure, that, that which disobeys would know what you have done, what you have said, (that must be kept down in all friends,) that it self would not obey, that all know, but now keeping down to the power, there is safety: then there is unity when that is kept down, and the power is over, so there is great wisdome in the City, that preserves it in the wisdome and power, that is the City of God, where all the spiritual wea∣pons are; abuse not the power, abuse not the Authority which governs the City, and preserves the City. Now the false City is fenced about with that that went out of the power of God, here the witnesses lye slain, and so the beast rose out of the earth and sea, so then the Dragon got up into heaven, and so made war with the woman. Then the false Church came up, the Whore, which drinks the blood of the Martyrs, Saints, and Prophets; here is the great City, the false Church, the fenced City, in the Dragons power, she on the beast, in the Dragons power, killing the Saints and true Ministers, so now this false Church, this fenced City taken, the walls tro∣den down, who comes to see to the Apostles dayes, tread over the walls, the Judgment of the great Whore is come, the Lamb again is known, the power of God over all; so now the age is come, that God will shew forth his exceeding riches and kindness, so that whereby people comes to see to the Apo∣stles dayes, the power and wisdome which preserves the City, so being kept in the power and wisdome of God, you know the City of the living God, and the great City where all the Saints Prophets and Martyrs hath been slain by the Dragons power; so friends shall see clearly where there is no mist, and so goes on in unity together, and feels over to the Apostles dayes, by the power of the Lord God, and so comes to know the kingdome where there is no end, the City of the living God, where honour and glory is given to him alone, so the wisdome of the Lord preserves in the power, and now one friend in this comes to comprehend all as a span, that hath got up since the dayes of the Apostles; and that is a cross to them all, that boyes and girles should come and preach the Gospel
to learned men, to Orthodox men, so the everlasting Gospel preacht again to all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, What? hath it not been preached all this while, cryes the great City? No, you have killed them that preached the Gospel, and so got the sheeps cloathing, the out side, but denied the power, which is the Gospel; so the Reapers are going forth to reap, the Wine-press trod without the City. Now friends having the thing on, preserving them, and keeping them in the power that feels over all, that sees over all; and so comes in, the Ministry, and unity is felt with every word, in the au∣thority of the Power; and so he that overcomes, he shall sit upon the throne, he shall eat of the hidden Manna, he shall go no more forth, and so feels over to the Apostles dayes, in the power, to the begiuning, to the immortal seed, the word of God, in this power that spans over the world, to the begin∣ning. But now, this contrary City would keep all down; as the Cross within, overcoming of sin, and leading by the Spirit of the Lord, and speaking by the Spirit; and the cry is in this fenced City, Prophesie is ceased, Revelation and Inspi∣ration ceased, no speaking by the Spirit now; these are in the great City, in the Dragons power, in the wisdom below, which is Earthly, Sensual, and Devillish. And as the Gospel was to go into all Nations, so hath Deceit gone over all Na∣tions, and now the Everlasting Gospel preacht again to all kindreds, tongues, and Nations, and peoples, this is the word to this present age, this is now in hand; now all the names are among the inwardly raveners; so as the power, the go∣spel goes over, strikes all down, and the gospel goes over; Sons and Daughters, Prophesie, go ye into all Nations. But now Prophesie is ceased in the fenced City, so now it is just guarded with its flag of defiance against the truth, and so hath killed the Prophets, killed the Saints and Martyrs, and so the power of God is gone, and going over all this, so keep in the power which will open, keep in the povver. vvhich is the au∣thority, vvhich vvill bring them in, so then it is not usurped authority, the povver that brings in, that breaks open, then the thing is not usurped, so now the gospel, the povver of God, goes forth over all nations, kindreds and tongues, as
deceipt hath spread it selfe over all Nations, and this fenced City in the Dragons power; now you know what a City is, what Guards, Orders, and Customes there are, and what work is done in this City, where all those orders are, the blood of the Martyrs and Prophets drunk: So now, the Gospel goes forth again, sons and daughters prophesie, go ye into all Nations; but since another hath spread over all Nations, whose cry is, Prophecy is ceased, Revelation and Inspiration is ceased; so now comes the Reapers, the Harvest is ripe, the everlasting Gospel preached again, to all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations, which is the power of God. Now friends are in the power, which doth fulfil Scriptures, and which opens words; all that are in the outside, are destroyers, and they know not the Scriptures, but you knowing the power of God, this brings the life and Immortality, so life and Immortality is seen, and known; the Devil he blinds the mind, darkens the mind, life and Immortality hath not been seen or known; but now the Devil destroy'd, the power of God goes over a∣gain, Sons and Daughters Prophecy, moved in the power of God, though cannot read a letter, so keep to the power, which is going over again, over all Nations, Tongues, and Kindreds, over the wise Orthodox men, the openers of Scri∣ptures (as they call themselves) the Gospel goes over them all; so the Gospel going over all these, and that preached again, that strikes down that power, that spirit that saith, Revelation is ceased, Prophecy and Inspiration is ceased, whereby the light of the glorious Gospel shines in their hearts, this shining in their hearts again, gives them the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jesus; so life and immortality, hath been hid from men, this hath been shut up, and the Whore, the false Church, the fenced City hath been set up, and she hath decked her self, this is true, plain, innocent words; so the power of God going over again, drives all this back, then comes the misery, the vials of wrath, and plagues, the seven vials, the seven thunders, the seven woes, before the mistery of God is revealed, and this comes be∣fore the mistery of God is revealed; so life and immortality is brought to light again, by the power of God, whereby the
light of the glorious Gospel comes to be known again; so then the mistery of the fellowship of the Gospel again known, the mistery of the fellowship of the Gospel, the Gospel is everlasting the power of God; the mistery of the fellowship of the power, that known again, this is everlasting, the fel∣lowship everlasting, the gospel everlasting, the mistery of the fellowship everlasting, with this is seen over all the fellow∣ships in the whole world, which are running one at another being blind; but now the Mistery of the fellowship of the Gospel lasts for ever; so here Friends gets behind all, and over all, which hath darkened the air, and life and immor∣tality is brought to light through the Gospel; so in this friends comes into unity, and one here comes to fathome the whole world; and so walking as good patterns and exam∣ples of righteousnesse then there is joy, and a sweet favour in the hearts of people, so dominion preaches through; so answering the Witnesse of God in people, it overcomes their hearts; and so now many are moved to go into the Steeple∣houses, among the Inwardly ravened, for all they that set up these things, were Inwardly ravened from the Spirit of God; now the power being known again, it knocks down that which hath ravened, which hath killed the Prophets, Saints, and Martyrs, and all the trees which cannot bring forth the good fruit, should be taken and cast into the fire, and the Beast, and the false Prophet taken and cast into the lake of fire. So the power, that goes over, and feels over ages, feels the Antient of dayes, here every one comes to stand in their lot, and in that comes to see the end of dayes, and there is none comes to know their lot, till they see the antient of dayes, be∣fore dayes was, and in that they come to see their lot, and as the Jews outwardly was to passe over the waters, by the rod of Moses made on heaps, so the people of God are all wa∣ters, Christ the Son of God coming to rule, as with a rod of iron, the waters goes back, the water's on heaps, the Spirit comes to war, the Egyptians overthrown; so every one in the power of the Lord God keep, that feels to the beginning, and as you keep in the same, you feel the power of God which is the Gospel, and then when you are come to that, you come
to receive the wisdom and power of God which is everlasting, which preserves in the power, the end of all outward sha∣dows, types, and figures; for shadows makes nothing per∣fect, figures makes nothing perfect; for look ye, you may see it is general in all people, that lives in something without, to cry, no perfection, figures and shadows makes nothing per∣fect, so all the cry is, there is no perfection, who comes not to Christ, for who comes to Christ, comes to that which is per∣fect; this is the word of the Lord God to you, all that come to witnesse perfection, know Christ the substance, and hears his voice that speaks from heaven, but not in Bread, and Wine, and outward shadows, but comes into the light Christ, in which is no shadow, which ends all shadows, and is the substance, that voice speaks perfection, it is the substance; and so as you are kept in the power of the Lord God, you shall be preserved, and feel over all that hath got up since the days of the Apostles, and goes over them all, and here one of you fathoms all; so in the au∣thority, and in the power, which brings up the seed, the seed that remains, and abides, and endures for ever, abide so friends, that are kept in the power of God, sees, and feels over all, to the Apo∣stles days, and over all Nations that the Whore hath got upon, and the Kings she hath sate upon, now keep above all, keep in the pow∣er of the Lord God over all, though she sits upon Kings and Nati∣ons; now as you are kept in the power of the Lord God, keep that off, keep that off that sits upon them, get to the witnesse, get to the fear, there comes wisdom, there comes the power, which goes over all transgressours, and transgression, so keep out in the Lambs pow∣er, and in the Lambs dominion over all; for Friends would be the finest people upon the earth, if they would do as the Presbyterians, Baptists, and other House-Creepers, give their power to the Beast, they would be an excellent people, if they would shelter there with them; but friends keep over all this, for a little honour leads them as one would lead a Dog, with a bit of bread, their Religion stands without; there was something at the first in the Presbyterians, the Eldership, but they now would come into the Eldership before they come to young babes state. And the Baptist, had they gone through all, and come to the light, then had they been in the thing, and the other▪ if they had been in the Eldership, they had been in the thing, so if friends would creep in there, they would be the finest people upon earth by their account.
Now that which keeps its place changeth not, Judas kept not his place, false Prophets, Antichrists kept not their place, these went forth, and so reserved in chains of darknesse; now they that do keep their place, feels over all these outward places, and that which they ravened from, that ye live in: so then, they that keep not their place, takes of the earth and sacrificeth, and then turns against the Just, and so death is their crown, they are fighting the bad fight, that hath no victory and doth not o∣vercome, but the other fights the good fight, that doth over∣come; so friends being skilful in the word of God keep down, keep your place, for all that goes forth from it makes ship-wrack of faith and a good conscience. And so now that which all along hath stirred, that, they be∣ing gone from, yet it stands sure, keep in thy place thou art with it, and so now the power if it be kept to, feels over all, and answers the witnesse which hath stirred, and as the power of God riseth all that must have an end, now all live in the power which destroys the Devil, destroy his works, save the man, bring the prisoner out of the pit, where there is no water, wrestle with the powers of darknesse, spiritual wickednesse, not with creatures, he is a wise man that wrestleth with the power which hath captivated, and this is the word of the Lord God to you, who wrestleth with flesh and blood with creatures, he never lets the captive free, he wrestleth in the dark power, that is one that hath captivated; now he that wrestleth with darknesse, and spiritual wickednesse in high places, turns from darknesse, and he that destroys the Devils works, brings the prisoner of hope forth with the power of God, so now every one in the power of God you will see over all, and fathom all that hath gone out, even in that which they have all erred from, and so this keeps all mortal crowns down, for when the crown is mortal and death, life is transgrest, when the crown is immortal then is life reigning, and so now he fights the good fight that overcomes, that hath the crown that is immortal, and the other that goes forth fights the bad fight, and all their fight is against the life, whose crown is death, and the Devil hath the power of it. So now in this state every man to his Tent, for there is the spiritual weapons, so comes where the weapons are, comes where there is food and bread of life, but out of the Tent he is abroad, every man to his Tent. Then keep in the power, in the life, which is able to overcome, here is the spiritual order and wisdom, so here every one coms to feel the ground of truth, so if any be moved of the Lord God to speak any thing, keep down in the thing that moved to speak: then you will answer that which converteth, keep in the power which moved to speak, which power reach∣eth
to the Witnesse, then you will walk in that power, which answereth the power which is transgressed, if you should go out of that which mov∣ed to speak, then you would come to be judged by it, so keep in the fear that keeps down all, so live in the power and wisdom of God, by which all things were made and created, which ends all things, in which there is no end, which is the beginning and the end; they that live in the form of godlinesse without the power, they live neither in the beginning nor end, but are falling out about what Christ and his Apostles said and did, & here is the power denied life, is out of. But now a true Christians life is in that which ends all the changeable; he is in the beginning, he is in the end, he is in the first, he is in the last, he fees over all that hath the form and not the power, in the many ways, sects, and opinions, so one Friend coming in∣to this comprehends all to the beginning, and all that is covered over, and stand upon this crushes under, and makes the wheat, the pure come up, the good come up, the just come up, so now standing here in the pure power of the Lord God, ye stand over the world, in the power of God, the unity, the Gospel, the fellowship which is everlasting now in this all meet, and the mind comes to be one, where all feel the Lord God present, the beauty of holinesse is known, the beauty of holinesse possest, keep your beauty, the beauty of holinesse, so live in the power and wisdom of God, stay down in the wisdom of God, which subjects down all the con∣trary; the wisdom of God by which all these things were created, by that destroy the Devil & his things, & his authority, even by that which recon∣ciles to all things, things in heaven, & things in earth, destroy the Devil e∣ven by that which was before all things were created▪ so whereas the cry is, you break the Commandements which are in these words, Thou shalt not kill, steal, make graven Images, covet, nor dishonour thy father & thy mother &c. Now the end of the Commandements is love in a pure heart, which loves no graven Images, & bows to none of the things in heaven nor earth, but comes into the everlasting Covenant; now love doth not kill, love doth not steal, love doth not take the Name of the Lord in vain, love doth not covet, love is in the wisdom by wch all things were created, love gives encrease & being to all things, so he that is in love is in that which gives all things a being; so love doth not dishonour its father and mother, but brings into unity with the whole Creation, love breaks down that nature which covets, & doth all these things so Christ the seed coms up above all, throws down that nature, breaks it under that pertains to all these things, & then comes up the wisdom of God, by which all things were created; so friends keep in that, and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ preserve you all. G. F.
The Third EPISTLE. Friends, THis is the day of the trial of your Faith, and therefore be faithful, for the Faith is it by which you have Victory and access to God; by Faith all the fiery darts of Satan are quenched, and by Faith the Mountains are subdued and re∣moved, and in your Faith all your Sacrifices are accepted of God; that gives you Vctory and access to God, and in this Faith you please God, that gives you victory over that which displeased him; and in this Faith you have all unity, which is the Faith of Gods elect; the one Faith which keeps you in the oneness, and all the Sacrificers, and Worshippers, and Religions that is not in this Faith, they are not one, their Sacrifices God hath no respect to, nor offerings, but it is like Cain's that went from the presence of God, and persecuted about his Religion, who built a City in the Land of Nod, which signifies wandring to and fro, and unsettled, and tos∣sings to and fro, up and down; and this is the City that all, that persecutes about Religion lives in, Cains, the Land of Nod, tossings, wandrings to and fro; let them be of what Pro∣fession, Religion whatsoever, Heathen, Jew, or Christian, if they be persecutors about Religion with carnal weapons, they are in Cains land of wandering, of Nod, out of the Faith of Abel, of the Elect, in which Faith God accepts the sacri∣fice, and these be in the land of the living; but the Cains land of Nod, where the envious ones are persecuting others a∣bout Religion, in that land God has no respect to none of their sacrifices, nor Religions. The outward Jew had outward weapons to hold up their outward services, which they had a command from God, but the Heathens had no command from God to hold up their inventions; and Christ Jesus came to
end the Jews Law and Commandment, that held up their outward services, together with their outward weapons, and all the outward things; and he who is the substance reigns, for all the types, and figures, and shadows, was given to man after man fell, which Christ that comes to redeem man out of the fall, to the state that he was in before he fell, ends them all, and in him there is no shadow, so he sets up a spiritual Mini∣stry, and spiritual Worship, and a spiritual fellowship, and a Church that's without spot or wrinkle, and a Religion that's pure, from above, and this Religion is ruled with spiritual weapons. And now friends, here you may discern what is set up by Christ and his Spirit, and what is set up by man▪ for Christ who ended the Jews Law and Commandments, who preached and taught his Disciples, which was to go into all Nations to preach the Gospel, to gather people unto him, and to establish Churches, he gave forth no command nor order, that them that would not hear them, nor receive them, his Law, his Commandment, his Doctrine, that they should be persecuted, imprisoned, or banished, though he suffered, and was blasphemed and persecuted, and his Apostles, for publish∣ing forth the truth, and rebuked them that would have had mens lives destroyed, and said that he came to save mens lives, and the Apostles, and the true Church, in the primitive times before the Apostacy, that was in the Spirit of Christ Jesus, walk∣ed in the Doctrine of Christ, and Commands, & did not perse∣cute any about Religion, nor imprison among themselves nor others about Religion, though they had Ordinances and Com∣mands amongst them for the utmost; if they did reject the Churches Counsel, they was to be left as Heathen, was the ut∣most penalty; and so here you may see the Spirit of Christ did not persecute any for not observing that which it gave forth and set up, which had it received from God; now here's a di∣stinction betwixt the spirit of Christ, and the spirit of fallen men, for that which mans fallen spirit sets up, which he hath invented, and if others will not fall down to it, and worship it, they persecute them, this is the practice of the heathen, the Jews that transgressed the Law of God, and followed their in∣ventions, who persecuted the Prophets, and killed the just one;
this is the practice of the spirit of all the Apostatized Christi∣ans, from the primitive spirit which was among the Christi∣ans, which was the spirit of Christ; so that spirit that does set up ordinances, commandments, wayes, Religions, worships, and persecutes others because they will not observe them, this is the spirit of the world, that lusts to envy, and not the spirit of Christ; and also those are the works of men which they persecute about, and not the works of Christ, which neither he nor his Apostles persecuted about. And so here's a clear di∣stinction to you, that you may know what leads to the spirit of Christ, and what lusts to the spirit of envy; for the spirit of Christ does not persecute any that does not receive that which he sets up, but the spirit of the world doth persecute them that will not receive that which it sets up; and in this you may try both fruits and spirits; as the rod of Moses de∣voured up all the Magicians serpents, of the lying signs and wonders, so shall the rod of Christ, who has all the power in heaven and earth given unto him, who will rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, Christs rod shall and will devoure all the serpents and lying wonders of the spiritual Egypt and Sodom, yea, and all the serpents that be in all Nations, for all Nations are to be ruled by it; and Moses song was sung when his rod had devoured the serpents, and all the outward Egyptians in the sea, so the Lambs song shall be known, as all the spiritual Egyptians scrpents are devoured by Christs rod, and the spiritu∣al Egyptian being overthrown in the sea, the Jews in spirit, shall rejoyce and fing the song of the Lamb; The Abomi∣nation that made desolation, that's spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, which should come in after the daily sacrifice was taken away, and should continue one thousand two hundred and ninety dayes, this abomination that hath made desolati∣on, desolate from the truth, light, life, and the power of God, true Religion and true worship, and true Church and fellow∣ship; so the beast that John saw and speaks of, which must continue forty two moneths, and the Whore, the false Church upon the beast, which beast should be worshipped 42 moneths, the time of his continuing, and the Whore should sit in her scarlet, the false Church upon the beast; the true Church this
time has been in the wilderness a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes, which is now come out again, and the man∣child is come down from heaven to rule all with his rod of iron, and the Lamb and the Saints shall have the victory, who make war in Righteousness, and going on conquering and to conquer; and so you that be followers of the Lamb be faith∣ful and valiant for the truth upon earth, and heed not your native soile, but mind the birth that's born and brought forth from the womb of eternity, that seperates you from your mo∣thers womb, by which you believe in God, and fear not man what he can do unto you, neither look at the hills for salvati∣on, for the Lord can make the rocks of flint a standing pool, and the Mountains streams, & therefore dwell in the power of God which was before the fall of man was, whose fallen spirit persecutes those who are come to taste of the power of Christs resurrection and life, and in this power of God you will not be weary nor faint, which was before the fallen spirit was that doth assault you, and in this power you will have stability, content, comfort, joy, and peace, and keep over that spirit, let it not have power over you, that may receive the truth in a notion, and may be a little civilized by it, that is ready to joyn with every gain-saying Core, and is ready to wander af∣ter every strange thing that's new, and so will follow strange flesh, who are uncleansed by the power of truth, and unsta∣blished in it, and such often hath their Religion to seek, that lives in questionings and disputings in carnal reasons, out of the power of God, in which is the fellowship, the one thing, which is Christ the substance, in which all stability is felt, has little room in such hearts. G. F. THE END.
