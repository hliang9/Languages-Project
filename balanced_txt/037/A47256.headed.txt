A LETTER FROM A STUDENT AT OXFORD TO A FRIEND IN THE COUNTRY. CONCERNING THE Approaching PARLIAMENT, IN Vindication of His MAJESTY, the Church of England and University. LONDON, Printed for John Seeres, 1681.
SIR, THIS place, being by the discretion of a Royal Umpire appointed for the Rendezvous of the approaching Parliament; is at present look'd on as a Metropolis, from whence that cried up Commodity of News is only to be had at the first hand and dispersed by retail to all remoter places. Supposing it therefore probable that any New Coin report from hence may not only gain acceptance from its stamp of Novelty, but credit from the reputation of its Mint: I am willing so far to satisfie your curiosity, as to set my weak abilities on the rack to extort some languishing description of our thoughts and con∣jectures on the intricacies of the present juncture of affairs. We are sensible that His Majesties late putting a Dissolution to a Resolving Parliament, and giving their great pretensions to discovery, a Nonplus, (by a previous Prorogation even at that very time when their prophetic fears were contriving a longer Session) did strangely disquiet those of the like occupation, who had been told by popular Abettors that by their crafts they should get no small gain; and at the same time so full of wrath that they would possibly have filled not only the whole City, but the Realm with confusion, had no His Majesties most admirable Wisdom diverted their thoughts by wholy busying them in fresh canvasing for new Representations. This politic Whetstone turn'd the edge of their fury, and it did somewhat abate the sorrow for their late demolished goddess, to think it was in their power to erect a new one, and for the quicker expedition (as well as from a sence of gratitude for past services) they resolve it shall be out of the same materials and chief Corner stones which were plucked from the former. We confess to have no such vulgar thoughts as to give our approbation of the common humour herein; since we suppose it was as much against the Interest as Honour of Elective Societies, which being the Trading part of the Nation are much concern'd
in the maintenance of undisturb'd Traffique, but this being upheld chiefly by peace and satisfaction at home, must needs be dimini∣shed by employing the disturbers of our setled Tranquility: Again some of them were particularly concerned not to disoblige so good a Customer as His Majesty, who, they knew no doubt, desired to see new faces when he dismissed the Old ones. If they neglected Interest they might have consulted Honour, and consi∣dered what a shame it would be, that Counties and Corporations should be judg'd so barren of honest Gentlemen that the same only should be thought capable of undertaking so great a trust; but alas they were so far biass'd with prejudice, that they neither lean'd to the sober consideration of Profit or Fame; nay these two inconsiderate Remora's put so little a stop to their Zeal, as they rather promoted their violence; they were told perhaps that Lex Talionis was a Limb of Magna Charta, and thought it therefore a piece of priviledge in the Subject to quit scores with their Soveraign, and since he had so oft denied their humble Petitions it were but reason for them to thwart his desires; And as to the last▪ they were loath to take New Adventurers in the good old cause, supposing experienced Soldiers could best shoot at the same Mark. How zealous their intentions, how resolute and how effectual their endeavours have been to reduce the old dis∣located Members to a reunited body, the consequence best shews. For our experience best tells us the Plastick vertue which was inherent in the Commonalty would operate on no other matter but the same, as only capable of introducing the same form; so that our dull Aristotle is now to be baffled, while such Machins of nature can do more than nature her self, a privatione ad habitum dare regressum. Thus did the factious Metropolis lead the Van, and set a noble Example for the rest to follow; they first argue the case in Dialogues and Advices to Electors. Wherein they plainly shew there was no way left of extirpating Popery, accommodating differences, securing Liberty, and preventing Arbitrary power, but by employing those they had already experienced to be such stout Champions in so commendable a quarrel; and therefore, well supposing they could not be more to the life represented, when the time of Election comes and the same Gentlemen Nomi∣nated to serve them, the unanimous Voters (without the tedious ceremony of poling) lift up their hands on high, and extoll the
name of all those their heated affections were so intent upon. The Lord Mayor, it is true, was so grand a Patriot of their cause and zealous a promoter and defender of their right of Petitioning, that it is more than probable they would not in civillity have denied him the Honour, if he would have vouchsaf'd his accep∣tance; but his modesty or policy declares himself no ways ambitious of it.; and so gives leave that the Compositum may result out of the same quaternion of Elements it consisted of before. And thus, Urbis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis. For as far as our intelligence reaches, we do not hear but that the same Persons have carried it in most Elections, to the great Charges and disappointment of all their Competitors. Particularly this City (which Ass like does always kick against that indulgent dam which lets her suck from her so plentiful a livelyhood) does so industriously (I mean ex industriâ) oppose whoever in such cases the University recommends to them, that scorning in their own Rhetorick to have it said, the University should choose them a Parliament Man, they have refus'd a neer Neighbour and Loyal Gentleman, for being too much a Scholar, and pick'd out the two former Cocks of the game, (though they both rise from the dunghill) to fight out the prize they are so deeply engaged for. It would have been unmannerly indeed for the Citizens not to hearken to their noble Chancellour, who not only interceded by friends, but appear'd himself in Person (though for the same thing he formerly received a just check from His Majesty) to promote the interest and encrease the partie of his two friends. To this end His Grace upon timely notice arrives here to exert the Priviledge of his freedom, and let the World know he had a City as well as a House Vote: And though he was so violently engaged against the Court partie, he turns Courtier in flattering the People, and in the sensless noise of the Tumultuous croud he waves his Tongue and Hat in crying up a Whorwood a Whorwood; in this manner for all his pretended hatred to Popery he walks in procession through the streets, and scrapes, cringes, and complements to all the Cloak'd fraternitie, though (if I am not misinform'd) his own Porter once took the chief of them but for Fidlers. As he was his friends chief Advocate he thinks it his duty to become Oratour, therefore in two or three short and sweet oratiuncles (each of which might have been Printed by F. S. for a Speech of
a Noble Peer of the Realm) he exhorts them to make the fame worthy choise, and not hearken to the clamorous suggestions of Popishly affected Scholars, and he plaies his part so well that the whole rabble Whistle after the same tune, and to our Loyal objections of No Fanaticks, No Latitudinarians, they give the thundring replie of No Pope, No Clergie; nay one of the most factious Mechanicks hearing a Graduate exclaiming No Round∣head, No Round-head, scraping his wit out of a Cap, gave the ingenious repartee of No Square-head, No Square-head. Thus were we poor Scholars miserably baffled in all our pretences to Arts and Sciences: We must trot back to the Grammar-School to know how to decline Variabile vulgus, and to learn in what case to put that fleeting Polyptoton, (though the witty Rogues confess when we and their Wives like two Substantives meet toge∣ther, we have the skill to put our selves in the Genitive) Then in the very first rudiments of Logick we are vastly to seek, since we must now from their undivided engagement in the same faction take the word Rabble, though praedicatur de multis to be an Indi∣viduum vagum. And our skill in Rhetorick is quite exploded, no plausible arguments are found effectual to move the resolute Multitude, which being tied to the mast of prejudice put a Waxen-eard deafness to all our Syrenical perswasions, but here's our comfort, experience never found their Consorts so inexorable. Yet at least though the Scholars (in more than one sense) their benefactours, could scarce recover a good Vote (i. e. wish) in recompence, yet sure they might consider what honour to the place and profit to the Inhabitants, is likely to accrue from His Majesties appointing so numerous a convening here, and from hence should result some spark of gratitude to induce them in some particular manner to express their thanks in return for so great a favour; but how contrary herein the torrent of their actions hath run to their duty, any one knows, who does but consider, that His Majesty in the last Parliament was pleased ex∣presly to intimate his dislike of one of their re-chosen Representa∣tives, though thinking him somewhat below his notice, he did it in a facetious Nick-name: He being one—Who by hook or by crook, Were resolved to rout the Pope and the Duke.
Well but perhaps Sir, you will ask me why we seem angry with our City, for taking in a like case the same priviledge with the University; who have so unanimously returned to the succeeding Parliament those two Gentlemen who represented them in the last: The inequality of reasons would soon give you an answer; I shall only say that we are so far from suspecting dislike of our same choice, that we have reason to think had all the other Members been Persons of as great Loyalty, Prudence and Integrity, both King and Subject had been quitted of the trouble of recol∣lecting a new Body. It is true one of those worthy Persons had but small encouragement to reingage himself in our service, being formerly some time forc'd to be a Secluded Member, but I hope he will be more civilly entreated, when he is within the verge of his own Liberty. But Sir, if you enquire some fresher news, and desire my opinion whither the approaching Sessions are likely to be durable, or an happy accommodation feasible, I am (though Academicus Aulicus) such a Novice in Court policie and so unacquainted with State affairs, that I do not at least pretend to an ability of giving a satisfactory answer. All I can say is, we humbly ac∣knowledge the honour done unto us by His Majesty in accepting of a Colledge for his Palace, and making a Court of our Academy. We therefore freely resign our Chambers to more Noble Inhabi∣tants, and wish there might be as much use of our Studies. We readily take His Majesties desires for Commands, and are prepared to withdraw to make room for better Company; and as many of us as are not like to have the happiness of being retained for His Majesties Security, will retire at a distance and pray for His Preservation. In the mean time we hope this place may so far sympathize with its noble Chancellours Deputyship, as to stifle all the vene∣mous contagions of disaffected Spirits, to dissolve all the specious Cobwebs of disloyalty, by irritating the artifices of Wiredrawing Spinsters, and finally to correct all misapprehensions, and create a right understanding both of and between all parties; that so without any longer interruption, Plotters of all sorts may receive such a Doom as shall be a just recompence for all their labours; yet that the popular clamours for justice may not stop the due and regular course of it, but that all Opponents may acquiesce in the determination of their wise Moderator; and not proceed to
expose the weakness of their own cause by a too clamorous en∣deavour, to invalidate the arguments and vilifie the Persons of their unhappy Adversaries. To this end we heartily wish there may be no grudges or animosities fomented, no suspicions or jealousies created, or revived; no biassing distractions to divert regular proceedings; and no new vampt contentions to engage us in old quarrels. We do not therefore so much despair of better success from the same Persons, as we hope an alteration of the place may effect some change in their proceedings, that they be not again so niggardly as to deny necessary supplies, so timorous as to pretend they will be misapplied, and so impudent as to avouch they want a KING whom they may trust; but that a sence of their Errors may so far extimulate them to their duty, as readily to comply with His Majesties just desires, for the more facile attainment of their own; whereby a happy harmony arising between King and People, all true Subjects may have reason to bless this our Sion for its pacifick property. If this be the happy event, we disposessed Gown-men may be soon reinstated in our old mansions, it being probable His Majesty may then adjourn the agreeing Company to their Old quarters. Nay if our hopes fail in this, our Successors may be forc'd more suddenly to resign, for if Sisyphus like they will roul up the same stone, they must expect to tumble down with it; And if they think their late Pre∣sidents sufficient authority for the same proceedings, let them ham∣mer out what intentions they will upon the Anvill of Resolves, His Majesty may distinguish between the Finis Operis & Operantis, and give the Actors an Exit before the Play ended. As we heartily deprecate this effect, so we as sincerely abominate those courses which are probable to be the cause of it; for how much their harping on the same string (will not only untune themselves, but) does jar against our united sentiments will easily appear from taking a transitory prospect of our Religion and Loyalty. As to the first we, who are so providently educated in the Seminaries of true Religion and Learning, are not so blinded with ignorance nor hoodwinkt with Error, but that we can give a plain and clear account of our Faith, and the Reasons of it. We are not so rigorously tied to any Dogma's of Philosophy, but that we can make any the most persuasive rational deductions prostrate and succumbent to our Faith; yet are we not on the other side so far elevated with Enthusiasme, as to think all incom∣prehensible
infallible and conclude with that credulous Father Certum est quia impossibile. No, we at the same time beware of being deceived through Philosophy and vain deceit; and yet are sensible there must be some use of Reason in the making out . On the other hand our sophistry does not transport us so far as to dispute with presumption, the Methods of omnipotence; to wrack our brains with that critical Philoso∣pher in finding out the Materials God first struck light with; or with that inquisitive fool to demand, how God could find employ∣ment before the Creation. We let our Logical reason make no excursions beyond their ultimate object , and therefore rather adore then enquire into any , tremendous mysteries of Religion; while we whistle at all heavenly inspir'd Bagpipes, and look upon inquisitive Record-searchers of the supreme judge, but as bold Astrologers who saucily pretend to bring intelligence from the privy Councel of Heaven, as if they had pickt the Cabinet of fate through the Keyhole of the stars. Neither does our education to science induce us to scorn, con∣temn, or turn into ridicule so sacred a Name as Conscience, which strikes us surdo verbere, not in such a sense as if we were deaf to all its impulses, or Adder▪like remained unmov'd, charm it never so wisely: No, we honour it as implanted by God for a sincere Register of our actions, an impartial Censor of our affections, and a happy Moderator of our passions; and therefore we willingly hearken to its suggestions when it would Bridle and restrain our inclinati∣ons to sin. Yet we laugh at those who would deifie it with so grand an omnipotence, as to make it Lord and Master over all their thoughts, words, and deeds, independently from its just rule; who create causeless doubts and queries, and then travail in a criti∣cal satisfaction; who think all their actions but deeds of darkness unless clearly guided by such light within; We know that as in reference to us, it is a Natural instinct, so in some respect it is a virtue consisting in a due mean, Too much or too little is equally exorbitant; nay we find the pretenders to it in the highest degree, have been more fatal and destructive to the designs of good Government, then those whose fear'd hearts have disclaimed any share; these last rest quiet with self preservation, and make no disturbances to propagate their fancies or opinions; but the former take the false Alarms of that striking deity within them, for so many Oracles which must be compleated though to their
own ruine and the destruction of others: they dissent from their Brethren out of idle Capricios of their brains, and then pretend insuperable scruples; they take offence where no occasion is offered, and then quarrel at others for giving scandal; finally they debauch their conscience into a resolute humour and then daub it over with the specious Title of tender, And What's tender Conscience?—It is a botch That will not bear the gentlest touch, But breaking out dispatches more Then the Epidemical'st Plague sore. A small burden hurts a gall'd horses back, so the most light and innocent impositions which come from superiours rub and grate against their squeasie consciences, and if they are denied the liberty of dissenting, they will take the license of revolting; and when once they will become Subject no longer for conscience sake, they zealously invade, Persecute, and Murder, their restraining Governours, and think in their conscience they do God service. We pitty their mistakes, but despair to rectifie them, since they are not come to the first step of amendment (viz.) acknowledgment of a fault. Let them therefore continue in their obstinacy, we'll allow their weakness to be a just plea. Yet we cannot but reflect on their hypocrisie, for let such cautiously precise Zealots never so much pretend to a care of not offending that little Deity within them, it is easily to be perceived they are notorious dissemblers, for while a few of our innocent ce∣remonies cannot be made to glide through the fine sive of their conscience, the grosser and more heavy bullets of sin, as Pride, Lying, Whoredom, and the like do with ease break their way through; thus their all powerful conscience is of no greater force then a Spiders fowling Net, wherein the larger and more fluttering insects do soon bustle through, while the weaker Fly is denied a passage out. When conscience serves thus for a pretext to disloyalty by wavering in doubts only to remain stedfast in self-opinion, we look upon her as a peevish ill-natur'd slut, that should not by Toleration have her silly humour in all things, but be severely dealt with, till her modesty teach her better manners then sullenly to contradict her superiours com∣mands. The sad effects of which cross grain'd moroseness in
reference to the irritating the designs of civil and Ecclesiastical policy, experience has so lately imprinted on our Memory, that no Act of oblivion can ever deface, while the pretence of con∣science serving for an impossibility of compliance, when press'd hard, often breaks out into an open resistance of those powers it cannot obey. Our conscience being otherwise instructed, teaches us better things which are some other Branches of our Religion. We honour Episcopacy as a sacred Office of the most Primitive insti∣tution, and think Parity as great a Solecisme in Church, as State. And we not only acknowledge a due respect to the function in general, but highly commend that order of it which the Wisdom of our Ancestors has settled in this Nation, and therefore think their envy blameworthy who cannot allow them their due right of profit, or honour; but would first degrade them from Peerage, and then crumble their revenues into many subdivisions. As we do not think this excellent Church Government could otherwise be kept inviolate from the rapine of Birds of prey, unless sheltred under the wings of Monarchy; so we hope our Princes will think their Autocrasie in prerogative (though not meerly inconsistent, yet) very unstable except supported with the wise upholding Columns of Episcopacy. We esteem of the Liturgy as an exact manual of Devotion, to all well pen'd Petitions whereof our conscience can safely say Amen; and pitty the blind arrogance of those who rely so much on their parts, as to scorn to take a ready drest oration to accost Omnipotency with, but transported with the Spirit of nonsence, tautology, and impertinency, unmannerly disgorge what their hasty digestion throws uppermost, to the nauseous disgust of all modest hearers. We pay a respect and obedience (not a veneration) to legal ceremonies without calling into question the authority of the imposer, and therefore are neither so ashamed of a crucified Saviour, as to refuse the wearing his badge in Baptisme; nor so averse to decency as to abhor the use of an outward sign of purity, or think the Surplais a superstitious upper Garment that first came out of the vestiary of the Jewish Harlot, or the wardrobe of the Babylonish Whore. In points of Worship we acquit our selves true Members of the British Church:
Neither too mean, nor yet too gay. While we equally reject the pompous extravagancy of She on the hills, and the sordid sluttey of She in the valle. Therefore, though we think the Tabernacles of the most high ought not to be so finely triced up with the work of mens hands, as shall with their dazling lustre divert the Devotion of gazing suppli∣cants; yet blame their penuriousness who, will not allow Gods Houses such fitting Ornaments as may distinguish them from common habitations. Thus we despise the pageantry of Crucifixes, the foolery of beads, and the drollery of an unknown Tongue in the perfor∣mance of Divine service, yet we think there may be some fit helps to agitate and stir up a drouzy Devotion, therefore we scorn those  unmusical churls, whose Souls are so far out of tune as to jar with their hisses the Hallelujah like Melody of our Church-Music; we wonder to hear them confess that their clod∣pated minds can be elevated to no higher pitch by such a charm∣ing harmony; since we know that truly devout and humbly pious Souls can like another David, when the Music plaies, have the hand of the Lord come upon them, and like a heavenly Quire of rational Larks, at the same time sing and mount upward. In like manner we laugh at the name of Pope yet retain that of Priest. We would kneel, yet not Worship the creatures in the Sacrament. We would not Judaize, yet neither profane one day in seven; and we think it hard to determin to which more pro∣perly belongs the imputation of folly, to the devoutly prodigal Papist who officiously solemnizes more than halfe those six days he should labour in▪ to the commemoration of some fictitious Saint; or to the sordidly thrifty Puritan, who, as it is observed by Poets, of Envy it self, Festos dies non aget, will keep no holy day: As in all other things so in this, we follow our more regular Mother the Church of England, which like virtue plac'd be∣tween two extreams, and yet like our Saviour crucified between two Thieves, rejects many of that too numerous Catalogue which his Holiness has falsely intruded into that Army of Saints and Martyrs, and yet on the other hand as discreetly retains the antient and venerable custom of setting apart some appointed days to solemnize the Memory of Christ, and his more immediate Successors.
In points of greater intricacy which the modesty of our Church has not resoltely determined, we think a middle opinion the best, as not f at least from the truth on which side soever it be. We suppose Christ neither died for universal imitation only, nor for partial satisfaction; we disavow the omnipotence of freewill, and yet think man more than a brutish machine. We acknow∣ledge God to have some respect of the Persons of his Elect, yet think the equity of his mercy and justice scarce consistent with absolute reprobation, nor know how on such a supposition any man may be said to work out his own salvation. While we com∣pare the immoderate maintainers of each contrary opinion to the fanciful Epicureans on the one hand, and the rigid and au∣stere Stoicks on the other. The former of which did fondly imagin that it was most correspondent to the nature of an omni∣potent being, serenely to enjoy his Quietus est in some upper Star-Chamber of Heaven, and that it was to mean and sordid for His August Majesty to interrupt his repose by reflecting on the Transactions of things below, and thus in effect they did no more then dress up a careless puppet, to which they falsely ascribed the Title of Deity: while the other made as it were a God of Necessity, and imposed such an inalterable fatality on the event of all sublunary things, as if God (like the fancy of a man in a dream) only sported with his own creation. I should not give you a farther trouble of perusing such an ill drest account of our Faith, unless I knew that some would ob∣ject, A principal Article of it is omitted, as long as no Mention is made how we stand affected to the belief of the late Popish-Plot. In declaring our sentiments wherein, I think will be offered a fit occasion of vindicating our selves from the imputation of Popery, whiech has been of late so confidently, eagerly, and maliciously laid to our Charge; And though perhaps barely to plead Not Guilty, would be as insufficient to the proof of our innocency, as the like vote in the case of another, which being asserted upon Honour, was reported to be meant with the Equivocation of Guilty upon Conscience. Yet because silence might gain the consent of many misinformed Persons, I shall recite those frivolous Reasons which huddled together helps to compose this bulk of accumulative Treason which we stand indited for. First, because we were so ingrateful to the preserver of our Lives and Liberties, Mr. Oats, as to deny him the privilege of
Legal commencement to a degree the Title of which he did al∣ready enjoy. Secondly, because our Representatives (which are supposed as not fitting in a personal capacity to follow the inclinations of those they represent) have not been such vigorous and zealous prosecutors of the late engaged Conspiracy, as so hazardous a case, pro aris & focis, the preservation of His Majesty and security of the Protestant Religion did require. Thirdly, that we espouse too much the interest of the Duke of York, in having too great a respect for his Person, too favou∣rable an opinion of his Religion, and too fervent a desire of his Succession, all which we apparently show by a civil Drinking his Health in all Companies and Occasions. Then Fourthly, because a continued report has made it now unquestionable that the Clergy of England, in General are more then faintly addicted to Popery, the seeds whereof they certainly suck'd in this place wherein the moiety at least did first take their Education. I foresee that a clear and genuine answer to these clamorous Objections, would be so little effectual for the wiping away such malevolent aspersions, as it would but excite the obloquies of the vulgar to cast more dirt upon our reputation; since we should in a limited sence acknowledge the premises, and yet without sorfeiting our skill in Logic positively deny the conclusion, which our popular adversaries collect, viz. our well affectedness to Popery. I shall not descend to particulars, but dare say thus much for our vindication. We are as averse to the supremacy of a Pope, as we are firmly devoted to that of a King. We are as loath to become Cloistered Friars, as we are asham'd to turn wandring Tub-preachers. We think a Monks coule as ridiculous as a Brothers Cloak; and are satisfied that Fraying to the flesh is as impertinent as prating by the Spirit. We are somewhat unwilling to be so far impos'd upon as to swallow the distinction of the Church and Court of Rome, yet we know Jesuits have laid down more pernicious principles then many sober Catholics will consent unto; we are certain their Policy is greater than their Religion; and observe they never lift up their voice to convert Heretics but with the Trumpet of Sedition, nor cry aloud but with the Thundring of Canon: we see their
force lies more in Ammunition than arguments, and often find that he who will not be a proselyte to their Religion, must be a Mar∣tyr to his own, while for a quicker dispatch he is helped forward by being blown up toward Heaven; for they propagate their Bloud and Arms, as if they had received such a commission from their fighting Founder, in commemoration of whom they are Loya∣lists to their Soveraign Lord the Pope, and Ignatians (i.e.) firebrands to all the World beside: Neither do we think Martials Rule an Axiom in this case. Parcere Personis dicere de vitiis. We would not only have their faults reprov'd, but their Persons punished; and abstracting from those devilish machina∣tions which have been of late discovered to be of their contri∣vance, it is crime sufficient for their Condemnation that they durst appear in a place, from whence for the prevention of mischief they are prudently banished: We know likewise that they do not run the hazard of their lives upon small adventures, but that to excite them to undergo such apparent dangers, they must have answerable motives, even no less then the propagating Popery by the utter extirpation of Protestanisme; after which they expect to receive rewards suitable to the merit of their service, yet we suppose they themselves know best on whose backs they must be brought to the attainment of these desires, no question  they are satisfied that the most effectual way to compass their designs, is to remove their great obstacle the setled hierarchy of the Church of England, whose vigilant Shepheards being once drawn off, or made incapable to defend their worried Flocks, they can soon by a poisoned sop, a threatning stick, or any other frivolous way put to silence those barking Curs, those Caterwawling Sectaries that now as saucily, as falsely, pretend it is their vigilance only that averts and prevents the invasion of the Enemy. They know Protestants to be like a bundle of well-packt sticks, not to be broke by the sinews of the strongest Arm while their ligament holds firm, but so brittle as to be snapp'd asunder with little force when unbound, separate, and disunited. It has therefore been all along their most politic design, and back'd with admirable success, first to crumble us into different opinions, then to make each fancie espouse a party, and so set
them all a scrambling for trifles, till rightdown blows must decide the difference; while they remain houting Spectators, promoting the quarrel, till they themselves get the prize the hot-headed combatants were so eagerly engaged for. The truth of this is most excellently demonstrated by Philanax Anglicus; and has the concurrent Testimony of one of the greatest witnesses of this Age; though we have reason to think he did not cordially design that advantage, the Governours of our Church may occasionally take in reference to the providing for their own security, because he would not accept of L'Strange's farther discovery of the same design, though dedicated to him with many civil Complements, in better language than was returned for them at the Council Board. I hope from what is said you will easily collect our Belief of the reality of a Popish Plot, and our disaffection to any other Religion than our own; If the rabble will yet prosecute us with the loud acclamations of Papists, Jesuits, or Dog-Towzer, we know not what better to say in our own behalf, than what a sore-cited Gentleman in the like case avouches for his innocency, we are true Sons of the Church of England, were never at Mass and Finally believe as much of the Plot as Dr. Oats himself. Take now a short account of our Loyalty. We are (though acquainted with) not wedded to the Demo∣cratical principles of Aristotle and Cicero. We have read (but only to know how the better to confute) those grand Patriots of Rebellion and Confusion: Hobbs, Milton, Hunton,  and others; we find their fallacies so well discovered in the incom∣parable Treatises of Wldon, Filmer, Diggs and Falkner; that we are unquestionably satisfied that all power is primitively dele∣gated by God to his Vicegerents upon Earth; that therefore their authority is Divine, how cros-grain'd soever their actions, hence their Persons ought not to be undervalued, nor their injunctions slighted, their impositions should not be murmured at, nor their commands disputed. For since the Almighty's imprinting his image on the Sons of men indifferently, produces a representation of his own Glory, Obedience to the represen∣tatives of the most high must not only be indefinite in reference to the Persons obeying, but universal in respect of the Persons to be obeyed; Subjects are Servants obliged to pay their duty not only to good and gentle Masters, but also to the froward; as
well knowing a wicked Prince is often ordained to be (as one of Romes enemies proudly vaunted himself) Flagellum dei the scourge of God, sent as a punishment for the wickedness of the People. We from hence disallow the extorted interpretation of Saint Peter's , as if Magistrates were so employed and substituted by the People, that they could call in their Lent authority when they suppose it misapplied to their prejudice: No, we pity any such miserable errour as shall introduce an assertion of the right of taking up Arms against a lawful Sove∣raign. We think the Name of Prince as Sacred as that of Priest; and are certain no weapon ought to be formed against him: while we look upon the sly Jesuit and barge sainted Fanatick as two dangerous Philistine Foxes, that carry between their tails that brand of confusion, The lawful deposition of supreme Magi∣strates. We hold likewise that the asserting the due Regalia of a Prince is not only the province of a Politician, but many times becomes the task of a Divine, whose indispensable duty re∣quiring him to instruct the People in the performance of all Christian duties, he would neglect pressing home one of the greatest, if he should not sometimes insist upon that firm obli∣gation which is laid upon all men, of being subject to the higher powers: we much question therefore their true intentions who would confine the subject of a Sermon to Grace, Faith, spiritual illuminations, beatifick visions and other transporting Topicks, while they censure as Eccentrical and impertinent all Pulpit discourses of subjection, obedience, and non-resistance. Again, we suppose that Kings Prerogatives ought not to be encroached on by a pretence of preserving the Peoples liberty: and believe Subjects have no privilege to question their Soveraigns authority▪ We think it a great solecisme in good manners for People to challenge a coordinate power with him who is set over them, and therefore must be above them all. We understand the name of Monarch to emply a soleship of Government; and they who to Monarchy would add the epithete of mixt, make but a contradictio in adjecto, if by mixt they mean a Division of power among divers. We know the People had first from the grant of one of their Kings, the privilege of sending up their Representatives to consult of the weighty affairs of the Kingdom; we have read they were first designed to balance the unweildy power of the Barons lately abused: and in whatever privileges
they have since encreased by the permission of Princes, we are sure their power at utmost extends no farther, then barely to propound and advise unto; while it is the Kings unquestioned right to refuse, or ratifie their Motions. We imagin therefore that for bare Votes to be accounted as Acts, is as great an en∣croachment on nonsence, as for a House of Commons to challenge the Name of Parliament: we think the first a miserable Catachresis, and know the last to be an insufferable Synechdoche. We judge it convenient that private Persons should not be such intermedlers in public affairs, as to notifie to Princes their errors in Government, and supplicate for a redress of grievances when there is no appearance of any but in the imaginary draughts of their own timorous fancies: when Subjects surpass the limits of modesty in such extravagant addresses, it is but Wisdom in Princes to disencourage their attempts, since the granting of some things would but give a fresh provocation to endless de∣mands. Petitioners being like dropsical fish-natur'd sippers, who by constant bibbing Metamorphose their stomacks into lime-pits, where moisture produces so contrary an effect, that the more they drink the more they burn. We look upon the Oath of Allegiance as made not only to bind Papists, but Protestants to obedience. We hold it nonsense that Major singulis, should be said to be Minor universis, at the same time a Soveraign, and yet a Subject of all his Subjects: And we think it as miserable a fallacy to divide the Prince into a Personal and Politic capacity, and so usher in a pretence of fighting for the King, when the Sword is drawn against him. Ours being no Elective Monarchy, we look upon the Crown as an inheritance entailed upon the lawful Heir, of which he ought not to be dispossessed by Persons that have no authority to take away the privilege os his Birth-right: And to this we farther add, it is somewhat disingenuous for People forcibly to divert all natural affection, and compel a Prince to sacrifice to the humour of the vulgar, one of the nearest of his own Bloud. We had rather other methods of securing the Protestant Religion, so freely offered by His Majesty might be accepted of; and when all courses are taken which can lawfully be used, the event must be left to God alone, whose Providence determins the success of all intentions.
Sir, the design at first proposed of giving this cursory essay of our Religion and Loyalty, was to intimate how the proceedings of the late Parliament, in many things were very far from obtaining of our approbation, how extravagantly soever magnified and extolled by the applauding vulgar. For first, they run contrary to our sentiments in Religion. Did they not use all the Spades and Mattocks of Seditious contrivances to undermine the Foundation of our well establisht Church-Government? Did they not envy us the support of our chief Pillars, the Bishops, whom they would first have made weaker and then pulled down? Would they not have let in many beasts of the Forrest to our Vineyard, by making a breach in our fence, in taking out three stakes from our hedge of the 39 Articles? Would they not have given encouragement to divisi∣ons by granting liberty to dissent, and by removing of penalties, have invited many to transgress? Did they not take up at the second hand many old artifices of innovating a change; as crying out against the unreasonableness of Pluralities, the inconvenience of Non-residence, and affirming the necessity of a redress of both? And finally did they not use all methods of irritating the vulgar to vilify the Clergy, because they were the chief opposers of Sedi∣tion, and perswaders to Allegiance and uniformity. Then in opposition to Loyalty,. How arbitrary and magisterial were their own proceedings, while they pretended to be doing nothing else but preventing the Arbitrary power of another? How many Honest and Loyal Gentlemen did they force to do the penance of falling down and worshipping them for speaking blasphemy against their authority, while Treason against a higher power past unquestioned? How crosly and resolutely did they always deny His Majesties just demands, though they were to be employed for the Nations security? And at last how saucily would they have cried down the King by debarring him of the privilege of the meanest Subject, making it unlawful for any one to turn his Creditor though on never so good security? This is not the moiety of what might be said, but perhaps in this case: .
I hope all former miscarriages may be obliterated in the ashes of oblivion and rak't up in the embers of an ardent and mutual affect∣ion between the King and his two Houses. I wish the same Gentle∣men may be sensible of their errors, and so become Achillean Physicians to cure the wounds which they themselves have made in our Church and state. Then will there be some encouragement for us Academics to make a diligent progress in our Studies, while there remain rewards suitable to our labours. But if preferments must be taken away, if Benefices must be monopoliz'd, and an equal maintenance allowed to the industrious and sluggish, it will invite us to take up some more advantagious employment. This puts me in mind of a passage in a late vindi∣cation of the Clergy, intimating, that if Church-men were turned out of their livelyhoods, they would rather than starve, adven∣ture to turn Soldiers to recover them. That is rather then the tribe of Levi would be couchant, as Issachar under the burden of poverty, they would become so many Judah's, Sword-bearers to avenge themselves of their enemies. I may add, if ever the per∣secutions of the rabble reduce them to this extremity (which God avert) we who are the Sons of the Prophets, and bred in their Schools should gather to our Fathers, and be intituled to the Church mili∣tant, and dying Martyrs in so good a cause, should be in hopes of being transplanted to the triumphant. SIR, I abruptly remain Your humble Servant, —— & Academiae Filius.
POSTSCRIPT. THE HUMBLE ADDRESS OF AN Academick Muse, TO HIS MAJESTY. HAil Mighty Charles, the Atlas of our State, Greater than Poets fancies can create, (Whose laded brows no other Garland bears, Then th'heavy burden of three Kingdoms cares, And yet whose stooping would endanger all He does support, to totter, or to fall;)
Hail Sacred Prince, We all Congratulate Thy Prudence for averting that dire fate Which lately did impend (however meant) Upon our well establisht Government: When Cockatricng States-men would have sate And hatcht Rebellion to its Birth, but that Thy interposing pow'r, when grown too proud, Soon dissipates the representing croud; And yet to shew how much you really prize Your Subjects misabused Liberties, By gracious Writs you soon give power unto Mechanick tools to frame the House anew; And then least it might grow infectious, By City Plagues remove it here to Us: Where th' dross refin'd Air does mortify Contagious venoms by Antipathy: So may it be, while here all Subjects learn Past errors by reflection to discern. And th'knowlege of a fault's one great degree, Unto th' amendment of deficiency. But if their fixed obstinacy blind, Their hoodwinkt reason so, as not to mind Th' impulses of their duty, but run on To th' jarring Chaos of Confusion, Curb, Royal Charioteer, the hotspur'd rout, Keep in the reins and tire their fury out:
Thou the true Phoebus art, ordain'd to guide, They but fond Phaetons whose giddy pride, Is still ambitious of mounting higher, Till want of skill sets all the World on Fire; Thy prudence yet unparalell'd, knows how, Best way to make such stifneck'd Rebels bow: But when thy pow'r has forc'd them to advance Back to their bounds of firm Allégiance; For to prevent Relapses which attend New cures, a bashful Muse makes bold to send This short advice. Recall that Liberty, Extorted from your Royal Clemency; Whence none within their bounds of duty stay, But plead a License for to disobey: If criticizing Conscience may resist, And peevish baggage do but what she list; There never will want scruples to withstand The plainest orders of supreme command: Nor is there hope the best contriv'd dispute, Should such like wilful errors e're confute, Plain arguing but few Converts will afford; No Rhet'rick will suffice but that of th' Sword, Their biass'd humours never will comply, Till force reduce them to their Loyalty; And only then they're fitted to agree, When backs as tender as their conscience be.
Take up then British Jove thy Thunderbolts Of vengeance, and strike down such stupid dolts To hotter Regions, where their sense may feel, What 'tis indeed to burn with ardent Zeal; And if their conscience ben't consum'd in Hell, But still has force to prompt them to Rebell, They'le learn from grim Belsebub's Tyranny, That Hell it self admits of MONARCHY. Gloria Deo, Regi{que} Salus.
