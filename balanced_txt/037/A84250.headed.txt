Exceeding Joyfull Nevvs FROM SCOTLAND: Wherin is declared the great willingesse of the Lords & Com∣mons in Scotland, to aid the Parliament of England against the Cavaliers and Prelati∣call enemies of this Kingdome. Whereunto is anexed a fit parralell between England and Scotland, manifestly declaring the parity and equallity of their pre∣cedent distempers, and our present troubles, oc∣casioned by the selfe same party of Court Pa∣rasits, Papists, Prelats and Projectors. Sept. 13. London, Printed for T. Rider, 1642.
Exceeding Ioyfull Nevves FROM SCOTLAND. THe Lords & Commons lately con∣veneed in Scotland (as in all their former actions) have declared thē∣selves both truly noble and ver∣tuously religious, all their aimes and ends ten∣ding to the preservation of that gordian knot Which nought but a final dissolution ought to cancell, wherefore finding that the great and manifold distempers of this Kingdom (occa∣sioned by a malignant party) must (if not time∣ly prevented) prove dangerous and destructive to the peace of their owne Kingdome, both Kingdoms running an equal hazard, likewise casting an eye of pity on the distressed estate of bleeding Ireland, to whose succour they have lent their brotherly assistance, our own King∣dom
being so much busied at home, all that we can do, being little enough, to prevent the active and malicious designes of those who seek the ruin of the Kingdom. And as to Ire∣land they have lent assistance, so now they are resolved to lend us their brotherly assistance, vowing to venture both their lives and for∣tunes in the just defence of the King and Parli∣ament against the malignant party of this King∣dom whose endeavours, plots and stratagems, power and policie, hath always been bent to ruin both England and Scotland. As may appe∣are in this ensuing discourse, when Load was made B. of Canterbury, he began to bring into the Church superstitious Ceremonies here in England, and when his Majesty went into Scot∣land, Laud attending on him, he found great fault with the government of the Church, stri∣ving to bring in the same superstitious Cere∣monies into their Church, but finding opposi∣tion, he by several stratagems, heaped oppres∣sions on oppressions, incensing his Majesty a∣gainst them, striving to maintain that by force which Justice could not abet to his aid, he summoned all the Papists of this Kingdom, all
the Prelates, all the Projectors and Monopolizers of the Kingdom, these by their power, and with the money which they had robbed the King and Sub∣ject of, maintained an Army which they carried a∣gainst Scotland, adding severall oppressions, stealing their cartell, pillaging the houses of the poore Sub∣jects, to the utter ruin of many poore families, spoi∣led whole fields of corne, with many unspeakable sufferings and oppressions, causing the Kingdome of Scotland to raise an Army for to defend themselvs from the intestine malice of these inveterate ene∣mies: By Gods Providence and unspeakable mercy they were that yeare defeated. His Majesty in His gracious disposition concluding upon certain Ar∣ticles of Peace, promising them Iustice & an equall hearing and redresse of all their grievances, Com∣missioners was chosen & sent for England, being ar∣rived, they were put off from time to time, after∣wards disgraced, one of them imprisoned, and a greater addition of their oppressions and miseries. A 2. Army was rised & brought into the bow∣els of this Kingdom, New castle was delivered up, by which meanes a second Parliament was called, and a new treaty of Peace concluded, all their grie∣vances was scanned in a parliamentary way, and
the Authors of their grievances was apparently known, some of them brought to condign punish∣ment, others imprisoned, which were found the principall Authors, but the manifold oppressi∣ons that lay heavy on the Kingdom, by reason of the many projects and taxes that were granted, & the corruption of the Laws & Courts of the King∣dom, Both Bishops Courts and others, took up so much time that before the High Court of Parlia∣ment could take order for the infliction of a just sen∣tence on the chief Authors, and make a strict en∣quiry who were their assistants, the aforesaid ma∣lignant party had fomented many lealousies and Feares between his Majesty & his Parliament, ma∣king differences of Prerogative and Priviledge, and having failed in their ends in Scotland, they now be∣gan to work the destruction of England. Having raised a difference thus between his Ma∣jesty and Parliament, they further perswaded his Majesty to withdraw himselfe from his Majesty, His Person not being secure during his residence so neere them (nay it is apparently manifest, that to further their plots some of the chief Actors in this designe did come into the City, and encourage the Prentices and others to repaire to Westminster in a
tumultuous manner offering affronts to severall of his Majesties servants, which act of theirs they fa∣thered upon the Parliament, telling his Majesty that such tumults were incouraged and countenanced by the Parliament. Having by this meanes drawn his Majesty from the Parliament, they framed many scandalous Declarations and Messages, which they sent to the Parliament, as from his Majesty; by that meanes busying the Parliament in framing Answers (which they were forced to do to cleare themselvs of these ignominious slaunders, which they had cast upon them.) In the meane time they under∣hand furnished themselves with provision for war; to be short they caused his Majesty to levie a war against his Parliament & (as in Scotland) so now to proclaime them traytors: At the difference that is between the proceedings of the malignant party in England and Scotland, one was Ecclesicsticall Ceremo∣nies, the other His Majesties Prerogative, both being made but as Instruments by which they cunningly endeavor to ruin both Church, King & Kingdom. All which timely weighed, I really beleeve that there is not one man that is either master of reason or truly religious, that will bee an assistant to these seditious Shimeons and Eleazars, who delight in
nought but rapine and destruction; surely I must of necessity condemne that man, as guilty of his own destruction that shall take up armes against himselfe. And let all the world Iudge what secu∣rity, he can have that puts his life into their hands. Let every man consider seriously what oppressi∣ons were heaped on this Kingdome by these Pre∣lats & Projectors, before the beginning of this Par∣liament, when their actions were limited by Au∣thority, & they may easily discern how boundlesse their actions & oppressions would be, if now they should prevaile & get the Law in their own hands They that would then without scruple, take halfe and pretend right to it, would if they could prevail, seaze the whole & give you Law for't, they having destined Law King and Kingdom to be at their disposall. Therfore let all men that desire ei∣ther to injoy the Protestant profession, or to declare themselvs true subiects to his Majesty, & faithfull servants to the Parliament, take up the resolution of the Lords & Commons in Scotland, my life for my Religion, King & Countrey. Let us fight valliantly, our cause is Iust, & doubtles the Lord of Hosts wil fight for us, & we shall obtain a glorious victory. FINIS.
