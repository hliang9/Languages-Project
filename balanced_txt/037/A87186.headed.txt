CONSIDERATIONS TENDING To the Happy Accomplishment OF ENGLANDS Reformation in Church and State. Humbly presented to the Piety and Wisdome of the High and Honourable Court of Parliament. Right Honourable Senators, AS I have been long agoe convicted of this Truth, that my Life is not mine own but Gods, and that God appoints the Ʋse of it to be retur∣ned unto Him in Christ through his Body, which is the Church visible: So I make ac∣count that I can have no true delight in the enjoy∣ment of this Earthly Life of mine any further, then I find my selfe Ʋsefull to others thereby in Christs
Way. Therefore I dare not desire either the conti∣nuance or comforts thereof any longer, then I may be serviceable therein to the Common-wealth of Is∣rael. And although I know not what service in this Kind I have hitherto done, or may do hereafter, (for I am no competent Judge of this matter) yet I am comforted herein, that I have the testimony of my Conscience assuring mee, that I have sincerely spent and laid out my selfe wholly to this effect. And that although I have been carelesse of my selfe as to this world (sine invidia lucri) yet I have seen al∣wayes Gods hand in the midst of many straits and difficulties supporting me, and shewing a way to proceed, when I found my selfe at a stand. Now because of late this hath been more eminently appa∣rent then ever, by the speciall Providence of God in moving the Goodnesse and Justice of the Houses to Order my present maintenance, and future sup∣port; I thinke my selfe highly obliged by all the bonds of Gratitude, to be so much the more Zealous, Free and Earnest both towards God and Men, to endeavour the Advancement of his Glory, and your Felicity, which I am fully perswaded may be done by such Motions and Proposalls as these are, which some (who are not much swayed by the Interests of flesh and blood) having concurred with me to put
to Paper, I suppose may have an effectuall influence upon those Honourable Friends of mine in the Houses, who are pleased to looke upon me as a Ser∣vant to every one for the Publick Good of All. Therefore in requitall of their care for me, I find my heart inlarged with cares for them, and by the advantage of most thankful Affections and Respects I would gladly give you All occasion to be Instru∣mentall towards Your own Happinesse, and the per∣fect Wayes of such a desired Reformation both of Church and State, as may by Gods blessing thereon in due time ferment the rest of the world; Which by the ensuing Discourse will appeare in some mea∣sure feasible, if the Things offered therein can be set afoot here; I say, if they can bee set a-afoot here; not that I doubt of the Possibility thereof in themselves. (for I know that elswhere the Matters here mentioned, have been practised by piece-meale, and therefore there is no reason why they may not be all at once jointly made use of a∣mongst Ʋs) but that I am somwhat in doubt of the season, Whether the Spirits of this Age bee not too much as yet (to say no more) discomposed and scat∣tered to entertaine such Overtures. But let Men be as they will, such seeds as these must be sown in their hearts, and presented to their thoughts. Who know∣eth
what they may worke? Sure I am the effect is in Gods hand, and he can make this honest endevour to become (as it is intended without partiallity) a Help and Expedient to that Regular Settlement, which all such as are upright in heart wish and long for. And I hope that such as seek not to make their own will, but the Word of God the sole Rule of our Reformation will all contribute to such designes as these, for the composure of needlesse differences. And that the Lord who is Wonderfull in Councell, and Excellent in VVorking, may bring all this to passe, I shall not cease to be restlesse before his Throne with my Prayers, who am the meanest of all that serve the Publick; but in truth, and as long as I breathe professedly Right Honourable Senators, Your most obliged, humble and faithfull Servant, SAMVEL HARTLIE.
A BRIEF DISCOVRSE Concerning The Accomplishment of our REFORMATION: Tending to shew, That by an Office of Publike Addresse in Spirituall and Temporall Matters, the Glory of God, and the Happinesse of this Nation may be highly advanced. WEE have exceeding great cause to blesse the Lord our God, who hath blessed us in many things farre above our fore-Fa∣thers; but chiefly in this, that we have the everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ revealed unto us, more evident∣ly, then ever they had in former times. And
although many of our neighbour-Nations partake of this great blessing with us, yet in Two Things the people of this Island, and chiefly that of England doth exceed all the rest. First, herein, that this Parliament, and such as joyne with it in this Publike Cause, are more solemnly and strongly engaged to advance the Glory of God by the Reformation of this Church and State, then any other Protestants are. Secondly, in this, that God hath put into the hands of this Parliament sufficiently all the Meanes and Advantages that may enable them to discharge their duty in order to this engage∣ment. If then this good and mighty hand of God, which hitherto hath done so many and so won∣derfull things for Us, will graciously continue to lead our Leaders on, in the way wherin they are entered, till they finish their course succes∣fully; it is evident, that our Happinesse may be compleated for our Age in a full measure, and without interruption propagated afterward for many Ages unto our Posterity: And lest we should seem to be carelesse of so great an Ad∣vantage, let us look upon our State, to make a
discovery of Gods dealing with Us, to the praise of his Name, and the increase of our hopes. First then, this our making of a Nationall Co∣venant in so solemn a manner with Almighty God, with our Neighbour-Nation, and with each other in reference unto God, as it is an extraordinary engagement to bind our soules unto his publike Service; so it hath been from him to Us the conveyance of an extraordinary blessing upon our proceedings, by Scattering all our adversaries before Us, and breaking al their plots and enterprises against Us; by which meanes also our engagement towards God is more strongly confirmed and increased, be∣cause he hath not onely delivered Us from the deadly feares of our most dangerous and de∣sperate Enemies; but hath manifested his acce∣ptance of our Persons, and approved of our wayes and undertakings by a successe, which is every way admirable. In the second place, the Advantages which by this successe hee hath put into our hands to effect that whereunto wee are engaged, are no lesse obliging towards the Advancement of his Glory, then the Covenant it self. For this very tye whereby God hath bound Us to him∣self
before other people Nationally, and called upon Us to make a solemne Profession of our purpose to live reformed under his Ordinance as Members of Christs body, hath obliged Us before others, to mind not Our selves alone, but the Communion of his Saints also in all the Reformed Churches. Then this other Advantage, that by our suc∣cesse hee hath made our Parliament eminently Honorable, and his great Trustee of the grea∣test and most uncontroulable Power and Au∣thority which is in any Protestant State on earth; doth bind Us so much the more to bee mindfull of his Honour, to advance it with all the power and authority which hee hath be∣stowed upon Us. Moreover this, that hee hath put into the hands of our Parliament, the right and privi∣ledge to Set a worke, to Addresse and to Dispose of, more large Spirituall Talents; and Intellectuall Abilities, and of more plentifull Temporall Meanes and Helpes for Spirituall Uses, then other Nations have, and withall, that offer he doth at this time also more convenient opportunities and occasions to Us, then to any others, to improve all these blessings to his
Glory, to our owne Good, and the Comfort of many; This ( say) that God doth all this for Us by our Parliament, is evidently a more effe∣ctuall drawing and engaging of Us to himself, then is our voluntary binding of our selves o∣ver unto him by our Nationall Covenant. Therefore as we may gather that our guilt for this reason will bee above other Nations ex∣treame heavily increased upon Us, in case we neglect the duties of so many and strong Obli∣gations; so we may hope that our Happiness in case we answer this great call, and discharge the trust which God hath reposed in Us faithfully, will be upon Us and our Posterity, more then upon others, for ever also increased. From which Consideration we must conclude, That Three Things will be required of Us to acquit our selves of all these engagements. The First is that which the Nationall Cove∣nant doth bind Us unto within and towards Our selves, for the redresse of Publike Evils. The Second is that which the Universall Kingdom of God in the world, and the Church Visible doth require of Us towards all, for the addresse of every one to partake of Publike Blessings.
And the Third is that, which the Communi∣on of Saints doth oblige Us unto, toward our Protestant Brethren at home and abroad, for the Common Advancement of Religion, and against the Common Enemies thereof. Upon the Conscionable performance of our Duties in these Three Relations, the continuance and enlargement of our Happines will consist: Let us then briefly consider of the Ways by which wee should acquit our selves of these engage∣ments. The Nationall Covenant doth bind Us for the redresse of our Evils, to settle our Church, our Civill State, and our particular Persons in a Reformed condition. The Reformation of our Church is specified in the settlement of Truth by a Common Confession of Faith and Cate∣chisme: in the settlement of Righteousnesse and good Order by a Common Directory for Worship, for Government, and for Discipline; and in the overthrow of Error, of Unrighte∣ousnes, and of Disorder, by the abolishment of Popery, of Prelacy, of Superstition, of Heresie, of Schisme, and of all Profanesse. The Re∣formation of the Civill State, is also specified in the maintenance of that Authority whereby
Justice is to be administred unto the Nations; in the preservation of that Peace and Unity, which is setled between the Kingdomes, in the suppression of all evil Instruments that disturb the Publike Peace between the King and his People, or between the two Nations; and in the faithfulness of every one, to persevere in these endevours, and to maintaine those that prose∣cute the same. And the Reformation of Our particular Person is specified lastly, in the Hu∣miliation of every one for his own sins, the sins of the Nations; and in the care which every one of Us doth bind himself unto, to Reforme his own life according to the Gospel of Christ, and to watch over all those that are under Our charges to the same effect. Now when all this is done, and Nationally agreed unto, as is expresly mentioned in the Covenant, yet even then all will not be done, which of Us Nationally God doth require for the Advancement of his Glory. For the very Reformation itself (if truly compleated) will oblige the Nation more effectually, then ever hitherto it hath bin; to mind a further Interest both in the generall Communion of Saints, and in the Universall Kingdom of God: For then
Christs saying wil take place in Us, Luk. 12.48. Ʋnto whomsoever much is given, of him shall bee much required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will aske the more. Therefore whatever blessing through redress of our Evils in our Reformation shall be attained by Us, or advanced to Us within this State, God will not conferre it upon us, that it should rest there and lye dead as a Talent buried in the ground; but he will expect that we should trade with it, and make it usefull in his service towards All for the enlargement of his Kingdome; because the maine engagement which hee doth put up∣on those whom hee hath delivered from their Enemies, is this, namely, That they should serve him without feare in righteousnesse and holi∣nesse all the dayes of their life, Luk. 1.24, 25. For if by this Reformation of our Church, State and Lives, he doth intend to convert Us unto himself; Hee will not doe it upon any other termes, then it was done to his Apostle Peter: to whom he said, Tu Conversus confirma fratres, When thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren, Luk. 22.32. So then our Obligation to the whole Body of Christ (for whose sake God doth all things to every one) will not be satis∣fied
by that discharge of our duty to the Body of this Nation; but that which in this Nation is brought home unto God by the Truth and Settlement of the Holy Profession therin; must be according to the Rule offered up again unto him, dedicated unto his service, and applyed unto the use for which he hath bestowed it up∣on Us; else wee shall rob him of the fruit of all these blessings, and deserve to be deprived of the same: For God dealeth with a whole Na∣tion in respect of his Kingdom, as he doth with a single Man: Hee doth not give to any parti∣cular man the gifts of his Spirit for himself a∣lone, but he giveth them, as the Apostle saith, To profit withall, that he should minister the same unto others, as a Steward of his Grace: even so wee must judge of the Nationall blessings be∣stowed upon Us in the hand of the Parliament; that Gods undoubted meaning is not that wee should ingrosse his gifts as our own, peculiar to our selves alone but that wee should become faithfull Stewards thereof for the Universall Kingdome of his Son, that it may be propaga∣ted, and for the generall Communion of his Saints, that it may be entertained. It will be therefore the Wisdome of Us all,
that make Conscience of our wayes, both in the Parliament, and in the whole Nation (whether we have taken the National Covenant or not) to lay this Truth to heart, That the onely ground of all Our Standing and prosperity is this, even Our Publike Interest in Christs Uni∣versall and Communicative Kingdom; and that by this Interest we are bound to raise Our Re¦solutions to some Duties of a larger extent then those are, which the solemne League and Covenant doth require of Us. These indeed must needs be done, but these other of a larger extent must not be left undone: these are ne∣cessary to remove the rubbish of scandals and impediments, that the Foundations of many Generations may be laid: but these other are no less necessary, that the superstructures of Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones may bee erected un∣to a Spirituall Tabernacle upon these founda∣tions. Although then some of Us may perhaps scru∣ple at some of the particulars mentioned in the Nationall Covenant, yet it cannot be well ima∣gined, that any will scruple to concur with his Brethren in those Duties, which without all controversie are Righteous, Holy, Harmlesse,
and Acceptable, and which will work upon all the main Effect, and profitable use of the Cove∣nant it self, namely, a Real advancement of that Truth which is after Godlines; and a Confirma∣tion of that Peace which is the fruit of Righte∣ousnesse. Now what these Duties are, and How they may be performed,  suppose will be a part of our duty to seek out, to discover and propose, that such of Us as are capable of thoughts rai∣sed above our selves, and can discerne a Con∣cernment more Publike then what the Vulgar doth apprehend, may have occasion to stirre up within Our hearts such faithfull and dutifull resolutions as will answer and come up to the main engagements which God hath laid upon Us: and to the end also, that the wisdome of this Parliament may see the offer of a Peaceable O∣verture and Motion made, whereby all those that are under their power, of what degree and quality soever, may be addressed, directed, and employed to serve the Publike Good, by all their useful gifts, without scruple to themselves or disturbance to any, although in some parti∣culars their strain may be different from others who walk up more exactly equal to the Solemn Nationall Engagement.
To speak then cleerly of this Matter, We must propose distinctly that which We have already intimated more then once, namely, That the main Duty comprehending the whole engage∣ment, whereunto by all these blessings God hath called Us beyond the tye of our Nationall Covenanted Reformation, is this: That wee should Study to make our Talents serviceable unto his Glory, by the advancement of his Uni∣versall Kingdome, and of the Generall Com∣munion of his Saints. And the Principles from which this Truth doth evidently flow, are these. 1. The Duty whereunto God by his gifts doth chiefly enable every one of Vs, is that Duty whereunto he doth mainly call Vs: but the gifts Spiritually and Temporally bestowed upon Us, by this successe of our Affaires doe chiefly inable Vs to the Advancement of his Vniversall Kingdom, and of the Generall Com∣munion of his Saints. Therefore this is the Duty whereunto we are mainly called. 2. The Duty wherby God is most eminent∣ly glorified, is that whereof the performance is mainly required, and to which wee are chiefly engaged, But God an be glorified in nothing
by Vs so much, as in the Advancement of his Vniversall Kingdom, and of the generally Com∣munion of his Saint,: Therefore nothing but this is mainely required of Us, and nothing but this will answer fully the high Engagement whereby wee are bound to serve him. 3. The Duty which being performed will settle and increase our present, and continue to Posterity our future Happines; and therin raise the glory of this Nation above our Neighbors; is that Duty, which should be Mainly and Na∣tionally intended and prosecuted by Vs more then by our Neighbours. But this is the Duty which will, and nothing but the performance therof wil (by the Advancement of Gods Glo∣ry amongst Us) doe all this unto Vs above our Neighbors: Therefore this is the Duty which should be mainly prosecuted by Vs. And least any might make a doubt of this last Position, let Vs a little enlarge our selves thereon, to make it more apparent from the Vndoubted Maximes and Reasons of a true Reformed Christian State, such as we are now called to be, if we take notice of our condition. First then We conceive that the Glory and
Happiness of a State go hand in hand together; so that every thing which may adde unto the true Glory, is also fit to increase the Happiness, & vice versa, on the other side, whatsoever doth adde unto the true Happinesse, is also Fit to increase the Glory of a State. Secondly, we conceive that no Happines can be counted true, which is not setled; and that no Happines can be counted setled to a Nation that is not, or cannot bee dilated unto all the Members thereof, and continued in after times unto their Posterity. Thirdly, that neither true Glory nor Hap∣pines can befal to any People or State without the Gospel and Kingdome of Christ. Fourthly, that the Wayes and Meanes by which the Kingdome of our God, and the Gos∣pel of Jesus Christ (which are inseparable) is advanced most really unto all, and in al respects unto every one; are the onely fittest to settle true Happines and the Glory of a Nation. Fiftly, that the Gospel and Kingdom of our God cannot be really advanced unto all, and in all respects unto every one, except it be advan∣ced purely for it self; and all other things made subordinate to it.
Sixtly, that if it bee thus advanced indeed, without any particular mixture of wordly State ends; then we may be sure that Christ wil reigne in that State; and that God will be truly glorified in it, because he can be no where glo∣rified, but where his Son doth reigne, and if hee be glorified in it, we may be also sure, that hee wil glorifie it in himself, by his comliness, which he will put upon it. For all the promises made unto his peculiar People will bee made good unto it. The Peace therefore shall bee extended as a mighty river; the Righteousnesse thereof shall goe before it; and the glory of the Lord shall bee a rereward unto it. To conclude then in a Word, the whole Hap∣pines and the Glory of this State will depend upon the Wisdome and the Piety of this great Parliament in discharging this great Duty: The large Means which he hath put into our hands doe inable Us hereunto, the high Aime of his Glory doth require this service of Us; and therefore this will be the main and blessed re∣sult of our Nationall Reformation and Settle∣ment according to the Covenant. For as it can∣not be imagined, that a house can bee raised to last without a foundation, so nothing can be in
this kind really attempted by Us towards all, except first within Our selves, the Fundamen∣tall Part of the Reformation, which is in hand, be in some competent Measure established for which cause before We proceed unto Particu∣lars, We must once for all premise this, that no¦thing in the sequel of this discourse is inten∣ded or proposed otherwise, then as it is consi∣stent with, and a sequel of our Nationall and Domesticall grounds of Reformation. Now then to fall from these Generals, unto such particulars as may shew Us the Way by which the propagation of Gods Glory in his Universall Kingdom, and in the General Com∣munion of his Saints, may redound unto the constant enlargement and continuance of his blessings over this Nation wee shall reflect as briefly as may be upon these Heads. 1. What is meant by the Universall King∣dom of God, and by the Generall Communion of his Saints? 2. What the Particular Duties are whereby Gods Glory is to be Advanced in this Univer∣sall Kingdom and Generall Communion? 3. What the Meanes are, by which God hath inabled our Leaders, and called them to the performance of these Duties?
4. And lastly, what the Way and Method of proceeding may be, to make Use of these Meanes, for the accomplishment of the Workes whereunto the Duties doe oblige Us? Which Way wil end in an Office of Address, of whose Method and Usefulness is finally to be spoken. Of the First. BY the Universall Kingdome of God, is to be understood that Administration of his Power, of his Justice, and of all his Good Gifts towards Mankind; whereby all men may bee made sensible of his Soveraignity and Provi∣dence over them: and so wrought upon, to de∣pend upon him, by his Outward Ordinances both Temporall annd Spirituall, as to fear him, to love him, and to give themselves up to be di∣rected by him, for to reap comfort to them∣selves, and to increase the good of Humane So∣ciety. The Advancement of this Kingdome is the proper sphere of a Christian Reformed Magi∣strate: First, as he is Gods Vicegerent over men, as they are in the condition of nature, and In∣habitants of the world. Secondly, as hee is a
Nursing Father to the Church within his do∣minions; to protect it, and provide for it all Outward Helps & Comforts. For his Relation to the World is under God to be their Leader in the things which may settle their Society in Righteousnesse and Love, that every one may be Usefull to his Neighbour by his abilities. And his Relation to the Saints is to bee their Brother and Fellow-servant in the Kingdome of Christ for the Glory of God their Common Father in Him. By the Communion of Saints, which is called Generall, is understood the administration of Grace through that entercourse of Love and Care for mutuall good in Spirituall and Tem∣porall things which ought to bee amongst the Members of Christs Body visible, that every one may reap the fruit of other gifts freely for his edification in knowledge and in vertue; and that all receiving each other to the Glory of Christ, even as Christ received Ʋs unto the Glory of his Father, the common Burdens of all may be borne by every one, and the common Ene∣mies of all, opposed by the joint strength of the whole Body at once. To entertain this Communion is the proper
work of faithfull Ministers of the Gospel, who walking before others according to the Rule of the New-Creature without partiality deny themselves; and holding forth the word of Life unto all, labour without prejudice to provoke every one unto Love and to good Workes without giving offence unto any. So then by these Two States whereof the one relates the Outward, the other the Inward man directly; yet neither separate in their rela∣tions from the other; all the Glory of Gods goodnesse is by certain degrees to be advanced to such as are capable therof. The Apostle saith, That which is Naturall is first, and then afterward that which is Spirituall; therfore the Magistrates Administration in the first place is to bee orde∣red for the Outward Things of this life, and first to the Naturall and then towards the Spi∣rituall Man, and afterward in the Second place the Ministers Administration for Spirituall Things is to be ordered, first towards those that are at home, and within the Houshold of Faith, and then also towards others, that are abroad and without the same.
Of the Second. IN the next place the particular Duties wher∣by these Aimes in each State may bee gained, come into Consideration, We shall onely name them to shew the Order wherein they should be ranked in the thoughts of those that are a∣bout to settle a wel-reformed State, and to dis∣cover the Perfections which in their Order they will adde unto the Happinesse of our in∣tended Reformation, if they be carefully atten∣ded. Now as both States by their Aimes answer the Manifestation of Gods Glory, so by their Duties they answer and reach at their Aimes; and as their Aimes in their direct relations to∣wards their proper Objects are distinct from each other, and yet in their Collaterall respects are not separate but stand United together, so their Duties are in some things severall and di∣stinct, and in some things to bee united and jointly performed, though each doth act in his owne Sphere differently. The State then of the Magistrate as a Magi∣strate doth bear the sword of Justice to execute wrath upon evill doers, which sinne against the
Lawes and Light of Nature: and he beareth the Scepter of Authority to reward and encourage those that doe well according to the same light and lawes. And if hee doth understand that his Calling doth bind him not onely to resist and banish evill out of the Common-wealth, but in it to further and maintain all that is good: then his Care and Duty should bee not onely to rule Men, so as he doth finde them, but hee should looke upon their wayes, to order them, so as they should be, to become partakers of that Happinesse which this life doth affoord, wher∣unto he is bound to give them addresse. His Duty then is to look unto all, as well to the direction of the Young ones, as of those that are of Age, both in respect of their Civill and of their Religious Publick walking. His Duty towards the Young ones; it is to Order the Meanes of their Education aright, to which effect he should see Schools opened, pro∣vided with Teachers, endued with Mainte∣nance, regulated with Constitutions, and hee should have Inspectors and Overseers to looke to the observance of good Orders in this busi∣nesse. The Schools should be of Foure severall
Kinds or Degrees. The First for the Vulgar, whose life is to be Mechanicall. The Second for the Gentry and Nobles, who are to beare Char∣ges in the Commonwealth. The Third for Scho∣lars, who are to teach others Humane Arts and Sciences. And the Fourth for the sons of the Prophets, who are a Seminary of the Ministery. And the right Ordering of these Schooles is to bee lookt upon as the Maine Foundation of a Reformed-Common-wealth, without which no other work of Reformation will ever bee effe∣ctuall. His Duty towards those that are of Age is to see that none who have strength and abili∣ties for employment, be without some profita∣ble Worke, and none that want strength and abilities to work for themselves, bee without necessary relief. And to fulfill this part of his Duty, all Vul∣gar Trades belonging to Husbandry, to Manu∣factures, to Merchandize and Commerce by Sea or Land in the severall kindes of Usefull Com∣modities; or employments about Commodities and all Honorable Offices and Charges belon∣ging to the Common-wealth in Generall, or to any part of it in Country and City in Particu∣lar;
are to bee ranked in their proper places: and all the Unlawfull and Unprofitable Ways whereby Men or Women get a livelihood, or spend their time in Idleness, in riot and vanity, are to be taken notice of; that such Employ∣ments as foment naughty Superfluities causing Pride and Sin to abound in a Nation, or such persons as live disorderly, and cannot be redu∣ced to any certain Employment, may be bani∣shed the Common-wealth, Even as weeds are to be rooted up and cast out of a fruitfull gar∣den. Then to such as are not able, for Age or otherwise to entertaine any Employment, if they be poore, relief is due unto them; and the Rules by which Hospitalls are to bee ordered aright, will be of singular Use in the Reforma∣tion of this State. The Duty of the Magistrate towards the Religious Conversation of his Subjects, is in this: That open Contempt of Religion and Profanenesse be restrained, That the Publike Ministery be Protected from injury, Preserved from contempt, and Maintained comfortably; and that a just Liberty of Conscionable Pro∣fession be not denyed to such as walke orderly
in the things wherein they differ from others about Religion. Here then some Wayes of Conference and Rules of Vnblamable behaviour are to bee de∣termined and authorized, for the preservation of Love, and of the Unity of the Spirit; and for the avoiding of endlesse and quarrelling Dis∣putes. The Duties whereby the Generall Commu∣nion of Saints is to bee entertained, belonging to the Charge of Ministery more particularly, are either such as relate the Society of Mini∣sters amongst themselves, or such as relate all other Professors, or such as relate the state of the Gospel abroad. Towards their fellow-Ministers their Duty is to stand united in Love, and to walk by Con∣junction of Counsels in matters of Ministeriall Concernment; and to that effect to keep the times of appointed Meetings for Mutuall Edi∣fication in the charge of Gods House. Towards all other Professors, their Duty is, as free from all to become servants unto all, to gaine every one in their severall degrees of growth and religious standing. Towards the State of the Gospel in Foraine
Parts their Duty is, to listen after the Welfare of the Churches; to lay the Common Interest thereof to heart; to Concurre with them in Prayers, in Counsell and Assistance for their Comfort; and to this effect, upon informations received from abroad, to Contribute the fruit of all their abilities, as shall bee expedient or necessary for the Common Cause of Religion, to maintain the Peace and Prosperity thereof. These are the Heads of Duties wherby each State should attend his own charge, and reach his proper Aime by himself; there be Objects of concurrence in Duties wherein both States should Consult and Co-operate jointly for mu∣tuall assistance in things which cannot bee well effected by either apart. Those are, 1 The Reforming, Ordering and Constitu∣ting of Schooles. 2 The setling of Courses to Prevent or Re∣medy Publike Scandals and disturbances of the Peace in matters of Religious Concernments. 3 The maintaining of the Liberties which are void of offence in such as differ and walke orderly for Edification. 4 The Advancement of Publike Helpes to Knowledge, and encouragements to Vertue to∣wards
those that are within the Kingdome. 5 The Propagation of the Gospel towards those that are without, and void of the know∣ledge of Christ, as Jewes, Turks, and Heathens. 6 The Entertaining of Brotherly Correspon∣dency, Intelligence and Commerce with Neighbour-Churches, to trade in Spirituall Matters with them; for the Enlargement of Christs Kingdome, and the support of his Truth against the Enemies thereof. Of the Third. THe Third Thing to bee opened in this Matter is to shew, that as the Aime of the Magistracy and Ministery in their severall Spheres, doth oblige them to intend the per∣formance of these Duties in order to the Mani∣festation of Gods Glory; so all the Meanes whereby they are inabled to effect the work it self are in their hands; so that nothing is wan∣ting but the Actual Contrivance of the Course, which may be followed in applying their Abi∣lities unto these their proper Uses. This Means is the power of the Parliament, able to set them∣selves and all others in such a way of Acting for
the Publike Good, as is most expedient for their owne Happinesse. It is needlesse to speake of the Al-sufficiency of Humane Abilities bestow∣ed upon this Parliament by the blessing of God for our Reformation. It is evident that our Leaders now fitting in it, have received from Him all Right and Supreame Authority to Or∣der all things without controule within this Kingdom. This their Right and Authority is setled upon the Undoubted faithfulnesse and fulness of Counsel, which is in their Assembly; and is backed with all Competency of outward Meanes and Instruments; to attend the execu∣tion of their decrees, which this Nation is fur∣nished withall, as much as any in the World. Nor is there any Power apparent, or in being, able to let or hinder any thing, which upon ma∣ture Deliberation they shall determine to bee done. They are not limited to any Objects of Deliberation, but such as they shall propose unto themselves; and such no doubt they will take readily into consideration, which shall be offered unto them, by fit Instruments, and in a fit way for the best Ends: Therefore if these Objects can be but fitly insinuated unto those that are most Conscionable, grave and zealous
for the Publike Good and Glory of this Nati∣on, that by their Meanes others may bee seaso∣ned throughly with this necessity of Aiming at such a Reformation (as being the Main Service wherunto God doth call Us at this time) and if upon such an effectuall insinuation the Way to introduce and settle by little and little the per∣formance and execution of these Duties by Authority of Parliament, can be proposed void of all exception; there is no cause to doubt of the successe of this Enterprise in due time. All the matter of difficulty will bee in these Two Things: First, How to make the Proposall free from Prejudice, and from the respects of Hu∣mane Partiality. And Secondly, How to bring the Way of Deliberating upon these matters in the Houses; into a just frame and course, which may at fit seasons and intervalls be con∣tinued and renewed to carry on the Designe with that stedfastnesse which the importance of the Worke deserveth. And truly whether we look upon God, or upon the Work, or upon our Unsetled Condition, or upon the Parlia∣ment and the Power and Abilities in it, which are under God to be the Meanes of our Happy Settlement, there can be nothing conceived or
proposed of greater importance, and more be∣fitting the thoughts of Wise and Conscionable Men in Parliament, then the Determination of these Duties. If therefore any respect either to God, or to Our selves, or to Posterity, can raise Mens thoughts above Particular and Pri∣vate Interests, to minde the settlement of a Publike Good, in a Way which is unblamable, the worth of these Duties, and the obligation whereby God doth engage Us all, but chiefly our Leaders to desire the fulfilling of them, should raise both their and our thoughts to the entertaining of such deliberations, Cer∣tainly Gods Aime in bestowing upon Us this Parliament, and upon the Parliament all Power and Ability to Act whatever it will in the King∣dom, is none other then this, to make them and Us, under Himself Instrumentall in Our owne Felicity, by serving him in his Kingdom: but if we should not care to minde the settlement of his Kingdome amongst Us, are we not unwor∣thy of all these blessings? And shal they not be taken from Us deservedly? if wee serve our selves only; or a particular Party of Men which wee affect; with our Interest in the Publike Power; and if we make Use of the Means which
we are intrusted withall, and set our thoughts onely to finde Wayes thereby to make Our selves and Our Party great; we shall be found in the day of Accounts Unfaithfull Stewards, and naughty Servants to so good a Lord and Ma∣ster: For it is most Undeniably apparent, that these fore-mentioned Duties are the true and proper Workes of his service whereunto wee are called: and the onely Meanes to deliver Us from the danger of our Confusions, will bee to Deliberate maturely of the performance ther∣of. Therefore as Mordecai said to Ester in ano∣ther case, so we may say with a small charge of the expression, to those that fit in Parliament, He said to her, And who knoweth whether thou art come to the Kingdome for such a time as this? But we must say to Our Senators, And Who knoweth not, that the Kingdome is come unto You for such a Work as this? Therefore You are bound to mind it, and use Meanes to ad∣vance it; and if You will not, know neverthe∣lesse that this dispensation is committed unto You; and that God will find some others to do this Work without You; but that You and the People which is led out of this Way, will cer∣tainly be destroyed. But wee will cheerfully
Hope, and by the Grace of God confidently Expect that upon a more full discovery and faithfull Insinuation of the Way How to proceed in the prosecution of this Enterprize: there will bee ho neglect in the Undertaking, nor impediment in the execution. Let Us then proceed to the Fourth and Last Point in hand, to shew How the Parliament should apply their Authority, Counsell and Abilities, to the ac∣complishment of these Duties; and this we shal intend to doe (if God permit) by shewing the true Contrivement, the right Use, and the In∣credible Advantages and Benefits of an Office of Publike Addresse, which may be easily and without delay erected and set afoot among Us. Of the Fourth. THe Honourable House of Parliament are the Great Committee of the whole King∣dom for the Universall Reformation ther∣of: and by the Deputation of Power given to them in their Members, from every part of the Kingdom, the whole Power of all is contracted in their Body, as in the Headship of the Nati∣on; for Counsell and Justice, and from thence
all Power hath again an influence upon every part of the Kingdome as need required. Now by vertue of this Supremacy or Power summed up in them, and in reference to the necessity of things to bee done under them; they have a right to confer Power, and make Deputations of Authority unto others to Act for a Refor∣mation, so as by them they shal be directed: nor is it lawfull for any without leave and commis∣sion from them, to act towards a Reformation in a Publike Way; so that properly the Worke of Reformation is radically seated in the Body of the Houses, and no Committee can bee with any just title termed a Committee for Refor∣mation, but the Houses themselves, because none have any right to minde and act a Refor∣mation in the Generall but They. Yet this not∣withstanding it is Lawful no doubt for all Men to entertaine the thoughts and wishes of a Ge∣nerall Reformation; and would to God every one in his place were acting something, as a pre∣parative towards it, more then seemes to be intended. If then it should be moved, that the Houses would depute some of their Mem∣bers (without excluding any from partaking of the same cares) to mind not so much a particu∣lar
Taske in the Work of Reformation (which is Ordinary in the appointment of all Commit∣tees) as to seek out the Generall Rules and Ma∣ximes by which the Course of a setled Refor∣mation should be steered & guided at all times: that those Maximes might be proposed and de∣bated in the Houses, and laid as Grounds of the Righteous Wayes by which all their Govern∣ment is to be established under God: I suppose it would bee a great advantage both to their proceedings in Counsel, and to the direction of all such as being subordinate unto their Power, desire to act knowingly according to their just intentions. For the Main Fundamentall Rules of all just proceedings once being setled and received; not only the Subordinate Agents, but the Senators themselves in doubtfull Cases of Advice, will be therby able to find Light what to resolve upon; and in dark matters of Judge∣ment they will be directed thereby, What Sen∣tence to give Conscionably according to their own Uncontroulable Principles. This Committee for Rules of Reformation should have power, and be ordered to call unto them for Consultation the most Learned, God∣ly, and Experienced Divines of the Kingdome;
whether in or out of the Assembly; to put them upon the thoughts of Resolving such Queries and Doubts from the Word of God and cleer Principles of Reason, as they shall think fit to propose unto them for the framing of those Maximes of Reformation, which they shall prepare to be proposed unto the Houses; to be upon debate received, as Universall Rules to walk by, in the pursuit of such an Evangelicall Settlement and Reformation as wee should now aime at. And although Men be never so able in Parts, never so much read in all Authors, never so deeply grounded in all Sciences, never so large∣ly experienced in all Affairs, and never so much seen in all the World, and consequently every way as much qualified as men can be for a work of such high Consequence as this will be to this State; yet except they have some helps to ena∣ble them, to look upon Matters neer at hand, & with some speciall relation to the changes of Times, Things, Persons, and Occasions, where∣unto their endeavours are to be applyed (that they may discern the native properties thereof by all Circumstances discoverable) they wil be but like Physitians, who without regard to the
particular Symptomes of their Patient, pre∣scribe a generall Remedy for the disease, which seldome is effectuall to work a good or speedy Cure; and if it doth any good, it is to be ascri∣bed rather to chance then wisdome. For the Theoretical part of general Rules may by Men of abilities bee delivered at large, but to make these Practically appliable for the Main End of an Effectuall Reformation unto a State that is lyable (as all States are) unto perpetuall chan∣ges, is the Matter, which the Wisdome of this Committee should mainly apply themselves unto, which necessarily requires a speciall In∣sight and Discovery of Affaires neer at hand. Therefore if to these Men, and to all others of the Parliament that desire to looke fully and fundamentally into the Affaires of this King∣dom, and of this Church in al the Members and Motions therof, and into the Affairs of Neigh∣bour Churches and States as they may relate towards these, to be able to Compare and lay things together: (If I say, to these Men) a Help can be given whereby they shall be inabled to look not onely upon the Outward Parts, but as it were, upon the very Anatomy of all the in∣ward bowels of the Church and State as they
are at all times, and from time to time existent, in their native features and lineaments, and up∣on all the Vitall Motions and Actions of these Parts and Bowels; If  say againe, an easie Help can be found for such a discovery, wil it not be an exceeding great advantage to them to open their eyes in al Counsels and Resolutions? Cer∣tainly it will; and such as shall have this insight in matters, will bee able upon all occasions to walke, as it were, at noon day in the light, when others will be constrained to doe things but at randome, and grope in difficult Cases, as it were for the wall at midnight. Now this helpe may be had in an Office of Spirituall and Temporall Addresses, whereunto all Men for their own Convenience, Advantage and Profit, will bee made willing, and invited to repaire as to a Common Center of Repose where∣in they may expect satisfaction for all their Lawfull desires, so much as may be had by any Humane Contrivance in a wel-ordered Com∣mon-wealth. And to make this apparent that an Office may be erected to this effect, which may bee of Infinite Usefulness to the State, and especially to the Work of Reformation, We shall ende∣vour
to set down the Sum of it; together with the right Uses thereof; and the Way by which it may bee established easily and without noise or delay. Of the Office of Addresse. WEE would advice then that a Certaine Place should be designed by the Autho∣rity of the State, whereunto all Men might freely come to give Information of the Commodities which they have to be imparted unto others; and some body should bee set in that Place to receive these Informations to the end that he may give address to every one that shall repaire to him, to make enquiry for such Commodities, Where and How to finde the same. His proper Charge then and Duty should bee to inable himselfe to direct all men to the attainment of such desirable things, as the Soci∣ety of Mankind in the Common-wealth where he lives can comfortably yeeld unto them: so that this Office should bee erected properly for the Relief of Humane Necessities; and to ac∣complish the effect of a wel-ordered Society; that all things which are Usefull and profitable
in a Common-wealth for Publick and Private Accommodation, & the Contentation of Soul or Body, being known where they are to bee found, such as stand in need therof may know whither to repair to get speedy notice therof, how to come by them lawfully. As for example: A man of good parts would fain serve a Master, Hee comes to the Office and enquires whether it knows of any Gentleman that desires a Ser∣vant; if the Register of the Office can tell him of any, he gives him Addresse where to find him: if he can tell him of none, then he should leave his name to be Registred with a Memoriall ex∣pressing his desire, and the place of his abode, and such other Circumstances as he shall thinke fit to inform the Office of, that as soon as any doth inquire for a Man of his quality, hee may be directed to him. In the like manner a Gen∣tleman desires a servant of such and such qua∣lities, hee comes to the Office to inquire after one, and the Master of Addresses should be able to tell him whether or no, and where any is to be found: and in case none is to bee found or known at that present, then the Gentleman leaves a Memoriall to bee kept for an Addresse to any that may afterward present himselfe.
And when these that have made enquiry for some Commodity have gotten it by the Ad∣dresse of the Office, they should bee obliged within the space of 24 houres to give notice thereof unto the Office; that the Register may be disburdened of their Memoriall, lest some body be addressed in vaine unto them. Suppose a Man would let out his house or his ground at a certain rent, or sell it, another would faine take a house or parcell of ground for rent, or buy it; both these run up and down, and make enquirie here and there at adventures for that which they want, and perhaps never light one upon another, till the convenient season bee past, and they for want of Accommodation have taken some courses lesse advantageous for their Affaires, then their mutuall encounter would have been; but if the Master of Addresse had been informed of both their desires, hee would have instantly directed the one of them to the other, by which meanes both would have been accommodated. And thus in all other Cases Whatsoever, which fal within the Com∣passe of Humane Conveniences, which the So∣ciety of Men in a Common-wealth can affoord for Contentation of the mind in Spirituall or
Bodily Concernments. From whence we may see that such an Office wil be the onely Proper Remedy and Help to that disorderly and con∣fused condition of Life wherin we may lye for want of profitable Contrivements begetting sociable encounters and communications. And if we will consider, that nothing doth make na∣ture fruitfull in all things, but the onely Ad∣dresse of Proper Agents to their Patients to cause them meet seasonably together; and that nothing doth cause Trade flourish in great Ci∣ties, so much as the Use of Exchanges and Meeting Places, where Merchants may come together at certain times to transact Matters; and that without this Contrivement of Mutual Converse, all Trade would bee so clogged and retarded, that it would be almost impossible to bring businesses to any issue Conveniently and in due time: If,  say, we consider this, we shall find that what Conveniency the Use of Ex∣change-meetings doth bring to a Particular sort of Men who are called Merchants; the same, and farre greater will this Office bring to the whole Society of all Men, for all their Mutuall Occasions and Accommodations wherein they have need to incounter with one another; so
that this Office will be a Center of all Mens sa∣tisfactions to gaine their Interest in each other for mutuall help. The Advantages which Post-houses and Exchange-places since they have been in Use (for of Old they were not) have brought unto those that trade, and to all Mens private dispatches are almost innumerable; but the Advantages, which such an Office as this is, will bring to the Society of Mankind, will bee altogether innumerable; for all that which is good and desirable in a whole Kingdome may be by this means Communicated unto any one that stands in need thereof; and if it is evident that the benefit of Mutuall Communication in good things is the Chief fruit of all Society; and that to facilitate the Wayes therof unto a Peo∣ple, is one of the Chiefe Duties of a faithfull Magistrate, whereby hee may make himselfe Powerfull, and his People Happy, whereby he may addresse all Men to profitable Employ∣ments; and know what every ones employ∣ments are, and by this Meanes be able to pre∣vent and rectifie an infinite number of disor∣ders which arise in a State to the great disad∣vantage therof, for want of such Employments as the idle People might be put to. Therfore it
belongs to none but to a supreame Magistrate to establish such an Office, and to Order it for the Proper Ends and Uses whereunto it should serve. Let it then have Two Parts or Branches: the One for Bodily, the Other for Spirituall Mat∣ters, and these should have each of them a Warden or Master of their severall Addresses, who should be Regulated and directed in their Ways by such Constitutions and Orders, which should prevent all danger of Abuses, and make them Unblamable and Comfortably Service∣able to every one. The Office of Bodily Addresses, should bee appointed to Meddle with al Outward Things concerning this present life, for the relations of men to each other in worldly Concernments, and may be called the Addresse of Accommoda∣tions. But the Office of Spirituall Addresses should bee appointed to meddle with all In∣ward things concerning the Soules of Men, and the Wayes whereby they may be helpfull one to another in Matters relating the same, which may be called, The Addresse of Communications. Their Main and Proper Objects of Employ∣ment will bee different; but their Ends and
Wayes to doe service will bee the same, and some things Collaterall to their Main Objects, will be common to both, and in these Collate∣rall Matters, they should be appointed to keep Mutuall Correspondency with each other for the Advancement of their Publick Services. The Office-bearer in each of these Offices should be warranted and authorized, each in his Sphere to make Inventaries, and keep Re∣gisters of all Commodities, Persons, Employ∣ments, Offices, Charges and Things which are Actually in being, and Usefully considerable in the Common-wealth, and which may be a mat∣ter of information to any for Addresse to that which hee in any kinde shall enquire after. Of these Inventaries and Registers some should be Perpetuall standing and the same; so farre as the things which they containe are existent in the Common-wealth, but some other Regi∣sters and Bookes must bee kept of Changeable Matters also, wherin daily Occurrences of New Accommodations and Communications to bee imparted from one Man to another, are to bee recorded and kept for Information. These Occasionall Registers (for so they should bee called) should be of Two Sorts; the One Com∣mon
and open to all to be lookt upon, contai∣ning the Summary Intimation of that whereof Information is to be given, to such as shall de∣sire it. The other secret, and reserved for more speciall Use, containing the particular point of that Addresse, which is to bee given to such as stand in need to be informed of it. Besides these Registers which will admit of some further Subdivisions, there must be Alpha∣beticall Tables of the Heads of Matters; wher∣of Informations are to bee given both for Ac∣commodations and Communications, so as may be needfull, which should be openly hung up in the Office-House with a Reference to the Register-bookes: and some of these Tables must be perpetual and standing Unchangeably; Others must bee, as the Occasionall Register-bookes will be, alterable. The Office of Addresse for Accommodati∣ons, although it may be exceeding usefull unto all, and can be prejudiciall to none, if he, that is intrusted therewith, wil not purposely abuse his trust; yet it will bee above all others most usefull for the Poore, to help them to employ∣ment, and to distinguish the Industrious from the Idle: and for the Supreme Magistracy in
all purposes of State, but chiefly in that of a healthfull Reformation: because it may be in his hand (if he will make use of it) an Engine to reduce all into some Order which is confu∣sed; and to discover what the Chief Inconve∣niences of the Subjects are, which are to be Re∣medied, which Two Things are the Pillars of an outward Reformation. The other Particular Uses of this Office of Accommodations, with the Way to Regulate it, to Oversee it, & to Im∣prove the Advantages, which it will yeeld to the State in matters of Publike Consultation, and in Cases of Resolution to bee taken con∣cerning Neighbour Nations in times of Peace and Warre, need not here to be mentioned di∣stinctly. A Man of Wisdome by that which hath been said, will easily discern this, and in due time Particulars may be mentioned, when it shall be requisite. The Office of Addresse for Communicati∣ons, is as far beyond that of Accommodations in Usefulnesse, as the Matters of the Mind are above those of the Body. It is then to bee e∣rected for Addresses and Informations in mat∣ters of Religion, of Learning, and of all Inge∣nuities, which are Objects of Contemplation
and delight unto the Mind, for their strange∣nesse and usefulnesse unto the life of Man. The Warden of this Office should be authorized to have and keep not onely all manner of Regi∣sters, Inventaries, Catalogues and Lists con∣taining the Peculiar Objects wherof he should furnish Information for Addresse to such as shall desire it (such as have been mentioned heretofore, and named, Perpetuall and Occasio∣nall Registers) but hee should bee Authorized also to negotiate for Spirituall Intelligence; and to maintaine a Correspondency and Lear∣ned Trade with all Men of Abilities within and without the Kingdome, about the things belonging to the Sphere of his Office; so that he should be allowed not onely to give Infor∣mation of things elswhere to be found, (which is properly the worke of Common Addresses) but also of that, which should be in his own pe∣culiar Possession and Custody, which he should be allowed to gather up and keep concerning all Matters of Religion, Learning and Ingenu∣ities, as a peculiar Stock belonging to his Of∣fice, to communicate the same by way of Spiri∣tuall Trade and Commerce to whomsoever he should think fit and expedient, onely for
the Ends wherunto his Commerce in this kind is to be directed. Now the Ends should be these: First, in Matters of Religion hee should in∣tend, 1 To Facilitate the Meanes of Recti∣fying Mistakes, and of Preventing the Increase of Divisions and Disorders about Matters of dispute whether in Opinion or Practise. 2 To stirre up and waken the sense and love of Pie∣ty, of Charity, and of the profession of Edify∣ing Knowledge in the Minds of all Men with∣out partiality. Secondly, in Matters of Humane Sciences, the End of his Negotiation should be, 1 To put in Practice the Lord Verulams Designati∣ons, De Augmentis Scientiarum, amongst the Learned. 2 To help to perfit Mr. Comenius Undertakings, chiefly in the Method of Teaching, Languages, Sciences, and of Orde∣ring Schooles for all Ages and Qualities of Scholars. Thirdly, in the Matters of Ingenuity his End should be to offer the most profitable In∣ventions which he should gaine, unto the be∣nefit of the State, that they might he Publikely made use of, as the State should think most ex∣pedient.
And that he may bee able to proceed cleer∣ly and worke toward these Ends effectually, Certain Rules and Directions should bee given him, whereby he should be instructed and ob∣liged to walke in his Calling Unpartially, and answerable to the Scope of Common Edi∣fication. So then his Office of Communication should be made a Center and Meeting-place of Advices, of Proposalls, of Treaties and of all Manner of Intellectuall Rarities freely to bee given and received, to and from, by and for all such as may think themselves concerned to re∣ceive or to give notice of the best Helpes and Overtures, and of the most Profitable Under∣takings, Discoveries, and Occurences; wherby Godlinesse, Truth, and Peace, and all the Ways and Means tending to the harmlesse Advance∣ment of Divine and Humane Wisdome and Perfections may be set forward in Church and Common-wealth. His way of Negotiating should be free and obliging, hee should make his Addresse to∣wards all that are of eminent Parts, or of any singular Abilities and Straines; whether in Publike Places or not; within or without the Kingdome; to give them some Objects to
work upon, and exercise their faculties in; that the gifts of one may be provoked and stirred up by another, according to the difference or similitude of their Straines; to the end that all Knowledge may abound in Love, and the discovery of one Truth may beget ano∣ther. Thus Forainers may be made partakers of Domestick, and such as are at home, of Forain Straines; that all may in their severall Abilities be set a worke, and contribute unto the Stock of Learning, that which may be use∣full to every one, in their severall Occasions: And amongst all other his speciall Correspon∣dency should bee with the Chiefe Library-keepers of all places, whose proper employ∣ments should bee to Trade for the Advanta∣ges of Learning and Learned Men in Bookes, and M. S. to whom he may apply himselfe to become beneficiall, that such as Mind the End of their employment may reciprocate with him in the way of Communication. But to improve the fruit of this Agency, both for the Advancement of our owne Reformation, and for the Generall Advance∣ment of Learning; hee should bee obliged from time to time:
First, to impart the Profit of all his Pur∣chases, and the Substance of all his discove∣ries (especially concerning Religion, and State or Church Government) unto the Committee for Rules of Reformation; whose Wisdome should direct them to revise every two or three Moneths once; the State of his Negotiation, to take the creame of it for their Use, and to direct him in the prosecuting of his Purchases and Communications, for the better Advantage of the Publique. Then Secondly, hee should yearly once at a certaine time bee obliged to give up the ac∣count of his Annuall Negotiation, to the Professors of all Sciences in both Universi∣ties, and to the Heads and Masters of Colled∣ges and Halls, who should bee made a Speci∣all Committee and appointed, according to their severall Faculties, or all jointly to meet, and to take into Consideration the things which he shall produec that such peeces as shal deserve to bee put into the Publike Libraries, to bee made Common unto Scholars, or other∣wise published in Print for the benefit of eve∣ry one, may by their advice bee applyed unto their proper Uses; for the advancement of
Divine and Humane Learning, according to the Counsell and Designe of the Lord Veru∣lam, to whose structure, by their joint advice, every yeare some stones should bee added. And to this effect a more speciall Way of Concurrence and Correspondency amongst the Professors and Heads of Colledges them∣selves should in due time bee contrived and proposed. Hitherto wee have considered these Offices of Addresse in their Intrinsecall Frame and Usefulnesse, whereby they may bee servicea∣ble unto all degrees and qualities of Persons; but especialy unto the designes which the Par∣liament should Advance for our compleate Reformation: Now one word more is to bee added concerning the Extrinsecall Frame and Constitution thereof, and then We have done. In the Affaires of this world, where Instru∣ments and Agents must be employed, nothing can bee done without Expences. Men must live in the Body, and Money must answer for all; nor can those that serve the Publick (al∣though they may bestow freely their owne paines, without cost to the Publique, yet they cannot command others) without Meanes
maintaine those whom they must set a worke, and without whose helpe the businesse can∣not proceed. Therefore as it is just, so it is necessary that the Employments which re∣dound to the benefit of all, should be maintai∣ned by Publick Revenues. And as there is no Charity so commendable, as that which reacheth unto All, and doth con∣ferre or procure the benefits which without all comparison are the best, so there is no∣thing so answerable to the Duty, and so commendable in the care of a Christian Magi∣strate, as to bestow his Charity upon such Objects. And although the maintaining of these Offices of Addresse in one respect may bee commended to the State, as the greatest Worke of Charity, which can bee bestowed upon the whole Nation, that is upon them∣selves in their Members, yet in another re∣spect the Charges which will bee laid out this way by them, will bee found the most profi∣table and richest Trade that they can drive, to increase their owne worldly Substance: For it will direct them both to preserve without losse, and mannage all that they have within the Kingdome to the best advantage; and al∣so
to increase their Stock every way by all the Negotiations which are afoot amongst their Subjects, within themselves, or towards their Neighbour Nations. So then there is nothing more Just, nothing more Charitable, and nothing more Profitable in order to Trade it self, then to bestow that cost which will bee necessary to maintaine these Offices, and the Agents belonging unto them. The First Thing then which is to bee be∣stowed upon them, is a House in a place which shall bee found for each of them most conve∣nient. And for the Addresse of Accomodati∣ons, no doubt London will bee the most Cen∣trall place. But for the Addresse of Communi∣cations, Oxford should bee made the Center, besides other Reasons for this, because the Great Library being there, more Strangers for it resort thither, and the Keeper thereof may bee a great helpe unto the Negotiation of the Warden of Addresses for Spirituall Matters. The Warden of the London Office should bee furnished with a House and Meanes to set up and furnish his Office with all Necessa∣ries; to him Maintenance should bee allowed to attend his Charge without distraction; and
because his worke will be principally to over∣see his Clerkes, and to make Observations of Matters fit for the States benefit and Informa∣tion; he should be free from all other Employ∣ments, except that which is proper and subor∣dinate unto the Charge of Addresses, or Col∣laterall thereunto in the Way of Trading and Employing People that are out of employ∣ment. His Clerkes may be sworne unto Him, and Hee to the State, to bee faithfull accor∣ding to the directions which should bee given him. The Clerkes should have some Compe∣tency allowed them, that without incroaching upon the Subject, or burdening the worke of Addresse, they may be able to live; and if any benefit bee allowed them out of the Worke which they doe, it should bee no more at the most, but a penny or two, for some Extract in Writing, to bee given in matters of profit, by such as are rich; but to the Poore all is to bee done freely; and if any Clerke bee convicted to have refused to communicate the Addresse which shall bee desired of him by any, hee shall bee most severely punished and lose his place without mercy. And as the Warden of Addresses for Accommodation is over his
Clerkes, so over Him some others should have an inspection to this intent, to see Matters carryed faithfully and truly for the Publique Good, to helpe the Warden with Advice and Counsell in Cases of Importance; and to con∣sider the Occasions of his Ordinary and Extra∣ordinary Expences (if any should be for the State) that some way may bee thought on to refound the same unto Him, as is just, and to this effect some Revenue of the State should be nam to beare such burdens. The Warden of the Oxford Office may have some Colledge or Hall appointed for his Of∣fice-place; and the Revenues thereof for his maintenance to support him in his Charge. His Clerkes that keep his Registers, should bee maintained under him, and also such as he shall have need of for his Negotiation to Copie out Matters, to write Letters for Correspondency as hee shall direct them; and to give Extracts freely to all such as hee shall appoint them to give unto. And as without his knowledge and appoint∣ment the Clerkes for his peculiar Negotiation should not bee permitted to impart any thing to any, so the other Clerkes must be obliged
to deny nothing unto any that shall desire In∣formation of things Contained in the Standing and Occasionall Registers. The Extraordinary Expences which he shal bring to the States account, the Committee of Professors and Heads of Colledges shall consi∣der and allow to bee paid, as they shall see Cause, out of some Revenue which may bee designed for such an Use. And seeing there can be nothing proposed of a more Publique and Usefull nature, then this worke is; We sup∣pose it would bee an injury done to the zeale and integrity of this Parliament, which hath received so many blessings at Gods hand, which is so deeply engaged to his service; and which hath undertaken so great things, and so succes∣fully advanced our Reformation so far hither to; to think that such an Enterprise as this, will not finde favour in their eyes, and sufficient Meanes to support the Charges necessary for the Undertaking and prosecuting thereof. For suppose the Charges should bee farre greater then at first they need to bee (because a small foundation may give a beginning to this work) yet what difficulty can there bee to allow them, where so many and large Revenues are
by Gods Providence for such Ends abundant∣ly put into their hands, and cannot justly bee otherwise disposed of then to Publique Uses? The Ecclesiastical Estates and Revenues, which are so Vast, and now to bee disposed of, to what Publique Uses can they bee more pro∣fitably applyed, then to the Advancement of the Wayes of Piety and Learning? And if in processe of time the Occasions in this Worke of Publike Expences grow greater (as no doubt they will, when the Communication be∣ing inlarged, the benefit thereof will invite all the Learned to a Concurrence) then also more Meanes may be raised to beare the same, which divers wayes may bee effected; whereof wee shall not need to speak; but to make Way for the increase of a Competent Stock hereafter in due time, Feoffees in trust may bee appointed by the Houses, to receive such Legacies, Do∣nations and Contributions which will cheer∣fully proceed from the Charity and zeal of the Lovers of Religion and Learning towards the Maintenance of a Trade for the Advancement of the same. Now to have the matter carryed on easily and without delay. It should bee imparted
unto all, or as many as are eminently and truly zealous for the Glory of God, that are free from Selfe-ends and partiality, and that Love Learning, and have power with o∣thers in the Houses. If not all, but onely three or foure of these bee throughly pos∣sessed with this designe, and they can bee brought to lay their Heads together, to move for the Erecting of such an Office in the Houses, and get the Contrivement ther∣of Referred unto some few, who for Pie∣ty, Prudency, and Learning are most com∣mendable unto all, no doubt the thing may bee speedily brought to passe, and a founda∣tion laid, which by the accomplishment of our Reformation will bee a blessing unto all Poste∣rity: Whereunto our prayers shall be offered as a daily Sacrifice, and what else God shall in∣able us to contribute; to whom the successe of all our Wishes is to bee referred in Christ; to Him bee Glory and Honour for ever. Amen. Psal. 50.23. Hee that Ordereth his Conversation aright, shall see the Salvation of God.

THE PERFECT Weekely Account: Containing, Certain Special and Remarkable Passages from both Houses of PARLIAMENT; And Collections of severall Letters from the Armies. From Wednesday May 19. to Wednesday the 26. of May. 1647. WEDNESDAY, May 19. ONe evill drives forward a∣nother, as one wave fol∣lowes another, troubles are alwayes present, and the shadow of what is good deceiveth us: It is the custome of the vul∣gar sort to despise the present, desire the future praise, and extoll that which is past.

These, or any five of them, are a Committee for relief of such persons, in such cases aforesaid. Thursday May 20. In my last I made mention of a Letter that came from the King, concerning his Answer to the Proportions, which being the substant all part of the Letter, I shall not vary from the words I received it, viz. C. R. In answer to all the Propositions concerning Religion, His Maj. proposeth that he wil confirme the Presby∣teriall Government, the Assembly of Divines at West∣minster, and the Directory, for three yeares, being the time set downe by the two Houses, so that His Maj. & His Houshold be not hindred from that forme of Gods Service which they formerly had; And also, that a free consultation and debate be had with the Divines at West∣minster (twenty of His Maj. nomination being added un∣to them) whereby it may be determined by His Maj. & the two Houses, how the Church shall be governed af∣ter
the said three yeares or sooner, if differences may be agreed. Touching the Covenant, His Maj. is not yet therein satisfied, and desires to respite His particular an∣swer thereunto untill His comming to London, because it being a matter of conscience he cannot give a resoluti∣on therein till he may be assisted with the advice of some of His owne Chaplains, which have hitherto bin denied him and then he will make cleerly appear, both his zeale to the Protestant Profession and the Union of those two Kingdomes, which he conceives to be the maine drift of this Covenant. To the 7. & 8. Propositions, his Majesty will consent, to the 9. His Majesty doubts not but to give good satisfaction, when he shall be particularly informed how the said penalties shall be levied & disposed of To the 10 His Maj. Answer is, That he hath bin alwayes ready to prevent the practises of Papists, & therefore is content to passe an Act of Parl. for that purpose &c His Maj. will give his consent to the Act for the due observation  the Lords Day, for the suppressing of Innovations, and those con∣cerning the preaching of Gods Word &  Non Resi∣dence & Pluralities and his Majesty will yeeld to such Act or Acts, as shall be requisite to raise monies for the payment and satisfying all publike debts, expecting also that his will bee therein included. As to the Proposition touching the Militia, though his Maj. consent unto it in terminis as it is proposed, because thereby he conceives, he wholly parts with the power of the Sword entru∣sted to him by God & the Lawes of the Land, for the protect∣ion & government of his People, therby at once divesting him∣selfe, & dis-inheriting his Posterity of that right & prerogative of the Crown which is absolutely necessary to the Kingly of∣fice, and so weaken monarchy in this Kingdom, that little more then the name & shadow of it will remain: yet if it will bee only security for the preservation of the peace of the kingdom after the unhappy troubles, & the due performance of all the a∣greements which are now to be concluded (which is desired) which his Maj. always understood to be the case, & hopes that herein he is not mistaken, his Maj. will give abundant satisfact∣ion,
to which end he is willing by Act of Parl. That the whole power of the Militia both by Sea & Land for the space of ten yeares be in the hands of such persons as the two houses shall nominate, & afterwards to return to the proper channel again, as it was fn the times of Q. Eliz. & K. Iames of blessed memory. His Maj. therefore desires, that his two houses of Parlia∣ment would seriously descend into these considerations, and likewise tenderly look upon his condition herein, & the perpetuall dishonour that must cleave to him, if Hee shall thus abandon so many persons of Condition and Fortune that have ingaged themselves with & for Him, out of a sence of Duty, and propounds as a very accepta∣ble testimony of their affection towards him, That a ge∣nerall Act of Oblivion and free Pardon bee forthwith passed by Act of Parliament. Concerning the Officers mentioned in the 19. Article. His Majesty when he shall come to Westminster, wil gra∣tifie his Parliament all that possibly hee may, without destroying the alterations which are necessary for the Crown. His Majesty will willingly consent to the Act for the confirmation of the Priviledges and Customes of the City of London, and all that is mentioned in the Propositions for their particular advantage. This day the Commons had a large debate on the Pe∣tition I mentioned in my last, and it was voted that the said Petition should be burnt on Satturday next, in the Pallace Yard, at Westminster, and against the Royall Exchange London. And it was voted that a VVarrant should issue to the Sheriffes accordingly. This day the Committee it Goldsmiths Hal made re∣port to the House, concerning the Compositions of Mr. Perey, Mr. Kercher, and Mr. Trinenlet which were confi∣ned by the House.
The Kings Letter being taken into consideration by the house of Peeres, a vote passed that his Maj. shall come to Oat∣lands, so soon as the house can be made ready, and that the con∣currence of the house of Commons be desired, &c. Fryday May 21. This day we received the result of the Army, or the Soldiers Reply to Field-Marshal Gen Skippon, the heads whereof I shal here give you, viz. FIrst, that whereas it pleases the honourable houses of Parl. upon misinformation falsly suggested unto them, to declare and immediatly publish in print to the Kingdome, that the Petition of the Army, being but on∣ly an intention, did tend to put the Army into a distem∣per and mutiny, to obstruct the relief of Ireland, and to put conditions upon the Parl. and declaring the Petitio∣ners, if they shall proceed therein, no lesse then enemies to the State, and disturbers to the Publique Peace, which said heavie charge remaining upon record, as a Memo∣randum of infamy upon us to posterity; we cannot chuse but be deeply sensible therof, and with amazement, won∣der how so humble and innocent adresse, intented to the Generall, could beget so strange an interpretation, 2. That whereas those persons that have attempted to beget and attempt and foment divisions betweene the Parl. and their Army, by their surrepticious obtaining & misrepresenting our Petitions, and by producing other scandalous Letters from unknown hands by them pro∣duced, the Authors whereof are concealed, & not brought forth to make a judiciall proofe of those things laid to our charge, which we cannot but look upon as a just cause of griefe, that the suggestors of such untruths seeme to be incouraged, and we who are innocent remain unjusti∣fied.
4. That divers Officers of the Army of publike and known integrity, have bin (upon what grounds we know not) sent for to the Parl. as delinquents; Some wherof do at this present attend there, and cannot procure a tryall, having nothing considerable laid to their charge, &c. 4. That whereas we understand that the Parl. hath vo∣ted a sudden disbanding of the Army, not having made sufficient provision for the auditing of our arreares, and stating of our accounts, our own reason, and experience of others, makes us sensible, how difficult, chargeable, & uncertain the obtaining thereof will be after our disban∣ding, and therefore justly make us sensible thereof. 5. That they stand in sear of being prest, &c. 6. They desire that the Parl. Declaration, in respect of freedome to those that were Apprentices, may be put in force against such masters as refuse it. 7. That widdowes who have lost their husbnds, and children their parents in this service, are not sufficiently provided for a future livelyhood. 8. That notwithstanding the great care of the Com∣mittee and Treasures of the Army, and the cheerfull rea∣dinesse of most Counties for the paying of Assesments, as those where we now quarter do affirme, neverthelesse the private souldiers are necessitated to take free quarter for the present, which is very irksome unto us to bee so burdensome to our friends. The house of Commons taking the premises into considera∣tion, passed several votes to this effect, viz, 1. That the Souldiers arrears shall be speedily audited▪ &c. 2. That the Ordinances concerning Prentices shall be made good. 3. That an Ordinance shall be drawn up, to exempt those from pressing for any forraign service, which have voluntarily served the Parliament in the late wars. 4. That an Ordinance shall be brought in for main∣tenance of maymed Soldiers, widowes, &c. and as to the point of vin∣dication, and other things, the House ordered to debate the same on Tuesday next.
Satturday, This day the house sate not, and for the Intelli∣gence abroad, we will refer you to Munday. Munday By Letters from Ireland, we received a ratification of some good services lately performed by the L. Inchiqueene, as his taking of Dromany, Caperqueen, & Dungarvan, in which he had Ammunition & other good prize, besides many brave head of cattel which he took from the Rebels. But on the other side its certified, the Rebels are exceedingly inraged that Dub∣lin is in the power of the Parliament Forces, & that there was lately a plot betwixt them & some Irish in the City of Dublin to have betrayed the same; for which design being discovered, 14. Irish were lately hanged in Dublin. They have taken Carlos 30. miles from Dublin, and are in hopes to draw neerer it, if not timely prevented. Out of Scotland we understand, that Lieut. ly makes his neer approaches on the Enemies quarters, he season now affording forrage for his horses, we are likely to heare of action shortly. A Letter was intercepted (& brought up to the Par.) going to the King from Mr. Ashburnham his Majestie guide wher∣in he adviseth the King nt to make any absolute agreement with the Parl offering seerall reasons both from and the neere agreement of peace there is between France & Spain, by which meanes the King mght asure himself of a great Army. His Excellency Sir T. Fairfax is returned from London to his head∣quarters, where his Officers met him, greatly congratulating his coming down to them▪ we are further certified from thence that the Army is in a very mild & peaceable condition, keeping good order and discipline, and read, to obey command from their Superiours. Thus have you this Weekly Account of The severall Votes of the House, in answer to the complaints and a grievances of the Army, and other further proceedings touching their vindication. The Copy of the Kings Letter to the Parlament, And a Letter of advce to his Majesty from Ashburnham, With particulars thereof. A plot for betraying of Dublin▪ and 14 hanged about the same. With the last intelligence from Scotland.
