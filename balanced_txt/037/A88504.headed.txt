Londons new Recorder: Or, certain Queres to be resolved by the old Recorder, for Londons further welfare. 1. WHether the Cities late furious and audacious insolence in listing themselves and ingaging their friends for a second War, or their tame and shamefull submission and betraying the others, be more worthy of contempt. 2. Whether we may not now as justly and ingenuously covenant to endeavour the extirpation of the chief Officers in the City-Government, whether it be the Lord Mayor, Alderman, Sheriffes Common-Counsell, and other Officers depending thereon, and pla∣cing better in their room, for their late intended rebellion in raising a new Warre, as they before have the extirpation of Popery, Pre∣lacy, (that is Church-Government by Archbishops, Bishops, Chancellors, Deanes, &c.) Superstition, Heresie, Schisme, Prophanenesse, &c. these being sins more apparantly, acted by them, and we more miserably sensible thereof, then these of the latter; none of which the whole Synod can yet reduce under any of their Classes. 3. Whether the City-Fomenters in their late practices for a new warre, did not give occasion, and it be not more justice and lesse Sa∣criledge for the King and State to appropriate to themselves these Caupon Capon-eaters, Halls and severall Corporations, the maine incentive of their pride and rebellion, then those ancient and pious fabricks and endowments of our fore-fathers devotion and charity. 4. Whether these new holy daies of Apprentices and School-boyes may not prove a greater deformation to Church and City, then their ancient Shrovetide and May-day hath been of Reformation to Play-houses and Stewes. 5. Whether the redoubted valour of the Apprentices hath not revived their extinguisht birth-right, and made more Gentlemen then Masters: who as they had done the King from the Parliament, so these shall extrude their Masters from their Commodities and Ware-houses. 6. Whether it be not as necessary for the temporall Sword to suppresse all Armes and Souldiery of the City, as it is for the spiri∣tuall, all Schisme and Sectaries, they both having their beginning in Queen Elizabeths time, and both alike formidably increased to Church and State. 7. Whether Queen Elizabeths first license to a few Citizens and Apprentices, may not exercise Armes for her disport and entertain∣ment, may not be re-called by her Successor, their number now being limited and their use è diametro to the contrary. 8. Whether since their expulsion of the King from his Chamber the City, and their disloyall royall hunt, they would not now though against their Religion and Charter, turne penitent Pilgrims and revisit S. Cutberts and S. Michaels Mount to reduce him and the Prince, and although they have not canonized any of them for a Saint in their weekly Pamphlet, yet for his returne to procure a new holy day Ordinance, and Register it in their yearly Kalenders. 9. Whether that ancient little Modell the City (not circumscribed now in the Lines of Communication) hath not by their tumul∣tuous Petitions reduced and whitled that maine prop and post of our English Government (the Parliament) to lesse power and pro∣portion then a Sheriffes white rod, or a Constables painted staffe. 10. Whether their long Liberties over Southwark, Westminster, White-Chappell, &c. hath not made those places greater ob∣jects of feare and danger unto the City her selfe, then they have made her to be of terrour to the whole Kingdome: And whether like an over-growne Oyster, doth she not now stew in her owne pickell. 11. Whether the City do not deale with its Suburbs and their Line of Communication, as the Jewes of old with the Samaritans, acknowledge them brethren onely while they advantage them: And whether, if necessarily they must be Appendices, they ought not to communicate in all its Liberties. 12. Whether those Marshall Burgesses have not good nigh brought their City into as calamituous a case as they would have done S. Peters patrimony or the Bishops estates. 13. Whether the City monopolizing all Trades, it be a good state of body, to have a fat head, thin guts, and leane members: Or whether it be not expedient policy by launcing the mids of the hide, to eventilate those tumors, which by the late depressing and trampling of the sides hath so exorbitantly swelled there, that it holds not now a fit proportion for the right levell of the whole. 14. Whether their endeavorring to make themselves a fourth party and estate of the Kingdome, and having (with the earthen pot in the fable) justled with all the other, and now downe stream they bee not likely to be shattered a pieces by the others greater strength. 15. Whereas upon the 7. of this August the City gave up its spirit inarticulately intestate, whether his Excellency, their present Administrator, will yet accept of their beaten gold Bason, and Ewer, and permit their wives and children, according to their custome to enjoy their third parts. 16. Whether the City-tame Pidgeons since their late wild flight, abandoning their Turtells, will not most of them be transform∣ed to Stockdoves, and seeke some desert or wildernesse to bemoan their unpittied desolation. 17. Whether the Cockneigh or the Horse-crow be now the more proper and pleasing language to a Citizen. 18. VVhether on the Royall Exchange, the Publike-Faith, or the Irish Purchaser will prove the greater Bankrupts. 19. Whether Alderman Gresham in his Trunk-hose and round Cap upon the Exchange deserveth not (though he lesse need) more incense to his memorie and is more worthy their imitation, then lately that Rhodomontado Alderman in Moorfieles on horse-back with all his caparisons. 20. Whether the Old Change and Guild-hall are not neerer to Newgate and Ludgate, then the Bishops gate be unto the Tower 21. Whether Britaines Burss be not now as rich as Gold-smiths or Guild-hall. 22. Whether Bedlame and Bridewell sound not better to Puritan then S. Bartholomewes or Christ-Church. 23. Whether Pater Noster Row Ave and Creeds Lane stood not as neer Cheapside-Crosse as Gracious street. 24. Whether Lex talionis in all things hath not yet met with the City; and whether to this Quintessence of all their former Rebelli∣ons, and adaequate transcendent punishment may not justly be feared. 25. Whether the old Recorder shall not be better imployed in staying here to resolve all these Quaeres, then his other ten fellow-Members hath been in giving occasions to raise them, and then running away.
