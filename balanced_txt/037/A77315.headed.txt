There would be without doubt vast summes of money discovered that is concealed from the Common-wealth, in most (if not in all) of the Counties throughout the whole Nation, to the great benefit of the said Common-wealth. And the said Bagwell and Brockedon, doe conceive and verily beleeve (by the sundry addresses and complaints of many of the Souldiers, and others of severall Counties) That there may be discovered of concealments (as above) more then will satisfie the Arears of the Souldery and the Publique Faith, if incouragement may be gi∣ven to their just endeavours. And therefore (in the behalfe of many thousands, Souldiers and others, Creditors to the Common-wealth) they humbly desire that an Act may issue forth for the effecting of the premisses, &c. Will: Bagwell. John Brockedon. LICENCED BY AƲTHORITY. London, Printed by James Flesher, for Nicholas Bourne, at the south entrance of the Royal-Exchange. 1652.
