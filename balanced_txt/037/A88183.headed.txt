ENGLANDS weeping spectacle: OR, The sad condition of Lievtenant Colo∣nell John Lilburne: Crying to all who have any conscience or compassion, for assistance and deliverance from his unjust, long and cruell sufferings. Wherein (as in a glasse) all Englishmen may see the sla∣vish condition, unto which (after so much blood, time and trea∣sure spent) they are yet by perfidious men (who vowed and pro∣mised to deliver them from all tyrannie and oppression) still most wofully subjected. Prov. 11.26. Matth. 26.44, 45, 46. The righteousnesse of the upright shall deliver them, but transgres∣sors shall be taken in their own wickednesse. Then shall they also answer him, saying, when saw we thee an hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, and say, verily I say unto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go into everlasting paine, and the righteous unto life etenrall. Printed in the Yeere 1648.
Englands weeping Spectacle, or the sad condition of Lievtenant-Colonell JOHN LILBURNE; Crying to all who have any conscience or compassion, for assistance and deliverance from his unjust, long and cruell sufferings. CErtainly in it selfe, and to a sound and vertuous mind, no∣thing is so sad, so irksome and grievous, as the unjust suffe∣rings of an honest and faithfull man, who for his hatred to oppression, and love to the just Liberty of his Coun∣trey, is made a prey to Tyrants, and the subject of their scorn, pride, and malice. And if this be so, as it must needs be, Paul testifying, that for a good man some would even dare to die, thereby signifying his exces∣sive griefe, (when vertue and goodnesse suffers) and in this respect, who can forbeare to weep, that considers the long and cruell suffe∣rings of M. Lilburn, which were not for any unjust action, nor for obtaining some particular good to himselfe, but in the constant pursuance of the generall good of this long-betrayed and insla∣ved Nation. When first he began to understand himself, had he been like un∣to most young men of his age and time, who either wast their a∣bilities on vaine fantastick pleasures, or hunt after the sordid re∣wards of ambition and covetousnesse, minding little else but the pride, vanity, and luxury of a sinfull life, mixt at best, only with a forme of Godlinesse, without the power or life thereof, no doubt but he might soone have come to have been a man of this world, to have been some body in the City and place where he was bred; and have enjoyed those contents, which most men seeke either in honour or profit. But it seems his conscience was soon awakened upon his Masters call, God to whose service he had dedicated himself, made him to know betimes, that he had other work for him to doe, and being
called, he neither suffered the motions of God in his conscience to be choaked with the cares of this world, nor the deceitfulnesse of riches, nor consult with flesh and blood, but (as Moses) he chused rather to suffer affliction in pursuance of a just cause, then to injoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Hereupon, he finding all Authority corrupted and perverted from the true end, (the preservation and freedome of the people) to its contrary, the ruine, vexation, and bondage of the people: his conscience presently sets him awork, waving all selfe-respects to the discovery thereof, by printing and publishing of bookes whereby to open the understandings of men, and stirring them up to a timely prevention of that intolerable bondage, which he per∣ceived to be coming fast upon them. Whilst he was thus employed, the Lordly Bishops and corrupt States-men (whose wickednesse was laid open through his endea∣vours) did by the craft of their officious instruments and trechery of fained friends, lay hold of him, and proceed against him in Star-Chamber, where after most corrupt proceedings, he is put to that vile Oath Ex Officio, enjoyning him to answer to all such questions as they should demand, even to Articles against himselfe, which be∣ing contrary to nature, reason, Law and Religion, he absolutely re∣fuses to answer, insists upon his right, and declares the illegality and abominable wickednesse of such proceedings. For refusing whereof, they sentence him to be whipt at a Cart, from the Fleet-prison, to Westminster-hall, and there to be set on the Pillory for many houres, to be a wonder to all men, and with what malice this cruelty was executed, how bloodily he was whipt, how cruelly gagg'd, and after that, how barbarously he was used in his imprisonment in the Fleet, would be no lesse sad, then tedious to rehearse, yea and is of it selfe sufficient, had his sufferings ended there, even to make every true-hearted English-man, with the Pro∣phet Jeremy, to wish that his head were a well of water, and his eyes fountaines of tears, that he might weep day and night, that any govern∣ment pretending Christianity should be so inhumane, or any peo∣ple professing the knowledge of God, or common equity, should be so sottish as to stand by, observe and suffer such inhumane cru∣elty, whereof the particulars have been so fully and frequently re∣lated, that it is needlesse here to repeat them; these are times wherein Christians are not Children in knowledge, but rather in
conscience and practice, or else this weeping Spectacle would make their heats to bleed, and burne within them, till they had found out some way of deliverance for him. But did his sorrowes end here? No; but as the injustice and cruelty of his adversaries abated not his courage, (as they supposed and expected) but rather increased and heightned his resolution, according to the nature of true Christian fortitude, so hath the same ever since, moved him with undaunted courage, to stand in opposition to the oppression and injustice of the times, and by that meanes begotten him more and greater affliction, even principally from the Parliament it selfe, who pretended not onely to de∣liver him, but all England out of all kind of bondage, and op∣pression. It's confest, they began well, like true Christians indeed, in de∣livering the captive, and setting the oppressed free, whereof he was one, and it was well for them he was so, for he was no un∣thankfull one, but immediately (occasion so requiring) ventured his life for their preservation, against Lunsford and his crue of Ruffians at Westminster, where the Parliament of England that had preserved him, was by his speciall meanes (under God) preserved; the greatest number that were there, even Sir Richard Wiseman, himself, being there by his incitement, who notwithstanding is since too much forgotten, and where this our weeping Spectacle was then a bleeding Spectacle to all beholders, and for which and much more both before and since, all true lovers of Englands Li∣berties, are beholding to him: and had not things then as well as since, been done by halves and deceitfully, our troubles had then en∣ded, or at least not halfe so long indured. And how sensible did the Parliament then seem to be of his sufferings and service? What could be desired, that was not then voted in his behalfe, whether in condemnation of his tyrannous adversaries, or in justification and reparation of his sufferings and losses, even as far, and as faire, as the wits of men could devise, which is evident by their Votes then manifested? And this at that time gained them abundance of friends, for he was exceedingly beloved and pitied throughout the Land: Oh that all their pro∣ceedings since had been agreeable to this, he is not a changer with the times, though they in their actions be much changed: For it had not then appeared, that this they did to him, was not for ju∣stice
sake, but rather to advance a party whereby to compasse their owne ends, and not the publike good. But so really thankfull is this good man, for their seeming good to him, and to the publike in him, (for he and the publike are but one, as time will prove effectually) that no sooner did their neces∣sities declare for VVarre, but he ingages himselfe, and all the friends he had, one way or other to ingage for them, and for their sakes, (supposing then they minded really the Commons Liberties, and the redresse of all grievances) forsakes his calling wherein he lived comfortably, and leaves his wife, dearer to him then himselfe, as she well deserved, honouring and comforting him before she was so, even when he was more like Job upon the dunghill by his suffe∣rings, then a man at that time for her society: And at Kenton∣field ventured his life freely for them, and his Countrey, so that he gained very much respect from all who observed his faithfulnesse and valour. Nor does he desist here, though by what he had seen both at Worcester and at this fight, he had cause to doubt, that there was no intention of a speedy end to the war, or of liberty to the peo∣ple, but occasion at Branford againe requiring his service, he there for many houres with an inconsiderable party of men that can ne∣ver be too much honoured, holds all the Enemies Forces at a bay, and inforces them to a stand till London was provided, which otherwise in probability had ben surprized on a sudden, and where he lost himselfe to redeem his Countrey, being in a worse condition then those many worthy men there slaine; for he was led in a most despicable manner from thence to Oxford, where he underwent a long and loathsome imprisonment, with most barba∣rous usage from Smith the cruell Jaylor, and a most dangerous tri∣all for his life before Judge Heath: and though he daily expected certaine death, yet stood he firme against all kinds of temptations and promises, whether of honour, or profit, or deliverance from his present misery, firme as built upon a Rock, even the Rock Christ Je∣sus, and a cause (as his conscience had digested it) just as justice it selfe. And for defence whereof, he had certainly and suddenly died the most shamefull death, if the faithfulnesse of his wife had not even in the very instant prevented the judgement and execution, for she knowing his danger, ceased not to solicite the House of Com∣mons
daily and hourely to interpose their power for his preservati∣on, and when by ordinary solicitation she could not prevaile, neces∣sity so much inforcing, she took the boldnesse to present her self at the Commons Barre, there begging and importuning their care of her husbands life, and was (by divine providence) so happy as to obtaine their Order and Letter to Judge Heath, requiring a for∣bearance of his execution, and withall, threatning the death of two of their friends (being then prisoners here) in case they took his life. With which letter (big with child as she was) she undergoes a task through all the strong Courts of Guard, which none else (as things then stood) durst undertake; in performance whereof, she met with so many sad and difficult accidents, to a woman in her condition, as would force tears from the hardest heart, to heare them related, but they are too large for this place, though those that know them, cannot but remember them to her perpetuall commendation, who by wisdome, patience and diligence overcame them all, and for her reward both saved her husbands life, and after a season obtained his liberty. Neither was he wearied by these his sufferings, nor un∣thankfull for the respects shewed unto him by the Parlia∣ment, as witnesse his speedy ingagement under the Earle of Manchester, in which service it is well knowne, he was so faithfull, resolute, and successefull, that he became the darling and bosome-friend to the now Lievtenant-Ge∣nerall Cromwell, through whose unhappy intimacy he had so great an inspection into the actions of the Earle himselfe, and likewise of Col. King, that when Cromwell impeached the said Earle upon many dangerous articles, he had not so materiall a witnesse (or that durst so effectually appeare) as his trusty friend Lievetenant-Colonell Lilburne, who (not knowing what belonged to fear or distrust) boldly discovers upon examination, all that he knew or could te∣stifie, and which made up so much as the house of Com∣mons, upon report of the Committee, voted the charge to be fully proved.
But here endeth the charge, (to Mr. Lilburne and all true hearted English mens great griefe, which otherwise if it had been prosecuted, might then have made an end of all these warres, troubles and oppressions) and here began Mr. Lilburne and all other honest mens overthrow, by meanes of those deceitfull instruments unto this day: For instantly upon this cessation and alteration, diverse unworthy officious men were set awork both upon him and all that loved him and his cause, even by printed, rail∣ing & lying pamphlets, to abuse, vex and provoke him, unto which he answering & replying in way of justifying himself and his friends, is hastily complained on to the Parliament, his person summoned by Warrants from the Committee of Examinations, where (as before in Starchamber) he is demanded questions against himselfe, which he refu∣sing to answer, they make no longer debate, but immedi∣ately send him to Newgate, purposely to disparage and provoke him more and more, wherein Mr. Miles Corbet and Mr. VVhitaker were very forward. And though they had no Commission so to doe, yet the house of Commons, both justifies the Committee, and directs the Recorder of London, to prepare for his tryall at Sessions for his life, as if there had been some capitall crime or dangerous matter against him, and in this base prison he lyeth almost three months, and of what slaunders were reported and Plots divised against him, all this time not onely his and his friends sad experience at present, but the accusing conscience of his enemies will in due time bear witnesse: And then upon his owne motion to New∣gate Sessions, and upon their hearing him in open Court by a publick speech (defying all his accusers and all their accusations) was by proclamation set free, without any le∣gall crime layed to his charge, either by Parliament or any other; whereby he gained the more credit and hon∣our, & all his enemies the more shame & contempt ever since.
Well, all this he puts up (there being no way of remedy yet found our, for any injustice of the House of Commons, nor of their Committees) and imployes his industry to get his due arreares, & the dammages Voted him formerly for his cruell sufferings in the Starre-Chamber, and having with continuall paines early and late, at length prevailed so farre, as that the House of Lords assigned him two thousand pounds, upon due triall and proofe of the businesse, and he being in good hopes of a speedy issue, Col. King is put upon him to bring him to further troubles, and frustrat all his endeavours, and for a beginning arrests him upon an action for Slande∣rous words, which he pretended to be spoken against him, whereas the words indeed were in way of proving King an offender, upon Articles exhibited against him in Parliament, and King aid this purposely to take away his Testimony. Here you are to minde, that Mr. Lilburne had left the service of the Warres, upon a just dislike of the corrupt managing thereof, and being here about London, had discovered the perverse proceeding of the Parlia∣ment, & now hateful all sorts of conscientious people (whatever they for∣merly pretended) were unto them; and thereupon invited others, and joyned with them by Petitions to induce them to a better temper. And this his forwardnesse for publick good, occasioned all men who had any publick greevances to discover, to come to him and to aske his ad∣vice, which brought some trouble, and more feare upon diverse that yet bear their heads full high, and wrought him more enmity, then that either of the Earle of Manchester, or of Colonel King, for all that had any guilt upon them new or old were greatly affraid of him; so that King gained aboundance of friends, as Prynne and Bastwicke had done before, by thus abusing Mr. Lilburne. But being arrested by King in the Court of Common Pleas, and put to his defence, having in all this time received no part of his dama∣ges, nor but a hundred Pounds of all his arreares, (which was spent (in these his sufferings) before he had it) and finding the preceedings in law, full of intricacy and perplexity both irrationall and destructive to himselfe and the people, he thence takes occasion to Petition the House of Commons, that the Charge and Articles against King might be try∣ed by a Counsell of Warre, before King should be permitted to proceed against him; this Petition he could never get to be delivered, or read in the House; then after long and tedious attendance, to save himselfe, and for the good of the people, (who are ever one) hee writes a dis∣course to Judge Reeves, and Prints it, and calls it, The just mans justifi∣cation
wherein he layes open the great corruption and unreasonablenesse of the Lawes and proceedings therein, which are now yet in force (not∣withstanding this long lasting Parliament) and intreats him to lay those things to heart, and in due sense thereof, that hee would endeavour to free, not onely him, but all the people from so great and grievous a bondage which was brought into this Nation, at the will and pleasure of the Norman conquerour, by force and violence of the Sword, or to this effect was the scope, tenor, and end of his Letter. The unjust Judge finding that this booke tended maynly to discover the jugling of Judges and Lawyers, to spoile their Trade and Mysterie of inquity, whereby they both heap up riches, and in effect sway the whole Nation instead of doing what a good Conscience would have bound him to, he (like himselfe) by way of complaint, presents the book to the House of Lords, where not only Monchester his deadlyest enemy is Speaker, but some of those wicked mn also, who sentenced Mr. Lilburn in the Starre-Chamber, are now again his Judges, with the rest, against whose legisla∣tive power and jurisdiction over Commoners, he is generally known to be a just and profest opposite. And is he not here now in a sad condition, summoned he is before these Lords, and boldly appears; is he not where all the Judges, Lawyers Oppressors, Projectors, and Committeemen could wish him? Is it not now come to passe as King would have it? For the Lords very well know whom they have before them, & how to handle him, they first (trading the ordinary path of Tyrants) put him to answer to questions against him∣selfe concerning the book, he in short, disclaimes their jurisdiction over him, and presents to them his appeale to the Commons as a Commoners for which they judge him to be worthy of no better place then Newgate, where he continued ten dayes, and was sent for againe, and then for refusing to kpeele before them, they returne him again to Newgate, to be kept close Prisoner without Pen, Inke, and Paper, and none to have accesse to him, but onely his Keeper, during their pleasure. But all those things are better knowne then considered, and how hee after this refused (till he was forced) to come any more before them, and being forced, what his behaviour was, how hee refused againe to kneele, and how he stopt his eares against their Articles, as utterly re∣nouncing their Authority over him, and how for this, he was sentenced Two thousand pound to the King, and seven yeares imprisonment in the Tower, where hee continued without hope of deliverance, untill the Army pretended to insist for the generall Liberty and Freedome of the Nation, as well from the new contracted, as from the old inveterate bon∣dage thereof.
In all which time, it is not unknown how diligent he was, to make the House of Commons sensible of the unjustice done unto him, and to all the people of England in him, but all in vain, their long continu∣ance having changed their interest from that of the peoples, to this of the Lords; so that in effect they joyned (hand in hand) with them in oppressing him; which unjust dealing also, as he had done other mens before, he spares neither paines nor charges to publish to the world; whereby at length not onely the people did gain so much understand∣ing, but the honest souldiers of the Army began to be sensible, that ty∣ranny and oppression was come to a height, as well in the Parliament, as in the King, and therefore could see no reason, but the same ought to be resisted in them, as it was in him. Whereupon, as for other things, so in particular for deliverance of him, or to procure him a legall triall, the whole Army begin to insist, and whilest they were in motion from Newmarket towards London, how many and great respects were manifested by them to him, is not unknown to thousands, nor was it ever imagined that he should have remained prisoner in the Tower, when once the Army were Masters of it. But it clearly appeares, the greatest number that really thought so were much mistaken; for the great ones of the Army, what ever they pretended, are of nearer relation, and more strongly contracted to the Lords and great ones of the Nation, then to the Commons or such faithfull patriots as Mr. Lilburn; which being discerned by him soo∣ner then by other men, and that their practises tended not to a common good, he spares neither paines, cost nor hazard, forthwith to discover their delusion (as well as he had done other mens formerly) to the world, and finding his old friend Cromwell, to have been a chief in∣strument in destroying the ends of their engagement, he neither flat∣ters nor spares him nor any other, but layes all their actions naked to the view of the world, fore-shewing that which since is come to passe, and which now every man sees and many feels, though then few or none would believe. Yet through the policie of those arch-deceivers, Cromwel, Ireton, and their apostate instruments, in stead of amending their faults, turn this his honest, plain and impartiall dealing, to his ruine; for they possessed all his lovers and friends in City, Country and Army, that the man was frantick, little better then one at Bedlam, that he really drives on the Kings designe, and to others, upon whom such speeches could not work, they give out, that he was a rash incon∣siderate
man, and that nothing would satisfie him, but onely to bring all this Nation to Anarchy and confusion. By all which their subtle workings, they blinded the eyes of those that had them in admiration for their specious shewes of devotion and Religion, under which veil they deceived most men, and securely went through with destroying the ends of the Armies engagements, decla∣rations, remonstrances, yea vowes and protestations to God and man, and whereby they have made the most honest and well meaning Army that ever was in the world, and the most valiant, best beloved and most hopefull of all the people, to be accounted the greatest deceiver and oppressor, and so the greatest object of all scorn, contempt, and ha∣tred. And this the Army and all good people got, by believing those great mens false reports and unjust censures of Mr. Lilburn, and exchanging his faithfull and timely advices for their delusions, and as this brought extream evill upon all honest men, so especially upon him, for those men having thus by their Arts and sophistry overcome his reputation, they by slanders and reproaches in all places, so alienated the hearts of those who formerly had comforted him in his sufferings, and supported his necessities, that himself his wife and children, have been many times since in such eatremities as is incredible to all, except those onely who know how vile their slanderous reproaches had made him in the eyes of most men. And when (notwithstanding all their malice) by his invincible di∣ligence, he had lately procured so much liberty, as to follow his own businesse, and sometimes to go out of his prison, how soon did they pick occasion, in stead of being prisoner to the Lords (from which he might justly and rationally expect to be delivered speedily by the Commons) to make him the prisoner of the Commons; and for what cause, even for promoting a petition for the universall good of the whole nation as any honest man will easily discern at the first reading thereof; yea such a petition, as unto which whosoever is an enemy, is not, nor cannot be Englands friend. Being thus a prisoner again, and hereby losing more friends (as who that suffers, and hath necessities are not subject unto) doth he now faint and sink under this addition of weight and sorrow to his former affliction? No, he ceases not day and night, to make this injustice and cruelty known to the deceived world, still writes, prints, and publi∣shes both his own just cause, and their malicious and cruell dealings,
so plainly, so powerfully, and couragiously, that some who formerly had been his enemies, now are so farre convinced of his integrity, that they both love and honour him, to the shame of his backsliding friends, and are by his faithfull councel preserved from a snare, un∣justly layd for their destruction. Certainly, if any man in the world, hath the unvaluable comfort of an impartiall, publict, active, sincere, persevering Conscience, this man hath, and yet of all men in this Nation, whether under the former or present Government, is not this he that is designed to live perpetually in prison? For what way possible is there for his enlargement? when the King, Bishops, Privie Councel, Starr-chamber, and High Commission ruled all, then who more then he was judged worthy of whips, torture, imprisonment, and death? Those Lords that first pretended to stand for the liber∣ties of the people, judge him most worthy of bonds, and the House of Commons who pretended more good to the people, then ever their predicessors did, yea, and both of them were preserved by his meanes (under God) in their greatest danger, and had fewest to take their parts, yet it plainly here appeareth, that never any one man hath re∣ceived more hurt from them, more palpable wrong then he hath. The present Clergyman that thrust out the former, even for their cruel persecuting of him, and such as he is, do not afford him so much as one good word; nay, they raile on him, and persecute no man more; those Lawyers that formerly suffered in opposition to some kinds of oppression, having forsaken their first love, and with Demas embraced the honours and profits of these times, make sport at his sufferings, and use their utmost power to continue, heighten, and increase them. Those Judges that sit in place of such as were removed for Injustice, and who are bound by Oath, Law, and Conscience, either to see him de∣livered, or brought to a legall Tryall, by 12. sworne men of his Neigh∣bours, by whomsoever he is imprisoned, yet seeme to think it neither perjurie in themselves, injustice to him, nor robbery to the people, to deny him this, which was never denyed to the veriest Villaine, Rogue, Malefactor, Thiefe, or Traytor, in Newgate, and which since this Par∣liament began, was granted to Maquier, and Machmahoone the Irish Rebels, which he hath set forth at large, (in his book called the Law-Funerall) to the eternall infamy of those Parliamentary Judges. And this hath been his portion, for no other thing, but for being the
most constant, vigorous, unwearied friend to Englands liberty, and the deadliest enemy to its bondage and slavery of any man whatsoever? Nor will any person, Authority, or State ever prove a true friend to this Nation, that continues an Enemy to him, or otherwise then Ty∣rants and Oppressors, that still domineere and tyrannize over him, as their Predecessours in oppression, the Bishops, and Starr-Chamber-men did before them. He is thy true touchstone, O England, thou needest no other to try either thy Gold or drosse, though any man appeare or glister never so faire, if such a one but speake against him, or insist onely on some harsh (and yet true) expressions in his Books, or any naturall infirmi∣ties, as is the manner of those hypocrites that doe him most mischief, thou maist certainely resolve upon it, that that man (whosoever hee be) doth thereby shew himself but a counterfeit, and is not to be trust∣ed in the day of thy necessity: Instance but one (if thou canst, O thou officious flatterer, who hath stood firme for Englands true freedome, that hath despised him: thy Patrone Cromwell himselfe stumbling at this stone, he is fallen like Lucifer, yea, and all that steere his un∣steedy course, doe they not stagger and reele up and downe like so ma∣ny drunken men, and finde no certain path wherein to walke, or set their feet, since they forsooke the streight way of this just and imparti∣all man, Mr. Lilburne. O England, (or rather thou true part of England, that knowest best what just freedome is) when thou wouldest know whether thou art bond or free, whether those thou trustest with thy freedome, power, and authority, deale well or ill with thee, or whether they be just, or unjust, thou needest not runne to the King nor Parliament, neither to the House of the Kings Lords, nor to House of the Peoples Com∣mons, neither enquire of thy Lawyers, nor of thy Priests or Judges, but look onely on him, consider his just cause, peruse his Writings, and deferre not to give judgement, that they are altogether become abho∣minable, and reprobate to every good work, that there is none of them that doth good, no not one, their throat is an open Sepulchre, not only in swallowing up thy good men greedily like a Whale, and de∣vouring thy goods insatiably like Bell, or rather like hell: but with their tongues they speake nothing but lyes of him, and the cause for which he suffereth, and yet promoteth for thy peace and freedome. Look, look upon him, all yee that passe by, yea, stand still, (I say)
and look steadfastly on him, his wife and children; Is it not a wee∣ping spectacle, and are there no teares yet in thine eyes, Whilst thou beholdest it? Looke steedily on his bloody stripes, terrible gagging, cruell imprisonment, and barbarous usage, and likewise upon his actions and sufferings since; Were these unparalleled sufferings not at all, because most of them were some yeares, moneths, or weekes agoe? Surely, O friends, yee seeme (by your practice) to thinke so; if it were otherwise, whence comes so great an alteration in you, though there be both a constant and couragious progresse in him. For no sooner entred he into any one of his afflictions formerly, but ye flockt about him like so many Bees at a hive, like friends and true comforters indeed, so that every one thought well or ill of them∣selves, as they comforted or neglected him. And seeing yee have found them all as step-mothers that have wea∣ned you from him, O then returne, returne, revive in love, there be∣ing no oppression, nor burthen, nor affliction so great, as the neglect of friends to one oppressed, burdened, and afflicted for a just cause, in prison; Be not you therefore after all the greatest, but lend him your societies, your comforts, your counsels, and assistance, as at the first, whenevery one was ready to runne, ride, petition, or do any just thing for his encouragement, or enlargment. And never look that England shall be free, or that any good is really intended to this Nation, till this worthy man be set at liberty, with full reparations for his foule injurious and unjust sufferings; and be sure ye neither neglect, nor delay your endeavours to effect it, whatever it cost you, as he accounteth nothing too deare or precious for you; for if any one suffer, all ought to suffer with him, nor think your selves religious either in your Fasts or Feasts, or any thing else, as in using all lawfull meanes, which possibly may deliver the Captive, and set the oppressed free. Isai. 586. This indeed may cost you something, for ye are like to go through many difficulties to obtaine it, but for these and the like ends, have ye your abilities; and without ayming at such, thinke not your religious exercises enough which costs you little or nothing: O! there∣fore, never cease, till yee procure him either free enlargement with re∣parations, or a Legall tryall, that England may cease to mourne any more over this weeping spectacle. FINIS.
