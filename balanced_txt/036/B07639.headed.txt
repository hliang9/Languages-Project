CERTAINE AD∣VERTISEMENTS AND Articles, giuen by the Worship∣full Master Robert Iohnson Arch∣deacon of Leicester. In the Visitation holden for the said Archdeaconrie, at the feast of the Annunciation of our blessed Ladie the Virgine MARIE in the yeare of our Lord God 1613. and of the Reigne of our most gracious Lord King IAMES, by the grace of God of Eng∣land, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. the eleuenth, and of Scotland the for∣tie fiue. LONDON Printed for Ambrose Garbrand. 1613.
The vse of the Ecclesiasticall Visitations. ORdinarie Visitations Ecclesiasticall by what authoritie soe∣uer executed, were originally instituted and ordained for the honour of God, the good of his Church, and the preseruation of the people of God in vnitie of true Religion, and in holinesse of life and conuersation, and that the Churches Parochiall & other foun∣ded and erected for diuine worship, might by Ecclesiasticall Ma∣gistrates and Church-gouernours in their distinct callings be furni∣shed with reuerent and discreet Ministers, godly and learned Prea∣chers, faithfully to teach and instruct the people in the truth of Gods word, sincerely to administer the Sacraments, and to doe and per∣forme all other offices of the holy Church, by name Matrimonie, visiting the sicke, buriall of the Dead, thankesgiuing of Women after childbirth, and such like, according to the positiue Lawes and Ordinances of Christian Kings and Princes, Gods Vicegerents on the earth, without any Antichristian corruption, Schismaticall innouation of addition of their owne. And further that in due exe∣cution, or such Visitations, the enemies of Gods truth, the Papall, Schismaticall, Anabaptisticall, prophane or other, might be refor∣med or expulsed Gods Church: All idle and dissolute Ministers (being insufficient and a scandall to their calling) remoued and dis∣placed, and men or better sort, sobrietie and worthinesse, placed in their stead: and that the people who are many times carelesse and negligent to be instructed, & oft seduced to follow innouation and strange worship, might be reduced from their errours and su∣perstition, eyther by godly exhortation and perswasion, or other∣wise by the censures of the Church. This diuine and verie neces∣sarie inquisition by the prouidence of God and in wisedome of for∣mer times grauely ordained being duly executed by the Magi∣strate, Minister, Churchwardens, & such other as are trusted in this businesse, would doubtlesse God assisting easily purge the Church of many inconueniences, and bring the people to better obedi∣ence, and more due acknowledgement of the benefits bestowed vpon them, in placing ouer them so renowned, sacred and religious a Prince, and in giuing vnto them by his sole wisedome and autho∣ritie vnder God, libertie to serue God, and to liue at home in peace.
¶ An Aduertisement. THankesgiuing for benefits and graces recei∣ued, and daily inuocation of Gods holy name for the continuance of his blessings towards vs, and for the protection and de∣fence of this Church, Prince, and People, from the rage, oppression, and violence of Satan and his members, as it is particular∣ly commanded in many places in holy writ, so it is warranted vnto vs by all examples of the Prophets and Patriarches in all ages, & therefore since we haue as good cause as euer nation had to prostrate our selues before the Maiestie of the Almightie for the infinite blessings brought vpon vs, in placing ouer vs so re∣ligious, sacred and godly a Prince, as no Chronicle can euer mention, neither any Kingdome or people euer had: let vs ther∣fore seriously, yea let vs sincerely euen from the bottoms of our hearts acknowledge with all thanksgiuing the good receiued, which we ought euen of our owne accord to do: yet much more when we are commanded by publike authoritie. And therefore for as much as we are by certaine statutes, proclamations, let∣ters, and ordinances required, enioyned and commanded, to celebrate the day of his Maiesties Coronation, and of his won∣derfull deliuerance from that bloody conspiracy of that family of the Gowries, as also from that most horrible, trecherous and vn∣speakable action of that Antichristian, hellish & most damnable plot and practise lately intended, not against the person of his Maiestie onely, but to the quite extirpation & subuersion of his royall issue, Religion, and the whole state of this Kingdome: it behooueth euery Minister & all Church-officers, be they Church-wardens or other, as they tender their dutie to God, their alle∣geance to their Prince, & their obedience to the lawes establi∣shed, to prouide that in their seuerall Parishes and Cures, all solemnitie be had of the day of his Maiesties Coronation, and all publike prayer be vsed according to the prescript forme set forth by authoritie as well the fift of August, as vpon the fift of Nouember, and that a particular note be giuen by the Minister
and Churchwardēs of al such as shall refuse to come to Church those daies: and for their better admonition it is required that the Minister doe make knowne vnto the people vpon the prece∣dent Sunday the seuerall daies as they shall happen to fall. Church recu∣sants enemies to Gods truth, to be presen∣ted.1 Church-Recusants, as it is a name heretofore seldome or neuer heard of, so are they in the condition and practise of their life, knowne enemies of Gods truth, such as hate to heare the word, or partake the Sacraments, and liue in open contradic∣tion and opposition against the lawes of God, and against the lawes of their Christian Prince and Common-welth. These persons being iustly reputed very dangerous subiects and of∣fensiue members in the Church, are by the Minister & Church∣wardens with all care and diligence to be enquired after, and presented by their knowne names & surnames, with addition of their titles, and with declaration of what power and suffici∣encie they are, and what office they beare in the Church and Common-wealth, which presentment so made is to be subscri∣bed and deliuered vnder the hand of the Minister, Churchwar∣dens and Sworne men. Admonish∣ment to be gi∣uen such as re∣fuse the Sacra∣ment, and af∣ter vpon refu∣sall to be pre∣sented.2 Where sundrie persons who haue béene héeretofore Re∣cusants, doe now of their owne accord frequent the Church, though not so vsually as others, & yet refuse to heare the word preached, or to receiue the Sacrament of the Lords Supper the better thereby to confirme them, and to giue testimonie vnto others by those their outward actions of that their inward zeal, deuotion and conformity, it behoueth the Minister and Church∣wardens in like sort, first by godly admonition to perswade the said persons if so they can, to receiue, or otherwise to present all such as shal obstinately refuse, being of the age of sixtéene years and aboue, least their sufferance and permission of them be∣come an offence vnto the godly, and giue others cause by their example to backslide. Wiues, Chil∣dren, and Fa∣milies of re∣formed Recu∣sants not com∣municating ought to be presented.3 Though sundrie Recusants haue of late conformed them∣selues, and doe now come to the Church to heare diuine praier, and to receiue the Sacraments, as by the lawes of God, and of this Realme they are commanded: yet the wiues, children, and family of many of those reformed Recusants doe notwithstan∣ding still continue obstinate, and will not be drawne eyther by the example of the husband, parent, or master, nor by any other godly perswasion or conference to doe and performe what to
them & euery of them in a Christian dutie to God & the Prince belongeth. For reformation whereof the Minister, Churchwar∣dens, and Sworn-men are to take a true note and particular of euery such person in those families as shall refuse to come to Church, or to receiue the Sacraments, being of lawfull age and hauing no iust impediment, shall accordingly present them. 4 The infection of Recusancy being the very fruit and badge of Antichristian irreligon, hath béene a surfet so long and dange∣rous in this Kingdome, as by the daily increase of such as affect those dregs of Popery, the disease and contagion séemeth in it selfe incurable, and the rather for that the seuerall houses of Recusants here infected for the better strengthning of that cause as is supposed,Marriages of Recusants and their children not publikely solemnized, to be presented. doe vsually couple and ioyne themselues in Ma∣trimonie together, and so are growne by that vnion and coniun∣ction to a great strength and kindred; now for as much as these marriages are most times in priuate houses celebrated without any publike licence or banes asking: and the Children likewise begotten betwixt such persons are seldome or not at all in pub∣like baptized: It is thought fit and very conuenient, that the Mi∣nister and Churchwardens of euery Parish doe very carefully informe themselues of all such marriages so supposed to be had and of all such Children so baptized, that the seuerall persons herein Culpable may be presented, and compelled to prooue by lawfull testimony their seuerall marriages, that their Children are baptized according to the Ordinances of the Church now e∣stablished, or otherwise to endure such punishment and penalty as by the lawes Ecclesiasticall of this Realme in such case is re∣ligiously prouided: the law it self requiring a due and perfect re∣gister continually to bee kept by the Minister and Churchwar∣dens, of all marriages and Christenings had within the Parish, and to be yearely sent into the Bishops Register there to be re∣corded. 5 Now for the auoyding of the future euill which may hap∣pen in such case, it is required that the Churchwardens and sworn-men of euery Parish doe inquire and informe them∣selues what Ministers other then ehe Parochiall Minister doth vsually celebrate diuine seruice,Strange Mini∣sters and Scholemasters frequenting the houses of Recusants to be presented. administer the Sacraments and performe other Church Offices, in those priuate Families, and whether the said person so executing such offices bée a Mini∣ster licensed, and haue subscribed to the Articles of Religion,
and if not to present him; & further what schoolemasters the said families being noted for Recusancy haue to teach their Childrē, and what license the said schoolemāsters haue so to doe, for that many transformed Iesuites, and Seminaries, vnder the name and colour of schoolemasters, doe vsually frequent such places, and in the Cloake and couert thereof doe exercise al their super∣stitious seruice and Idolatrous practises. 6 For as much as some pretēd & haue informed (as it séemeth) the Kings most excellent Maiestie and the Honorable Lords & other of his Highnes priuy Councel,All excommu∣nicate Recu∣sants vpon Oath for con∣formitie to be absolued. that sundry Recusants be∣ing excōmunicate persons would willingly come to the Church & receiue the Sacramēt in case they might obtaine their absolu∣tion from the sentēce of excommunication inflicted, it is thought fit & hereby required that the Ministers of euery Parish, Chap∣pel, or Hamlet, within this Dioces doe forthwith, or so soone as with conueniency they may, giue publike notice in the Church or otherwise to the persons thēselues or at their mansion houses, that if they will come to the Ordinary who did excommunicate them, or being not able to come will procure commission to bee granted for their better ease to their particular Minister, and take oath for their after-conformitie, they shall bee absolued without fée: so as they haue commited no other offence which doth deserue some publike reformation or satisfaction to the con∣gregation. 7 Lastly for as much as Schisme and deuision in Religion and in the Ceremonies of the Church hath & doth much disturbe the peaceable gouernment of the same,One vniforme order of Com∣mon prayer, &c. wherein default is to be presented. and doth likewise giue great occasion to the professed enemies of Gods truth thereby to withdraw the people and such as are weake from the Religion, doctrine & discipline of the Church now established, for that we are not (as they pretend vnto them) at vnitie within our selues, it is very necessary and behouefull, that sithence it hath pleased the Kings most excellent Maiestie by his late Canons exempli∣fied vnder the broad seale of England, to decrée and set downe that one vniforme order in the execution of diuine seruice and in ye administration of the Sacraments, of apparel, as of Church ornaments and Ceremonies, should be vsed by the Cleargie of this Kingdome, as well in the publike execution of those their particular offices as in other their outward conuersation and behauiour, that the same be accordingly vsed and prouided, or
else that the Church wardens doe present whether the fault bee in the Minister who will not weare the same, or in the Parishio∣ners who will not prouide those ornaments necessary and com∣maunded.
