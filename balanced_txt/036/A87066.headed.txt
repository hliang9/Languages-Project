THE Hang-Man's Lamentation; OR, THE Chancellour's Farewel. HAve at the Blind Harper's, for once let us try, To Sing a Poor Chancellor's Sad Destiny, Bewayl'd by Three Kingdoms, without one wet Eye. Then Farewel Jeff—s, Old Boy Jeff—s, Ever and ever Farewel. With Popery and Slavery, he Thriv'd Cock-a-hoop; But when Right, Law, and Gospel, began to Look Up, He got a Consumption, and dy'd of a Droop. Then Farewel, &c. To Die neither Satan, nor Belzebub's Debtors; Some say he's but gon to Visit his Betters; And to take up a Lodging for Old Father Letre's. Then Farewel, &c. Yes, the Chancellour's Dead▪ and would ye know why? His Boys in the West, like Goblins stood by; And with Bloody Pitch-forks, kill'd him Dead in the Eye. Then Farewel, &c. The Ghosts of his Martyrs, they made such a Stir there, That Great Russel's Ghost, and Cornish's Murther, E'en frighted his Soul, to the Devil and further. Then Farewel, &c. The sad Thought of Hemp, pierc'd him thoro' and thoro', And to tell you the Truth, in meer Grief and Sorrow; He e'en Died to Day, to save Hanging to Morrow. Then Farewel, &c. This Hector that once cou'd Roar, Swagger, and Bristle, Our great Son of Thunder's, gon out like a Fizle; And bids both the Sheriffs, and Hangman go Whistle, Then Farewel, &c. But to march off so sneaking, in troth was fowl play, For his good Friends of Holbourn, as all People say, Complain he has lost them a whole Holy-Day. Then Farewel Jeff—s, Old Boy Jeff—s, Ever and ever Farewel. LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1689.
