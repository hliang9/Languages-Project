TO HIS GRACE The DUKE of ORMOND, Upon His leaving the Government and King∣dom of IRELAND. HAve we a further Trouble yet in store? And can our Destiny afflict us more? To lose our Prince we thought too great a blow, And must we lose his glorious Image too? Ireland for more than thrice seven yeagrave;rs has been Envy'd without, for being so blest within; While Plague, Fire, Famine, War abroad has reign'd, This only was the safe and happy Land. Which Happiness, Great Sir, to You we owe, Next to the God above, and God below. The Irish Harp, which long abus'd had lain, Your skilful Hand first brought in Tune again. And when some others by our King were sent To play upon the Noble Instrument, Such was their Ignorance, or their Errours such, They prov'd but Foils to your Melodious Touch. Into Your Hands then, which before it grac'd, The Noble Instrument again was plac'd; On which, a long, soft Tune again You play'd, When jarring Discord did all else invade. And we rejoyc'd to think you wou'd play on — But Heav'ns and our King's Will must still be done: We submit humbly to that Soveraign Pow'r, Which can the Bliss it takes away, restore; More we can't have, nor do we wish for more. Adieu then, much-lov'd Prince — (With mournful Hearts we make this Pray'r for you) Greatest and Best of Un-Crown'd Heads, adieu. And since You must go hence — O're you shall fly, a steddy Gale of Pray'rs, And under roll an humble Sea of Tears; All the amends which for Your mighty Toil Can be return'd by a poor Widdow-Isle: Such now, alas! she is, and ne're till now, That ORMOND's Noble House do's wholly from her go; Not leaving, to support her fainting Mind, An ARRAN, or an OSSORY behind. May Heav'ns choice Blessings on them all attend; And bring them to a Calm and Glorious End. Glorious and Calm may all their Passage be; As was the Hour in which they put to Sea. And landed; wheresoe're her ORMOND goes, May England doat on him, as Ireland does. To whole Great King, due Homage having done, His Councils Honour'd, and secur'd his Throne; Let Him Return His VICEROY here agen; May Heav'ns and England's Monarch say, Amen. Dublin, Printed by A. C. and S. H. Reprinted at London for Ben. Tooke, 1685.
