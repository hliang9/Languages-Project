A right Christian Treatise, entituled S. AVGVSTINES PRAIERS: Published in more ample sort than yet it hath bin in the English tong; purged from diuers supersti∣tious points; and adorned with manifold places of the S. Scrip∣ture, by THOMAS ROGERS. Wherevnto is annexed Saint AVGVSTINES PSALTER: Translated and quoted by the same T. R. 1. Thes. 5, 17. RRAIE CONTINVALIE. Imprinted at London, by Henrie Denham, dwelling in Pater¦noster Row, at the signe of the Starre. 1581. Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestati.
To the Christian Reader. S. IN this place both to satis∣fie thee, beloued, and that thou also the better maist, if it please thee, answere mine aduersaries, I thinke it my part to show the rea∣sons of my translating, correcting, and a∣dorning this booke. For some perhaps, to translate that which is once done alreadie, wil thinke it vanitie; to amend that which no godlie man would euer enterprise to correct, wil iudge it presumption; and to adorne that which was, though often im∣printed, yet neuer so put-forth, wil deeme it curiositie. And so I shal be counted vane for my translating; ouer-bold for my cor∣recting; and verie curious for my quoting this booke. It stands me therefore vpon to show the causes of dooing what I haue done; wherein I wil be the more briefe, because else-whereIn the Epi∣stle dedicato∣rie before S. Augustines Priuate talke with God: and also in the second Epistle be∣fore the I∣mitation of Christ. I haue somwhat tou∣ched these general points, and what there I haue spoken hath apt relation vnto this place. And first for my translating (to ouer-passe in silence the wel acceptation of S. Augu∣stines Priuate talke with God,Causes why this booke was transla∣ted, being in English be∣fore. by the godlie zelous, for whose sake I did bestowe my paines; and the approbation of the same by the Honorable of famous memorie ma∣ster Secretarie Wilson, for whose iudge∣ment sake chieflie, which I knew was verie learned and sound, I choase him to be Pa∣trone thereof: sufficient causes both to encourage me to go forward, and to cleere
me from al suspition either of vanitie, pre∣sumption, or curiositie for doing as I haue done) I saie, the rather I put this booke in∣to English, for that I saw the other, before in our vulgar tongue (whosoeuer was the translator of the same, or what copie soe∣uer the Printer folowed) was verie vnper∣fect; as by comparing this my translation with the other in English, and both with the Latine copie, may easilie appeere. And therfore that neither the aduersarie might haue iust occasion to carpe; nor the godlie to complaine hence-foorth that it is not perfected, I thought good faithfulie to translate the same. Furthermore were no∣thing at al, as more than halfe was left-out, yet good cause I had to translate it, both because of the errors therein contained, which were necessarilie to be corrected; and of the manifold sentences of holie scripture comprehended therein, which were needful to be quoted. So that, both that the godlie might not be either infec∣ted, or offended by the one; and that ma∣nie might be allured to reade, and in rea∣ding confirmed by the other, I tooke the translation thereof vpon me, for otherwise neither could the faults be rightlie amen∣ded, nor the places dulie applied. Secundarilie,Causes of cor∣recting this booke. my correcting of this booke, I haue hope no good man wil mis∣like. For I did it not rashlie of presumpti∣on, but with the testimonie of a good con∣science; with the warrant of God his word; and after the example too of such, who for doing the like are not dispraised. For if the Spirit of God command vs, To trie euerie
Spirit1. Iohn. 4, ; to trie al things, and to keepe that which is good1. Thes. 5. verse. 21.; to doe al things vnto edificati∣on 1. Cor. 14. verse. 26., not vnto the destruction of soules; &, if both those noble & good men of Be∣rea did examine the doctrine euen of the Apostles themseluesAct. 17, 10. 11.; and diuers godlie men in our age haue tried, and purged the writings of other men, & that to the great benefit of the Church, and their owne commendation: I trust I am not blame worthie for trieng, and for chusing that which good is, and refusing that which ei∣ther might infect, or be offensiue to the godlie, but should do verie il, both against God, against man, and against my consci∣ence too, if I did not so, hauing both so ho∣lie a commander to obeie, and so worthie examples to imitate. Againe, by the cen∣sure euen of anie indifferent iudge, I may with as good, and better auctoritie either quite-omit, or Christianlie conuert that which il is vnto good purpose, than some euil disposed persons either altogether leaue-out, or wickedlie change that which good is to the ingraffing of il opinions; as did both Io. Baptist a Ficklerus a Papist in his handeling that booke entituled, De iure Magistratus in Subditos; and also Iohan. de Ales another Papist in corrupting the ho∣lie Psalmes of Dauid, and applieng them most sacrilegiouslie vnto the virgine Ma∣rie. And thus brieflie for my correction in general. Now furthermore would be showed par∣ticularlie what I haue corrected;What things corrected. how I haue corrected the same; and why. The places which I haue corrected, be either
manifestlie erroneous; or scapes vnwit∣tinglie, for so charitie and circumstances wil me to iudge, committed. Of the former sort be praiers which tend either to make works meritorious,Faults mani∣festlie erro∣neous. as where among other things petition is made by the Auctor, that he may Amando mala sua rednereMed. cap. 1; and haue teares gran∣ted, Quae peccatorum possint dissoluere vincu∣la Medit. cap. 40.: or to make Saints intercessors for vs, as doth this praier vnto the House of God, Tu dc, tu roga Deum, vt dignum me faciat par∣ticipatione gloriae tuaeMedit. cap. 20.; againe vnto the same House of God, Aduent me merita tua, sub∣ueniant prauitati meae sanctae & purissimae orationes tuae, quae inefficaces apud Deum nulla∣tenus esse possintMedit. cap. 20.; so doth this, Da mihi effe∣ctum petitionis, & desiderij mei intercedente, & orante, & impetrante gloriosa virgine, genetrice tua Maria, Domina mea, cum omnibus sanctisMed. cap. 35. & ca. 36.; and this, Da mihi gratiam lachrimarum, &c. propter merita, & orationes corum, qui tibi pla∣cuerunt, & deuotissimè sruieruntMedit. cap. 36.; and this especialie, Exadi nos Trinitas sancta, & con∣serua ab omni malo, &c. per orationes Patriar∣charum, per merita Prophetarum, per suffragia Apostolorum, per constantiam Martyrum, per fidem Consessorum, per casttatem Virginum, & per intercessionem omnium Sanctorum, qui tibi placuerunt ab mitio mundiMedit. cap. 40.: or praiers fina∣lie either vnto the dead, as is both the whole 24. Chapter after the Latine copie; and these also in another placeMedit. cap. 40., Sancta, & immaculata virgo, Dei genetrix, Maria, & Mater Domini nostri Iesu Christi, interuenire pro me digneris apud illum cuius meruisti effici templum. S. Michaël, S. Gabriel, S. Raphaël,
S. chori Angelorum, Archangelorum, Patriar∣charum, at{que} Prophetarum, &c. vos rogare praesu∣mo, vt pro me culpabili ipsi Deo supplicare dig∣nemini, quatenus de faucibus Diaboli, & de mor∣te perpetua merear liberari: or praiers for the dead, as this is, Praesta Domine, &c. defunctis fidelibus requiem sempiternamMedit. cap. 40., AgaineMedit. cap. 40., Omnibus etiam Christianis defunctis adiutorium praestare digneris, & defunctis fidelibus absoluti∣onem, & requiem sempiternam per aeterna saecula. Of the later sort be these especialie,Seapes vn∣wittinglie committed. and such like words in one chapterMedit. cap. 6., Respice clementissime Rex, qui patitur, & reminiscere be∣nignus pro quo patitur, &c. Candet nudum pe∣ctus, rubet cruentum latus, tensa arent vescera &c. and these, and such like in anotherMedit. cap. 7., Ego iniquè egi, tu poena mulctaris, ego crimen e∣didi, tu torturae subijceris; ego superbui, tu humi∣liaris; ego tumui, tu attenuris, &c. Such is the whole 19. Chap. in a maner after the Latine copie, and finalie, so be these, and such like, (for to recite al the words, I thinke it not conuenient) in anotherMedit. cap. 41., Hei mihi, quia vi∣dere non potui Dominum angelorum, humiliatum ad cōuersationem hominū, &c. Vtinam cum feli∣ce Ioseph Dominū meū de cruce deposuissem, aro∣matibus condijssem, in sepulchro collocassem, &c. In which my correction, I haue had spe∣cial care to leaue as little out as might be,Maner of correcting this Booke. and therefore did I thinke it better to change vnto good purpose that which is contrarie vnto the Christian faith, where aptlie I could so do, than quite to omit whatsoeuer was amisse. In which respect I haue changed the 24. Chapter after the La∣tine copie in my traslation, the 23. which is a praier vnto Saincts, as also these words,
Propter merita, & orationes, &c.Medit. cap. 36., and appli∣ed them vnto Christ. The other errors I haue quite left out. Likewise among the scapes, some things I haue omitted, and some things I haue changed. I haue omit∣ted the whole 19. Chap. in the Latine co∣pie, which is the cause I haue one Chapter lesse in my translation, than is in the Latine: and also these words, and the rest tending to the like effectMedit. cap. 41., Hei mihi quia videre non potui Dominum angelorum, humiliatum ad con∣uersationem hominum, &c. vtinam cum felice Io∣seph Dominum meū de cruce deposuissem, aroma∣tibus codijssem, in sepulchro collocassem, &c. That which I haue altered, are ye rest specified a∣fore: the onlie difference betwene the La∣tine copie and mine in those places is, for that I turne the present tence into the pre∣terperfect tence, which agreeth to ye truth. It remaineth now that I do yeeld the rea∣sons why I haue corrected these faults.Special rea∣sons of cor∣recting the errors and scapes in this booke. And first for the errors: the chiefest causes of my correcting them was, for that they be contrarie to Scripture, and might both in∣fect the simple, and coole the zeale euen of the strong; but another was, because I saw manie places in this booke did ouerthrow them quite. As first the places for merits are ouerthrowne, as by other, so especialie by these, I acknowledge that no penance can satisfie for my sinnesAugust. praiers. ch. 38. pa. 198., and againe, If thou ex∣aminest my righteousnes, lo, I stinke like dead ca∣rion August. praiers. ch. 39. pa. 206.. Secondlie, intercession vnto Saints, with praieng vnto the dead, is ouerthrowne by these and such like places, What other intercessor should I direct vnto thee, but euen him August. praiers. ch. . pag. 23., who is the reconciliation for our sinnes, and sit∣teth
at thy right hand, making request for vs. For, what is it to cal vnto the truth in truthAugust. in the same cha. pa. 21., but e∣uen to cal vnto the Father in the name of the Sonne (not of Saincts {reversed ?}) There is nothing be∣hinde to adde, for I haue sent mine whole hope vnto theeAugust. praiers. ch. 8. pag. 35.. I haue directed thy beloued Sonne mine aduocate, vnto thee, and haue sent thy glo∣rious child to be a mediator betweene me and thee: I haue sent I saie an intercessor, through whome (not through Marie, or anie other Sainct) I hope to get pardon. For what is more acceptableAugust. praiers. ch. 5. pag. 21., than to cal vpon the begetter in the name of his onlie begotten? to moue the Father vn∣to mercie, in the recordation of his Sonne? to mi∣tigate the wrath of the King, through naming of his deere child? &c. Thirdlie, praieng that the faithful departed out of this life, may haue rest, is also in diuers places ouer∣throwne, as where it is saidAugust. praiers. ch. 22. pag. 90., Happie is the soule; which departing from the earthlie bodie, go∣eth directlie into heauen, secure it is, and quiet, &c! Oh happie are al thy Saincts, o Christ, which haue passed ouer the sea of this mortalitieAugust. praiers. ch. 23. pag. 93., & at∣tained vnto the hauen of perpetual quietnes, secu∣ritie, and peace, where they are at rest, and alwaie ioiful, & merie! And therfore considering this contrarietie in ye Auctor, I thought it best to publish those things which were conso∣nant to ye true faith, and to omit whatsoeuer sauored either of heresie, or superstition. And for the scapes, I am to yeeld the same reason, which I haue giuen for my correcting the errors. For as they, for the most part, be contrarie vnto the Scrip∣tures: so be diuers places in this booke, as easelie I could showe, against them. I ex∣cept onlie the scapes contained in the 41.
Chapter after the Latine copie: the which, as also the other scapes and errors, I am persuaded, were the Auctor liuiug, hee would gladlie either amend himselfe, or suffer them to be reformed. I often make mention of the Latine copie, because that hath one Chapter more than this hath, which commeth to passe by leauing out the 19. Chapter. Thirdlie,Causes of quoting this booke with places of Scripture. and last of al, I haue adorned this booke with places of Scripture, both to show from whence that which good is both is, and ought to be taken: and also to moue the zealous Christian the more ear∣nestlie to reade this booke. For when it is apparent, that praiers, and meditations be deriued out of the pure fountane of Gods holie word, manie are not a little not one∣lie pricked forward vnto the reading, but also strengthened and comforted much in mind, when they doe reade them. Which being so, I trust thou wilt accept my trauel in good part, and at the leastwise reade this booke as diligentlie now, being both made perfect, corrected, and adorned, a earst thou hast done when it neither had so manie praiers in it by halfe as now it hath; nor was so pure fró error; nor so au∣ctorized with the warrant of Gods word for the comfort of thy soule, as now it is. And thus I commend both thee and my selfe into his hands who hath not onelie made, but also redeemed vs for his owne glorie, and praise. The tenth of Iune. An. 1581. Yours in the Lord, THO. ROGERS.
A right Christian Treatise, containing manie holie and heauenlie Meditations, writ∣ten, as it is thought by that reuerend Father S. AVGVSTINE. Chap. 1. A praier vnto Almightie God for grace to leade a new life according to Gods holie Word. O LORD my GodPsal. 7, 1. 3.

O my makerPsal. 139, verse. 13. 14. 15., make a large distance betweene mee and rashnes; betweene me and wic∣kednes; betweene me and fro∣wardnes;
betweene me and vn∣quietnes; betweene me & idle∣nes; betwene me & drousines; betweene me and blockishnes; Grant that my hart prooue not blinded, my senses obstinate, my maners sauage: but let me delight in goodnes, and folowe coūsel, & neuer loose the bridle to my tong; nor cruellie make a praie of the poore; nor vio∣lentlie oppresse the weake; nor vniustlie slander the innocent; nor negligentlie regard infe∣riors committed to my charge; Finalie, let me vse neither cru∣eltie toward my seruants, nor treacherie toward my friends, nor violence vpon my neigh∣bours.

Chap. 2. An accusation of mans vn∣worthines; and a commenda∣tion of Gods infinite mercie. THus, my makerGen. 1, 26. 27., I haue asked much, and yet haue deser∣ued naught. I confesse, yea alas, I confesse, that not onelie I deserue not those blessings which I do re∣quire, but also do deserue ma∣nie and exquisite tormentsIob. 10, 8.. Notwithstanding, euen pub∣licanesMat. 21, 31. Mark. 2, 15., harlots, and theeuesLu. 23, 40. 41. 42. 43., who in a moment plucked from out the iawes of the enimie, are taken into the armes of the shepheard, do embolden me to do as I do. For albe thou, ô God, maker of al thingsGenes. 1, 1. 2. 3, &c. Psal. 148, 1, 2, &c. 5. Hebr. 1, 1. 2., art woonderful in al thy worksReue. 15, 3.: yet art thou most
wonderful in the works of mer∣cie: therefore didest thou saie by one of thy seruantsPsa. 145, 9., His mercies are ouer al his works. And although thou spakest this but of one, yet we trust it is ment of thy whole people: My louing kindnes wil I not take from him2. Sam. 7, verse. 14. 15. Psal. 89, 33.. For thou despisest none, thou castest none awaie, thou abhorrest no man, vnles it be him which madlie abhorreth thee. Hence it is, that being mo∣ued, thou strikest not; but, if they surcesse, thou powrest thy blessings vpon them which pro∣uoke thee. O my God, the horne of my saluationPs, and my refuge I, wretch that I am, I haue prouo∣ked thee; I haue done euil in thy sight; I haue stirred vp thine anger; I haue deserued thy dis∣pleasure. I haue sinned, and thou hast suffered; I haue of∣fended,
yet thou bearest with me. If I repent, thou sparestEze. 18, 21. 22. Eze. 33, 14. 15. 16.; if I returne, thou embracestLuk. 15, 20.; yea, beside al this, though I differre, thou waitest. Thou reclaimest him which wandereth; thou inuitest him that resisteth; thou lookest for him that sleepeth; and him thou embracest which returneth. Thou teachest the ignorant; thou comfortest the pensiue; thou liftest vp from destruction after a fal; thou giuest to him that askethMatt. 7, 7.; he that seeketh, findeth thee, and thou openest to him which knocketh. Lo, ô Lord, God of my salua∣tionPsa. 18, 46.

Cor. 1, 3., pearce my flesh with thy feare, so that by fearing, I may escape such things as thou doest threaten; and restore to me the ioie of thy saluationPsal. 51, 12., that by louing I may taste the felicitie which thou hast promised1. Cor. 2, 9.. O Lord, my rocke and my for∣tressePsal. 71, 3.; my God, my refuge, and my sauiourPsal. 18, 2.; put thou in∣to my remembrance the things which I should conceaue of thee; teach me by what words I may cal vpon thee; instruct me with what good workes I may please thee. For I knowe, indeede I knowe one good worke, wherein thou
art much delighted; and ano∣ther which thou doest not de∣spise. Thy sacrifice is a contrite spiritPsal. 51, 17., a contrite and a broken heart, ô God, thou doest not despise. O my God, mine helperPsal. 18, 2., enrich me with these thy gifts: with these defences arme thou me against the enimie; let this be the water to quench the flames of sinne; reach out of thy goodnes this refuge against the passions of my desires. O Lord God, the strength of my saluationPsa. 140, 7., let me not be of that number which for a time beleeue, but when temptation commeth, go backePsa. 140, 7.. Couer thou mine head in the daie of battelLuk. 8, 13., ô mine hope in affliction, and my saluation in the time of trouble. Thus, ô Lord, my lightPsal. 27, 1., and my saluation, what I neede, I
haue asked; and what I feare, thou art priuie of: but my con∣science gnaweth, and the secret cogitations of the heart reproo∣ueth my boldnes, and what loue ministreth, feare scatreth; zeale stirreth vp, feare checketh; my wicked deedes strike a ter∣ror, but thy goodnes maketh bold; thy mercie encourageth, my wickednes keepeth mee backe: and to saie more trulie, the fantasies of vices come fresh into my remembrance, which beate backe the boldnes of pre∣sumptuous mindes. Chap. 3. A complaint of a sinner, whose praier God heareth not in re∣spect of his disobedience. FOr he that is wor∣thie hatred, how can he require mer∣cie! he which hath deserued paine, how can he de∣sire
glorie! He prouoketh the iudge, that laieng satisfaction for his of∣fence apart, sueth to be hono∣red with rewards. Who so is condemned to punishment, is too bold with the King, if hee seeke to be crowned with an vndeserued garland. That foo∣lish child doth prouoke the sweete affection of his louing father vnto wrath, that after re∣proches offered, wil vsurpe the dignitie of inheritāce, before he haue repented him of his fault. O my FatherMal. 2, 10. Math. 5, 48., why cal I into mind what I haue done? I haue deserued death, and I beg life. I haue mooued my KingPsalm. 5, 2. Psal. 44, 4., whose assistance impudentlie I doe craue. I haue despised the iudge Iob. 9, 15. Psalm. 50, 6. Esai. 33, 22., and yet rashlie I beseech him to be mine helper. Proudlie I haue refused to heare my father, whom notwithstanding I pre∣sume
to haue mine helper. Wo is me, how late do I come; alas, alas, how slowlie do I hasten; wo is me, because I runne after woundes, refusing being whole to auoide the darts. I haue neglected to fore-see the dartes, but now am troubled standing at deathes dore. I haue encreased my wounds, because I haue not feared to adde sinne vnto sinne. With a fresh wound I haue embrued my scars, because I haue augmented mine olde sinnes by my dailie transgressi∣ons; & what God by his medi∣cines had healed, I by my fran∣tike scratching haue opened. The skin which going ouer the woundes, did hide the dis∣ease, through ye breaking out of the corruption, is become rot∣ten, in asmuch as wickednes v∣sed againe, made ye mercie once
granted to be of none effect. For I knowe it is written, At what time soeuer the righteous man shal commit wickednes, al his righteousnes which he hath done shal not be mentionedEzech. 18, verse. 24.. Now if the righteousnes of a righteous man through sin shal be forgotten; how much more shal the repentance of a sinner turning again vnto wickednes! How often haue I a dog retur∣ned vnto the vomitPro 26, 11.; and like a sow wallowed in the mire2. Pet. 2, verse. 22.! I acknowledge, because for me particularlie to remember al it is impossible, I haue taught ma∣nie to sin, which knew not what sin meant; manie that were bent to sin, I haue persuaded thervn∣to; such as haue resisted, I haue cōpelled; & haue consented to thē as haue gone about wicked∣nes. Snares I haue laid for them which haue kept the right waie;
and made a pit for such as haue sought the same: yea I made no conscience of committing sin, & feared not to forget thy lawes. But thou a righteous iudge2. Esdr. 14, verse. 32., sealing mine iniquitie vp as in a bagIob. 14, 17., lookest narowlie vnto al my paths, and numberest al my steps. Thou hast held thy peace, thou hast alwaie bin silentPsa. 50, 21, thou hast bin patient a long time: but, out alas, one daie thou wilt crie like a woman in trauelEsa. 42, 14. Chap. 4.

Cor. 4, 5. be∣fore so manie thousand people; and not onelie al my wicked deedes, but also al mine euil thoughts, and words shal be manifest before al the compa∣nies of Angels. So manie iudges then shal I wretch stand before, as haue excelled me in wel-doing. So manie shal giue sentence to my confusion, as haue shewed me examples to liue vprightlie. So manie shal be witnesses to con∣uince me, as haue both instru∣cted me with their godlie ex∣hortations, and prouoked mee vnto imitation by their righte∣ous dealing. O my Lord, I knowe not what to saie; I can not tel what an∣swere

Behold my deliuerer from the fierce nations; behold, with whom I haue liued, with whom I haue studied, with whom also I haue kept promise from the daie of my birth! The studies which I deligh∣ted in, doe now condemne me; which once I praised, dispraise
me now. These are the friends vpon whom I rested; the teachers to whom I listened; the masters whom I serued; the counselers whom I beleeued; the citizens with whom I dwelled; the com∣panions, whome I consented vnto.

Surelie had we the knowledge and power of the blessed An∣gels: yet could our amends be nothing correspondent to thy mercie, and goodnes.

And although I am yet a sin∣ner:
yet I doubt not of this par∣ticipation of grace; although my sinnes doe hinder me; yet my substance doth require it; and although mine offences ex∣clude me; yet the communion of nature doth not repel me. For God is not so hard harted that he can forget flesh & blood which he beareth; which for my sake he hath taken; which on my behalfe he requireth. But the Lord our God is mild, and verie gentleIoēl. 2, 23.; he loueth his owne flesh, his members, and his bowels.

No winter cold, no sommer hot, At no time there do men annoie. Fresh roases alwaie may be got, The spring alwaie men there enioie. The saffron red, the lilies white, The balme giueth sent men to delight. The fields are fresh, the seede doth spring. With honie sweete the riuers flowe. The pleasant odors comfort bring, And sauors good from spices go. The apples alwaie hang on tree, And euermore the woods greene bee.

They noble, strong, they iocund are, From trobles now they be set free. The healthful there right wel doe fare: And youth dreads nought old age to see. Hence too & thence they spring, & last: For frailtie now is gone and past. Their state diuine doth vp swalowe, The mightie force of death so fel. God knowing al things they which knowe▪ Al other things most knowe right wel. For ech mans hart to ech mans sight Is ope. In one they do delight.

Yet loath they nought: though ful they be. Their hunger doth them moue nothing. They eate and that ful greedilie: And eating pricks them to eating.
The pleasant songs expel sad feares, And organe pipes doe please the eares. Due praise they yeeld vnto the King, Through whom they doe triumph in blis.

For they, whose eies euermore bee fixed vpon the Lord, whom they be∣hold not through a glasse dark∣lie 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12. but face vnto face; they doe most purelie and without cea∣sing praise the Lord. But who can, yea so much as in thought comprehend, much
lesse in words expresse, what an infinit multitude of those bles∣sed spirits, and celestial powers are in the presence of the Lord God almightie! Or what conti∣nual ioie they receaue by the sight of God! what euerlasting mirth! what heate of loue, not to their griefe, but to their dele∣ctation! what a desire is in them of the sight of God with satietie; & a satietie with desire, in whom neither desire ingendreth griefe, nor satietie bringeth loathing! How blessed they are by clea∣uing to thy soueraigne blessed∣nes! How they be made light, ioined to the true light! Finalie, alwaie beholding the vnchan∣geable Trinitie, they be conuer∣ted into an vnchangable nature! But when shal we be able to comprehend the glorious con∣dition of the Angels; when we are not able to search out the
nature of our owne soules! What is this thing which can quicken the flesh; and yet vo∣luntarilie can not bind it selfe to holie cogitations! what kind of thing is this which is so strong, and yet so weake; so smal, and yet so mightie, that it searcheth out the secrets of God, and be∣holdeth celestial things; which for mans behoofe is wel knowne to haue, through sharpenes of wit, inuented the knowledge of manie sciences? what kind of thing is this then which knoweth so much of other things, and yet is vtterlie ignorant how it selfe was made? For although much be spoken doubtfulie of some, concerning the beginning of the soule: yet we find how it is a certaine in∣tellectual spirit made through the power of the Creator; liuing euerlastinglie in her kind; quic∣kening
the mortal bodie which it sustaineth; subiect to alterati∣on; prone to forgetfulnes; which feare manie times trobleth, and mirth puffeth vp. O strange thing, most woor∣thie to be woondred at!

But omit we these things, and mount we; leaue we, and ouer∣passe we whatsoeuer is created; and let vs direct the eies of our faith vpon him who hath made al things. Wherfore I wil make degrees of ascension in mine hart; and therby mount vp vnto my soule;
and by my soule and vnderstan∣ding ascend vnto my Lord, who abideth aboue ouer mine head. Let whatsoeuer is either visi∣blie seene, or spiritualie imagi∣ned, with a strong hand be far a∣waie remoued from the sight of mine hart & mind: onlie let the pure vnderstanding, going on plainelie, attaine swiftlie vnto him who is the Creator both of AngelsPsa. 148, 1. 2. 5., and of soulesGen. 1, 26. 27. 1.

Blessed is that mind which for∣saketh base things belowe; and seeketh after hie things; which maketh a nest in the rocke, and from the high cliffe with Egles eies beholdeth the Sonne of righteousnes. For nothing is so goodlie, and so comfortable, as with the sight of the mind, and desire of hart to behold the verie Lord alone; and after a maruelous manner
inuisiblie to behold the inuisi∣ble 1. Tim. 1, 17: and so to taste another, not this sweetenes; and to see ano∣ther, not this light. Because this light, which is en∣closed in a place, is ended by time, and changed by the inter∣ruption of nights, and is com∣mon with vs to wormes and beasts; and, to saie the truth, in comparison of that soueraigne light, can not be called light in∣deede, but night rather. Chap. 27. VVhat it is to hold, and to be∣hold God in part; and how we are to conceiue of God. AND although that soueraigne and vn∣changable essence, that true light, that lasting light, that light of An∣gels can be seene of none in this life (for that preeminence is re∣serued
for the Saints in celestial glorie:) yet firmelie to beleeue, and to vnderstand, & to marke, and zealouslie to couet for the same, is after a sort to hold, and to behold the same. Let the voice therefore sound aboue the Angels; and let man with an intentiue mind behold God, and praise him with words as wel as he can. For it is meete that the crea∣ture doe praise his Creator. Be∣cause he hath made vs to praise himEsai. 43, 7., who standeth not in need of our praise. And he is an incōprehensible virtue, wanting naught2.

Of the vnitie of persons, and pluralitie in God. ANd thou an vnitie of the God-head, through the plurali∣tie of persons mani∣fold, art in number infinite, and therefore measurablie vnmea∣surable, and waightilie vnwai∣able. For we acknowledge no be∣ginning of the soueraigne good∣nes,
the which thou art; of whome, through whome, in whome al things; but through participation thereof we saie al good things are1. Cor. 4, 7. Iam. 1, 17.. For thy diuine essence hath alwaies bin, and yet is without matter; although it lacke no forme, to wit, informed, the forme of formes, the most wel∣formed forme, the which while thou imprintest as a seale to e∣uerie particular thing, thou makest them doubtles to differ from thy selfe without anie ei∣ther of your augmenting, or di∣minishing; but whatsoeuer is in the world, it is thy creatureIohn. 1, 1. 3. Hebr. 1, 1. 2.. O simple Trinitie, and triple vnitie, God, whose almightines both possesseth, and ruleth, and replenisheth al things which thou hast created. Neither in saieng how thou fillest al things, meane we that
they conteine thee, but rather that thou conteinest them; nei∣ther by partes fillest thou al things; nor yet may it be thou∣ght, that euerie thing, according to the greatnes of the portion it hath, receaueth thee, that is, the greatest thing more, and the smallest thing lesse: thou rather being in al things, or more tru∣lie al things in theeAct. 17, 28., whose om∣nipotencie includeth al things; neither can anie man finde a waie to escape thy powerPsa. 139, 7. 8, &c.. For whosoeuer hath not thy fauor, can by no meanes auoide thy displeasure, as it is writtenPsal. 75, 6. 7., Neither from the East, nor from the Weast, nor from the South, but God is the Iudge: and a∣gaine Psa. 139, 7. 8, &c., Whither shal I go from thy spirit, or whither shal I go from thy presence? The immensitie of thy diuine greatnes is this, that we knowe
thee to be within al things, not as included; and without al things, yet not as excluded. And therfore thou art within, yt thou maist conteine al; and therfore without, that al things may be comprehended within the im∣mensitie of thy circumscribed greatnes. So then by that thou art within, thou art knowne to be a Cre∣ator; by that thou art without, we perceaue how thou art the gouernor of al things. And least al things which are created, might be without thee, thou art within, and without, that al things may be included of thee, not by local greatnes, but by thy mightie presence, who are euerie-where present, and al things present before theeEccle. 15, verse. 18. Eccl. 23, 18. 19. 20.: although some vnder∣stand these things, yet some do not.
The vnitie then of thine in∣separable nature, cannot haue separable persons; because as thou art a trinitie in vnitie, and a vnitie in trinitie, so can you not haue a separation of per∣sons. Sometime indeede those per∣sons are particularlie namedMat. 3, 16. 17. 1. Iohn. 5, 7., but so thou wouldest, ô God the Trinitie, declare thy selfe inse∣parable in persons; that there is no name in anie one person, but may be referred vnto ano∣ther, according to the rule of relation. As the Father vnto the Sonne, and the Sonne vnto the Father; so hath the Sonne true relation both vnto the Father and the Sonne. Also those names which sig∣nifie either your substance, ô God, or person, or power, or es∣sence, or els what, which pro∣perlie
is caled God, do equalie agree to al the persons: as great God, almightie, eternal, and ge∣neralie al things, which natu∣ralie are spoken of God. So that there is no name of nature, which so may agree vn∣to thee God the Father, but the same also may fitlie be referred vnto the Sonne, & holie Ghost. We saie how thou the Father art naturalie God, so is the Sonne naturalie God, and the holie Ghost naturalie; and yet not three Gods, but one God naturalie, ye Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost. And therefore, ô God holie Trinitie, in persons thou art in∣separable, in sense are they to be vnderstood, though in sound you haue separable names: for you receaue no plural number in the names of nature. For hereby is it declared, how
the persons in the holie Trinitie, which is onePsa. 86, 10. Esaic. 37, 16. 20., verie GodIohn. 17, 3. 1. Thes. 1, 9., can not bee diuided: for that the name of euerie person, respec∣teth alwaie another person. If I saie the Father, I point vn∣to the Sonne; if I name the Sonne, I presuppose a Father; if I mention the holie spirit, I must necessarilie vnderstand of whom he is the Spirit, namelie of the Father and of the Sonne. For this is the true faith, pro∣ceeding from sound doctrine: this vndoubtedlie is the catho∣like and right faith, which God of his goodnes hath taught me in the bosome of the mother ChurchGal. 4, 26..

healthful; thou, at a becke a∣mendest the things which are broken and decaied, heale thou me, and I shal be wholeIer. 17, 14., saue me, and I shal be saued. For do thou vouchsafe in mine hart, thy field, to sowe the good seede, it must needes be, that first thou wilt plucke-out the thornes of my wickednes by the hand of thy mercie. O most gratious, most gentle, most louing, desired, amiable, and louelie of al others, powre, I praie thee, vpon mine hart, the streames of thy sweetenes, and goodwil, that I may neither de∣sire, nor thinke vpon anie earth∣lie, or fleshlie thingMatth. 10, verse. 37. 1.

Write thy wil, and thy iustifi∣cations also vpon the tables of mine hart, that alwaie, and eue∣rie-where I may set both thee, the Lord of infinite sweetenes, and thy lawes before my face. Inflame my mind with that thy fire, which thou sendest vp∣on the earthLuk. 12, 49., and wouldest haue increased verie much, that daie by daie with abundance of teares I may offer vnto thee the sacrifice of a contrite spiritPsal. 51, 17., and of a broken hart. According as I desire, and as from mine hart I craue, ô sweet Christ, ô good Iesu, giue me thine holie and chast loue, that it may replenish, and hold, and possesse me altogether. And giue me too a continual watering streame of teares, which is an euident signe of thy loue, that they also may testifie
to the world thy loue within me, that they may declare, and tel, how greatlie my soule doth loue thee, seeing for the excee∣ding pleasure it receaueth from thy loue, it cannot refraine from shedding teares. O good Lord, sometime I re∣member that good woman An∣na1. Sam. 1, verse. 18., which came vnto the ta∣bernacle to beg a sonne of God, of whome the Scripture testifi∣eth, how after her teares and praiers, she looked no more sad: but when I remember so great virtue, and such constancie of that woman, I am troubled in mind, and do blush againe, be∣cause I behold how I wretch do grouel too much downeward. For if a woman did so weepe, and continue in weeping, and that for a sonne; how should my soule weepe, yea and persist in weeping, which seeketh, and lo∣ueth
God, yea and longeth too for to come vnto him! How should the soule both groane, and be greeued, that seeketh af∣ter God night and daie! which esteemeth al things as naught beside Christ! for it is much maruel, if teares be not the meate of such a soule daie and night. Regard therefore, and shewe mercie vpon me, for the dolors of mine hart be increased. Giue me thine heauenlie com∣fort, and despise not the sinful soule for which thou diedst1. Tim. 1, verse. 15.. O giue, I beseech thee, the in∣ward teares of hartie affection, which may both lose the fetters of my sinnes, and also replenish my soule euermore with thy ce∣lestial comfort. Gladlie would I atteine some portion in thy kingdome, if not among men aforetime, whose
steps I am vnable to imitate, yet at the least among religious women. And here commeth into my remembrance the woonderful deuotion of other women, that with a godlie affection sought thee in the graueMatt. 28, verse. 1. 5. Mark. 16, 1. 2, &c., that, albe thy disciples departed, yet went not from the sepulchre, that sate there heauie lamenting, and weeping much & a long while, and rising againe, with manie teares oftentimes went and pee∣ped into the holes of the sepul∣chre, & verie diligentlie sought if anie where they could see thee, whome earnestlie they sought for. Manie times went they vnto the graue, but to the louers too much was not often enough; for the virtue of a good worke is perseuerance: and because a∣boue the rest they loued, both in
louing they wept, and in wee∣ping they sought, and in seeking they perseuered, and therefore they before al did find thee, saw thee, and talke with thee. And not onlie so, but also they carried the tidings of your glo∣rious resurrection to ye disciples themselues, according as you bad, and warned them, saieng, Go and tel my brethren, that they go into Galile, and there shal they see meMatt. 28, verse. 10.. If then the women so wept, and in weeping perseuered, that sought the liuing among the dead, and by faith touched thee; how should the soule bewaile, and in bewailing continue, which in hart beleeueth, and with mouth confesseth, how thou her Sauior dost rule in hea∣uen, and gouerne euerie-where! how should that soule weepe and lament, which with her hart
loueth, and with al her whole de∣sire longeth for thee! O thou onlie refuge, and hope of the distressed, to whome no man sueth, without hope of mercie, giue me this grace for thine owne sake, and for thine holie Name sake, that as often as I thinke of thee, speake of thee, write of thee, reade of thee, confer of thee, as often as I re∣member thee, serue thee, offer the sacrifice of praise vnto thee, so often I may shed abundance of teares sweetelie before thy face, that my teares may be∣come my meate daie & nightPsal. 42, 3..

O good Iesu, by those most pretious teares of thine, and by al thy manifold mercies, where∣withal thou hast vouchsafed wonderfullie to helpe vs mise∣rable sinners, giue me grace to bewaile my transgressions, the which my soule doth much long for, and desire, because without thou giue it, I cannot get the sameIam. 1, 17., but euen through the ho∣lie Ghost, which mollifieth the harts of sinners, and prouoketh them vnto the teares of repen∣tance. Giue me grace to mourne for my sinnes, as our forefathers did, whose footesteps I am bound to imitate, that I may bewaile mine offences al my life long, as they haue mourned daie and night. Euen for thine intercession
sake, and for al thy merits sake, haue mercie vpon me thy mise∣rable and vnworthie seruant; and giue me grace to bewaile my sinnes. Water thou my plants both from aboue, and from beneath, that my teares may be my meate daie and nightPsal. 42, 3.; and I through the fire of compunction may be made a fat burning sa∣crifice in thy sight, and be killed altogether vpon the altar of mine hart, and be taken as a fat burnt sacrifice for a sweete smel∣ling sauor in thy nostrels. O sweete Lord, giue me a watering fountaine, and a cleere fountaine, wherin dailie this de∣filed sacrifice may be clensed. For although through the as∣sistance of thy grace I haue offe∣red my selfe wholie to thee; yet in manie things for al that I do sinneIam. 3, 2., by reason of my too too
great weakenes. Wherefore, ô blessed and lo∣uing God, giue me grace espe∣ciallie of the great sweetnes of thy loue, and remembrance of thy mercies, make readie this table for thy seruant in thy pre∣sence, and giue me power, that when I wil, I may be satisfied of it. Of thy mercie and goodnes grant, that this inebriating and goodlie cup may quench my thirst, that my spirit may couet after thee, and my mind burne with thy loue, forgetting al va∣nitie and miserie. Heare, ô my God, heare ô light of mine eies, heare my petition, and grant that I may beg that thing, which thou maist grant. Gratious, and merciful God, stop not thine eares against me, because of my sinnes, but of thy woonted goodnes grant me the
effect of my petition and desire; Amen. Chap. 36. A verie effectual praier to the stirring vp of the mind vnto god∣lines being zelouslie vttered.

Be pacified at the length I be∣seech thee, and haue mercie vp∣pon me, neither hide awaie thy face fro mePsa. 27, 9., who for my re∣demption, didest not turne thy face from such as reprooued, and spat vpon theeMatt. 27, vers. 27, &c. 30.. I confesse in deede, I haue sin∣ned, and that my conscience de∣serueth damnation; I acknow∣ledge also that no penance can satisfie for my sinnes, but cer∣taine it is, that thy mercie is more than al my sinnes. O most gratious Lord, write not thou bitter things against meIob. 13, 26., neither enter thou into iudgement with thy seruantPsa. 143, 2., but according to the multitude of thy compassions, put awaie mine iniquitiesPsal. 51, 1.. Wo to me wretch, when the daie of iudgement shal come, and the bookes of each mans
conscience be openedReu. 20, verse. 12. 13., when it shal be said of me, Behold the man, and his workes. What shal I then do, ô Lord my God, when the verie hea∣uens shal reueale mine iniqui∣tie, and the earth rise vp against me? Surelie I shal be able to saie nothing, but hang-downe mine head for verie griefe of hart, and stand trembling and confoun∣ded before thy presence. Alacke wretch, what may I saie? shal I crie vnto thee my Lord God, wherefore am I con∣sumed saieng naught? but though I do speake, yet wil not my griefe haue end; and if I be stil silent, I shal be vexed in∣wardlie with most bitter sorow. O my soule, mourne thou like a virgin for the husband of hir youthIoël. 1, 8.; howle thou miserable wretch, and weepe, because thine husband euen ChristEph. 5, 25.
hath forsaken thee. O wrath of the almightie, fal not thou vpon me, for I cannot beare thee, because there is not that strength in me, that I can endure thee. But haue mercie on me, ô God, that I despaire not, but in de∣spaire let me hope againe. And although I haue done that which deserueth damnati∣on; yet hast not thou forgone that whereby thou art wont to salue. O Lord, thou wilt not the death of sinners, neither doest thou reioice in the destruction Eze. 18, 23. of the dieng: but that the dead might liue thou diedstRom. 4, 25; and thy death hath killed the death of sinners; and if they through thy death were againe brought vn∣to life, ô Lord, grant, I beseech thee, that I may not die, now thou art aliue.
Send downe from heauenPsa. 57, 3., and saue me from the power of mine enimies, least they tri∣umph ouer me, and saie, We haue deuoured him. O good Iesu, who at anie time can doubt of thy mercie, who, euen when we were thine eni∣miesRom. 5, 10 didst redeeme vs with thy pretious blood, and reconcile vs to God! Lo, thus protected vnder the shadowe of thy mercie I doe run vnto the throne of graceHeb. 4, 16., requiring mercie, crieng and knocking vntil thou take com∣passion vpon me. For if thou calledst vs vnto mercie, when we asked none: how can we misse of mercie, crauing the same! O sweete Iesu, thinke not vp∣on thy iustice against a sinner; but remember thy goodnes to∣ward thy creature. Thinke not
vpon thy displeasure against a transgressor; but remember thy mercie toward the miserable. Forget me when I was proud, prouoking thee vnto wrath; and regard me now in distresse, cri∣eng vnto thee for mercie. For what is Iesus, but a Saui∣orMatt. 1, 21.? Therefore, ô Iesus, by thy selfe arise to helpe me, and saie vnto my soulePsa. 35, 3., I am thy salua∣tion. Much doe I presume of thy goodnes, ô Lord, the rather be∣cause thy selfe thou teachest vs to aske, to seeke, and to knock Matt. 7, 7.. And therefore admonished thereby, I doe aske, seeke, and knocke. But thou, Lord, who comman∣dest to aske, grant I may re∣ceiue; who counselest to aske, giue grace to find; who teachest to knocke, open to the knocker, and strengthen me a sinner, saue
me a wretch, raise me that am dead, and vouchsafe to direct and gouerne al my senses, cogi∣tations, & works after thy good pleasure, that hencefoorth I may serue thee, liue to thee, and be wholie thine. I knowe, Lord, I doe owe my selfe to thee, euen because thou hast made me; and for that thou hast redeemed me1. Pet. 1, 18. 19., and taken humane flesh vpon thee for my sakeMatt. 1, 21 Luke. 1, 31. 69., I doe owe so much more beside my selfe, as thou art grea∣ter than he for whom thou hast giuen thy selfe. Lo I haue no more; neither can I giue that which I haue too without thee: but accept thou me, and drawe me vnto theeIohn. 6, 44, that I may be thine by imitati∣on and loue, as I am thine by condition, and creation, who li∣uest1.

O sacred Trinitie, heare my petition, and saue me from al euilMatt. 6, 13, from offending, and from sinning anie maner of waie; from al snares and pursutes of Satan, and of enimies visible, and inuisible. Expel far fro me the hautinesse of mind, and increase within me the sorowe of hart; diminish my pride, and establish true humi∣litie within my breast; fetch teares from mine eies, mollifie mine hard and stonie hart; and saue Lord, both me & my soule from al traps of the enimie; and continue me in thy pleasure. Teach me to doe thy wilPs. 143, 10., for thou art my God. Giue me perfect sense, & vn∣derstanding, ô Lord, that I may be able to conceaue the deepe∣nes of thy mercie. Grant me grace to beg that at thine hands, which may both be
ioiful for thee to grant, and be∣hooueful for me to receaue. Make me vnfainedlie to be∣waile my sinnes, and manifold offences. Heare, ô my Lord, and my GodPsal. 7, 1. 3.; heare, ô light of mine eiesIohn. 1, 9.; heare my petition, and grant that what I request, I may obteine. If thou despise, I am vtterlie vndone; if thou heare me, I take hart againe. If thou examinest my righteousnes, lo I stinke like a dead carrion; but if in mercie thou respect mee, thou raisest him that stinketh out of the graue. What thou hatest in me, re∣mooue far fro me; and ingraffe the spirit of chastitie and of a cleane life in my mind, that in asking anie thing at thine hands I may not offend thee in asking the same.
Take fro mee whatsoeuer is hurtful to my soule, and giue what is behooueful. O Lord, giue me a salue, to heale my greeuous woundes. Indue me, good Lord, with thy fearePsal. 2, 11., with sorowe of hartPsa. 51, 17., with humilitie of mindeEcc. 23, 4., and with a pure consciencePsal. 24, 4.. Giue me grace, Lord, to keepe brotherlie concord euermoreRom. 12, verse. 10. 1. Pet. 2, 17.; to remember my transgressi∣ons; not to meddle with the dealings of other men. Pardon my soule; pardon my sinnes; my wickednes pardon; ô pardon mine offencesPsal. 51, 2. 9.. Visit me that am weake; cure me that am sicke; heale me that doth languish, & raise me which am dead. O Lord, giue me both an hart to dread thee; a mind to loue thee; sense to knowe thee; eares to heare thee; eies to see thee.
Haue mercie on me, ô God, haue mercie on me; looke vpon me from the holie seate of thy Maiestie; and illuminate the darknes of mine hart with the beame of thy brightnes. Giue me wisedome, ô Lord, to discerne betweene good and euil; and grant me a watchful vnderstanding. Forgiue al my sinnes I beseech thee; and in the time of necessi∣tie & troblePs. 37, 39., be thou good and gratious to me, I onelie beseech thee. After thy woonted mercie, & most louing kindnes, ô Lord, I beseech thee, vouchsafe to giue me ye life which euer shal endure. O Lord Iesus Christ, giue both to thy ministers vnitie of mind; and to magistrates iudging vp∣rightlie, peace and tranquillitie. Furthermore, ô Lord, my re∣quest is for the whole catholike, and holie Church, for men and
women; for religious and for se∣cular men; for al Christian go∣uernors, & people beleeuing in thy Name, which labor for thine holie loue, that they may haue grace to continue in wel doing.

O Lord Iesu Christ, my redemptionCol. 1, 14., my mercie, and my saluationMatt. 1, 21., I doe praise thee, & yeeld thee thanks, although far vnanswereable, I confes, to thy benefits, although not zealous enough, although verie leane from the desired fat∣nes of thy sweete affection: yet such as it hath, not as I knowe it oweth, and as it is able, my soule paieth vnto thee. O thou hope of mine hart, and strength of my soule, let thy di∣uine power fulfil, what my luke warme weaknes endeuoreth to bring to passe; ô my life, and thou end of my thought. And though I haue not hither∣to deserued so greatlie to loue,

Cor. 4, 7. Iam. 1, 17., if I do minde anie thing that good is. If it be good which thou doest enspire, yea, because it is good yt I would loue thee, graunt that which through thee I would. Giue me grace so greatlie to loue thee, as thou commandest. Praise and thankes I do offer, ô let not thy gift, which volunta∣rilie thou hast imparted vpon me, be vnfruiteful to me. Performe what thou hast be∣gun, and giue the thing, which of thy goodnes preuenting me, vndeseruing the same, thou hast made me to desire. Conuert, ô gratious God, my securitie into the burning loue of thy Name.
For, merciful Father, hetherto tendeth this my praier, this re∣membrance and meditation of thy benefits is, to the end that thy loue may be inflamed with∣in my brest.

O good Lord, thou lookest for mine amendment, and that I may repent, and leade an vp∣right life, my soule doth looke for the inspiration of thy grace. O my GodPsal. 7, 1. 3., my creatorPsa. 119, 73, forbearerWis. 11, 20., and my nourisher, after thee do I thirst, after thee do I long, after thee do I sigh and couet. And as a tender Orphane be∣reft

that sinful man might enioy life. What shal I saie? what shal I do? whether may I go? where shal I seeke? or when shal I find him? of whom shal I aske? who wil tel my beloued how I lan∣guish for loue?
